Web site funded by a Texas government grant provides 15 live feeds of “ high - crime areas ” near the fence between U.S. and Mexico , urging people to go on “ virtual stakeouts ” from their computers and report “ suspicious activity ” to authorities .
These “ virtual stakeouts ” frame any activity on the border as criminal , as the low - quality video provides no way of discriminating between legal and illegal activity .
The public overwhelmingly wants Gordon Brown to turn his attention to the British economy rather than seek a global solution to the recession , according to a ComRes survey for The Independent .
The findings are a severe setback to the Prime Minister as world leaders fly in to London for the G20 summit he will chair on Thursday .
Some 72 per cent of those interviewed believe that he should focus more on a domestic solution than a global one .
Just 22 per cent favour his global strategy .
Even Labour supporters are not convinced about Mr Brown 's emphasis : 66 per cent of them favour a more domestic approach .

The figures will fuel growing fears among Labour MPs , including some ministers , that Mr Brown is expending too much energy on his goal of a " global new deal " .
Some allies have warned him privately that there are " no votes in it " for him in Britain , while opposition politicians criticised his five - day , three - continent tour last week ahead of the G20 meeting .
According to ComRes , the public also opposes , by a margin of two to one , the Prime Minister 's attempt to spend his way out of recession .
Only 30 per cent agree that government borrowing should be raised to boost the economy if that means tax rises in future , while 62 per cent disagree .
Fewer than one in three people ( 31 per cent ) agree that the Prime Minister has the right policies to get Britain out of recession , while 58 per cent disagree .
And only 27 per cent are optimistic that the economy will improve before the end of this year , with 70 per cent disagreeing .
Less than half of Labour supporters ( 46 per cent ) believe things will get better by December , while Tory ( 22 per cent ) and Liberal Democrats ( 24 per cent ) supporters are even more gloomy .
ComRes puts the Conservatives 12 points ahead of Labour , down from 16 last month .
The Tories are on 40 per cent ( down four points on last month ) , Labour 28 per cent ( no change ) , Liberal Democrats 18 per cent ( up one point ) and other parties 14 per cent ( up three ) .
At a general election , these figures would give the Tories an overall majority of 50 .
According to ComRes , 93 per cent of people who voted
Tory in 2005 would do so in an election held now , while only 75 per cent of Labour voters and 66 per cent of Liberal Democrat voters last time would stick with the same party .
Some 12 per cent of Labour and 16 per cent of Liberal Democrat voters in 2005 would back the Tories .
The Tories lead Labour among all demographic groups and all regions except Scotland .
Brown allies insist that he will switch his attention to the domestic political agenda after Thursday 's summit , for which President Barack Obama arrives in London tonight .
Although a further meeting of G20 leaders is expected to be held later this year , Mr Brown does not want to chair it .
He hopes governments will be ready to consider a further fiscal stimulus for 2010 .
Silvio Berlusconi , the Italian Prime Minister , wants the G20 to meet after a session of the G8 wealthiest nations in Sardinia in July .
Despite the poll findings , the Prime Minister is unrepentant in his view that the root causes of the crisis are global and require international agreement .
In a speech at St Paul 's Cathedral today , Mr Brown will insist : " I understand that people feel unsettled , and that the pain of this current recession is all too real . "
He will defend open markets and free trade but say the old consensus in favour of free markets is over .
" This is the great challenge of our generation : instead of the free market becoming a free - for - all , can we instead build anew a market system which respects the values we celebrate in our everyday lives ? " he will say .
Last night , Mr Brown set five tests for Thursday 's summit : extra money for bodies such as the International Monetary Fund ; cleaning up the banking system ; doing " whatever is necessary " to bring about growth ; resisting protectionism and boosting trade ; and delivering a low - carbon and sustainable recovery .
The Prime Minister said " a lot of work " was still needed to reach agreement , and called on the world to " rise to the challenge " .
Speaking alongside the Mexican President , Felipe Calderon , in Downing Street , Mr Brown said : " This is a decisive moment for the world economy .
We have a choice to make . "

SYDNEY ( Reuters Life ! ) -
An Australian school bus driver hit in the back of the head by a hard sweet has become a local hero after taking his unruly students to the police station to report their crime .
Veteran driver Graham King had asked the primary grade students to buckle their seat belts and stay seated while he drove them back from school in a Brisbane suburb , but they refused , running around the bus instead and throwing things .
One of the objects -- which turned out to be a piece of hard candy -- hit King in the head , and fed up by the commotion , he headed straight to the police station .
“ It could have been dangerous if it had gone through the windshield or knocked me out , ” King told a local newspaper , referring to the candy projectile .
The suburb ’s police district inspector described the driver ’s actions as “ brilliant . ”
“ The bus driver involved in this incident has acted responsibly and taken his duty toward the bus seriously and he has placed the students welfare and safety first , ” Ipswich Police District Inspector Kevin Keillor told reporters .
“ Police attended two bus accidents in recent weeks , one which was fatal and Mr. King ’s decision may have prevented another , ” he added .
King ’s zero - tolerance disciplinarian approach comes a few months after Australian father Sam Burt made headlines in December for making his 5 - year - old son walk 13 km ( 8 miles ) to school every day after the boy was kicked off the school bus for hitting the driver in the head with an apple core .
Burt ’s “ tough love ” inspired an appreciation group on social networking site Facebook .

How much is the word " toys " worth on the Internet ?
Hundreds ?
Thousands ?
Try millions of dollars .
In a close bidding war , Toys ' R ' Us last week bought the domain name Toys.com at auction for $ 5.1 million , placing it among the top 10 most expensive domain names on record .
And industry watchers say that it was probably a bargain .
" Had it not been such a recession , I think it probably would have gone for a little bit more than that , " Ron Jackson , editor and publisher of the Domain Name Journal , told ABCNews.com .
In better economic times , he said it might have sold in the $ 7 to $ 8 million range .
The reason a generic word like " toys " has such value , he said , is because it 's a massive key word .
Hundreds of thousands , maybe millions of people type that word into search engines every day , generating an incredible flow of traffic to Toys.com .
" It 's like having a store in the middle of Times Square , " Jackson said .
" The name is really almost priceless . "
Jackson 's industry magazine has tracked domain name sales since 2003 .
Because transactions can take place privately and publicly , he said , it 's difficult to record all sales .
His magazine only records transactions that were pure cash sales .
Others in the industry have speculated that Sex.com sold for $ 12.5 million , Business.com sold for $ 7.5 million , and Wine.com sold for $ 3 million .
But as they were not pure cash sales , Jackson does n't include them in his records .
Toys.com has not yet been added to his journal 's records , but Jackson expects to add it once the name has been officially transferred to Toys ' R ' Us .
For the full list of 10 most expensive domain names , click on to the next page .
According to the Domain Name Journal 's records , below is a list of the top 10 most expensive domain names .
1. Fund.com , $ 9.99 million
2. Porn.com , $ 9.5 million
3. Diamonds.com , $ 7.5 million
4. Toys.com , $ 5.1 million
5. Vodka.com , $ 3 million

Managing Object Lifecycles in Ironclad
Ironclad 0.8 has just been released .
Ironclad is an open source project by Resolver Systems to allow the use of Python C extensions from IronPython .
Ironclad is an implementation of the Python C API in C# , with a bit of assembly language to fool extensions into believing they are calling into Python 25.dll .
It also reuses as much of the C implementation of the API where possible .
When extensions make API calls , Ironclad creates IronPython objects rather than CPython objects , and Ironclad also handles the mapping of extension objects into IronPython .
One of the hardest challenges for Ironclad is that Python extension modules expect to use reference counting for garbage collection , whereas the .NET framework has its own ( more efficient ! ) garbage collector .
Ironclad objects that are still being used by the C extension module must n't be freed even if no .NET references exist to an object , and the reference count of extension objects must n't be allowed to drop to 0 if they are still being used inside .
NET .
A while ago I blogged about how Ironclad handled this .
That entry is now well out of date , so William Reade ( lead developer of Ironclad ) has provided an update .
Hello !
My name is William Reade .
I 'm a colleague of Michael's , and the primary developer on the Ironclad project , and some months ago I explained to Michael how I managed object lifetimes in Ironclad .
He in turn wrote a detailed post about it here , and I merrily chipped in to clarify a couple of points in the comments ; the result all looks perfectly respectable and technically quite neat , apart from the fact that the approach described is , in fact , dangerously stupid and wrong in at least one critical respect .
So , er , sorry .
Let 's see if we can do a little better this time .
The fundamental problem that Ironclad needs to solve is : " how do we make an IronPython object from a type defined in a compiled CPython extension ? "
Well , modulo a few mildly diabolical details , it 's actually pretty easy to construct an IronPython type which forwards all method calls ( and attribute accesses , etc ) to an underlying CPython instance .
So , in essence , we solve the problem by creating IronPython objects which wrap CPython objects -- which combination I will call a " bridge object " , for want of a better term .
There 's a bit of an impedance mismatch between the two systems , and the biggest problem thus far has been managing object lifetimes .
CPython objects are reference - counted , and will effectively commit suicide -- completely deterministically -- as soon as their refcount hits 0 , while IronPython objects are destroyed non-deterministically by the Garbage Collector : effectively , at random .
Some objects ' lifetimes are easy to track : when we create a CPython proxy for an IronPython object , we store the IronPython object and the pointer to the CPython stub object in a 2 - way map ( thus ensuring the IronPython object will not be GCed ) , and give the stub a dealloc method that deletes the association ( rendering the IronPython object -- or CLR object , for that matter -- once again eligible for GC ) , as soon as the CPython object 's refcount hits 0 .
However , when dealing with a bridge object , we need to manage its constituents ' lifetimes very carefully .
For reasons that will hopefully soon become clear , we need to depend on the GC to initiate the chain of events leading up to object destruction , so we can't let our map strongly reference the IronPython part ; instead , we have to use a weak reference to it .
We can't stop the CPython reference - counting from working , but clearly we can't afford to have the bridge object 's CPython part deallocate itself when the IronPython part is still alive : referencing freed memory is not generally considered to be industry Best Practice .
So , the IronPython object IncRefs the CPython object as soon as it's created , to ensure that the CPython object 's refcount never actually hits 0 again -- and hence that the normal mechanism for CPython object destruction never gets triggered .
Instead , at the point when the refcount hits 1 , I can be sure that no CPython references to the bridge object still exist .
Now , when the IronPython object gets garbage - collected , it can safely call the CPython dealloc method and release its unmanaged resources at the same time as the managed object dies .
And that 's fine , as far as it goes : it ensures that CPython objects can't disappear from underneath their IronPython counterparts .
However , that 's not the only failure scenario : the CPython part of the bridge object depends upon the IronPython part as well , so I can't afford to let wanton garbage - collections destroy the IronPython part while the CPython part is still being kept alive by unmanaged references .
So : whenever IronPython code calls into a CPython extension , we need to translate every parameter to that function into a format comprehensible to CPython .
If the parameter lacked a CPython representation beforehand , one is created with refcount 1 ; otherwise , the existing representation is IncReffed .
When the function returns , each parameter is DecReffed ( as is the return value , once its IronPython representation has been created or retrieved ) .
However , the IncRefs and DecRefs described above do extra checks for bridge objects whose refcounts are increasing to 2 or decreasing to 1 .
Every time the refcount increases to 2 , the IronPython object is added to a managed set , and it 's removed from it again whenever the refcount drops to 1 .
This ensures that , if the CPython code grabs a reference to a bridge object by IncReffing the CPython part , the refcount will not drop as far as 1 when it 's DecReffed on return .
Therefore , the IronPython part will stay in the strongRefs set and remain ineligible for garbage collection , even if it falls out of scope everywhere else , and so we can guarantee that it wo n't disappear while the CPython part still needs it .
Note
It 's important to draw a distinction between the Ironclad IncRef / DecRef operations and the normal reference incrementing and decrementing done by extension modules .
The former is fully under our control ( of course ) , the latter are implemented as C macros and directly manipulates a field on objects .
As we can't know when a C extension has updated the reference count on an object we are subject to these contortions .
The only remaining drawback is that , once CPython has finished with the bridge object , it may become an unreferenced zombie : the strongRefs set keeps the IronPython part , which holds the last reference to the CPython part , ineligible for GC .
So ... I periodically loop over the CPython parts of the bridge objects , checking refcount .
When I find a zombie , I just remove the - head , - or - destroy - the - brain - IronPython object from the strongRefs set , and allow GC to take its natural course ... and that closes all the loopholes I have thus far identified .
I hope that was broadly comprehensible , and perhaps even interesting or edifying ; if I 've been at all unclear , please comment , and I 'll answer your questions as best I can .
Book Review : Intellectual Property and Open Source
O'Reilly have been kind enough to give me a copy of Van Linderg 's book Intellectual Property and Open Source .
Of course the term " intellectual property " is itself controversial , but I prefer the more pragmatic approach to copyright reform of people like Lawrence Lessig .
Van Lindberg is an intellectual property lawyer , but also a member of the Python community and is strongly involved ( amongst other things ) in the organising of the PyCon Conference .
But enough about him , what 's his book like ?
The book is subtitled " A Practical Guide to Protecting Code " and is intended to be a description of US intellectual property law as it stands and applies to software .
It is not intended to be a defence of the current state of the law , nor conjecture about what it should be like .
Interestingly though , in order to understand the state of the law , it starts with a history of IP law and the philosophies behind it .
This is chapter 1 : " The Economic and Legal Foundations of Intellectual Property " .
Van is not just an IP lawyer , he is also a programmer , and the book is aimed at us poor beleaguered software developers .
The writing is down to earth and peppered with programming analogies .
It really is highly readable and enjoyable ( although dense with information ) ; no mean feat for a book on this subject .
I found the history of IP fascinating - and essential reading to understand why the law views intellectual property rights in some of the same ways as other property rights .
In fact Van makes the interesting point that the concept of property is a legal construct , and as theft is the defined as the violation of property rights the RIAA ( quite despicable though they are ) are technically correct to describe copyright violation as theft .
Having covered the background each of the next chapters tackle a major area of copyright law ; chapters 2 & 3 are on patents .
These chapters are n't restricted to the subject of software patents ( and in fact spend relatively little time on them ) but are more on the why and what of patents .
Although this knowledge does prove useful in later chapters as you consider the full range of property rights associated with our craft , I could n't help wanting to move onto the other more directly relevant topics all through this chapter ( although useful for completeness I felt that some of the minutiae of the patent documents could have been skipped ) .
Having said that , Van does a good job of explaining the inherent contradiction ( hypocrisy ? ) in the current US patent system .
The ethos of the patent system is to encourage the sharing of knowledge by making it public whilst granting the inventors a temporary monopoly .
At the same time it penalises creators if they check for pre-existing patents in their technology field .
If you are known to have been aware of a patent , yet are found to be in violation of it , you are liable for much worse damages .
As a creator it is important that you deliberately stay unaware of patents in your field !
Another interesting snippet is that if any of the inventors of a technology later patented are left off the patent document then other companies are free to license the technology from the unlisted inventor .
Decisions about who to list and who not to list as an inventor in the patent filing may be subject to internal company politics - but they can be vitally important .
All of these points are illustrated through the book by relevant case history .
The next chapters cover in turn copyright , trademarks and trade secrets .
Most people have some vague impressions of the law around trademarks and copyright - and most of them are wrong !
Even if you think you know what these terms mean there is enormous amount of useful and clearly presented information here .
Issues of copyright ( and even trademarks ) are particularly relevant to open source projects .
The chapter on trade secrets was also interesting to me , mainly because I do n't think we have trade secrets as a legally protected category in the UK ( I 'm probably wrong - but they are rarely discussed as having legal ramifications ) .
Frustratingly enough although the chapter explains in great detail what trade secrets are , how the legal protection can be removed and so on , it skims over what the legal remedy is in cases where trade secrets are unlawfully abused .
Property rights only have meaning in as much as there is a legal consequence to violating those rights - and the remedy available is this protection .
All through the chapter I was wondering , what actually happens if the court finds that trade secrets have been misappropriated .
Finally in chapter seven we arrive at contracts and licenses .
In some ways this is where the real meat of the book begins .
The book has Open Source in the title , and one of the most tangled areas of confusion around open source ( or free software or whatever you want to call it ) is licensing .
In order to understand open source licenses we are going to have to understand the legal validity of licensing intellectual property - and in particular the differences between licenses and contracts .
( One of the main differences is the legal remedy available to you - so whether an open source license is a contract or a license can be an extremely important issue . )
One of the chapters on contracts ( " So I Have an Idea ... " ) is about the situation for those employed as programmers .
Although less common in the UK , it is normal for employment contracts in the US to stipulate that not only are any projects or code you work on in your spare time the property of your employer - but even ideas you have whilst you work from them , even if you only create them later , may belong to them .
This obviously has ramifications for contributions to open source projects .
The solution is to communicate ' early and often ' with your employer , and get their permission in writing ( email is fine ) .
The chapters on open source licensing ( including a full chapter on the GPL license ! ) are for me the most practical .
They explain the issues around open source licensing , including how who owns the copyright ( particularly for contributions - which make the resulting work a derivative work of the original ) affects issues like relicensing .
My default license for my projects has always been the BSD License .
This is one of the more permissive ' academic ' licenses , but makes no stipulations regarding contributions .
After reading this book I 'm considering switching new projects to the Apache License 2 which explicitly specifies that contributing a patch grants a license for redistribution under the Apache license .
This simplifies licensing and redistribution issues .
The final chapters cover the legal status of reverse engineering ( surprisingly protected if you do it right - but complicated by the DMCA ) and incorporating as a not for profit organisation ( if this is relevant to your open source project then not only have you really made it but this chapter will be very useful ) .
So in summary , an excellent book .
Van Lindberg has done an outstanding job of navigating a dry and complex subject in an engaging and precise manner .
If you 're a programmer , or involved in open source projects , you need to read it - thankfully you 'll enjoy it .
Python 3 and Encodings ( again )
A while ago I blogged about how to specify the encoding when reading or writing text files with Python 3 : Python 3 : An end to Unicode Problems ?.
The full situation is a bit more complex , as you may need to be aware of encodings anywhere you have a text to bytes conversion ( or vice - versa ) .
This situation in essence is no different than Python 2 , but some of the mechanisms have changed and if you only dealt with byte - strings in Python 2 you just may not have been aware of the issues .
Thankfully Martin Lowis ( recipient of the Frank Willison award in 2008 for services to the Python community ) has posted to the Python - Dev mailing list a useful summary of how Python 3 determines the encoding to use :
In Python 3 , sys.getdefaultencoding ( ) is " utf - 8 " on all platforms , just as it was " ascii " in 2.x , on all platforms .
The default encoding is n't used for I/O ; check f.encoding to find out what encoding is used to read the file you are reading .
Notice that the determination of the specific encoding used is fairly elaborate : if IO is to a terminal , Python tries to determine the encoding of the terminal .
This is mostly relevant for Windows ( which uses , by default , the " OEM code page " in the terminal ) .
if IO is to a file , Python tries to guess the " common " encoding for the system .
On Unix , it queries the locale , and falls back to " ascii " if no locale is set .
On Windows , it uses the " ANSI code page " .
On OSX , it uses the " system encoding " .
if IO is binary , ( clearly ) no encoding is used .
Network IO is always binary .
for file names , yet different algorithms apply .
On Windows , it uses the Unicode API , so no need for an encoding .
On Unix , it ( again ) uses the locale encoding .
On OSX , it uses UTF - 8 ( just to be clear : this applies to the first argument of open ( ) , not to the resulting file object ) .
Note that these are n't the only encoding issues that remain .
Normally when you perform operations like listing the filenames in a directory , or looking at command line arguments , you want them as strings .
On some platforms these will originally be bytes ; what happens if they are undecodable ?
This issue has caused much debate .
Particularly on Linux it is not even uncommon for a filesystem to have filenames in inconsistent encodings ( undecodable filenames ) and it was considered unacceptable for a call to os.listdir ( ) to raise an exception in these circumstances ( applications would just stop working ) .
The answer ( issue 3187 ) is that operations like os.listdir ( ) honour the type of the argument you pass in .
If you pass in a string then you get a list of strings ( possibly with undecodable filenames missing ) .
If you pass in bytes then you will get a list of bytes back , guaranteed to be complete but you will need to do the decoding yourself .
As for undecodable command line arguments , it 's a bit hard to follow ( issue 3023 which is still open ) but I think the decision is that Python 3 will refuse to handle them .
Python in the Browser on Linux ( with Moonlight )
Programming the browser with Python is fun , and is easy with Silverlight but suffers the deficiency of only being available on the Mac and Windows .
The Mono team have been working on the Linux port of Silverlight called Moonlight .
Moonlight 1.0 is already available and includes media codecs supplied by Microsoft to support all the media streaming capabilities of Silverlight .
President Obama 's inauguration was streamed over Silverlight , and a link on each page showed a link to Moonlight with the caption " Linux - compatible Silverlight Player " .
The really interesting version of Silverlight is Silverlight 2 , which includes a cut down and sandboxed version of the .NET runtime called the CoreCLR .
Now that Moonlight 1.0 is complete work on Moonlight 2.0 is well underway .
JB Evain is on the Mono team , and has demonstrated the capabilities of the Moonlight 2.0 port by running some IronPython examples :
Those are my Try Python ( interactive interpreter ) and IronPython Web IDE apps running in Firefox on Linux !

WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. businesses cut jobs at a rapid pace again in December , analysts say , worsening a trend that could produce the largest quarterly job loss since America demobilized its war economy after beating Hitler .
The Labor Department will report on December 's nonfarm payroll report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. Eastern , with economists surveyed by MarketWatch expecting payrolls to fall 500,000 after the 533,000 loss in November .
See Economic Calendar .
December 's loss could be much worse , some economists believe .
Following the news from payroll firm ADP that its revised private - sector job index fell by 693,000 in December , some economists sharply lowered their forecasts for the payrolls number .
Ian Shepherdson , chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics , said payrolls could fall by 700,000 , the worst in 60 years .
Other economists were sticking to their slightly less - horrible forecasts .
" Labor market conditions are deteriorating at a rapid clip , and we look for another sizeable drop in payrolls , " said David Greenlaw , an economist for Morgan Stanley , who continued to look for a loss of 450,000 .
" However , we are discounting the results of the ADP survey . "
For the fourth quarter as a whole , the median expectation is for payrolls to fall by 1.35 million , the worst since 1945 .
Global business and consumer confidence , already weak , plunged abruptly after the collapse of Lehman Bros . and the rescue of AIG and Fannie and Freddie in September , said Jay Feldman , an economist for Credit Suisse .
For all of 2008 , employment likely fell by 2.41 million , the most since 2.75 million jobs were lost in 1945 and exceeding the 2.1 million lost in 1982 .
Of course , the workforce is much larger today than it was in 1982 or 1945 .
As a percentage of employment at the beginning of the year , payrolls likely dropped 1.7 % in 2008 , the fourth worst year since the war .
The unemployment rate is expected to surge higher to 7.1 % from 6.7 % in November .
It would be the highest unemployment rate since 1993 .
Analysts surveyed by MarketWatch believe the jobless rate will continue to rise through 2009 , peaking above 8 % , 9 % or even 10 % early next year .
As grim as these figures are , they probably understate the collapse of the labor market .
Many workers are being forced to cut back their hours ; in November , 7.3 million workers had been reduced to part - time hours because of the slowing economy , up 1.6 million in just three months .

Thousands of carbon - intensive facilities across the U.S. may have to report their greenhouse gas emissions for the first time beginning in 2011 .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday , using its authority under the Clean Air Act , proposed a national greenhouse gas reporting framework that will impact roughly 13,000 facilities covering up to 90 percent of the country 's emissions .
The first report in 2011 would cover emissions from 2010 .
The reporting rules lay the groundwork for future climate change legislation and would apply to facilities generating more than 25,000 metric tons of emissions annually , such as power generators , car manufacturers , industrial chemical suppliers and cement , iron and steel producers , among others .
" Through this new reporting , we will have comprehensive and accurate data about the production of greenhouse gases , " EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said in a statement .
" This is a critical step toward helping us better protect our health and environment -- all without placing an onerous burden on our nation 's small businesses . "
The EPA estimates it will cost reporting companies about $ 160 million in the first year , and about $ 127 million in subsequent years .
There will be a 60 - day comment period once the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Canadian researchers have uncovered a vast electronic spying operation that infiltrated computers and stole documents from government and private offices around the world , including those of the Dalai Lama , The New York Times reported on Saturday .
In a report provided to the newspaper , a team from the Munk Center for International Studies in Toronto said at least 1,295 computers in 103 countries had been breached in less than two years by the spy system , which it dubbed GhostNet .
Embassies , foreign ministries , government offices and the Dalai Lama ’s Tibetan exile centers in India , Brussels , London and New York were among those infiltrated , said the researchers , who have detected computer espionage in the past .
They found no evidence U.S. government offices were breached .
The researchers concluded that computers based almost exclusively in China were responsible for the intrusions , although they stopped short of saying the Chinese government was involved in the system , which they described as still active .
“ We ’re a bit more careful about it , knowing the nuance of what happens in the subterranean realms , ” said Ronald Deibert , a member of the Munk research group , based at the University of Toronto .
“ This could well be the CIA or the Russians .
It ’s a murky realm that we ’re lifting the lid on . ”
A spokesman for the Chinese Consulate in New York dismissed the idea China was involved .
“ These are old stories and they are nonsense , ” the spokesman , Wenqi Gao , told the Times .
“ The Chinese government is opposed to and strictly forbids any cybercrime . ”
The Toronto researchers began their sleuthing after a request from the office of the Dalai Lama , the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader , to examine its computers for signs of malicious software , or malware .
The network they found possessed remarkable “ Big Brother - style ” capabilities , allowing it , among other things , to turn on the camera and audio - recording functions of infected computers for potential in - room monitoring , the report said .
The system was focused on the governments of South Asian and Southeast Asian nations as well as on the Dalai Lama , the researchers said , adding that computers at the Indian Embassy in Washington were infiltrated and a NATO computer monitored .
The report will be published in Information Warfare Monitor , an online publication linked to the Munk Center .
At the same time , two computer researchers at Cambridge University in Britain who worked on the part of the investigation related to the Tibetans are releasing an independent report , the Times said .
They do fault China and warned that other hackers could adopt similar tactics , the Times added .
The reviews are in on the leaked Geithner plan , and we are going to do something different here for a change .
We are not going to listen to people who have been wrong about everything , and instead are going to listen to people who have been more right than wrong .
The administration might learn from this approach .
First up , Yves at Naked Capitalism :
And notice the utter dishonesty : a competitive bidding process will protect taxpayers .
Huh ?
A competitive bidding process will elicit a higher price which is BAD for taxpayers !
Dear God , the Administration really thinks the public is full of idiots .
But there are so many components to the program , and a lot of moving parts in each , they no doubt expect everyone ’s eyes to glaze over .
Calculated Risk :
With almost no skin in the game , these investors can pay a higher than market price for the toxic assets ( since there is little downside risk ) .
This amounts to a direct subsidy from the taxpayers to the banks .
Oh well , I ’m sure Geithner will provide details this time …
Krugman :
The Geithner plan has now been leaked in detail .
It ’s exactly the plan that was widely analyzed — and found wanting — a couple of weeks ago .
The zombie ideas have won .
The Obama administration is now completely wedded to the idea that there ’s nothing fundamentally wrong with the financial system — that what we ’re facing is the equivalent of a run on an essentially sound bank .
As Tim Duy put it , there are no bad assets , only misunderstood assets .
And if we get investors to understand that toxic waste is really , truly worth much more than anyone is willing to pay for it , all our problems will be solved .
If this were a medical emergency , it appears it would look something like this :
The Illness - reckless and irresponsible betting led to huge losses
The Diagnosis- Insufficient gambling .
The Cure- a Trillion dollar stack of chips provided by the house .
The Prognosis- We are so screwed .
If these guys are right , this will be the undoing of the Obama administration .
Better enjoy this four years , libs .
Bugs play a vital role in balancing the ecosystem .
The only problem with some bugs is that they do tend to invade areas they are not needed like your house .
Presence of some bugs can cause all sorts of trouble .
Some pests transmit contagious diseases , while there are others that are known to be destructive .
Thus , the first line of defense as far as pest control is concerned is to keep your home tidy and sealing off possible entry spaces .
Unfortunately , taking all the necessary preventive measures do not eliminate the possibility of pest infestations .
This article looks at some of the common pests that invade our living spaces , and possible ways of dealing with them .
Cockroaches
These filthy and disgusting pests contaminate almost everything they come across .
In light of this , cockroaches are associated with things like food contamination and poisoning .
These uninvited guests hide in dark spaces and often come out when we retire to bed .
If you happen to notice in signs of a possible infestation , it is advisable to call in a pest control expert and have the issues addressed .
Termites
These tiny black , tan , or white bugs are known to attack wood .
They might also be a hazard to books and food depending on the type of species in your house .
As much as you might have put in all preventive measures , they are bound to find their way into your home at some point .
The moment any termite species invades your home , go for professional removal .
Ants
These pests are known to ambush homeowners in long troops .
Considering that they live in colonies , seeing a group of them is often indicative of the possibility of having even greater numbers somewhere .
While some homeowners might resort to DIY quick fixes , most of these methods rarely work .
Pesticides rarely get the problem solved .
So the best way to prevent and deal with an infestation is always a call away .
Bed Bugs
Bed bugs cause all sorts of problem .
Not only do they bite , but they also transmit some harmful diseases .
These pests live within the woodwork of your bed or furniture .
They are not readily noticeable considering that they come out during times of low light intensity .
They are tricky pests to get rid of , and often push their hosts to use any possible method to get rid of them , including burning furniture .
Cockroaches , ants , termites , ants , and mice can cause havoc our homes .
The best way to deal with any pest infestation problem is to enlist the services of a professional control expert .
Professional services go a long way in eradication and prevention of future infestation .…
Writing Systems Software in a Functional Language
Writing Systems Software in a Functional Language : An Experience Report
Iavor S. Diatchki , Thomas Hallgren , Mark P. Jones , Rebekah Leslie , and Andrew Tolmach .
In Proceedings of the Fourth Workshop on Programming Languages and Operating Systems ( PLOS 2007 ) , sponsored by ACM SIGOPS , Stevenson , Washington , October 2007 .
Abstract :
Current practices for developing systems software usually rely on fairly low - level programming languages and tools .
As an alternative , our group has been investigating the possibility of using a high - level functional language , Haskell , for kernel and device driver construction , with the hope that it will allow us to produce more reliable and secure software .
In this paper , we describe our experience developing a prototype operating system , House , in which the kernel , device drivers , and even a simple GUI , are all written in Haskell .
The House system demonstrates that it is indeed possible to construct systems software in a functional language .
However , it also suggests some ideas for a new Haskell dialect with features that target specific needs in this domain , including strongly typed support for low - level data structures and facilities for explicit memory accounting .
If you are among those seeking an answer to the question is financial aid free , then you are in the right place .
But before we proceed , I will like you to know that financial assistance can come from any source .
It could come from the federal , state government , private organization or individual , including a tertiary institution .
However , the source does n’t matter .
What matters is the question ;
Is financial aid free money ?
Well , the answer is yes and no !
There are several financial assistance out there , divided into Gift Aid and Non-Gift Aid .
Any Gift Aid awarded to a student is free money .
In other words , the recipient does n’t have to pay back at any point in time .
Such type of aid ( free money ) includes scholarships and grants .
However , Non-Gift
Aid is n’t a gift or free money .
It ’s a loan that the recipient needs to pay back at some point .
So , not all financial aids are free money .
It depends on the type of assistance one receives .
So , that ’s it about financial aid .
You can continue reading for more information on the topic .
What Does Financial Aid Mean ?
Some individuals dream of going to college but do n’t believe their dream can ever come to pass .
The reason is not that they are n’t capable , but due to a lack of finance .
Education is quite expensive , and it ’s not possible to cut corners .
You need money to purchase books , pay for tuition , eat , rent an apartment and do other things .
When you factor in the cost of going to a tertiary institution for an academic session alone , you will discover that it runs into thousands of dollars .
So , every college or university student needs substantial financial support .
Otherwise , there ’s no point furthering one ’s education .
And this brings us back to the question ; what is financial aid ?
It refers to financial support or money offered to students seeking to further their education .
This financial support can also come from different sources .
It could be from the federal government , state government , your school of study or from private sources .
However , the source of money or aid does n’t matter .
What should matter most to you as a student is the type of assistance you are getting .
Is such financial support repayable or not ?
That ’s what should concern you the most .
Kinds Of Financial Aid Available For College Students
It ’s interesting to know that college students have a plethora of financial support to choose from , whenever the need arises .
And the beautiful thing is that one can decide to apply for multiple loans , there ’s nothing wrong with that .
You can apply for the financial aid and get approved , provided you are eligible for the said aid .
So , as I said earlier , there is tons of financial aid available for college student seeking to further their education .
These include scholarships , grants , work - study funds and loans .
Let ’s look at each of them one after the other for better understanding .
Grants
First off , what ’s the meaning of grant ?
It refers to a specific amount of cash that the government ( federal or state ) or other institutions offer to an individual for a known purpose .
It could be for educational use or home improvements .
Grants can also be offered to an individual or organization that ’s embarking on meaningful research .
It could a research project to discover a cure for certain diseases , technology - wise or something that could have a positive impact all over the world .
It ’s also important to note that not all grant application will be honored .
Unless one satisfies the requirements to receive a grant , one ’s grant application can be denied .
And as I said , grants can be offered by any individual or institution .
It could come from the government , which include the federal or state government .
Most colleges also provide grants to specific students .
What are grants offered to students based on ?
Here ’s another question I expect anyone seeking a grant to ask .
Fortunately , they are based on several factors .
It could be need - based , merit - based , and or student - specific .
Below are some of the grants an individual can get from the federal government .
You can go through them carefully for better understanding and make an informed decision when the need arises .
Pell Grants
If you are an undergraduate , keep in mind that the Pell Grant is precisely for your educational level .
This grant is directly from the federal government , and aid amount depends on diverse factors .
These include one ’s financial needs , and how much the attendance for your school of interest costs , among other critical factors .
Another critical question to ask and things to know about the Pell Grant is how it works and eligibility .
Generally speaking , Pell Grants are paid directly toward one ’s tuition and fees , including room and board , if applicable .
After paying these fees , the leftover cash is paid into the recipient ’s account .
This grant is paid to students for six years or 12 semesters .
Now , what are the criteria for receiving or qualifying for the Pell Grant ?
For you to be counted eligible for this grant , you must be a vocational student or an undergraduate .
You also must have enrolled or have been accepted into your school of interest .
Again , an eligible candidate for the Pell Grant is someone who has n’t acquired a professional or bachelor ’s degree .
And finally , to become qualified , participants are required to satisfy the Basic Eligibility Criteria requirements to be awarded federal financial support .
Other eligibility criteria for the Pell Grant :
If you are applying for the Pell Grant , here are some of the requirements one has to satisfy :
Possess a social security number
Possess a GED certificate or high school diploma .
Other equivalent certificates might be accepted .
You must prove that you seriously need financial aid
Must maintain excellent and acceptable academic progress
You must be a USA citizen or an eligible non-citizen .
These are some of the criteria that can make you eligible for the Pell Grant .
Let go over other grants the federal government awards besides the Pell Grant .
FSEOG – ( Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity )
The FSEOG is another grant awarded to undergraduate students .
The only difference is that it ’s not just awarded to any student but those who have a higher degree of financial needs .
How to be eligible for FSEOG
Applicant must possess a social security number .
The school of interest has to be accredited .
The applicant has to be a citizen of the United States of America .
An applicant must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ) form .
Applicant must be in pressing need of financial support .
The TEACH ( Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education ) Grants .
This grant is open to all , but you need to be eligible to be awarded such a grant .
One of the eligibility criteria is that you must be ready to become a teacher , but that ’s not all .
Another requirement is that you must be prepared to teach in low - income regions .
IASG ( Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grants )
Here ’s another grant reserved for select applicants .
It ’s a grant reserved for students who lost their guardian or parent that participated in Afghanistan or Iraqi military exercises .
To be eligible , one ’s parents must be a member of the United States armed forces and may have died in active service in either of both Middle East regions after September 11 , 2011 .
Loans
Any institution can offer a loan .
It could come from a private institution or directly from the federal government .
But keep in mind that loan is n’t free money .
Students will have to pay back their loans , together with some interests once they graduate from college .
For those seeking federal loans , keep in mind that the two types of loans available are unsubsidized and subsidized loans .
Besides federal loans which are issued to students by the federal government , there are also private loans .
As the name implies , private loans are issued to students by privately owned banks .
The two significant issues private loans have are , interest rates are a bit on the high side , and they depend mainly on the credit scores of the recipient .
Scholarships
If you are seeking a financial aid that is free money , then apply for a scholarship .
Once you receive such an award , you do n’t have to repay it .
It ’s entirely free and can be from anyone .
You can receive a scholarship from a private organization or individual institution .
Below are factors upon which scholarships are awarded ;
Race
Academic performance
Religious affiliation
Athletic ability
Work - study
Let me make something clear ; work - study is n’t financial aid .
It ’s just another means for students to use their abilities to earn money .
The work - study program is open to student and offers them the opportunity to work , earn cash and pay their school levies .
All you ’re expected to do is complete any assigned federally funded job which could be on campus or other approved location .
Conclusion
Is financial aid free money going by what you have read ?
I guess your answer will still be yes and no !
Not all financial aid is free money .
Let ’s consider a Loan , for instance .
A loan is not free money .
In short , the recipient needs to pay back and with specific interests added to the original amount .
However , a scholarship is free money .
In other words , the recipient does n’t have to repay such financial aid .
I hope you now understand the answer to the question .

General Motors
( GM ) - Get Report
executives are more open to a speedy bankruptcy reorganization financed by the government , a published report says , pushing aside earlier concerns that such a move would scare away so many customers the company would n't survive .
The new view represents a reversal from GM 's position late last year , when it sought a federal bailout , the
Wall Street Journal
reports .
The change in thinking , combined with the
disclosure
Thursday that GM 's auditor has raised " substantial doubt " about the automaker 's ability to keep going , appears to move GM closer to the possibility it will file for reorganization .
Shares of GM were down 11 cents , or 5.9 % , to $ 1.75 in the first half hour of trading Friday .
Both developments come as President Barack Obama 's auto task force is trying to decide how much more aid to provide GM .
They also come as GM is locked in negotiations with its bondholders to trade debt for equity as a way to cut its cost of operations .
The task force met Thursday with representatives of GM 's bondholders .
The panel held lengthy meetings with executives and lawyers for two important parts of the proposed turnaround plans for General Motors and
Chrysler
, the
Associated Press
reports .
Those companies are surviving on $ 17.4 billion in government loans and seeking billions more to stay afloat .
Advisers to GM bondholders met with Steve Rattner and Ron Bloom , top aides to
Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner , and other members of the panel for two hours .
GM is negotiating with its bondholders to cut two - thirds of its $ 27 billion in unsecured debt under the terms of the loan agreement with the government .
The advisers to the bondholders declined comment .
They were expected to outline several options to reduce the Detroit automaker 's unsecured debt and discuss whether the government would guarantee new bonds that GM would issue as part of its restructuring , the
AP
reports .
GM CEO told Congress and the White House in November and December that a Chapter 11 reorganization would spark a plunge in revenue from which the company would n't recover .
But after months of research , including analysis done by top bankruptcy advisers , the
Journal
reports the company has come to believe it could emerge from what is known as a prepackaged bankruptcy , according to a person familiar with the matter .
A GM spokesman told the
Journal
: " We have n't changed our view that bankruptcy is not something that we want to contemplate . "
2/28/09 : A California gay - rights group announced Friday it is formally ending a boycott of one of Utah 's most high - profile car dealerships .
Fred Karger , director of Californians Against Hate , said Friday the two - week boycott of Ken Garff Automotive Group was being called off immediately , following a series of meetings that included face - to - face discussions between company principals John and Robert Garff and Utah philanthropist Bruce Bastian , a leading gay - rights advocate .

Unemployment will rise this week to beyond the two - million mark – and higher than the level that New Labour inherited from the Conservatives when Tony Blair became Prime Minister and Gordon Brown Chancellor in May 1997 .
The jobless total , when it is released on Wednesday , will easily exceed the last recorded figure of 1.971 million , and may well be larger than the 2.05 million people unemployed that was bequeathed by John Major over a decade ago .
In recent months , the headline rate of unemployment has risen by about 40,000 to 60,000 per month .
Many economists expect unemployment to carry on climbing steeply , and to exceed the post - Second World War peak of 3.3 million seen in 1984 , during Margaret Thatcher 's premiership .
The workforce is larger now , so the unemployment rate , expressed as a percentage , may remain below that 1980s highpoint .
And the number of benefit claimants is substantially lower than one decade ago .
But the headline figure will still evoke memories of the mass unemployment suffered in the 1980s and even the 1930s .
By this time next year , more than one in 10 of the labour force could be out of work .

The most acute concern for ministers will be the sharply deteriorating outlook for younger workers .
Unemployment among 16 - to - 24 - year - olds is running at more than 15 per cent .
Despite a succession of government schemes to place them in work , the level of British youth unemployment has remained stubbornly high .
Some 488,000 of 18 - to - 24 - year - olds were unemployed in May 1997 , a figure which declined to a low of 371,000 in July 2000 .
However the latest figure puts it back up at 616,000 , and many economists point out that the young will suffer disproportionately from the wave of sackings sweeping the economy .
Younger workers tend to fall victim to a " last in first out " mentality , but tend to have little money to fall back on .
Howard Archer , of economic consultancy Global Insight , said : " We expect unemployment to have risen by around 176,000 , taking it up to 2.040 million and the unemployment rate to jump to 6.6 per cent .
We also expect unemployment to rise to a peak of 3.3 million around late - 2010 and early - 2011 .
This would give an unemployment rate of around 10.5 per cent . "
The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development forecasts that redundancies will reach 300,000 over the first quarter of this year .
For Mr Brown 's government to preside over levels of unemployment even higher than those during the Thatcher and Major governments will be embarrassing to the Prime Minister , who made much of his early political reputation by passionately campaigning on this very issue .
In 1983 , in his maiden speech to the House of Commons , Mr Brown declared that " the grossest affront to human dignity and the gravest assault , on any view of social justice , is mass unemployment and its inevitable consequence , mass poverty . "
As Chancellor from 1997 , Mr Brown told MPs : " The greatest waste of our economic potential and the most serious cause of poverty is unemployment . "
Perry Ward : ' I 've now used up all my savings '
I am a junior programmer but I have been unemployed for seven months .
After graduating with a degree in physics from the University of Exeter I moved back in with my parents and helped them renovate their house so that I could save some money .
In 2007 , I got a job as a junior technical adviser .
It started off as a contract position then became permanent but last summer the company folded and I lost my job .
I got another job through an agency but after just two months the company had to let me go as the recession was hitting them really hard .
I have applied for lots of jobs but have only had two interviews since September .
The situation is pretty bad .
People with more than five years ' experience are going for junior jobs with £ 20,000 salaries , taking big pay cuts .
And so many graduates are out there looking for jobs that the competition is fierce .
The lease on my Oxford flat does not expire until July and I do n't want to leave but a lot of people are moving towns in search of work .
I consider myself a young professional and I can't really hand in my CV to Tesco as I would n't be the person they are looking to hire long term anyway .
I have used up all my savings and am on unemployment benefits .
It 's getting harder to pay the rent .
If I run out of money I will have to move back home and help the parents build a garage .
Interview by Stina Backer
By Paul Reynolds
World affairs correspondent , BBC News website
The ICRC report implies the US violated international law CIA interrogation techniques used on al - Qaeda suspects " constituted torture " , according to a leaked report by the international Red Cross .
The findings were based on testimonies by 14 so - called " high - value " detainees who were held in secret CIA prisons .
They were interviewed after being transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2006 .
President George W Bush denied torture had happened and President Barack Obama has banned US agents from carrying out such practices .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) has an international role in monitoring standards for prisoners and trying to ensure compliance by governments with the Geneva Conventions .
It was denied access to the prisoners until their transfer to Guantanamo Bay .
I was told that they would not allow me to die but that I would be brought to the 'verge of death and back again '
Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
Among those interviewed by the ICRC was the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who said he was told he would be " brought to the verge of death and back " .
The ICRC report was obtained by Mark Danner , a US writer , whose account is in the New York Review of Books .
The report was not intended for publication but , as is the procedure in such cases , was given in confidence to the US government .
" For the first time the words are those of the detainees themselves , " Mark Danner says in a podcast attached to his story .
' Breaking point '
The report 's table of contents lists the methods the prisoners told the ICRC they had endured .
Taken overall they constitute an attempt to break a prisoner down through sensory deprivation and beatings , none of which is supposed to leave physical damage that can be traced .
The accounts indicate that a combination of methods was used on each prisoner .
The methods listed included : Suffocation by water or waterboarding ; prolonged stress standing ; beating by use of a collar ; confinement in a box ; prolonged nudity ; sleep deprivation and subjection to noise and cold water ; and denial of solid food .
" They never used the word ' torture ' ... only to ' hard time ' , " Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is quoted as saying .
" I was never threatened with death , in fact I was told that they would not allow me to die , but that I would be brought to the ' verge of death and back again ' . "
He said he underwent waterboarding five times : " A cloth would be placed over my face , cold water from a bottle kept in a fridge was then poured onto the cloth by one of the guards so I could not breathe . "
He said a clip was put on his finger to monitor his pulse " so they could take me to the breaking point " .
' Minimise physical damage '
Another prisoner Abu Zubaydah was apparently the first to be subjected to this " alternative set of procedures " .
He said : " I was told ... that I was one of the first to receive those interrogation techniques , so no rules applied . "
In his case , there was a variation apparently not used subsequently .
' INTERROGATION METHODS ' Waterboarding Beatings Sleep deprivation Prolonged stress standing Prolonged nudity Confinement in a box Denial of solid food Source : ICRC Report
He said he was put into a tall box and later into a smaller one in which he had to crouch , causing a wound on his leg to start bleeding .
He also had a towel tied round his neck with which his interrogators would slam him against a wall , which had plywood attached to it .
Mr Danner surmised this was to minimise the physical damage caused to him .
With other prisoners this towel became a plastic collar used with the same effect .
Contradiction ?
President Bush acknowledged that , as he put it , an " alternative set of procedures " had been used on some prisoners but he denied this meant they had been tortured , which is outlawed by an international convention .
" The United States does not torture , " President Bush said in September 2006 .
That was after the techniques described had been used .
The Bush administration developed a legal protection , under which the definition of torture was narrowed to exclude the methods described .
Barack Obama has outlawed practices like waterboarding Mr Danner says the ICRC report now presents a " clear contradiction " of that position and that " this contradiction needs to be worked out " .
Senator Patrick Leahy , chairman of the US's Senate Judiciary Committee , has proposed that former officials be given immunity in return for evidence .
Human rights groups want accountability .
President Obama has spoken of " looking forwards " .
He has also banned the use of the techniques by all US agencies , including the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , which had been given special dispensation by the Bush administration .
The ICRC has said that it regrets the publication of the information attributed to its report .
' Essential '
There has been a counter attack by former Vice President Dick Cheney , who once said that the use of waterboarding had been , for him , a " no- brainer " .
He accused President Obama of " making choices that , in my mind , will , in fact , raise the risk to the American people of another attack " .
Some have questioned the value of the intelligence gained from harsh techniques .
Mr Cheney said : " I think those programmes were absolutely essential to the success we enjoyed of being able to collect the intelligence that let us defeat all further attempts to launch attacks against the United States after 9/11 . "

Explanation : Did observatories exist before telescopes ?
One example that still stands today is the Beijing Ancient Observatory in China .
Starting in the 1400s astronomers erected large instruments here to enable them to measure star and planet positions with increasing accuracy .
Pre-telescopic observatories throughout the world date back to before recorded history , providing measurements that helped to determine when to plant crops , how to navigate ships , and when religious ceremonies should occur .
It is interesting to compare the above picture to one taken in 1895 .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation today has taken the wraps off a new Web site designed to help you keep the government from taking the wraps off your personal communications and stored data .
And here 's a prediction : Someone 's going to call it a threat to national security before the day is out .
... Phooey .
( 2010's 25 Geekiest 25th Anniversaries )
From the Surveillance Self - Defense site :
The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) has created this Surveillance Self - Defense site to educate the American public about the law and technology of government surveillance in the United States , providing the information and tools necessary to evaluate the threat of surveillance and take appropriate steps to defend against it .
Surveillance Self - Defense ( SSD ) exists to answer two main questions :
What can the government legally do to spy on your computer data and communications ?
And what can you legally do to protect yourself against such spying ?
Now if you 're thinking that you have no need for such information because you 're not doing anything wrong , well , you 're right in the sense that this site is not meant for those whose faith in their benevolent government remains unshaken .
It 's more for those who lived the past eight years , in particular , with their eyes wide open .
From the press release announcing SSD :
" Despite a long and troubling history in this country of the government abusing its surveillance powers , most Americans know very little about how the law protects them or about how they can take steps to protect themselves against government surveillance , " said EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston .
" The Surveillance Self - Defense project offers citizens a legal and technical toolkit with tips on how to defend themselves in case the government attempts to search , seize , subpoena or spy on their most private data . "
More from the site :
After an introductory discussion of how you should think about making security decisions - it's all about risk management - we 'll be answering those two questions for three types of data :
First , we 're going to talk about the threat to the data stored on your computer posed by searches and seizures by law enforcement , as well as subpoenas demanding your records .
There a section called " What can the government do ? " gets into : the Fourth Amendment ; reasonable expectations of privacy ; search warrants ; " sneak and peek " search warrants ; warrantless searches ; search incident to lawful arrest ; and subpoenas .
As for what you can do to protect yourself , topics include : develop a data retention and destruction policy ; master the basics of data protection ; learn how to use passwords properly ; encrypt your data ; and protect yourself against malware .
Second , we 're going to talk about the threat to your data on the wire - that is , your data as it's being transmitted - posed by wiretapping and other real - time surveillance of your telephone and Internet communications by law enforcement .
Third , we 're going to describe the information about you that is stored by third parties like your phone company and your Internet service provider , and how law enforcement officials can get it .
There are also sections about the government 's recent claims to expanded surveillance authority , as well as one about " defensive technologies " that may cause a stir in some circles .
The site is well organized , easily navigable , and written so as not to scare off the non-techies .
There 's a legal disclaimer noting that " this guide is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice . "
Curiously missing is any sort or discussion forum , although there is a form for asking questions .
I 've always liked that the EFF is an action - oriented advocacy group , witness the organization 's highly successful Patent Busting Project .
This effort fits in with its mission quite nicely and is worth a look ... even if you have nothing to hide .
( Update , Wed. , 3:40 p.m. : The " Surveillance Self - Defense " site has been down for more than an hour , prompting almost instantaneous / light - hearted conspiracy theories in the comments below ... and me to ask EFF what 's up .
Their reply : " We 're having a server issue ( more traffic than we expected ) .
It 's being worked on right now , and hopefully will be up within the hour . " )
BGP を解説してみた
2009年2月17日にインターネットが壊れました。 今回の障害はチェコのISPが出してしまった経路情報によって世界各地のルータが機能不全に陥るという事態へと発展したようです。
先日の記事で、流れた経路情報の詳細などを紹介しましたが、「BGPとは何か？」や「そもそもルーティングとは何か？」を知らなければ何を言っているのか意味不明な解説記事だったと思います。
そこで、今回は「インターネットの仕組み」そのものを解説しながら「何が起きたか？」を解説しようと思います。
対象としている読者は、IT系の知識はあるがIPによる通信そのものに関しての知識は無いエンジニアです。
なお、本来ならば正確さを確保するために解説すべきである細かい点は、あえて解説しないようにしているのでご注意下さい。
そもそもインターネットとは何か？
まず、最初 に 「インターネットとは何か？」を説明したいと思います。
Inter-netとは、ネットワークの集合体です。 ネットワークとネットワークが相互に接続しながら巨大なネットワークを構成するというものです。
「 様々な障害を想定して非常に冗長で堅牢に出来ている」というイメージを持たれる方も多いと思いますが、実際の運用がそのようになっていない場合もあります。
インターネットを構成する「仕組み 」や「プロトコル」は非常に冗長性があるものであったとしても、商業として構築されているインターネット網がそうであるとは限らないからです。
インターネットは、巨大な網の目のようなネットワークです。
ネットワークは「網」と呼ばれる事もあります。
この網の中をパケットと呼ばれるデータが転送されて行く事によって通信が成り立っています。 例えば、特定のWebサーバとの通信が行われているとき、やり取りされるデータは細かくパケットに分かれています。
一般的には、各パケットは最大千数百バイトぐらいのサイズになります。
パケットを転送する役割を持っているのがルータ( router)と呼ばれる機器です。
ルータはパケットの行き先を考えながら転送するのが仕事です。
ルータ( router )
Webやメールだけを使っているとルータという機器をあまり意識しないと思いますが、インターネットは無数のルータによって構成されています。 家の入り口に置いてあるSOHOルータなどもルータです。
ルータは、２つ以上のネットワークインターフェースを持っていて、到着したパケットをどのネットワークインターフェースに転送するか考えてから転送します。
この転送はフォワーディングと呼ばれます。
フォワーティングは経路表を見ながら行われます。
経路表には、「この宛先ならこのネットワークインターフェースへ」という情報が列挙してあります。
現実世界に比喩すると、「北海道はネットワークインターフェース１番、沖縄はネットワークインターフェース２番、大阪はネットワークインターフェース３番」というような看板を見てから、小包であるパケットをネットワークインターフェースに渡して、次のルータにさらに託すという感じになります。
このように、全てのパケットは多数のルータによる「バケツリレー」が繰り返される事によって最終的に目的地に到達します。
ここでポイントになるのが、「○○はあっち」という情報が大量に列挙された経路表をどうやって構築するかです。
なお、注意が必要なのは、経路情報とフォワーディングは別の概念である事です。
フォワーディングとは、パケットを転送する行為そのものです。
ルータの内部で保持される経路表を元にフォワーディングが行われますが、「経路表を作る事」と「パケットをフォワードすること(転送すること) 」は別なのです。
インターネットとルーティング
ルータはパケットを何処に向けて転送すれば良いのか考える必要があります。
無数にあり得る宛先のバリエーションに対応するための「経路表」を作るのが「ルーティング」と呼ばれる作業です。
ルーティングは主にルータによって行われます
（手動で設定してしまう静的ルーティングも使われる場面が色々ありますが、今回は割愛します）。
ルータは相互に協力をしあいながら「経路表」を構築していきます。
ある程度は自分たちで勝手にネットワークの構造を把握しながら経路表を作って行きます。
ネットワークが十分小さければ人間が全ての経路を指定していくことで経路表を完成させられますが、勝手にネットワークが増えたり減ったりするようなインターネットでは、人間が常に状況を把握しながら経路表を更新するのは、ほぼ不可能です。
そして、経路表の作られ方には 「ネットワーク内」のためのIGP( Interior Gateway Protocol ) と「 ネットワーク間」のためのEGP( Exterior Gateway Protocol ) があります 。
IGPとEGP
インターネットは 「 ネットワークの集合体」です。
ということは、ネットワークとネットワークが接続しているということになります。
ネットワーク同士で行われるルーティングと、ネットワーク内で行われるルーティングは全く別です。
ネットワーク間で行われるルーティングをEGP、ネットワーク内で行われるルーティングはIGPと呼ばれます(EGPという単語には二つの意味があり、BGPの前身プロトコルとしてのEGPもありますが、それは今回は割愛します ) 。
ネットワーク内で行われるルーティング手法であるIGPには様々な物があります。 日本国内ではOSPFと呼ばれる手法が多く利用されています。 例えば、OSPFでは、各ルータは「自分の隣にいる人」をネットワーク内の全てのルータに伝えます。
全てのルータが全ての隣接ルータを自己申告すれば、その情報から「完全な地図」が構築できます。
その「地図」を元に経路表が構築されていきます。
* OSPF の説明はかなり乱暴で厳密には間違っています。詳細を知りたい方は「OSPF」という単語で検索してみたり、本を読んでみたりして下さい。
特定の組織がコントロール可能な「ネットワーク内」と違い、「ネットワーク間」の接続は「全ての隣接ネットワークを全てに伝える」ような事はできません。
そのような方法では規模性が実現できません。 そのため、EGPはIGPとは異なる仕組みになっています。
次はEGPの代表的なプロトコルであるBGPを説明します。
「 代表的」というよりは、ほぼ「これしかない」に近いです。
BGP以外で運用されているという話は聞いた事がありません。
BGP ( Border Gateway Protocol )
組織内での利用になるIGPと異なり、EGPであるBGPは組織間を接続するのが一般的です。 組織内では「最も近い経路が良い」という選択肢が多くなりますが、組織間になると「お金」が絡んだり「政治」が絡んだりします。
BGPは、このような「ポリシー」を考慮した設定が可能なプロトコルです。
BGP はパスベクタ ー( Path Vector ) 型プロトコルと呼ばれています。 ネットワークを単位としたパスの列を指定して経路を計算します。 ここでの 「 ネットワーク 」 はAS ( Autonomous System , 自律システム ) と呼ばれるものです。 例えば 、ISP などが代表的 なASです。
AS には世界で一意（他の人と被らない）の番号が割り振られます。 割り振られた番号 はAS番号と呼ばれます。 AS 番号を割り振るの はNIC ( Network Information Center ) と呼ばれる組織で、地域毎に存在しています。 例えば、日本 のNICとしてはJPNICがあります。 JPNICが管理してい るAS番号と割当組織は「 JPNIC : AS 番号リスト」をご覧下さい。
BGPは通過するASの列で経路を表現します。例えば、192.0.2.0/24というネットワーク
が AS64496内にあったとき、AS64502が192.0.2.0/24宛のトラフィックを送信するには、AS
64500を通過してAS64496へという感じになります(番号は架空のものです ) 。
図では、 各ASを通過する毎にAS番号がネットワーク経路の先頭に追加されています。
このように、宛先ネットワークに対して通過するASの列が出来上がって行きます。 なお、以下の図のASは多数のノードが内部に存在するネットワークで、各ASであるAS64496,AS64500,AS64502,AS64498はそれぞれ別々のプロバイダだと思って下さい。
以前の例では、単純に数珠つなぎでしたが、普通はAS同士はもっと複雑な繋がりをしています。
以前の例を見ると、一見全てのAS
pathが転送されているように見えますが、実際にはそうではありません。 実際は、各ASはネットワークに対するベストパスを選択して、次のASへと知らせています。 例えば、以下の例では、AS64504がAS64505に伝える203.0.113.0/24へのAS
pathは一つだけです。
ただし、注 意
AS pathは、ベストパスを決定する際に最も良く使われる指標です。 しかし 、AS_PATH 以外の要素と合わせ て 「 AS path的には最短ではないパス」がベストパスとして選ばれることもあるのでご注意下さい。
AS_PATHの話だけだと、 「 経路制御って、LocalPreferenceやMEDを上げ下げして複数あるピア先から受け取った経路情報を自分たちの運用ポリシーに従って最適化して行く事だよね？」と突っ込みが入りそうですが、ここでは割愛させて下さい。。。
次へと続く ...
インターネットとルーティングとBGPに関して、非常に荒っぽくではありますが、解説してみました。
次からやっと2009年2月17日に発生した大規模経路障害の解説に入ります。

Any Grand Theft Auto game on the DS is going to be defined by the hardware , as Nintendo 's portable is the least - powerful system on the market .
It also sells amazingly well , moving 3 million units last December .
That 's a customer base that 's impossible to ignore , so Rockstar has decided to shoehorn its most popular series into the little money - making machine .
What 's surprising is just how good the result is and how much care went into the game 's design .
The motivation may have come from profits , but the execution is pure class .
Title Grand Theft Auto : Chinatown Wars Developer Rockstar Leeds in Association with Rockstar North Publisher Rockstar Games Price $ 34.99 Platform Nintendo DS
The game starts in the expected way : you 're a low - level thug who finds himself in way over his head dealing with the criminal underworld , so it 's time to carve out a place and get some respect .
In this case , you 're Huang Lee , and you were tasked with delivering your dead father 's sword to your uncle in Liberty City .
The game begins when things go violently wrong with that mission .
The biggest loss from Grand Theft Auto 4 has to be the animated cut-scenes and the incredible voice acting from that game ; in Chinatown Wars the story is moved forward via comic book cut - scenes , and sadly the written humor often falls flat without much context for people 's emotions .
Lee is somewhat loose with his mouth , and while that may have worked if handled a certain way in video , here it seems like his bosses are simply dense as they fail to react to sarcastic insults hurled their way .
This is the only spot where there is a dramatic drop in quality , however ; the rest of the game uses the hardware very well .
The game uses a top - down view of a 3D city , and you can do all the expected things such as steal cars , get into random fights , check your e-mail ... the sandbox aspect of the game is kept intact .
The gameplay does seem slightly sped up in a concession to the portable nature of the system , though .
You can run almost as fast as many cars can drive , and you can warp back to the beginning of a mission if you mess up in order to have another go at it .
The touchscreen is likewise used for a number of impressive minigames : cars will often have to be hotwired , you 'll have to deal with security systems in others , and buying scratch - off lottery tickets becomes an oddly compulsive activity .
In a neat touch , you also use the touchscreen to aim and control the force of your throw when lobbing molotov cocktails .
The touchscreen is used in many other ways I wo n't ruin here , but I 'll say this : all the different uses make sense , and do n't feel like they 're there for the sake of taking advantage of the technology ; they add to the immersion .
The missions are standard for Grand Theft Auto : you 'll be racing cars , you 'll be recruiting for the gang , and you 'll be killing people for money .
The story is appropriately twisty , and the police are always a threat , especially with the city 's security cameras keeping close watch for the drug deals that make up the game 's drug - running minigame .
You can take out the cameras while you speed around town trying to find the best price to both buy and sell a variety of narcotics , and this is an easy way to make some money if you want to put some time into it .
Getting rid of the cops has also been changed up ; now you can disable the cop cars by causing them to slam into buildings or simply ramming them in ways that feel like Burnout 's " Takedowns , " and this adds an aggressive and mean - spirited feel to the police chases .
It 's pretty great , and gives you a reason to fight back instead of just running .
In fact , if you have two stars or more , you have to disable the cruisers to escape .
The amount of content on the DS cart is stunning .
There are a ton of different cars , and they all handle differently and are good for certain jobs .
There are local WiFi multiplayer modes that allow you to race against others or simply play deathmatch games .
All of the different modes add a ton of replayability to the game , although there is no actual online play and you 'll need multiple copies of the game .
You can jump online to chat with friends after exchanging friend codes , or trade cash and weapons .
If you get bored with all of this , you can hijack certain cars for another set of missions , or simply grab a motorcycle or your favorite sports car and try to find all the stunt jumps hidden around the city .
You can tear apart the individual mechanics forever — including how well the PDA system is integrated into the game play — but the fact of the matter is Rockstar brought the feeling and quality of a console Grand Theft Auto title and made it work on the DS .
This is n't a cash - grab , and it 's certainly not a gimmick ; this is a portable version of a big - name title and it's pretty incredible .
From the opening scenes , to cruising around the city , to ordering guns to be delivered to your door ... you know what game you 're playing .
The missions are all over relatively quickly , and the frequent auto - saves make this game a portable feast .
Singh said in a phone interview he was planning to include bus timetables , a planner tool and information on service interruptions in the next version of the application , which is being bought by iPhone users at a rate of about 20 copies a day .
But Singh recently received a threatening email from RailCorp advising him that if he did not remove the application he would be sued for copyright infringement , as RailCorp owns all of its timetable information .
Singh said he did not have the resources to take on the Government in court and his legal advice suggested he would probably lose the case .
So he will most likely withdraw the application from the App Store .
" I 've asked them to send me a formal written cease and desist notice before I take it further , " he said .
" The argument they 've said is we are in the planning stages of getting our own application up there , but going by the Government 's past performances I do n't think we 'll see it any time soon . "
RailCorp would not comment on whether or not it was developing its own iPhone application .
" RailCorp 's primary concern is that our customers receive accurate , up - to - date timetable information , " a spokeswoman said in a statement .
" This includes details of service interruptions , special event services , trackwork and other changes .
Third - party RailCorp timetable applications may contain inaccuracies and have the potential to mislead our customers . "
Since Singh 's application is based on the fixed timetables provided on the RailCorp website , it does not account for service delays .
Singh said he was not looking to profit from the application and sold it only to cover his costs .
He said he would give the code to RailCorp for free if it wanted to build its own version .
" It 's in the public interest for them to have this out there and the argument they gave me was they plan to release their own one but they 've had two years to do it and they 're a corporation ; they 've got lots of people to do it , and I did it over a few weeks in the December break . "
The Victorian and Western Australian governments have been far less draconian when it comes to iPhone developers .
The Metro Melbourne , Metro Perth and iTT Perth applications have provided public transport timetable information for some time .
Google Maps offers transport timetables for Adelaide and Perth , but Google has not yet been able to secure the rights to provide the feature for other cities .
Limbaugh responds to the White House ’s reported strategy of turning him into the face of the GOP .
Rush challenges Obama to debate
Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh challenged President Barack Obama to a debate Wednesday in response to the White House ’s reported strategy of turning him into the face of the Republican Party .
“ If these guys are so impressed with themselves , and if they are so sure of their correctness , why does n't President Obama come on my show ?
We will do a one - on - one debate of ideas and policies , ” Limbaugh said on his radio program Wednesday .
“ So let 's have the debate !
I am offering President Obama to come on this program — without staffers , without a TelePrompTer , without note cards — to debate me on the issues . ”

POLITICO reported Wednesday on the Democratic effort to portray Limbaugh as the leader of the Republicans , an effort carried out by high - profile Democratic strategists like James Carville and Paul Begala .
Top White House officials , including chief of staff Rahm Emanuel , have joined in , and a senior White House aide is helping to guide the Limbaugh strategy , Politico reported .
Limbaugh equated the effort to the “ enemies list ” once maintained by former President Richard Nixon .
“ This is being led from the White House .
There is an orchestrated attack , daily drumbeat on me from the White House , ” Limbaugh said .
“ Your flunkies are demanding this debate , ” Limbaugh said to Obama .
“ Your flunkies are targeting a private citizen with an enemies list that so far has three or four names on it : Mine ; [ CNBC’s ]
Rick Santelli ; Jim Cramer at CNBC ; and let 's not forget Joe the Plumber , who your allies in Ohio also tried to destroy . ”
“ The difference is that Joe the Plumber does not have his own microphone every day .
They 're shutting Santelli up at CNBC .
They 're going to shut Cramer up pretty soon , too , but he 'll go down with a fight , ” Limbaugh said .
“ That is n't going to happen here , to me . ”
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs conceded Wednesday that engaging media personalities like Limbaugh and Santelli “ may be counterproductive . ”
“ Are there days where I just turn my television off ?
Yes , ” Gibbs said .
“ There are days when , yeah , you ’re head drops from listening to arguments that are n’t necessarily centered on delving into some important issue , but on finding two people on completely opposite ends of the spectrum to yell loudest . ”
For over twenty years , scientists have known that a normal protein in the brain , PrP , or prion protein , can turn harmful and cause deadly illnesses like Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease ( CJD ) in humans , and bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE ) in cattle .
What they could not explain is why large amounts of this normal protein are produced by our bodies in the first place .
Researchers from the University of Konstanz in Germany now reveal that PrP indeed plays a beneficial role for the organism – PrP helps cells communicate with one another during embryonic development .
In prion diseases , what transforms the normal PrP protein into a life - threatening substance is the abnormal alteration of its chemical structure .
Moreover , prions have the treacherous ability to replicate by imprinting their abnormal structure into healthy PrPs , thereby generating new pathogenic particles .
While this " conversion " process explains how prions are disseminated , " An abnormal function of the prion protein is considered to be one of the reasons for neuronal degeneration , " explains Dr. Edward Málaga - Trillo , leader of the study in Konstanz .
However , the normal function of PrP has remained an unsolved mystery for many years .
Until now , all previous experiments in genetically modified mice had failed to provide conclusive evidence , as these animals lacking PrP seemed perfectly healthy .
A dead end ?
By no means .
The scientists from Konstanz were able to show that the lack of PrP can cause clear physiological abnormalities in a living animal and the trick was to use the tiny zebrafish as a model .
When the researchers from Konstanz microinjected zebrafish eggs with morpholinos , DNA - like molecules that prevent the normal production of PrP , the treated zebrafish embryos were unable to develop normally and eventually died .
The proteins in the fish embryos normally found at cell - to - cell contact sites disappeared , rendering these cells unable to communicate and carry out the differentiation program that shapes the major structures of the body , including the nervous system .
" We were then able to prove that PrP serves as a glue element , bringing cells together and keeping them in contact , " explains co-author Dr. Gonzalo Solis , member of the team at the laboratory of Prof. Claudia Stürmer .
" When two neighboring cells make contact , they become able to exchange important signals that affect the function of a tissue in the body . "
Although the work by Málaga - Trillo , Solis , and colleagues does not offer an immediate cure for CJD or BSE , the team from Konstanz has fit together the first pieces of a complex puzzle , which may widen our understanding of prion diseases and provide hope for their effective treatment .
Mayflower has been described as a " sausage - dog horse "
A pony with short legs and a long body has caused numerous people to call the emergency services in the mistaken belief she is stuck in the mud .
Hampshire fire crews were last alerted on Tuesday as Mayflower was grazing by the River Test in Southampton .
An animal rescue expert said Mayflower seemed to be a cross between a Shetland and a New Forest pony , making her look like a " sausage - dog horse " .
Her owner is now considering erecting signs advising passers - by .
Rescue specialist Anton Phillips said Mayflower could appear to be stuck in mud as she was half the height of other nearby ponies .
" We have been called out several times for the animal now and it is getting a bit ridiculous .
" We are changing our mobilising policy for this particular area now and in future we will only send out an animal rescue specialist to evaluate the call - out before sending a full team out , " he said .
" These calls from the public are with good intent .
When viewed at long range , this pony looks like it is trapped , particularly if it is standing still next to its mates which are twice its height . "
A federal district court in Vermont has ruled that the Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination does not bar the government from requiring Sebastien Boucher , who faces charges of possessing child pornography , to decrypt his laptop hard drive .
A lower court had previously quashed a subpoena compelling Boucher to enter his password , reasoning that this was tantamount to requiring a defendant to testify against himself .
Boucher , a Canadian citizen who legally resides in the U.S. , was stopped while returning to the country in 2006 .
Immigration officials searched his laptop at the border , and found thousands of image files that a border agent judged , on the basis of their file names , to be probable adult and child pornography .
After viewing several images , border guards seized the laptop and shut it down — at which point Boucher 's Pretty Good Privacy encryption kicked in , locking down the Z drive on which the files were contained .
Federal prosecutors initially sought a grand jury subpoena ordering Boucher to provide the password that would allow them to decrypt his hard drive .
They later amended their request — presumably in hopes of avoiding Fifth Amendment concerns — clarifying that they would ask Boucher to enter the password himself in front of the grand jury .
Despite this , a magistrate judge ruled in 2007 that the act of entering the password , even if the password itself was not disclosed to the government , was " testimonial " and therefore could not be compelled without offending the Fifth Amendment .
The author of the 2007 opinion , Judge Jerome Niedermeier , distinguished the order to enter the password from the superficially similar requirement that a defendant produce the key to a locked safe on the grounds that asking for the password was a demand that Boucher reveal the contents of his mind .
Even though the password itself might not be incriminating , either disclosing or entering it would entail " implicit statements of fact , such as admitting that evidence exists , is authentic , or is within a suspect 's control . "
The government had sought to surmount Fifth Amendment barriers to its subpoena by stipulating that it would not use the fact of Boucher 's knowledge of the password against him — prosecutors had ample evidence linking him to the laptop already , after all , not least his own admissions to the border guards .
But Niedermeier would have none of it .
Citing the 2000 case U.S. v. Hubbell , which disallowed the use of documents showing tax fraud against a defendant who had been granted immunity for the act of producing them ( i.e. for demonstrating his knowledge of the documents ) .
" The testimonial aspect of the entry of the password , " wrote Niedermeier , " precludes the use of the files themselves as derivative of the compelled testimony . "
Niedermeier similarly rejected the argument that the existence and location of the files — as opposed to their precise contents — was already known to the government , a " foregone conclusion . "
Since the files themselves are ordinary physical evidence , lacking any special protection , the privilege against self - incrimination applies only to the extent that the " testimony " of entering the password gives the government new information .
" While the government has seen some of the files on drive Z , it has not viewed all or even most of them , " Niedermeier reasoned .
" While the government may know of the existence and location of the files it has previously viewed , it does not know of the existence of other files on drive Z that may contain incriminating material . "
On February 19 , however , Judge William Sessions reached a different conclusion .
Though he did not directly address Niedermeier 's Hubble analysis , Sessions accepted the " foregone conclusion " rationale , arguing that the lower court judge had erred in failing to distinguish between the contents of files on Boucher 's Z drive and their existence and location .
The distinction here is fairly subtle , but the crucial legal point appears to be the interpretation of the " reasonable particularity " requirement that applies when government demands the " testimonial " production of evidence .
Crudely put , the government can demand that you produce that bloody knife the police saw you run into the woods with , but they can't insist that you turn over any objects you may have around the house that would prove you guilty of a crime .
In one case , they 're just insisting that you provide the thing they intend to show the jury ; in the other , you 're supplying the information that helps them convict you .
Niedermeier reasoned that even if border guards had seen some of the files on the Z drive , prosecutors could not force Boucher to produce all the files on the drive .
For Sessions , by contrast , the government 's knowledge that it was after " the drive " constituted sufficient " particularity " that decrypting it merely gave prosecutors access to the specific contents of evidence they already knew about in reasonable detail .
It 's a fuzzy enough distinction that Boucher 's lawyers hope the next court up the ladder might land on the other side of it : they 've already filed notice of their intention to appeal .
There 's a bandwidth gap between the United States and the rest of the developed world that President Obama wants closed , and the feds are about to ask for help devising a plan to catch up to the Japans of the world .
Epicenter will make it easy for you to be heard .
The FCC announced Thursday that at its next open meeting , April 8 , it will discuss a notice of inquiry ( .pdf ) — essentially an open call for comment on what the government 's role , if any , should be in making the country richly wired and unwired .
From there the FCC will draw out a broadband road - map report — due to Congress in less than a year under the rules of the stimulus package .
From there , the money might really begin to flow .
The drive is part of Obama 's tech agenda , which calls for America to lead the world in internet access with " true broadband in every community in America [ and ] better use of the nation 's wireless spectrum . "
It 's a noble goal , but one that 's unlikely to happen without some change .
Broadband in Britain , Ireland , France , Japan and Korea is faster , cheaper and more popular than in the States .
That 's due to complicated regulatory , geographic , historical and economic issues .
Or , it 's because telecoms are greedy , it 's too risky to bet billions on fiber , or the government has n't funded needed infrastructure since the net went commercial in the early 1990s .
It depends on who you talk to .
One thing 's clear — something is likely to change in how the feds fund , tax and subsidize IP - based communications .
There 's already $ 8 billion or so set aside to fund rural broadband programs .
Here 's your chance to weigh in .
Epicenter will bundle up the best and most popular ideas and submit them to the FCC once it opens its calls for comments .
Submit and vote as much as you like , though you can only submit a new idea every 15 minutes .
Submit a Broadband Plan Sugggestion
While you can submit as many suggestions as you want , you can only submit one every 30 minutes .

The Pirate Bay is planning to launch a paid VPN service for users looking to cover their tracks when torrenting .
The new service will be called IPREDator , named after the Swedish Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive ( IPRED ) that will go into effect in April .
IPREDator is currently in private beta and is expected to go public next week for �5 per month .
IPREDator is clearly a response to the introduction of IPRED in Sweden , which will allow law enforcement and copyright holders to request the personal details of suspected infringers .
The copyright holders will then be able to make direct contact with the accused users and presumably threaten them with lawsuits .
If users connect to The Pirate Bay through something like Tor or VPN , however , they 're less likely to be tracked .
IPREDator 's website says that it wo n't store any traffic data , as its entire goal is to help people stay anonymous on the web .
Without any data to hand over , copyright owners wo n't be able to find individuals to target .
This , of course , is likely to irk law enforcement even further , as it has been on The Pirate Bay 's case for years .
Some three years after Swedish police raided the site and confiscated its servers , a few of The Pirate Bay admins finally went on trial for copyright infringement earlier this year .
The world is still awaiting the verdict ( expected to arrive on April 17 ) , though those behind The Pirate Bay maintain that what they 're doing is entirely legal .
In fact , Pirate Bay spokesperson Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi said during the trial that 80 percent of The Pirate Bay 's torrents are for content that 's legal to share online .
Still ,
The Pirate Bay is sensitive to the concerns of its users , especially with IPRED going into effect on April 1 .
The question remains , however , if any significant portion of The Pirate Bay 's users will decide to fork over � 5 per month solely to remain anonymous .
It seems more likely that the majority either wo n't care , or will simply start looking for lesser - known torrent trackers to use .
The World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Control launched an investigation into how live Avian Bird Flu viruses ( both H5N1 and H3N2 ) were accidentally mixed up with Bird Flu vaccines and shipped to 18 countries .
US - based Baxter International accidentally sent an “ experimental virus material , ” which mixed H3N2 seasonal flu viruses and unlabelled H5N1 viruses , to an Austrian research firm .
That company then shipped portions of the mixture to sub-contractors in the Czech Republic , Slovenia and Germany .
Czech researchers caught the error in early February when testing the shipment on ferrets .
The animals died from the inoculation , indicating a live Bird Flu virus .

CALGARY–Immigrants who can't speak English or French well enough should be denied citizenship , says a federal politician .
Canada needs to improve its efforts to integrate newcomers , Jason Kenney , minister of citizenship , immigration and multiculturalism , said Friday .
" I believe one area that we can ask immigrants in the country to make a greater effort ( in ) is that of language , " Kenney said in a speech to an immigration conference in Calgary .
" Last January I was in Delhi and sat in on a few immigration interviews .
I encountered one woman who has lived in Canada for 15 years and been a Canadian citizen for nearly 12 years , " he said .
" This woman was sponsoring a spouse to come to Canada but she could not conduct the interview with an official in either of our official languages .
It made me wonder – is this an isolated example ?
Regrettably I do n't think it 's isolated enough . "
Kenney later told reporters that immigration needs an overhaul and a key effort must be to ensure that immigrants and those who want to become new Canadians speak a competent level of French or English .
He said the requirement is already there but is n't being enforced strictly enough .
" In terms of the citizenship , if you can't complete the test in one of those two languages , you 're not supposed to become a citizen , which I do n't think is harsh , " he said .
" It 's just basically saying go back and study more and come back to us when you can get by in one of those languages . "
Kenney worries that granting citizenship without guaranteeing language skills puts a new Canadian at an economic and social disadvantage .
And he wants to know how some people who can't speak either of Canada 's official languages got through the system .
" All I can say is if someone can't conduct an immigration interview in English or French they do n't have basic competences .
" I have citizenship judges tell me that frequently people are given a pass even though they do n't have that ability . "
The NDP immigration critic , Toronto MP Olivia Chow , said language is important , but it should n't be the only criterion .
" If the government is saying if you 're not fluent in English or French then you can't be citizens , I have a real problem with that , " said Chow , who sat in on Kenney 's speech .
" My mother 's not very fluent in English but she makes a very good citizen .
She 's been in Canada since 1970 but she had to work in a hotel for many years to raise her family , even though she was a school teacher , " Chow said .
" Is it her fault her English is n't fluent ?
No .
Does she make a good citizen ?
Yes , I think so . "
Chow argues there should be subsidies available for immigrants so they can attend languages classes but not have to worry about missing work so they can feed their families .
A conference organizer chose her words carefully when reacting to Kenney 's speech .
" I think it probably raised a few eyebrows , " said Tracey Derwing , a professor of educational psychology at the University of Alberta .
Her area of expertise is how people learn second languages .
" The ( citizenship ) test is a multiple - choice test so people are expected to get 12 out of 20 questions right .
And if they 're not able to do it , then they 're interviewed by a judge and asked the questions orally , " she said .
" I do n't think it 's really possible in every instance for people to gain the language skills they need before coming from overseas .
" But the test does n't really assess what it takes to be a good citizen and a lot of people born in Canada could write that test and not do a very good job . "
Kenney also said he wants to find ways of recognizing an immigrant 's credentials in a more timely fashion .
He gave as an example the case of a Syrian obstetrician who has delivered " hundreds of babies , " but who has been working as a chambermaid for the last five years .
Motorcycle accidents have become pretty common in the country with several thousand people getting involved in motorcycle accidents each year .

Mr Brown said MPs must have the " highest standards " Prime Minister Gordon Brown has written to the chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life calling for a full review of MPs ' pay and allowances .
This must look at " outside interests " including second jobs , he added .
The letter follows the news that employment minister Tony McNulty could face a parliamentary investigation into his second home allowances .
It has emerged that he claimed £ 60,000 in expenses for a constituency house he shared with his parents .
But Labour MP
Mr McNulty has said he did not break any parliamentary rules .
In his letter to the committee 's chairman , Sir Christopher Kelly , Mr Brown calls for a wide - ranging review which would also look at MPs ' outside interests and second jobs .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The committee is already due to carry out an inquiry into the system of expenses and allowances .
This is likely to begin in the autumn , after the committee ruled out an inquiry in this parliamentary session .
But Mr Brown 's letter calls for this to be widened out to look at the " whole picture " , including MPs ' outside interests , pay and expenses .
The workings of Parliament " must be transparent , accountable and of the highest standards " , he adds .
Sir Christopher told the BBC : " When you have a system whereby individual MPs can claim that the things they 're doing are completely within the rules - and may well be within the rules .
" But where the public find that rule to be completely unintelligible from the point of view of normal standards ... that suggests that something is basically wrong with the system . "
Conservative Party chairman Eric Pickles said : " This is a typical trick from Gordon Brown .
SECOND HOMES ALLOWANCE
MPs can claim up to £ 24,006 this year Cannot be claimed by 25 inner London MPs Covers rent , mortgage interest payments or hotel expenses Can cover repair and utility bills , furnishings , insurance Includes £ 25 - a- night subsistence allowance , including food , for nights spent away from home
In 2006 / 7 , 23 of the 49 MPs representing outer London seats claimed the allowance
A guide to MPs ' pay and expenses Analysis : Reforms ahead ?
Full text : Brown 's letter " His last - minute conversion to an inquiry into MPs ' expenses has more to do with diverting attention from embarrassment about the expense claims of yet another of his ministers than any desire for real change .
" This is a case of too little too late from a prime minister who failed to ask the right questions about the activities of his own employment minister . "
Mr McNulty has claimed £ 60,000 since 2002 for the house in his Harrow constituency - 11 miles from the House of Commons - where his parents live .
He moved into his main home in Hammersmith in 2002 when he got married but continued to claim expenses on his Harrow house .
Breached ?
Tory MP Greg Hands has lodged an official complaint about Mr McNulty 's second home expenses claims .
He asked Parliament 's standards commissioner John Lyon to look into whether rules were breached .
Mr McNulty himself said the regulations should be looked into .
Map showing distance from Tony McNulty 's home to Westminster and his parents ' home for which he claimed expenses All MPs , apart from the 25 who represent inner London constituencies , can claim up to £ 24,000 a year in allowances towards the cost of staying away from home while on parliamentary business .
Mr McNulty said he made " considerable " use of the Harrow property and that it allowed him to do his job more effectively - but had stopped claiming the allowance in January because the fall in interest rates meant he could afford to pay the mortgage from his MP 's salary .
His spokesman has said the MP is " completely compliant with all the regulations around the allowances for second homes " .
A new system of expenses is due to come into force on 1 April .
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg , said : " We should get rid of this charade all together and stop any MPs living in commuting distance from claiming this allowance at all . "
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has defended claiming about £ 116,000 for her family home in the West Midlands after declaring her sister 's property in London - where she stayed four days a week - as her main residence .
She said the Commons authorities had approved her conduct .
The parliamentary standards watchdog has asked her to justify her arrangements .

In Trouble Journalists
In Trouble RFE / RL journalists take risks , face threats , and make sacrifices every day in an effort to gather the news .
Our new " Journalists In Trouble " web page recognizes their courage and conviction , and documents the high price that many have paid simply for doing their jobs .
An Iranian blogger , Omidreza Mirsayafi , has died in Tehran 's notorious Evin Prison .
His sister told RFE / RL's Radio Farda that the death of her 28 - year - old brother came under suspicious circumstances .
The media watchdog group Reporters Without Borders ( RSF ) said it was " deeply shocked " by the news and called for an investigation into the details of the tragedy .
According to RSF , Mirsayafi 's lawyer , Mohamed Ali Dadkhah , was told of his client 's death by a doctor , Hesem Firozi , who is himself in prison .
Mirsayafi mostly blogged about traditional Persian music and culture , not politics .
He had been summoned to Tehran 's Revolutionary Court for interrogation on February 7 .
At the end of the questioning , he was placed in detention .
"
The death of this young blogger is entirely due to a failure to provide assistance , ” Firozi said .
He said Mirsayafi had been despondent at the refusal of prison authorities to allow him to leave prison .
" I am worried , " Mirsayafi told RSF in a recent e-mail .
" The problem is not my sentence of two years in prison .
But I am a sensitive person .
I will not have the energy to live in prison .
I want everything to be like it was before .
I want to resume my normal life and continue my studies . ” Mirsayafi was first arrested in April 2008 .
He was released after 41 days in custody on payment of bail of some 72,000 euros .
He was tried in November under articles of Iran 's Criminal Code dealing with insults against the country 's leaders .
" I am a cultural and not a political blogger , " he told RSF after his conviction .
" Of all the articles I have posted online , only two or three were satirical .
I did not mean to insult anyone . "
Rails 2.3 Release Candidate 1 Released - What 's New ?
David Heinemeier Hansson has announced the release of Rails 2.3 Release Candidate 1 ( RC1 ) .
In a break from the usual rush from RC to a final release , David says that due to the substantial nature of this update this will probably be a " longer than average release candidate phase " in order to get as much testing done as possible .
So if you 're up for the challenge , try it out with this magical gem command :
gem install rails -- source http://gems.rubyonrails.org
Note : The Rails logo , used above , is CC Licensed from railslogo.com
Why Rails 2.3 Will Be A Big Deal
Rails typically has significant new features added on a point - by - point basis , but the number of new features in Rails 2.3 ( and the scope of their functionality ) is mindblowing :
Rails 2.3 is now based on Rack
Rails Metal ( thanks to the aforementioned Rack ) - Makes it easy for you to hook up very " bare " request handlers that are n't processed through the entire Rails stack .
Nested Model Forms -
It 's now trivial to create forms that create objects that are on associations with the current model .
Rails Templates - Create a Rails application in seconds using templates ( basic text scripts ) that install plugins , arrange files , set up source code management , and more .
Sessions are now lazy - loaded , so if you do n't want sessions enabled , do n't use them !
Engines
Improved local caching for all .
HTTP Digest authentication support
And , naturally , a lot more !
The release notes highlight all of the new features wonderfully .

Here in Seattle -- the town Bill O'Reilly derides as a " far left haven " -- one would think that a properly functioning free market would create offerings on local AM radio reflecting the political climate : generally liberal to middle of the road , with a few dedicated conservatives hanging in there .
But that 's not what we get .
We have three all - conservative talk stations in town .
The largest news station has a popular talk show featuring a right - winger and a fake centrist .
The other big news - talk station , KIRO , is supposed to be a pan-ideological station ; it features a popular centrist Democrat but also one of the most obnoxious right - wingers -- and no genuine liberals , having dumped David Goldstein awhile back .
And then we have a little Air America station that 's reasonably popular but only runs nationally syndicated material and does nothing locally .
I have friends in the Bay Area who tell me it 's not any better there .
( I 'm sure readers from there can fill us in down in the comments . )
And in Washington , D.C. , the owners are shutting down their progressive talk station in a population that 's decidedly Democratic .
It 's happening all over , and it's a problem , because these are the public airwaves , not just the private commodities that are radio stations -- which is why we have a Federal Communications Commission in the first place .
We need to talk seriously about reforming radio so that the public 's well - being is served on its airwaves .
Now , we 've had a little fun making fun of the right - wing paranoids for getting all worked up about this issue well in advance of it actually surfacing .
But now it is in fact surfacing : Sen. Debbie Stabenow earlier this week said she'd be interested in taking a look at reviving the Fairness Doctrine .
Predictably , it 's emerging now with a right - wing frame :
" Dems target right - wing radio " : More and more Democrats in Congress are calling for action that Republicans warn could muzzle right - wing talk radio .
Representative Maurice Hinchey , a Democrat from New York is the latest to say he wants to bring back the " Fairness Doctrine , " a federal regulation scrapped in 1987 that would require broadcasters to present opposing views on public issues .
" I think the Fairness Doctrine should be reinstated , " Hinchey told CNNRadio .
Hinchey says he could make it part of a bill he plans to introduce later this year overhauling radio and t-v ownership laws .
What Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity have been telling their audiences is that any talk about the Fairness Doctrine is actually about trying to " silence " them .
But of course , no one 's interested in " silencing " anyone on the right : all we 're talking about is creating a level playing field on the public airwaves so that a broad range of viewpoints can be heard instead of just one narrow bandwidth of ideology .
This notion , naturally , is what they fear most , since their ideas do n't compete well outside the vacuum they 've created .
Frankly , even though at one time I was a full advocate of simply reinstituting the Fairness Doctrine , I no longer believe that 's the wisest course .
For one thing , the Doctrine did n't actually achieve what it was supposed to do , which was making for a rounded and robust political conversation ; mostly it stifled it , in large part because it did n't address the structural defects involved .
The core problem is ownership : Radio station ownership in the past twenty years has been decidedly conservative .
And anyone who 's worked in media can tell you that ownership sets the tone and direction of what you do .
After the Fairness Doctrine was removed , these wealthy right - wing owners effectively proved right one of the fears that drove the creation of the Fairness Doctrine in the first place :
That the wealthy can and will dominate the political conversation on the public airwaves by simply buying up all the available space .
Since the wealthy in this country are overwhelmingly conservative , the end result was not only predictable , it was in fact predicted .
Liberal radio has withered on the vine not for the lack of demand , but for the lack of ownership dedicated to nurturing talent , promoting the product , and creating local outlets as well as national markets .
Still , one of the right 's favorite myths about the Fairness Doctrine has been that these stations failed because no one wanted to listen , as in this Fox report ( video above ) :
But Oklahoma Sen . James
Inhofe said radio programming should be based on what brings in listeners and advertisers .
" I can't think of anything worse than to have government in a position to dictate the content of information going over public radio , " said Inhofe , a Republican .
" The whole idea is that it has to be market driven .
We have a lot of progressive or liberal radio shows but nobody listens to them and every time one tries to get on , they are not successful . "
On the contrary , as Bill Press observes :
Unfortunately , what 's happening in Washington reflects what has happened in one city after another across the country .
In Miami , Clear Channel recently dumped progressive talk for sports : Clear Channel stations made the same move in San Diego and Cincinnati .
Sacramento abandoned progressive talk for gospel music .
In fact , according to a study released by the Center for American Progress and Free Press , there are nine hours of conservative talk for every one hour of progressive talk .
In fact , the only reason there 's not more competition on American airwaves is that the handful of companies that own most radio stations do everything they can to block it .
In many markets -- witness Philadelphia , Boston , Providence and Houston -- they join in providing no outlet for progressive talk .
In others , as in Washington , they limit it to a weak signal , spend zero dollars on promotion and soon pull the plug .
Companies are given a license to operate public airwaves -- free ! -- in order to make a profit , yes , but also , according to the terms of their FCC license , " to operate in the public interest and to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views of issues of public importance . "
Stations are not operating in the public interest when they offer only conservative talk .
For years , the Fairness Doctrine prevented such abuse by requiring licensed stations to carry a mix of opinion .
However , under pressure from conservatives , President Ronald Reagan 's Federal Communications Commission canceled the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 , insisting that in a free market , stations would automatically offer a balance in programming .
That experiment has failed .
There is no free market in talk radio today , only an exclusive , tightly held , conservative media conspiracy .
The few holders of broadcast licenses have made it clear they will not , on their own , serve the general public .
Maybe it 's time to bring back the Fairness Doctrine -- and bring competition back to talk radio in Washington and elsewhere .
Rather than bring back the Fairness Doctrine , though , it might be better simply to reform the structure of how FCC licenses are distributed and make diversity of ownership a priority .
That was the conclusion of a 2007 report from ThinkProgress that took a hard look at the issue and concluded that serious reform indeed was needed -- but that the Fairness Doctrine was not the way to go :
Along with other ideas , the report recommends that national radio ownership not be allowed to exceed 5 percent of the total number of AM and FM broadcast stations , and local ownership should not exceed more than 10 percent of the total commercial radio stations in a given market .
The full report [ pdf file ] is here .
We need to have robust , informed , and mature discussion about reforming radio and the use of the public airwaves .
Unfortunately , because of the wingnuttery of the right , that 's been all but impossible .
Perhaps we can start by framing this not as an attack on right - wing radio but on creating a level ideological playing field -- not driving out the right , but ending the dominance of right - wing wealth .
When it comes to the public airwaves , the people with the most money should not have all the megaphones .
The sharp fall in China ’s exports ( down 17.5 % y/y ) and imports ( down 43 % y/y ) should n’t have been a complete surprise .
Korean and Taiwanese exports are down far more than China ’s exports , in large part because of sharp falls in their exports to China .
And , given the intra-Asian supply chain , that has long augered bad news for China .
The Chinese New Year cut into China ’s January exports and imports .
After adjusting for this , China ’s exports are down , but not quite as much as the headline figure suggests .
But that , alas , likely implies further falls in the future .
Even if -- as Stephen Green highlights in his latest note -- " processing " exports ( i.e. exports with significant imported content ) are falling far faster than non-processing exports , it is a little hard for me to see how Korean and Taiwanese exports to China could be down 40 % if Chinese exports are only going to fall 5 - 10 % .
Historically , the correlations between Japanese , Korean and Taiwanese exports to China and China ’s exports to the world have been fairly tight .
Of course , China ’s exports now have more domestic content , so the correlation could change .
But I am worried .
Paul Swartz helped with the following chart :
The current downdraft is clearly far more than just an artifact of the seasonality in China ’s trade .
A rolling 3 m sum of China ’s exports and imports smooths out some of the volatility .
Exports and imports usually do fall in the first quarter -- but nothing like they are falling now .
The trough -- on a rolling 3 m basis -- usually comes in March , not January .
Yet we already know the this year ’s trough will be a lot lower than last year ’s trough .
What worries me the most ?
The possibility that the sharp y/y fall in imports does n’t just reflect a fall in imported components or a fall in commodity prices , but rather a major deceleration in China ’s domestic economy .
In some sense , it is hard to imagine a worse combination .
China ’s export are falling , making China understandably reluctant to allow its currency to appreciate .
But China ’s trade surplus is also rising ... certainly in nominal terms and quite possibly in real terms .
That is n’t good for the world .
At a time when the world is short demand , China seems to be subtracting from global demand not adding to it .
The best solution : an absolutely enormous domestic stimulus in China .
One last note : the PBoC ’s other foreign assets were unchanged in December .
That implies that China ’s reserve growth -- counting its hidden reserves -- was somewhat larger than I initially estimated and that hot money outflows were somewhat smaller .
The basic story though remains unchanged -- for the first time in a long time , reserve growth lagged the trade surplus , implying significant capital outflows .
After Obama praises torture ruling , civil liberties group appalled John Byrne
Published : Wednesday February 4 , 2009
Print This Email This ' Hope is flickering , ' ACLU declares The American Civil Liberties Union , which has generally been harshly critical of President George W. Bush and praiseworthy of President Barack Obama , has fired a torpedo across the Obama bow .
After the British High Court ruled that evidence of a British resident 's rendition and harsh interrogation at the Pentagon 's Guantanamo Bay prison must remain secret because of threats made by the Bush administration to halt intelligence sharing , the Obama Administration offered a terse statement seemingly expressing support to the BBC .
" The United States thanks the UK government for its continued commitment to protect sensitive national security information and preserve the long - standing intelligence sharing relationship that enables both countries to protect their citizens , " a spokesman said .
In response , the ACLU 's executive director , Anthony Romero , shot off a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asking the Obama Administration to clarify their position .
Romero also issued a sharply - worded three sentence statement to the press , saying Obama has now offered " more of the same . "
" Hope is flickering , " Romero said in a statement .
" The Obama administration 's position is not change .
It is more of the same .
This represents a complete turn - around and undermining of the restoration of the rule of law .
The new American administration should n't be complicit in hiding the abuses of its predecessors . "
The ACLU called on Clinton to " reject the Bush administration 's policy of using false claims of national security to avoid judicial review of controversial programs . "
Romero's letter to Clinton follows .

Re : Clarification Requested on Position of the United States on Blocking Disclosure by a British Court of Its Report on Allegations of Torture
Dear Secretary Clinton :
The American Civil Liberties Union strongly urges you to clarify the position of the United States on the publication of the full judgment in a lawsuit brought by a Guantanamo detainee , Binyam Mohamed , in a British court .
Earlier today , the High Court in Great Britain published a judgment denying publication of its report detailing allegations of torture .
The High Court stated that the United States had threatened that full publication of the court 's judgment would jeopardize intelligence cooperation between the two countries .
Remarkably , the court reported that the British government claimed the U.S. position had not changed , despite the inauguration of President Barack Obama .
We urgently request that you clarify the position of the United States in this matter .
Two of the British justices severely criticized the position of the United States in working to block publication of the judgment in the torture case .
Lord Justice Thomas and Justice Lloyd Jones stated today that : Indeed , we did not consider that a democracy [ the United States ] governed by the rule of law would expect a court in another democracy to suppress a summary of the evidence contained in reports by its own officials ... relevant to allegations of torture and cruel , inhumane , or degrading treatment , politically embarrassing though it might be .
We had no reason ... to anticipate there would be made a threat of the gravity of the kind made by the United States Government that it would reconsider its intelligence - sharing relationship , when all the considerations in relation to open justice pointed to us providing a limited but important summary of the reports .
The court 's opinion specifically stated that attorneys for British Foreign Secretary David Miliband told the court that the United States ' threat on the effect of publication on intelligence cooperation was continued by the United States , despite the inauguration of President Obama .
Specifically , the justices stated that , " it was submitted to us by Mr. David Rose that the situation had changed significantly following the election of President Obama who was avowedly determined to eschew torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment and to close Guantanamo Bay .
We have , however , been informed by counsel for the Foreign Secretary that the position has not changed . "
The claims made by the British justices that the United States continues to oppose publication of the judgment in the Binyam Mohamed case -- to the point of threatening the future of U.S. - British intelligence cooperation -- seems completely at odds with both the anti-torture and transparency executive orders signed by the President .
We strongly urge you to clarify the position of the United States and remove any threat related to the publication of the court 's full judgment .
Please let us know if you have any questions regarding this matter .
Sincerely ,
Anthony D. Romero
Executive Director
Caroline Fredrickson
Director , Washington Legislative Office

A mechanical engineer at Purdue University has one - upped the Segway guys with a hands - free scooter that uses the principles of tai chi , the ancient Chinese martial art , to keep you from falling on your face .
The Tai Chi Scooter ditches the Segway 's handlebars in favor of an optical encoder that monitors the angular displacement of the electric motor .
With nothing to wrap your hands around , riding the scooter requires focusing your mind and maintaining awareness of your center of balance – two fundamental elements of tai chi .
That 's not to say you 'll be pushing hands or doing a single whip on wheels .
" The reason it is called the Tai Chi Scooter is that the hands - free , remote control and large platform make it possible for tai chi poses , " said Henry Zhang , a professor who has practiced the martial art for seven years , in an interview with Wired.com .
But it makes sense to us .
With a top speed of 15 mph , you 'll either find the perfect inner balance of yin and yang , or you 'll fall off and break an arm .
Zhang and his students spent several months designing , wiring , coding and assembling the scooter , which he figures costs a few grand .
That 's a bargain compared to the first three Segways , which went for as much as $ 160,000 when they popped up on eBay .
In actuality , though , the scooter is nothing more than a box with wheels .
It 's turned on using remote control , but acceleration and turning are done strictly by shifting your weight or tai chi pose .
Turning is handled by the optical encoder , while sensors perceive the rider 's movements and direct the motor to slow down or accelerate accordingly .
Power comes from three 24 - volt , 40 - amp rechargeable batteries .
Do n't expect to see Woz playing polo on a Tai Chi Scooter anytime soon .
Zhang said it was developed strictly for educational purposes , and he has no intention of marketing it .

Return To Castle Intel
Last month , we took you deep into the hidden recesses of Intel ’s Hawthorn Farm facility , where the company ’s enthusiast motherboards are designed and refined .
On our way out of the building , we walked down a long hallway that ends with the metal detector gate one passes through when entering the building .
This hallway is lined with dozens of mounted , framed motherboards — a veritable walk - through museum documenting Intel ’s many years of motherboard innovation .
As tech enthusiasts , we tend to be amnesiacs .
There ’s just so much good stuff to focus on now , and even better stuff coming soon , that we forget where we ’ve been and the massive effort that went into moving through those stages .
Walking this hallway , we felt a bit like archeologists or perhaps sudden visitors to the Galapagos Islands , granted a rare glimpse at the sweep of natural evolution .
Some fits of creativity grew into the technologies we have today .
Others blossomed for a moment and died ingloriously .
At the end of our last visit , we got about half - way down this hallway , then stalled in our tracks .
After nearly two decades in the hardware business , it was impossible not to stop at each frame with a “ I remember that ! ” or a “ Oh , what was that called again ? ! ”
We wanted to stay for hours .
So on a return visit with a camera and tripod , we did .
Sure , we had to shoot the boards under poor lighting and through the high - glare glass of their frames , but it turned out well in the end .
What follows are our picks for the best dozen of the mobo brood , the ones that stood out as having exceptional historical significance .
We had a blast taking this walk down memory lane and rediscovering our roots .
Hopefully , you will , too .
I ’m Batman
For you trivia buffs , the original Batman TV series debuted in 1966 .
Twenty - seven years later , Intel delivered the “ Batman ” motherboard , the first commercial release from the company ’s motherboard group .
Prior to Batman , Intel had merely produced reference boards for major OEMs and MNCs ( multi- national corporations ) .
The trouble was that the CPU group would launch a chip but there were no motherboards on the market to support it .
Intel was stuck in a chicken - and - egg conundrum , and the best solution was to release both items together .
Marketing - speak for this is “ time to market , ” or TTM .
Batman was Intel ’s first TTM board , and it was meant to accelerate the adoption of Pentium .
Those rectangular chips near the CPU socket are cache , because L2 had yet to be integrated into the processor .
And the big , square chips ?
No , those are n’t part of the chipset .
They ’re for I/O .
Less Is ... Less
One thing you ’ll notice on the really old boards is that some of the SIMM slots closer to the board edge are angled 45 degrees .
This was due to chassis height restrictions for items like the hard drive or power supply .
The real nugget here is the “ OverDrive Ready ” stamp on the CPU socket ( Socket 4 ) , a feature so ancient that it stumped our first set of Intel engineers .
Socket 4 supported a 5V connection and only worked with the Pentium 60 and 66 chips .
Socket 5 ( 3.3V ) would later support the Pentium 75 to 133 and used staggered pin rows .
The Pentium OverDrive chip used a clock doubler to take the speed to 120 or 133 MHz on Socket 4 systems .
The net result was slower than a true 120 or 133 MHz product , but it was the poor man ’s answer to a system upgrade .
There were also OverDrive chips for Socket 5 , Pentium Pro , and , most famously , the 486 , which allowed a Pentium core to run on a 486 platform with somewhat hit and miss results .
Not Much I/O , Is There ?
In 1993 , Bill Clinton became President , CERN unleashed the World Wide Web , and motherboards integrated practically nothing .
That ’s right — the only I/O integrated on Batman is a couple of PS / 2 ports .
If you wanted to add audio , you could use one of those ISA buses for something like a Sound Blaster Pro .
That monster - sized Dallas DS1887 real - time clock could select between Motorola and Intel bus timing .
( Motorola timing ?
Chalk that one up to the round file of history . )
Plato Power
By September of 1994 , Intel was ready to bail on the 5V Pentium plan .
The Plato motherboard jumped to Socket 5 while preserving many of Batman ’s quirks .
You still only find PS / 2 on the back .
There ’s 256KB of cache mounted on the PCB — a laughable amount compared to the several megabytes now baked into modern CPUs — and the board could support system memory configurations up to 128 MB across two banks .
Plato supported Pentium 75 or 90 chips , and there was a jumper on the motherboard ( JP7 ) you had to set in order to enable the correct processor .
Gateway came out with an OEM version of Plato called Neptune , which just makes you wonder if someone in the company erroneously thought the name was Pluto and wanted to be one planet closer to Earth .
Lotsa Slots
The Plato motherboard was famous within Intel for being the first model to sell over one million units for the company .
It was also a sign of the times that boards should be loaded with as many slots as possible — five ISA and three PCI in this case .
Maximum expansion capability , summed up by the phrase “ slots and watts , ” was both a sign of coolness as well as a practical necessity since practically nothing was built into the board .
Not how close together the last PCI slot is to the ISA slot on the board ’s edge .
This was one of the first instances of a shared slot design , in which either slot could make use of one opening in the chassis ’s rear .
Other curiosities : Notice how there are no plastic walls around the floppy and hard disk headers on Plato , although there were on Batman ?
This is an odd step backward since it was all too easy to bend pins during cable attachment and removal .
Enough bending and you ’d snap a pin or two clean off .
And do you see that power connector between the fourth ISA and first PCI slots ?
Not even the oldest of the Intel old timers helping us could remember what that was for .
Bonus kudos to anyone who can solve the mystery in our feedback section .
Thor Strikes
By the beginning of 1996 , the industry was in clear need of a return to the simple form factors that made AT and Baby AT desktops so easy to work with , only without AT ’s legacy technologies .
Intel had released the first specification for ATX in 1995 , and Thor was the first Intel board to use the new form factor .
While ATX has been updated a few times , the form factor , along with its microATX derivative , still remains the dominant format used in PCs today .
Thor featured a maximum bus speed of 66 MHz for Socket 7 Pentiums and up to 128MB of Extended Data - Out ( EDO ) SIMM memory .
EDO marked a 10 % to 15 % improvement over the prior Fast Page Memory technology by allowing the memory controller to start a new column address instruction while concurrently reading a different address — multitasking .
Of course , this required support in the chipset , and Thor ’s Triton ( 430 FX ) core logic proved to be immensely popular and really established Intel as a leading chipset company .
Triton also supported PCI level 2.0 and pipelined burst cache .
You ’ll notice several blank spots on this Thor model .
That ’s because it was common for Intel , then as now , to produce reference designs that OEMs could then customize to taste .
Not everyone needed an extra ISA slot or additional on - board memory .
An Open Intel Platform ?
There are a lot of nifty tidbits on this board .
The Socket 7 design was novel , not only because it provided split rail voltage — what ?
over 10 years before AMD made a fuss about Barcelona ’s split rail power ? — but it was also backward compatible with Socket 5 CPUs .
Imagine that , a backward compatible CPU socket .
Better yet , Socket 7 worked with processors from AMD , Cyrix , IDT , and others .
True , friendly , open craziness .
No wonder it did n’t last .
And hey , believe it or not , those are Sony 32 - bit SRAM chips sitting alongside the CPU socket .
Let The Integration Begin
Looking behind the board , it ’s a little miracle -- the birth of motherboard integration .
Forget those Super I /O cards .
Now we have integrated serial , parallel , and game ports .
Remember 15 - pin game ports for joysticks ( support for these disappeared under Windows Vista ) ?
Under the game port , behold — three audio jacks fueled by a Crystal Semiconductor ASIC mounted under the third and fourth PCI slots .
In the bottom - right of the image below , you can also see the four - wire audio header for connecting to the CD - ROM so systems could play music discs .
Welcome To Seattle
You ’d think that our first Intel board code - named for a place might have been Santa Clara , Hillsboro , Portland , or some other major Intel location .
But no .
The first quarter of 1998 brought us Seattle , Intel ’s first board to make it to a 100 MHz front - side bus ( FSB ) .
This was also the company ’s time - to - market board for supporting the Pentium II launch .
Hmmm , where is that CPU socket ?
Oh , right — there was n’t one !
Instead , we had the Slot 1 design supporting processor cartridge packages often informally known as “ candy bars . ”
Launch speeds of the 100 MHz bus parts were 350 and 400 MHz .
Compared with Thor , you can see that Seattle is a cleaner board .
A lot of the extra and oversized chips are vanishing .
All of those real estate - sucking memory chips are gone , for instance , although 512KB of L2 cache is still on the motherboard , and large capacitors are starting to crop up like mushrooms around the CPU slot .
Note again that we have a shared PCI / ISA slot , this time second in from the far edge .
AGP Redux
Integration takes another hop on Seattle , this time in the form of a pair of USB ports , so new at this time that hardly any devices were available to use them .
The USB functionality derived from the PIIX4E southbridge controller .
Even more significant was the 440BX northbridge , which was the second from Intel to support Accelerated Graphics Port ( AGP ) .
The AGP slot is peeking out to the left of the Slot 1 interface .
Members of the European Parliament ( MEPs ) will push for a re-think of the balance between the need for security and the right to privacy on the Internet , not just in Europe but around the world , they agreed during a debate at the Parliament on Thursday .
They supported a report which calls on the 27 countries in the European Union and the European Commission , its executive body , to define global standards for data protection , security and freedom of expression .
The author of the report , Greek socialist MEP Stavros Lambrinidis , said the move is vital at a time when people 's digital identity is becoming an integral part of their actual identity .
One specific demand in the report is for a strict definition of a user 's " consent " to share his data , given the unequal balance of powers between users , private companies or governments .
Another is that the right of access to the Internet should be considered equal to the right to education , and should never be blocked by governments or private companies .
The report debated Thursday drew support from academics , civil liberties groups and Europe 's data protection supervisor Peter Hustinx , who warned against applying less strict data protection rules to the Internet than the protection expected in daily life .
Hustinx said the term ' cyberspace ' implied that the Internet is removed from real life , and that this was a very wrong impression .
" The Internet is increasingly an integral part of our daily life .
We must apply the same values as we do in our society ; fundamental rights must apply there , " he said .
Gus Hosein , a representative of the civil liberties pressure group Privacy International , was concerned that with the departure of George W Bush from the White House , Europe has become the standard - bearer for the security - obsessed , and he called for lawmakers in Europe to reverse a trend towards more security and fewer civil liberties in European lawmaking that began with the terrorist attacks on the U.S. in 2001 .
He referred specifically to the European data retention directive passed in the wake of terrorist attacks in Spain and the U.K. in 2005 , which forces Internet service providers and telecoms companies to hold on to data generated by their subscribers beyond the normal period required for billing purposes .
This view was backed by Professor Steve Peers of Essex University , who presented the key points of his study on strengthening security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet and E.U. policy on combating cyber -crime .
The report will be debated by the fully plenary of the European Parliament when it meets in Strasbourg at the end of this month .
PRESS RELEASE :
Ingolstadt , 2009-03-10
Annual Press Conference 2009
Audi Group : best - ever vehicle sales and revenue , plus record profit for fiscal year 2008
* 2008 fiscal year : total vehicles delivered 1,003,469 , revenue € 34,196 million , profit before tax € 3,177 million
* Audi boss Rupert Stadler : " Highest ever profit in the company 's history , amid a difficult market environment "
Despite the already noticeable effects of the financial crisis , Audi Group ended the 2008 fiscal year with yet more record - breaking figures for production , vehicle deliveries , revenue and profit : " With our 13th successive deliveries record , 2008 was the most successful fiscal year in the history of our company .
We have been steadily improving our productivity in recent years , and the main financial figures for 2008 reflect this .
These positive effects make it easier for us to respond appropriately to the crisis , " remarked Rupert Stadler , Chairman of the Board of Management of AUDI AG , at today 's Annual Press Conference in Ingolstadt .
" In the current year too we have succeeded so far in increasing our market share in the premium segment with an attractive model range , " added Stadler .
With deliveries of Audi brand vehicles up 4.1 percent to the record total of 1,003,469 automobiles , revenue for fiscal 2008 also reached a new all - time high of € 34,196 ( 33,617 ) * million , representing growth of 1.7 percent .
Operating profit improved by 2.5 percent to € 2,772 ( 2,705 ) million .
Net liquidity climbed by 18.2 percent to around € 9.3 ( 7.9 ) billion .
Profit before tax reached another all - time high of € 3,177 ( 2,915 ) million , representing growth of 9.0 percent .
Profit after tax was € 2,207 ( 1,692 ) million , a rise of 30.4 percent .
With a return on investment of 19.8 ( 18.6 ) percent , the Audi Group was also able to improve on another important ratio .
The disproportionately sharp rise in earnings compared with revenue is moreover reflected in the increase in the return on sales before tax from 8.7 to 9.3 percent .
" This figure means the Audi Group is now one of the most profitable players in the international automotive industry , a particular advantage in a year in which the repercussions of the financial crisis were already very noticeable , " explained Axel Strotbek , Member of the Board of Management for Finance and Organization at AUDI AG .
" These outstanding key figures – the best ever in the history of the company – provide Audi with a sound basis for funding capital investments in its ambitious model range from its own resources over the next few years , " emphasized Strotbek .
This success has been made possible by the newest and most attractive model range in the premium segment of the market .
The new Audi A4 , which also appeared on the market in an Avant body version in April 2008 , was particularly successful .
Other updated products such as the Audi A3 and A6 , as well as the brand new Audi Q5 , also contributed towards the rise in profit .
" We will continue in 2009 to invest heavily in new products , future - proof technologies and growth markets , " said Strotbek .
" We will counter the negative impacts of shrinking sales caused by the global economic crisis through consistent spending and investment discipline , and continuous process optimization , " explained Strotbek .
Record figures for deliveries in 59 markets
Audi delivered 1,003,469 ( 964,151 ) cars to customers in the past year .
Sales were thus 4.1 percent up on the previous year .
The outstanding vehicle deliveries figures also brought the brand record - breaking market shares in Western Europe and Germany .
In an overall market again characterized by falling sales , Audi delivered 258,111 ( 254,014 , up 1.6 percent ) cars to customers in Germany .
With a record market share of 8.1 percent in its crucial home market , the company achieved the best level in its history as a premium manufacturer .
Outside Germany , too , AUDI AG strengthened its position as a premium brand :
In Western Europe the brand with the four rings set another record for vehicle deliveries of 666,984 ( 650,407 , up 2.5 percent ) units .
Great Britain , the largest market in the region after Germany , grew to 101,522 cars ( 100,712 , up 0.8 percent ) .
Audi also achieved substantial growth in France .
The brand was able to deliver 51,200 vehicles to customers in its neighboring country ( 47,540 , up 7.7 percent ) .
The expanding market in Eastern Europe performed extremely well .
Vehicle deliveries in this region rose by 18.4 percent to 42,693 ( 36,073 ) automobiles .
The biggest single export market in 2008 was again China ( including Hong Kong ) , with 119,598 cars delivered ( 101,996 , up 17 percent ) .
This meant that the brand with the four rings easily defended its position as market leader in the premium segment in 2008 .
Its success is moreover regularly reflected in the satisfaction rankings .
In the J.D. Power customer satisfaction poll , the carmaker has enjoyed a top three place in China in each of the past five years .
The market performance in India , where Audi started up CKD assembly operations at the end of 2007 , was also very positive .
Deliveries to customers there tripled to 1,050 ( 349 ) cars .
In the United States , on the other hand , the number of vehicles delivered to customers fell to 87,760 ( 93,506 , down 6.1 percent ) automobiles in a sharply contracting market .
By contrast , the brand 's share of the premium market grew to 7.1 ( 6.2 ) percent .
The subsidiary Lamborghini increased deliveries of its supercars to 2,430 ( 2,406 , up 1.0 percent ) in the past fiscal year .
Record levels of car production
The Audi Group built 1,029,041 cars ( including Lamborghini ) .
This represented a new production record for Audi ( 980,880 , up 4.9 percent ) .
The Ingolstadt and Neckarsulm locations accounted for around 83 percent of total car output .
Engine production within the Audi Group dipped slightly to 1,901,760 units ( 1,915,633 , down 0.7 percent ) .
Consolidating growth , retaining the core workforce
Audi invests around € 2 billion each year , largely in new products .
It is continuing with its model initiative as planned .
Over the next seven years the car manufacturer will be increasing its vehicle range from the current 28 models to 40 .
Nor does the Group see any reason to revise its growth targets .
" We are standing by our existing goals .
Audi has the potential to secure yet further growth by launching new model series , and also by working in existing markets more effectively .
The new A1 , which is set to diversify into a separate family of models , will help us achieve precisely that , " remarked Stadler .
AUDI AG is again passing on a share of the company 's success to all employees this year .
The profit share to be paid out in 2009 will average around € 5,300 per employee .
" Dedicated , highly qualified employees are the basis for Audi 's future success .
That is why , unlike our competitors , we will not be imposing a freeze on recruitment in 2009 .
We will be looking for up to 300 new experts , mainly engineers , and are convinced that this counter - cyclical approach will pay dividends in the future , " explained Stadler .
As well as maintaining apprenticeship places at the recent years ' high level of around 700 , Audi will be recruiting an extra 40 apprentices in 2009 .
The number of employees within the Audi Group rose to an annual average of 57,533 ( 53,347 ) .
Of these , 46,089 ( 44,698 ) were employed at AUDI AG , including 32,603 ( 31,369 ) at Ingolstadt and 13,486 ( 13,329 ) at Neckarsulm .
With 2,181 apprentices in 20 different trades , AUDI AG has maintained the number of those in training at the German plants at the previous year 's high level .
Outlook for 2009 : new products for an increased market share
Audi , too , is feeling the consequences of the economic crisis in the current year .
" We are responding flexibly and proportionately to changes in the volume of orders and adjusting production at short notice in order to keep stock levels down , " explained Stadler .
He also made it clear that Audi would carefully assess all investments and costs that are not product - related , and prioritize .
" The 17 new models we launched last year were only possible thanks to the incredible dedication of our workforce , " emphasized Dr. Werner Widuckel , Member of the Board of Management for Human Resources at AUDI AG .
The company is using its entire battery of human resources measures to protect jobs and offer bright employment prospects for the future .
Human resources and production turntables between the plants have long been successfully used as a means of utilizing the capacity at the two locations as evenly as possible .
" The market may be in crisis , but Audi is not .
We are using short - time working to protect the jobs of our core workforce .
And we stand by the ' Audi's Future ' agreement , which rules out any redundancies before 2011 , " added Widuckel .
According to provisional figures , Audi increased its market share in Western Europe to 4.9 percent ( 4.0 percent ) in the period January through February .
The market share in Italy rose to 3.6 percent ( 2.5 percent ) , in Spain to 4.8 percent ( 3.0 percent ) and in France to 2.4 percent ( 2.1 percent ) .
Even in the deeply depressed U.S. market , the brand with the four rings succeeded in boosting its market share in the premium segment to 7.1 percent ( 6.3 percent ) .
From January to February 2009 , the Audi brand sold 119,600 cars worldwide , 20.3 percent fewer than in the prior - year period .
Efficiency and low emissions are and remain a top priority for Audi .
" We will not be watering down our efficiency strategy .
One of the next key moves will for instance be the gradual rollout of start / stop systems .
We kicked off this process with the recently unveiled A5 Cabriolet , which will be arriving at dealers in a matter of weeks , " promised Stadler .
In the areas of engines , transmissions , aerodynamics and electronic components , too , Audi will be making further optimizations and building on its position as the pioneer of lightweight construction .
Diesel technology will likewise remain a vital cornerstone of Audi 's efficiency strategy .
" This year we will launch the cleanest diesel engine in the world – we call it the ' TDI clean diesel ' – in the Audi Q7 3.0 TDI , " declared Stadler .
This system will reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by up to 90 percent .
The Audi Q7 3.0 TDI consequently already complies with the limits of the Euro 6 standard due to take effect in 2014 .
" This engine is impressive proof of just how much potential the diesel engine still offers , " says Stadler .
2010 will see the arrival of a premium compact car in the guise of the Audi A1 , with which Audi will be venturing into a new segment .
" The response to the A1 studies shown at Tokyo in 2007 and Paris in 2008 was very encouraging .
The A1 will enable us to tap into a new , attractive target group .
With its typical Audi DNA , this car will round off our model range at the lower end and boost the appeal of the Audi brand particularly among younger customers , " explained Audi boss Rupert Stadler .

Intel on Monday detailed plans to push its
Atom processors into devices beyond just netbooks and mobile Internet devices .
The company introduced four Atom chips that will go into devices such as entertainment systems for cars , videoconferencing devices , robots and interactive kiosks , said Doug Davis , vice president of Intel 's digital enterprise group .
These ultra -low - power chips can offer the rich multimedia performance and high - bandwidth Internet connectivity demanded by those devices , Davis said .
The Z500 - series Atom processors are integrated chips the size of a penny that draw little power and do not require fans to operate .
The chips draw 2.5 watts of power or less and run at speeds of between 1.10 GHz and 1.6GHz .
The chips offer integrated 2D and 3D graphics and will be manufactured using Intel 's existing 45 - nanometer process .
Atom chips to date have gone into low - cost laptops , also known as netbooks , and devices such as mobile Internet devices ( MIDs ) and smartphones .
Intel has said it wants to integrate more capabilities into Atom processors that could help the company enter new markets .
With the new chips , Intel is ramping up efforts to dive into an embedded space dominated by chips made with Arm designs , said Nathan Brookwood , principal analyst at Insight64 .
" Now that they have their Atom processor in good shape , they are looking for new places where they can ship it , " Brookwood said .
Some new markets being targeted by Intel with the new chips include entertainment systems in cars and desktop videophones .
For example , the new Atom Z520 PT powers an in - car infotainment system that can run video without compromising on performance , Davis said .
Intel and OpenPeak also provided a reference design for a touch - screen videoconferencing phone embedded with a low - power Atom chip .
Resembling a blown - up mobile Internet device , the OpenFrame home IP ( Internet Protocol ) phone design from OpenPeak also runs Internet - based video and social - networking applications , Davis said .
As part of the announcement , Intel also said Microsoft automotive applications would work with Intel 's embedded Atom chips .
Microsoft 's auto division provides a software toolkit for developers to write in - car applications that include navigation and hands - free calling .
The new chips will be available in commercial quantities in the second quarter of this year .
Pricing information was not immediately available .
Intel has taken a number of steps to develop integrated chips that could fit into devices such as set - top boxes and TVs .
The chip maker in February said it was hurrying up the move to the new 32 - nanometer process technology to produce faster and more integrated chips .
To that effect , the company said it would spend US $ 7 billion over two years to revamp manufacturing plants .
The 32 - nanometer process will also help Intel make more chips at lower costs and add efficiencies to the production process .
Intel will begin producing chips with 32 - nm circuitry starting in late 2009 .
Intel may also be looking for outside help to develop custom Atom chips for embedded devices .
Earlier on Monday , Intel entered a partnership to share the Atom chip designs with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing .
TSMC customers will have access to the Atom intellectual property to develop customized chips .
The partnership with TSMC could result in the development of customized chips for Intel to access new markets it can't reach alone , Brookwood said .
If you needed customized GPS ( Global Positioning System ) or graphics technology on the chip , for example , you could n't do it , as Intel does n't provide the building blocks to do so , Brookwood said .
The deal with TSMC makes that level of Atom chip customization possible , he said .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Tuesday he wanted to work with Russia to resolve a nuclear stand - off with Iran but denied reports he had offered to slow deployment of a missile defense shield in exchange for Moscow ’s help .
The New York Times reported that Obama had sent a letter to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev suggesting he would back off deploying a system in eastern Europe to intercept and destroy missiles , a move Russia sees as a military threat , if Moscow helped stop Iran from developing long - range weapons .
“ What I said in the letter is what I have said publicly , which is that the missile defense that we have talked about deploying is directed toward , not Russia , but Iran , ” Obama said after meeting British Prime Minister Gordon Brown .
“ And what I said ... was that , obviously , to the extent that we are lessening Iran ’s commitment to nuclear weapons , then that reduces the pressure for , or the need for a missile defense system , ” he said .
Obama ’s defense secretary , Robert Gates , said Washington wanted to reopen dialogue with Moscow on Iran .
There were two options , he said -- to work together to persuade Iran not to go ahead with their ballistic missile program , or make Russia a “ full partner ” in the defense shield .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs stressed the linkage between the missile shield and Iran at a White House briefing .
“ If working with our allies and working with Russia we can eliminate the threat , then you eliminate the driving force behind that system to combat that threat , ” .
Moscow , which plans to start up a nuclear reactor at Iran ’s Bushehr plant by the end of the year , has used its veto in the United Nations Security Council on a number of occasions to water down or defeat U.S. - led efforts to impose tougher sanctions on Iran .
The Obama administration has said it wants to “ reset ” U.S. - Russian ties , which deteriorated under former U.S. President George W. Bush and then Russian President Vladimir Putin , partly because of the plans to deploy the shield .
MOSCOW WILLING TO TALK
Putin ’s successor , Medvedev , told a news conference that Moscow was willing to talk to Washington about the shield but that it saw Iran ’s nuclear program as a separate issue .
“ If the new ( U.S. ) administration shows common sense and offers a new ( missile defense ) structure which would satisfy European ( needs ) ... and would be acceptable for us , we are ready to discuss it , ” Medvedev said on a visit to Madrid .
“ If we are talking about any ‘ swaps ’ ( Iran for missile defense ) this is not how the question is being put .
This would not be productive , ” he said .

U.S. officials have said the United States will go ahead with the planned deployment of the missile shield in eastern Europe , but only if it is shown to work and is cost - effective .
The plan to site missiles and a radar tracking station in former Communist satellite states Poland and the Czech Republic has angered Moscow , which sees it as a threat , despite U.S. insistence that it is aimed at rogue missiles from Iran .
The United States and some European nations fear Iran is trying to build atomic weapons and are concerned at its development of ballistic rockets that could be used to carry any nuclear warheads great distances .
Tehran insists its pursuit of a nuclear capability is purely for the peaceful generation of electricity .
Obama has said he is prepared to offer Iran economic incentives if it abandons its nuclear program but he has also warned of tougher economic sanctions if it pushes ahead .
The United States and five other powers , Britain , France , Germany , Russia and China , said on Tuesday they were committed to direct talks with Iran , a switch from Bush ’s policy of trying to isolate the Islamic Republic .
On Capitol Hill , a key Republican said Obama should consider engaging Iran more directly .
“ Among other steps , the possibility of establishing a U.S. visa office or some similar diplomatic presence in Iran should be on the table , ” said Indiana Senator Richard Lugar , the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
Shocking footage shot by police , accompanied by their own critical commentary , shows how their officers monitored campaigners and the media – and demanded personal information – at last August 's climate camp demonstration in Kent guardian.co.uk / Jason N. Parkinson
Police are targeting thousands of political campaigners in surveillance operations and storing their details on a database for at least seven years , an investigation by the Guardian can reveal .
Photographs , names and video ­footage of people attending protests are ­routinely obtained by surveillance units and stored on an " intelligence system " .
The ­Metropolitan police , which has ­pioneered surveillance at demonstrations and advises other forces on the tactic , stores details of protesters on Crimint , the general database used daily by all police staff to catalogue criminal intelligence .
It lists campaigners by name , allowing police to search which demonstrations or political meetings individuals have attended .
Disclosures through the Freedom of Information Act , court testimony , an interview with a senior Met officer and police surveillance footage obtained by the Guardian have ­established that ­private information about activists ­gathered through surveillance is being stored without the knowledge of the people monitored .
Police surveillance teams are also ­targeting journalists who cover demonstrations , and are believed to have ­monitored members of the press during at least eight protests over the last year .
The Guardian has found :
• Activists " seen on a regular basis " as well as those deemed on the " periphery " of demonstrations are included on the police databases , regardless of whether they have been convicted or arrested .
• Names , political associations and photographs of protesters from across the political spectrum – from campaigners against the third runway at Heathrow to anti-war activists – are catalogued .
• Police forces are exchanging information about pro­testers stored on their intelligence systems , enabling officers from different forces to search which political events an individual has attended .
Lawyers said tonight they expect the Guardian 's investigation to form the basis of a legal challenge against the use of police surveillance tactics .
Liberty , the human rights group , is challenging the police surveillance tactics in a judicial review at the court of appeal .
But police appear not to have disclosed to the court that they were transferring private details of campaigners to a database .
Corinna Ferguson , Liberty 's legal officer , said : " A searchable database containing photographs of people who are not even suspected of criminal activity may well violate privacy rights under article 8 of the Human Rights Act .
It is particularly worrying if peaceful protesters are being singled out for surveillance . "
Police surveillance footage from the climate camp demonstration in Kent last August , obtained by the Guardian , reveals how journalists are monitored as well as the often clumsy nature of the ­surveillance .
It shows police are interested in the names , clothing , whereabouts , and personal details of protesters and journalists .
Three members of an ITV news crew , a Sky News cameraman and several photo­graphers were among members of the press monitored as they left the camp .
Later in the day journalists at a protest against the Kingsnorth coal - fired power station , were followed by ­surveillance officers to a McDonald 's restaurant .
Police filmed them as they used the restaurant 's Wi-Fi ­connection to file their material .
Kent police have already apologised after official complaints about the incident and intrusive stop and searches of journalists covering the demonstration .
The National Union of Journalists has been assured ­that members of the press were not being ­targeted after it took concerns to the Home Office and senior police ­officers .
The union documented at least eight ­protests since last March where its ­members were " routinely " photographed and filmed by police .
Several journalists said police officers they had never met knew their names .
" We have put this to police and the Home Office several times but they have always denied the practice or sought to avoid answering the question , " said Jeremy Dear , the union 's general secretary .
" With this evidence there is no credibility in doing so any longer . "
Police have not disclosed the number of activists on the database .
But court testimony by surveillance officers has confirmed the existence of a large intelligence system which , according to one officer , contains " thousands " of campaigners .
Overt surveillance by police forward intelligence teams ( Fits ) or evidence ­gatherers ( EGs ) is designed to record potential criminal activity and gather ­useful intelligence .
Pioneered by the Met 's public order branch in the late 1990s , the technique is used regularly across the country .
Surveillance officers use ­" spotter cards " to identify activists .
Police have always denied surveillance is conducted for the purposes of storing information on a database .
Information released by Scotland Yard under the Freedom of Information
Act has revealed that while raw surveillance material is stored in a warehouse , material on certain individuals " is added to a corporate intelligence database " .
Scotland Yard 's disclosure , in response to questions from NUJ lawyers , stated " generally , records are retained for seven years " .
Superintendent David Hartshorn , from the Met 's public order branch , conceded law - abiding campaigners were being added to the database .
He said individuals on the system included people convicted or suspected of public order offences .
But he added " people we have seen on a regular basis involved but may not have been charged or arrested " were also stored on the database .
He added that the data was reviewed every year .
" In relation to what we can keep on databases , we are governed quite strictly on that .
Obviously you 've got the Data Protection
Act but also , in terms of intelligence , we have to justify what we are able to keep . "
A stowaway bat is seen clinging to the external tank of the space shuttle Discovery at Launch Pad 39A during a March 15 , 2009 launch countdown .
CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla . -
A small bat appears to be trying tohitch a ride aboard the space shuttle Discovery from its perch on the spacecraft ?
sattached external tank as NASA counts down to a planned Sunday evening launch .
Mission managers said the tank - clinging fruit bat is unlikely topose a risk for the shuttle , and will probably fly away when Discoveryblasts off this evening at 7:43 p.m. EDT ( 2343 GMT ) from Pad 39A hereat NASA 's Kennedy Space Center .
" It 's not expected to be a debris problem , " NASA spokesmanMike Curie told SPACE.com .
The bat is between one quarter and one thirdof the way up on the north side of the shuttle 's huge orange external fueltank , which is the side that faces away from the orbiter .
It could be seen in aNASA camera view caughtby collectSPACE.com , a SPACE.com partner .
It was first noticed this morning while the fuel tank was being filledwith its super - chilled liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant .
NASA doesnot think the bat has frozen in place , though , because the tank 's surfacetemperature is between 58 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit at the bat 's location .
This is n't the first time a bat has taken up position on a shuttle ' sfuel tank on launch day .
" On STS - 72 there was a bat , but it flew away during launch , " Curie said , referring to the 1996 flight of the shuttle Endeavour .
That bat didnot harm the shuttle at all .
Birds and bats canpose a hazard to space shuttles if they impact and damage an orbiter ' ssensitive heat shield tiling .
This thermal coating protects the shuttle fromburning up in Earth 's atmosphere when it re-enters .
In 2005 , a large turkey vulture ran into the back of the space shuttleDiscovery 's external tank .
Luckily , this impact did n't harm the shuttle , whichwas on the opposite side of the tank .
Ever since , NASA launch officials useradar to track flocks of birds during a launch .
NASA also fires loud canons toscare away birds when the shuttle is heading in to touch down on the longlanding strip at Kennedy Space Center .
Discovery is poised to delivernew solar arrays and a new station crewmember to the International SpaceStation .
Commander Lee Archambault will lead the seven - member STS - 119 crew on the planned 13 - day mission .
Discovery is also ferrying Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata to the space station , where he will replace NASA astronaut Sandra Magnus as a member of the outpost 's three - person crew .
Coincidentally , Wakata - Japan 's first long - duration astronaut - was also part of the STS - 72 crew aboard Endeavour when the last bat tried to hitch a ride into space .

The MPAA 's " no homo " rule strikes again !
Sascha Baron Cohen 's new mockumentary Bruno , in which he terrorizes straight men with flagrant gayness , has earned an NC - 17 , partly because of a scene depicting buttsex .
The Wrap reports that the film — in which Baron Cohen plays gay Austrian fashion correspondent Bruno who talks about doing ickies with other men — got the basically - banned - from - theaters rating because , in part , the character " appears to have anal sex with a man on camera .
In another , the actor goes on a hunting trip and sneaks naked into the tent of one of the fellow hunters , an unsuspecting non-actor . "
Baron Cohen 's previous outing with Universal , Borat , initially earned an NC - 17 as well , but was re-edited and got its coveted R .
That film had a famous naked men wrestling sequence , though it was n't as overtly homocentric as Bruno butt fucking or going on a talk show to discuss same - sex parenting , adopted black baby in tow .
The notoriously homo and dick - phobic ratings board just can't abide that .
Baron Cohen has appealed and the film will go back to the editing room to try and come up with a more palatable version .
Meanwhile the gratuitous tits of a movie not trying to say anything at all except " Straight men !
Whoo ! " like the abysmal College sail comfortably under the radar .
Boys will be boys , not do them .

Gefährliche Tauchfahrt Atom - U- Boote im Atlantik zusammengestoßen
Sie sind mit modernster Waffentechnik ausgestattet , können mit bis zu 16 Atomsprengköpfen bestückt werden - und stießen mitten auf hoher See zusammen : Im Atlantik sind zwei U - Boote aus Frankreich und Großbritannien kollidiert .
Researchers at Purdue University have developed a technique using spun-sugar filaments to create a scaffold of tiny synthetic tubes that might serve as conduits to regenerate nerves severed in accidents or blood vessels damaged by disease .
The sugar filaments are coated with a corn- based degradable polymer , and then the sugar is dissolved in water , leaving behind bundles of hollow polymer tubes that mimic those found in nerves , said Riyi Shi , an associate professor in Purdue 's Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Basic Medical Sciences .
The scaffold could be used to promote nerve regeneration by acting as a bridge placed between the ends of severed nerves , said biomedical engineering doctoral student Jianming Li , who is a member of Shi 's research team that developed the technique .
The researchers are initially concentrating on the peripheral nerves found in the limbs and throughout the body because nerve regeneration is more complex in the spinal cord .
About 800,000 peripheral nerve injuries are reported annually in the United States , with about 50,000 requiring surgery .
The approach also might have applications in repairing blood vessels damaged by trauma and disease such as atherosclerosis and diabetes , Shi said .
The new approach represents a potential alternative to the conventional surgical treatment , which uses a nerve " autograft " taken from the leg or other part of the body to repair the injured nerves .
Researchers are trying to develop artificial scaffolds to replace the autografts because removing the donor nerve causes a lack of sensation in the portion of the body where it was removed .
advertisement
" The autograft is the lesser of two evils because you have to sacrifice a healthy nerve to repair a damaged segment , " said Li , who led the research .
New findings were published online in December and this month in the print edition of the journal Langmuir .
The paper was written by Li , biomedical engineering doctoral student Todd A. Rickett and Shi. Rickett also is attending the Indiana University School of Medicine in an MD - Ph.D. program .
Researchers from Cornell University published similar findings online Feb. 9 in the journal Soft Matter .
Those findings focused on using the technique to create vascular networks for providing blood and nutrients to tissues and grafts .
The synthetic scaffold resembles the structural assembly of natural nerves , which are made of thousands of small tubes bundled together .
These tubes act as sheaths that house the conducting elements of the nerve cell .
The first step in making the tubes is to spin sugar fibers from melted sucrose .
advertisement
" It 's basically like making cotton candy , " Li said .
The sugar filaments were coated with a polymer called poly L - lactic acid .
After the filaments were dissolved , hollow tubes of the polymer remained .
The researchers then grew nerve - insulating cells called Schwann cells on these polymer tubes .
These cells automatically aligned lengthwise along the tubes , as did nerve cells grown on top of the Schwann cells .
This alignment is critical for the fast growth of nerves , Shi said .
Nerve cells grew not only inside the hollow tubes but also around the outside of the tubes .
" This finding is important because the increased surface area may accelerate the regeneration process following an accident , " Li said .
The scaffolds are designed specifically to regenerate a portion of a nerve cell called the axon , a long fiber attached to the cell body that transmits signals .
Fast regeneration is essential to prevent the atrophy of muscles and organs connected to severed nerves .
The researchers also discovered that the polymer tubes contain pores that are ideal for supplying nutrients to growing nerve cells and removing waste products from the cells .
Images of the polymer - coated sugar strands were taken using a scanning electron microscope .
Another instrument , called an atomic force microscope , was used to obtain images of the hollow tubes and pores in the walls of the tubules .
Other images using fluorescent dyes revealed the nerve cell alignment along the tubes .
The work was done using cell cultures in petri dishes , but ongoing work focuses on implanting the scaffolds in animals .
The method for creating the scaffolds is relatively simple and inexpensive and does not require elaborate laboratory equipment , Shi said .
" This is low - tech , " he said .
" We used the same kind of sugar found in candy and a cheap polymer to make samples of these scaffolds for a few dollars .
The process easily lends itself to mass production .
It is a unique idea , and the simplicity and efficiency of this technology distinguish it from other approaches for nerve repair . "
A provisional patent application on the material has been filed .
This study was conducted at Purdue 's Center for Paralysis Research , which receives funding support from the state of Indiana .
Shi's lab is supported by both the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation .
Li was supported by the NSF 's Graduate Teaching Fellows in K - 12 Education Program , which strives to help graduate students bring their research and practice into the K - 12 classrooms and inspire students to pursue careers in science and engineering .
Li used knowledge gained in the laboratory to teach middle school students and worked on curriculum development .
Rickett is supported through the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute , which funds research on developing new technologies into effective medical therapies .
Dangerous designs
Programming language specifications often start with a design philosophy .
Of all those I have read , I like that of the Scheme language most .
You can read it in the introduction of Scheme standard , where it is stated as a single line :
Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature , but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary .
The argument is that , using a very small number of rules for forming expressions and with a minimal syntax it is possible to support all possible programming paradigms .
For instance , if the language has support for higher - order functions , closures and dynamic typing , we can implement object oriented programming without special language level syntactic support .
Tail - call optimization elude the need for special looping constructs .
But this ideology has failed to capture the imagination of the majority of professional programmers .
Instead the following thinking seems to have imbued their minds :
As more features are piled on top of an already bogged language , the more powerful will it become .
In this article I try to prove that this argument is false and misleading .
Adding more syntax and restrictive rules to a language , which has a badly designed core , will only make it weaker and even susceptible to security risks .
I will make my point clear with the help of a feature added to the Java programming language – Inner classes .
Inner classes are Java ’s answer to Smalltalk ’s blocks and Scheme ’s closures .
Look at the following code snippet :
public class OuterClass { //
Inner class class AddN { AddN ( int n ) { _n = n ; } int add ( int v ) { return _n + v ; } private int _n ; } public AddN createAddN ( int var ) { return new AddN ( var ) ; } }
The method createAddN ( ) takes an integer ‘ n ’ and return an object that adds ‘ n ’ to a value .
That object is defined as an inner class whose local state stores the value of ‘ n ’ .
Those who are familiar with Scheme or Common Lisp should be shouting by now : “ Hey , this can be done more elegantly and compactly , like this - ”
( define ( addn n ) ( lambda ( k ) (+ n k ) ) )
No new syntax to learn , no special rules to remember .
Agreed .
The problem is Java does not have first - class functions and closures , and the JVM is not designed to support them .
But they are really nice features and are the natural solutions for many a programming problem .
So as to have these nice features , Java introduced a restrictive rule to the language .
The following example will throw more light on this :
public class OuterClass { public int add10 ( final int n ) { class Add10 { int add ( ) { return 10 + n ; } } return new Add10 ( ) .add ( ) ; } }
Here we have a method add10 ( ) , that contain a local inner class , which is used to add the constant value ’ 10 ’ to a given value .
But why the parameter to add10 ( ) is declared final ?
Problem is , the JVM has no idea of inner classes .
So the Java compiler will generate a separate class file for the inner class .
Now how to pass a local variable declared in Outerclass.add10 ( ) method to the Add10 class ?
The compiler does a trick here .
You can find this out by decompiling the OuterClass $ 1Add10. class file .
The compiler quietly adds a variable val$n to the Add10 class .
When an instance of Add10 is created , the value of ‘ n ’ is copied to val$n .
The JVM needs a guarantee that the original value of ‘ n ’ will not change after this copying is done because there is no way for it to keep track of those changes .
Requiring the programmer to declare the variable final is the only way out of this problem .
An inner class should be able to read and write all variables of it ’s parent class , despite what access modifiers they have .
Otherwise , there is no point in making it an inner class in the first place !
The following code demonstrates this .
Here , the inner class is copying the result of the computation to a private variable of the outer class :
public class OuterClass { public void add10 ( final int n ) { class Add10 { void add ( ) { k = 10 + n ; } } new Add10 ( ) .add ( ) ; } private int k = 0 ; }
Now we face a new dilemma .
If , for the JVM , both OuterClass and Add10 are two unrelated classes , how an instance of Add10 is able to modify a private variable declared in OuterClass ?
The answer can be found by decompiling both OuterClass.class and OuterClass $ 1Add10.class files .
We see that the compiler has secretly placed a new method with package level access in OuterClass.class file :
int access$ 002 ( OuterClass a OuterClass3 , int int4 ) { this .k = aOuterClass3 ; return aOuterClass3 ; }
Using this method , not just Add10 , but any class in the package can see and modify the private variable OuterClass .k!
If you generate a class file with appropriate byte code and place it in the same package as OuterClass.class , you can read from and write to its internal state using these secret access methods !
By adding a new feature Java has broken one of the key premises that identify it as an Object Oriented language , i.e , retention and protection of local state .
This may not be a security problem .
No one should rely on Object Oriented abstractions for securing their data anyway !
But this might still cause problems for certain types of software and is certainly a hole in the language .
Higher - order functions and closures are features to be desired by any modern programming language .
Unfortunately , many ‘ modern ’ programming languages have such rigid a design so that adding a new feature to it often breaks an existing , important feature .
I think this is where comparatively simple languages like Common Lisp and Scheme shine .
You can add new syntax , even whole new paradigms , without touching or spoiling the compiler or the runtime system .
As an example , read about how the Common Lisp Object System ( CLOS ) is implemented .
Good languages let you write terse , clean code .
Look at the Scheme code snippet I gave at the beginning of this article .
Compare that with all the verbosity in Java , just to get the same result .
Of course , you will get what you want , only with a fissure in your program !
Every graduate student has a fair share of funny TA moments , but hearing these tales is nothing compared to actually experiencing them first hand .
This past Friday was the very first midterm of our first semester organic chemistry course for non-chemistry majors .
The TAs celebrated this historical event by spending 10.5 hours in lock - down mode , grading .
True to the optimistic spirit of our department , a friend shared with us some of the highlight of her day :
“ Texas carbon to the max ” “ The elusive Canadian Nitrogen - it has almost TWO full octets ” “ Yes , nitrogen has 4 2 p orbitals ” “ Where did H come from ? ”
And my personal favorite :
“ [ Professor ]
Frechet ’s quote after he saw this : “ This person is going to go far in life ” ”
On the topic of funny undergraduate responses , my post - doc mentor shared his most unforgettable memory from the good ol ’ days of graduate school at yet another very prestigious public institution .
Q : “ Which solvent would be more likely to facilitate an SN2 reaction , H2O or DMSO ? Explain . ”
A : “ H2o .
Because clearly , DMSO is not a real molecule . ”
What ’s your best TA story ? 🙂

Russia now has # 1 fighter plane in the world ...
SU - 30 - Vectored Thrust with Canards .
As you watch this airplane , look at the canards moving along side of , and just below the canopy rail .
The " canards " are the small wings forward of the main wings .
The smoke and contrails provide a sense of the actual flight path , sometimes in reverse direction .
This video is of an in - flight demonstration flown by the Russian 's - 30 MK fighter aircraft .
You will not believe what you are about to see .
The fighter can stall from high speed , stopping forward motion in seconds .
( full stall ) .
Then it demonstrates an ability to descend tail first without causing a compressor stall .
It can also recover from a flat spin in less than a minute .
These maneuver capabilities do n't exist in any other aircraft in the world today .... This aircraft is of concern to U. S. and NATO planners .
We do n't know which nations will soon be flying the SU - 30 MK , hopefully China is n't one of them .....
New tabs are not an end by themselves , they are a means to get to the real content we need .
This is the approach that Mozilla Labs has embraced when designing a smarter , more efficient new tab page to replace the current blank one we get whenever we add a tab .
Of course this is not new at all .
Opera was perhaps the first browser to do something for a more efficient new tab page with its Speed Dial feature that added nine user defined links ( by default ) to new tab pages , making it easier for users to reach their most visited sites .
Google Chrome took a more dynamic approach including the most visited and most frequently visited web pages along with recently closed tabs .
And since last year , the idea has been floating around Mozilla with attempts like Ed Lee ’s AutoDial ( frequently visited sites ) , Atul Varma ’s Ambient News ( web feeds approach ) , and Aza Raskin ’s new tab concepts video ( context search and sequences ) .
about : tab is a new Firefox extension developed by Dan Mills that merges all of these concepts providing a clean interface with links to the most visited web pages , web feed items , Â context search , and a way to restore recently closed tabs , while following three basic principles : no configuration , streamlined , and polite .
While I did n’t get it to work consistently ( I may or may not get an option to restore a closed tab or a link to search a selected text ) and I ’m still getting page suggestions I ’d swear I do n’t visit that often so I do n’t find them very useful , this dashboard approach looks like the right way for me .
And it could be even more if it is designed in an extensible way so add - ons could add content to this page like recent Tweets , web mail , weather forecasts , and other small pieces of information that may help the user get to the content he wants .
about : tab requires Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 or a nightly .
You can get it from Mozilla Labs .
* Cargill takeover renews Chavez nationalization drive
* Tightening control over food comes after some shortages
* Chavez emboldened after referendum victory last month
* Cargill “ respectful , ” seeks talks to resolve situation
( Adds Cargill statement , background , paragraphs 8 - 10 , 13 )
By Patricia Rondon
CARACAS , March 4 ( Reuters ) - President Hugo Chavez seized a unit of American food giant Cargill on Wednesday and threatened to take over Venezuela ’s largest private company , renewing a nationalization drive as the OPEC nation ’s oil income plunges .
Chavez ’s clash with the food companies , demanding they produce cheaper rice , came less than three weeks after he won a referendum on allowing him to run for reelection and marked his first nationalization in seven months .
“ I warn you this revolution means business , ” said Chavez , whose government has struggled with lower oil income and minor food shortages this year .
The anti-U.S. president , who has nationalized swaths of the economy , is popular among the poor for pressuring companies to produce cheap goods and for government programs that provide subsidized food in city slums .
The moves to tighten the government ’s grip over the food supply were criticized by the private sector and many economists who say the state distorts the supply chain and contributes to food shortages .
Chavez , an ally of communist Cuba , recently seized some rice mills belonging to Polar , Venezuela ’s largest private business , after accusing the food industry of skirting his price controls and failing to produce enough cheap rice .
U.S. company Cargill [ CARG.UL ] , which operates one rice mill in Venezuela , said earlier in the week it was expecting a visit from officials even though it does not produce the type of rice that is at the center of the dispute .
Cargill said on Wednesday night it was “ respectful ” of the Venezuela decision but seeks talks to resolve the situation .
“ Cargill is committed to the production of food in Venezuela that complies with all laws and regulations , ” Cargill spokesman Mark Klein in Minneapolis , Minnesota , told Reuters .
“ Cargill expects the opportunity to clarify the situation with the government and is respectful of the Venezuelan government decision , ” Klein said .
“ The rice mill was designed exclusively to manufacture parboiled rice , which the company has done at this site for the last 7 years and elsewhere in the country for 13 years . ”
Chavez said he ordered the takeover because Cargill -- one of the largest privately owned U.S. companies -- avoids producing basic rice that is subject to government price controls .
“ Prepare the decree , we are going to expropriate Cargill .
We are not going to tolerate this , ” Chavez said .
It was not clear if Cargill ’s other Venezuelan food units would be affected .
Cargill has approximately 2,000 employees at 22 locations across Venezuela and operates 13 manufacturing plants including oilseed and animal feed processing .
Polar , one of Venezuela ’s best - known companies that produces many its most popular food and drink brands -- including its top - selling beer -- has vowed to take legal action over the rice mill takeovers .
NATIONALIZATION
Chavez has often followed through on his nationalization threats , taking over oil , electricity , steel , cement and telecommunications companies .
Sometimes , however , threatened companies have averted seizures by bowing to Chavez ’s demands .
On Wednesday , he warned Polar to back down .
“ If they get funny with us ... we will go for expropriation and pay them with debt bonds , ” Chavez said during a televised Cabinet meeting .
Chavez has typically paid companies adequately after ordering their takeover .
But several nationalizations last year have not been implemented and this year Chavez has said he would only pay for seizures with government debt paper .
While Chavez ’s nationalizations tend to be widely supported , periodic shortages of basic goods have hurt his popularity in recent years .
Venezuelan shoppers have faced shortages of white rice sold at a low government - set price in recent weeks , while stores have ample supplies of parboiled rice which is not subject to price controls .
Venezuela ’s rice millers association blames the shortages on insufficient supplies of the grain , while the government says the mills are deliberately producing small quantities of white rice to skirt price controls .
On Wednesday , Chavez also ordered his ministers to inspect companies producing goods ranging from toilet paper to cars , which have been hard to buy at times in Venezuela .
Venezuela is the third - largest buyer of U.S. rice .

Each year , as state legislatures return to work , there 's a steady flow of bills introduced that target the teaching of evolution in public schools .
With a few exceptions , most of these do n't pass , and they fade quickly into obscurity .
This year , however , the state of Texas has embarked on an extended fight over science education that has dragged in at least two state agencies and the legislature .
By all appearances , the school board 's role in matters will be coming to a close during a meeting that is currently taking place .
There 's so much going on in Texas that it 's difficult to know where to start .
Chronologically , the first item in the recent chain of events occurred last year , when the Institute for Creation Research applied for permission to grant degrees in " science , " despite the fact that its curriculum holds that the earth is less than 10,000 years old and species are not related by common descent .
Texas ' higher education board turned the request down , saying the ICR would be unable to properly prepare its students to teach science .
Instead of " strengths and weaknesses , " the biology standards call for students to consider " the sufficiency or insufficiency of common ancestry to explain the sudden appearance , stasis and sequential nature of groups in the fossil record . "
Although the ICR threatened to take the state to court , one Texas legislator apparently decided to take a shortcut to giving the group approval to grant degrees : a bill that would exempt any private , nonprofit institution from certification by Texas .
Although the legislator who introduced the bill was apparently inspired by ICR 's plight , the broadly worded bill will allow anyone to set up a nonprofit diploma mill in the state .
More recently , as part of its regular review of education standards , the Texas State Board of Education tackled the science standards .
In past years , these have included a requirement that instructors cover the " strengths and weaknesses " of scientific theories in classrooms .
This year , the educators involved in formulating the new standards dropped this language .
Part of the reason for doing so is that it 's bad pedagogy .
We tend to only teach theories , like plate tectonics , that have strengths that vastly outweigh the weaknesses ; focusing on the weaknesses creates a false sense of balance .
It 's also problematic in education terms because the weaknesses tend to require a far higher level of understanding than public school students ever reach .
Few students are going to be equipped to understand the incompatibility between relativity and quantum mechanics before college level .
Finally , the general use of the language is largely dishonest .
Nobody 's actually interested in teaching the weaknesses of relativity — the wording is there to target evolution .
Given that the new standards were formulated by professional educators , the State Board of Education might be expected to accept their guidance and examine it for obvious errors .
But , this is Texas , where the Governor has appointed someone who also believes that the earth is 10,000 years old and that life is not related by common descent .
( There are some recent profiles of Board chair Don McLeroy that give some sense of his perspective on evolution . )
Instead , the Board invited two of the authors of the deeply flawed text Explore Evolution to critique the proposed standards , and then engaged in a protracted debate about them .
In the end , the teaching of evolution achieved what might be called a partial victory .
The strengths and weaknesses language was kept out of the standards , although the vote on the issue was apparently a 7 - 7 tie , which meant the proposal to revise them failed .
Nevertheless , the Board did sneak in some revisions that called into question a central tenet of evolution , common descent .
Instead of " strengths and weaknesses , " the biology standards call for students to consider " the sufficiency or insufficiency of common ancestry to explain the sudden appearance , stasis and sequential nature of groups in the fossil record . "
Common descent also took a hit in the earth sciences standards , which were revised by the Board to include a requirement that students , " evaluate a variety of fossil types , proposed transitional fossils , fossil lineages , and significant fossil deposits and assess the arguments for and against universal common descent in light of this fossil evidence . "
This wording would n't be problematic in and of itself ; fossil evidence provides our primary indication of major evolutionary transitions , like the origin of tetrapods and birds .
Nevertheless , as Explore Evolution demonstrates , there 's also lots of misinformation packaged as science when it comes to fossils , and requiring an evaluation of the case against fossil evidence opens the door to some problematic material .
And it's not like the Board members are attempting to disguise that their efforts to place this material in public schools is religiously motivated .
All of that sets the stage for this week 's meeting of the State Board of Education , in which the amended standards will face a final ratification vote .
Supporters of science education will be attempting to get the problematic revisions eliminated , while reports are indicating that Board Chair McLeroy will be attempting to insert further revisions , possibly focusing on arguments over the ability of natural selection to produce complex structures .
This line of reasoning is advanced by a proponent of intelligent design , Mike Behe , and played a prominent role in the defeat of the school board policy adopted in Dover , Pennsylvania .
No matter how the School Board votes , at least one Texas legislator is taking no chances .
A bill has been introduced in the House that would reintroduce the strengths and weaknesses language to science education without involving the Board .
In a stunning revelation it seems the Army has successfully foiled a bid to assassinate General ( R ) Pervaiz Musharraf by none other then the killer of Daniel Pearl .
Omar Sheikh has been imprisoned in Hyderabad Central Jail and was allegedly running a campaign to stalk and kill Musharraf either in Karachi or Islamabad .
What was shocking to read that when the authorities cleaned up his jail cell they discovered three mobile phones , six batteries , 18 SIMS of almost every cellular company and various mobile chargers .
The jailed murderer had reportedly called Musharraf in the second week of November and had threatened him “ I am after you , get ready to die . ”
Subsequent investigations by the authorities revealed the threatening phone call was made by someone from the Hyderabad Central Jail .
Being a suspect , Omar Sheikh was placed under observation before it transpired that he was the one who had threatened the former strongman .
Personally I am glad that this attempt did not cause any bodily harm to General Musharraf but I am astonished that such a high profile prisoner had access to mobile phones and various other utilities to be able to run a successful network even while imprisoned in a high profile jail cell – read more at Geo

In an article for Scientific American , two scientists who are working on the causes of colony collapse disorder ( CCD ) say that they and other researchers have made some progress in determining what ’s killing all of those bees .
The growing consensus among researchers is that multiple factors such as poor nutrition and exposure to pesticides can interact to weaken colonies and make them susceptible to a virus - mediated collapse .
In the case of our experiments in greenhouses , the stress of being confined to a relatively small space could have been enough to make colonies succumb to IAPV and die with CCD - like symptoms .
It ’s like AIDS for bees … the lowered immunity does n’t kill directly but makes the bees more susceptible to other illness .
One the techniques researchers used in investigating CDD is metagenomics .
Instead of singling out an organism for analysis , they essentially mixed together a bunch of genetic material found in the bees ( including any bacteria , virii , parasites , etc. ) and sliced it up into small pieces that were individually deciphered .
They went through those pieces one by one and assigned them to known organisms until they ran across something unusual .
HIV is adept at evading attack by the immune system Researchers have identified a cheap , commonly - used compound that , applied vaginally , can stop monkeys being infected with a primate version of HIV .
The discovery , by the University of Minnesota , raises hopes of a similar microbicidal treatment to block HIV transmission in humans .
Several microbicides have been tested , but results have been disappointing .
The study - focusing on a compound called glycerol monolaurate ( GML ) - is published online by the journal Nature .
GML is a naturally occurring compound widely used as an antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agent in food and cosmetics .
Crucially , it is also cheap , and is likely to protect against other sexually transmitted infections too .
Lead researcher Dr Ashley Haase said that if GML proved to be effective in blocking HIV it could potentially help to save millions of lives .
A majority of cases of HIV worldwide are now contracted vaginally , and in Sub - Saharan Africa , where the pandemic is at its most intense , women account for nearly 60 % of new infections .
Blocking response
After monkeys are exposed to their version of HIV , known as SIV , T - cells from the immune system rush to the scene to try to fight infection .
However , this is actually counter - productive , as the virus merely uses these cells as fuel to aid its expansion throughout the body .
Therefore , blocking this initial immune response - although it seems counter - intuitive - might actually help to stop infection in its tracks .
What is interesting about glycerol monolaurate is that it 's very cheap and it may protect against a broad spectrum of sexually transmitted infections , not just HIV
Keith Alcorn
NAM
The Minnesota team examined GML because it has already been used to block a potentially lethal bacterial infection , and was known to impact on key immune system molecules .
They developed a gel containing GML which could be easily applied vaginally .
Ten monkeys - five treated with the gel , and five untreated - were injected with doses of SIV large enough to infect 50 % of cells .
Four hours later , the monkeys were again treated with GML and then given a second dose .
The researchers monitored the animals for evidence of SIV infection for two weeks .
If there was no evidence of infection , the procedure was repeated for a second time .
Four of the five untreated monkeys contracted SIV , but the infection was not seen in any of the animals who were treated with the GML gel .
The researchers stressed more work was needed before human trials could take place .
Easy formulation
But researcher Professor Pat Schlievert said : " GML is exceptionally inexpensive , is widely used in foods and cosmetics , and is easy to formulate in many ways for vaginal use .
" The compound has been demonstrated in vitro to inhibit the growth of nearly all sexually - transmitted disease microorganisms and other causes of vaginal infections , without affecting normal bacteria .
" Its use by women may significantly improve overall vaginal health . "
Keith Alcorn , of the HIV information service NAM , said : " Dozens of compounds are currently being investigated in animal studies as potential microbicides to prevent HIV infection .
" What is interesting about glycerol monolaurate is that it 's very cheap and it may protect against a broad spectrum of sexually transmitted infections , not just HIV .
" It also looks like the sort of compound that could be made available over the counter , without the need for a prescription , which can only help uptake of any potential microbicide . "
Genevieve Edwards , of the HIV charity Terrence Higgins Trust , welcomed the research , but she warned that other precautions should still be taken .
" If we 're able to produce an effective microbicide , it would be a significant step forward in the fight against HIV .
" In the short term , promoting condom use and good sex education are essential to reduce transmission . "

The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people .
( 10th Amendment to the Constitution )
That 10th Amendment just keeps popping up causing all kinds of potential problems for our current “ leaders ” in Washington .
I put leaders in quotes because I do n’t see any right now .
All I see is a bunch of extremely corrupt pseudo - fascists manipulating and lying to the American people day - after - day , creating false crises so that they can go about selling off the country to the highest bidder .
According to the Kansas City Star , as reported on Oil for Immigration , the Congressional Research Service will be publishing a report that raises questions about that part of the Porkulus bill that gives state legislatures the authority to circumvent the governor of a state by accepting porkulus funds that the governor is refusing .
It turns out that it is the well - known Jim “ racecard ” Clyburn of South Carolina who is responsible for inserting this language into the bill .
I guess he had some idea that the governor of South Carolina , Mark Sanford , might not want to lead the state into debt , ‘ cause after the federal bucks dry up , guess who will be responsible for continued funding of whatever it was spent on ?
You guessed it ; the citizens of the state .
That ’s why California is always going broke … they will take anything from anyone and foist it on its citizens who of course can’t pay for it .
Bankrupt again !
Anyway , it is the 10th Amendment that is crucial to this report .
The Congressional Research Service report raises the concern that a legislature that attempts to circumvent the state ’s governor is usurping the governor ’s executive power .
And it is the 10th Amendment that defines the concept of federalism and delineates the separation of powers between the states and the federal government .
In other words , does the federal government have the right to overrule the state constitution and provide an avenue for the legislative branch to usurp the authority of the executive branch ?
Clyburn says , basically , who cares ?
The law is passed and if anyone does n’t like it they can take it to court .
Well , you know Jim , that just could happen and if it does , you know what Jim , it just could jeopardize the entire pork package because if this section you are responsible for is found unconstitutional , it ’s possible the entire pork sandwich could be struck down .
So grab that barbecue sauce and prepare to eat some barbecued crow .
Now , to end on an upbeat note , I heard today on the local talk radio show that North Carolina will be introducing a 10th Amendment / State Sovereignty resolution into the legislature this session .
I ’m not sure how many states that makes right now , but I surmise somewhere between 22 and 28 .
So , Jim can stick that in his pipe and smoke it , right after he finishes his barbecued crow sandwich .
Go North Carolina !

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- Jim Cramer 's week from hell just got even worse on Friday .
Fresh from being dressed down on " The Daily Show " on Thursday night , Cramer had to answer for more bad news when Thomas Clarke resigned as CEO of The Street.com Inc. TSCM , the online financial news site co-founded by Cramer .
Board member Darryl Otte will be the interim CEO .
Will the joke actually become part of Obama ’s national energy plan ?
During last year ’s presidential campaign , Republicans mocked then - candidate Obama for suggesting that proper tire inflation would reduce the need for oil and should be part of an energy - conservation plan .
But now the suggestion is becoming a regulation in California .
Under a new resolution adopted Thursday by the state Air Resources Board , maintenance shops will have to check the tire pressure of every vehicle they service .
Regulators say widespread awareness of having properly inflated tires could lead to California motorists saving 75 million gallons of gasoline a year and using 700,000 fewer tires .
The Republican National Committee and John McCain ’s presidential campaign handed out pressure gauges labeled “ Obama Energy Plan ” in an effort to make a mockery of the comments .
The issued died out after several days when McCain acknowledged that he also believed tire maintenance was a good idea .
“ Under - inflated tires waste fuel , cause tires to wear out prematurely and increase drivers ’ safety risk , ” said Dan Zielinski , senior vice president with the Rubber Manufacturers Association , which represents tire manufacturers , in a news release .
“ This regulation will help protect California ’s environment , help consumers save money in fuel and tire costs , and help Californians optimize vehicle safety . ”
The rules , scheduled to take effect in July of 2010 , apply to smog check stations , engine repair shops and oil service stations .
According to Department of Energy estimates , proper tire inflation can boost gas mileage by more than 3 percent .
It recommends the step along with regular tuneups , replacing dirty air filters and removing unneeded items from the trunk .
“ Checking tire pressure is one of the many simple things that we can all do to reduce our impact on the environment , said Air Resources Board member Barbara Riordan .
“ While we should do this monthly , this measure makes it convenient and regular . ”
The Air Resources Board wants their plan to be taken to the national level , and ultimately spread across the globe .
They are urging the Environmental Protection Agency to adopt similar requirements across the country .
“ We are providing leadership not just for the country but the world , ” said James Goldstene , the board ’s executive officer .
So how funny would the joke be if it were to become even a minor detail of Obama ’s energy plan ?
Researchers have identified the gene that ultimately controls the production of tooth enamel , a significant advance that could some day lead to the repair of damaged enamel , a new concept in cavity prevention , and restoration or even the production of replacement teeth .
The gene , called Ctip2 , is a " transcription factor " that was already known to have several functions - in immune response , and the development of skin and the nervous system .
Scientists can now add tooth development to that list .
The findings were just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" It 's not unusual for a gene to have multiple functions , but before this we did n't know what regulated the production of tooth enamel , " said Chrissa Kioussi , an assistant professor in the College of Pharmacy at Oregon State University .
" This is the first transcription factor ever found to control the formation and maturation of ameloblasts , which are the cells that secrete enamel . "
The researchers used a laboratory mouse model in this study in which this gene has been " knocked out " and its protein is missing .
Such mice lack basic biological systems and cannot live after birth , but allow scientists to study what is there , and what 's missing .
In this case , the mice had rudimentary teeth ready to erupt , but they lacked a proper enamel coating , and never would have been functional .
" Enamel is one of the hardest coatings found in nature , it evolved to give carnivores the tough and long - lasting teeth they needed to survive , " Kioussi said .
With an understanding of its genetic underpinning , Kioussi said , it may be possible to use tooth stem cells to stimulate the growth of new enamel .
Some groups are already having success growing the inner portions of teeth in laboratory animal experiments , but those teeth have no hard coatings – the scientists lacked the genetic material that makes enamel .
" A lot of work would still be needed to bring this to human applications , but it should work , " Kioussi said .
" It could be really cool , a whole new approach to dental health . "
Many people have problems with eroded tooth enamel , including people who smoke , drink and especially some who use illegal drugs such as methamphetamine .
And most cavities start as a hole in tooth enamel that allows decay to begin .
This research was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the OSU College of Pharmacy .
The study was a collaboration of scientists from the OSU College of Pharmacy , College of Science and College of Engineering , and the Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire in France .
While the American International Group comes under fire from Congress over executive bonuses , it is quietly fighting the federal government for the return of $ 306 million in tax payments , some related to deals that were conducted through offshore tax havens .
A.I.G. sued the government last month in a bid to force it to return the payments , which stemmed in large part from its use of aggressive tax deals , some involving entities controlled by the company ’s financial products unit in the Cayman Islands , Ireland , the Dutch Antilles and other offshore havens .
A.I.G. is effectively suing its majority owner , the government , which has an 80 percent stake and has poured nearly $ 200 billion into the insurer in a bid to avert its collapse and avoid troubling the global financial markets .
The company is in effect asking for even more money , in the form of tax refunds .
The suit also suggests that A.I.G. is spending taxpayer money to pursue its case , something it is legally entitled to do .
Its initial claim was denied by the Internal Revenue Service last year .
The lawsuit , filed on Feb. 27 in Federal District Court in Manhattan , details , among other things , certain tax - related dealings of the financial products unit , the once high - flying division that has been singled out for its role in A.I.G. ’s financial crisis last fall .
Other deals involved A.I.G. offshore entities whose function centers on executive compensation and include C. V. Starr & Company , a closely held concern controlled by Maurice R. Greenberg , A.I.G. ’s former chairman , and the Starr International Company , a privately held enterprise incorporated in Panama , and commonly known as SICO .

Video : Molotov cocktail burns both Milk and truth
by Jeremy Hooper
-FACT : The connection between San Francisco politicians and Jim Jones ' Peoples Temple is the subject of great debate .
It is fair to say that many politicians of all stripes supported early version of Jim Jones ' " church , " as did many Bay Area residents ( thus the reason why his crew grew so large ) .
And it 's true that various campaign workers tapped into the Peoples Temple 's network , as the " church " was very politically active , and seemingly in support of many appealing ideals ( inclusivity , fairness , nondiscrimination , etc. ) .
-FACT : But it was n't just Democrats who initially praised Jones .
For one , the complete San Francisco Board of Supervisors gave Jim Jones a Certificate of Honor .
Also , a Republican senator by the name of Milton Marks was an early Jones supporter , even passing a Senate resolution honoring the work of the Peoples Temple .
- FACT : However , as the extent of the Peoples Temples ' cult - like behavior became known and the harsh treatment of its members became clear , there is considerable evidence that Harvey Milk , George Moscone , and other SF politicians moved away from Peoples Temple support .
In fact , some people believe Milk and Moscone were planning to blow the lid off Jonestown ( and there are even conspiracy theories saying that 's why the two were killed ) .
-FACT : Even while supporting Jones / using his network , there is firsthand evidence that Harvey had his suspicions .
In The Mayor of Castro Street , Randy Shilts quotes Milk as saying of Peoples Temple :
" They 're weird , but they 're good volunteers , " Harvey told her .
" You take help where it comes from , but do n't trust them . "
-FACT : Modern people must remember that it took investigation to learn the extent of what was going on with Jim Jones .
Remember , investigating the truth of Jonestown is exactly what Congressman Leo Ryan ( a friend of Moscone and , presumably , Milk ) was doing in Guyana when he was assassinated by Jones ' cohorts .
The truth was largely unknown before that horrific instance .
-FACT : Hindsight being 20 / 20 , it 's easy for folks to now condemn anyone who had connection with Jones .
But this crystal - clear hindsight is often anything but .
It may be politically opportunistic to exploit the hindsight -- but it 's rarely fair .
-FACT : The Peoples Temple members actually drank cyanide - laced Flavor Aid , not Kool Aid .
It 's a common fallacy .
-FACT : In regards to Milk 's record :
In his short time in office , Harvey proved to be an amazing leader .
Remember , he was instrumental in keeping Prop 6 from passing .
This is no small fete considering the Anita Bryant hysteria of the day .
-FACT : Nobody can fairly say that Dan White shot Harvey Milk merely because Harvey was in the wrong place at the wrong time .
Evidence does not support this , as firsthand accounts reveal that there were several other people Dan White could 've shot ( Willie Brown , Dianne Feinstein , various aides ) if his desire was only to kill those who got in his way .
Okay , now you can go watch this new video from conservative flamethrower Molotov Mitchell :
***
* Video source : Harvey Milk drank the Kool - Aid [ WND ]
***
-FACT : The two letters that are referenced in the video are actually one .
In one letter to President Carter dated 2/19/1978 , Harvey did , in fact , defend Jones against Timothy Stoen .
And it was wrongheaded for Harvey ( or anyone ) to do so .
But again , this was well before people were aware of what the Peoples Temple was really all about .
Plus -- and this is an important detail -- the father mentioned in the letter , Timopthy Stoen , had signed a document swearing that his son was not actually of his DNA , but rather the product of Jim Jones ' sperm .
Stoen fully admits to signing this letter , but has since said that its testimony is untrue , and that the son ( later murdered at the hands of Jonmes ' cult ) was his .
However , Harvey had no way of knowing this at the time .
As far as he knew , Tim Stoen was unfairly trying to take a son that Jim Jones had fathered .
Again , you have to remember that Jim Jones in 2/1978 was not the Jim Jones we know in March of 2009 !
-FACT : We 're actually quite okay with you using the word " assassin " to refer to Dan White .
In fact , if one insisted on giving a choice between " assassin " and " homophobe " ( even if there 's no reason why the two should be mutually exclusive ) , we would easily choose the former .
-FACT : Molotov Mitchell 's video is offensive , short - sighted , unmeasured , disrespectful , and even borderline libelous .
Even for WorldNetDaily , it is a low .
Your thoughts
my god .
wnd gets more and more evil every day .

If I hear " FOR THE RECORD ! " one more time , someone 's going to get hurt .

I remember the day that the San Francisco Headquarters for the Election of Jimmy Carter opened up in 1976 , in a empty store front on Market Street .
It was a media event , and I arrived early .
My cameras were stolen the day before ... but I was still in the roped off media section .
I was surprised that except for the media , it was almost empty 20 minutes before the event was to start .
Then 3 school like busloads of members of th People 's Temple arrived and nearly 100 people filled up the empty hall .
I was wearing a real peanut lapel pin , and as Jim Jones was walking past me and noticed it .
He asked me if I had any extra ... because he said he was going to be standing next to Roselyn Carter and would like to give her one .
I had extra , because the guy who made them gave them to me .
Just as the event was to start , I noticed that Jones was giving one to Carter 's wife and had put one on , too .
I was unable to take photos ... but that was the one and only time I met him .
I later had heard that Mayor Moscone , had made the arrangements for the People 's Temple members to be there .

Former vice president Dick Cheney said the security of policies of the Bush administration had protected the U.S. since the September 11 attacks and warned of a high probability that much deadlier attacks could take place if those policies were not kept in place .
Cheney issued the statement during an interview with politics news site Politico defending the previous presidential administration 's efforts to combat terrorism .
If it had n't been for what we did — with respect to the terrorist surveillance program , or enhanced interrogation techniques for high - value detainees , the Patriot Act , and so forth — then we would have been attacked again , he said .
Those policies we put in place , in my opinion , were absolutely crucial to getting us through the last seven - plus years without a major - casualty attack on the U.S .
President Barack Obama , just days into his administration is undoing some of those policies , including banning the military 's use of torture , and vowing to close the Guantanamo Bay prison which houses hundreds of enemy combatants .
Some of those detainees were in the process of being tried through special military tribunals set up by the Bush administration .
President Obama believes the existing U.S. federal criminal justice system should be used instead .
Cheney said the 'ultimate threat to the country is 9/11 type event where the terrorists are armed with something much more dangerous than an airline ticket and a box cutter – a nuclear weapon or a biological agent of some kind that is used in an American city .
He said such an attack would kill hundreds of thousands of people , and the one you have to spend a hello of a lot of time guarding against .
I think there 's a high probability of such an attempt .
Whether or not they can pull it off depends whether or not we keep in place policies that have allowed us to defeat all further attempts , since 9/11 , to launch mass - casualty attacks against the United States .

This week ’s question , courtesy of reader Ryan Greenlaw :
What is the worst movie - watching experience you ’ve had in another person ’s company ( be it a date , your parents , classmates , etc. ) ?

I ’m not sure whether you ’re getting specifically at situations that were the fault of the other person we were with , Ryan .
Certainly the two experiences that leap to my mind — both experienced with my boyfriend — were n’t his fault at all .
The first was in 1999 , when The Phantom Menace came out .
We saw it shortly after it opened , at the now - defunct McClurg Theater in Chicago , then supposedly the high - techiest of the new high - tech digital theaters — basically , the place where the serious sound - and - picture - experience nuts would go .
Just as the film started , a small boy , maybe 7 or 8 years old , burst into tears somewhere down front .
He continued wailing hysterically through the opening crawl .
Anticipation for Phantom Menace was high at the time — oh , little did we know — and it was a completely full house , so keyed - up people almost immediately started yelling “ Shut that kid up ! ” and “ Get him the fuck out of here , you asshole ! ”
So the boy ’s father started shouting back , “ We paid to be here too ! ” and “ YOU shut up , goddammit ! ”
After a few minutes of the theater getting louder and nastier , the father suddenly dragged the boy bodily out of his seat and threw him to the ground , then hauled him up the aisle stairs by his shirt , yelling at him .
Halfway up , he knocked him to the ground , yelling “ See what you ’ve done , you ’ve completely ruined this ! ”
Someone much braver than me stepped out into the aisle and started trying to reason with the angry father , asking him to calm down and stop hitting the kid .
Which of course elicited the catchphrase of bad parents everywhere : “ He ’s my kid , do n’t you fucking tell me what I can do to him ! ”
Meanwhile , the boy lay on the ground between them , still bawling .
By this time , everyone else in the theater had shut up .
The father and the guy who ’d intervened exchanged some quieter words , and then all three of them went out the door together .
I did n’t actually see any of the first 10 minutes of the movie , and I did n’t take in or process any of the next hour or so , because I was so upset and so angry at myself for not doing anything .
Which I still am .
My other worst experience was at the Brew And View at the Vic , during a Quentin Tarantino double — Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs — in the mid-’90s .
Brew And View was normally a pretty mellow place to watch movies , but this was a special event , hosted by an infamous local shock jock , and the place was packed .
Because of the special guest , they were doing thorough weapons screenings at the door , so the line was barely moving .
It was freezing outside , and there was a liquor store right across the street .
We showed up early , and it still took us more than an hour to get inside — by which time most of the people in the line around us were already cold , hostile , giddy , and drunk .
That mood prevailed inside ; I ’ve been to a lot of Brew And View screenings where drunk wags commented loudly on the film , but nothing like this , with a crammed - full house whooping and howling at every curse word or act of violence .
When Ving Rhames started taking potshots at Bruce Willis and hit a chubby bystander , a handful of people shrieked “ Yeah !
Kill the fat chick !
Shoot the fat bitch ! ”
When the door opened on Ving getting raped by the hillbilly pawn - shop owners , people howled “ Fuck the n*gger !
Fuck the n*gger ! ”
It was lurid and ugly and terrifying being in that crowd ; it felt like a riot getting ready to happen .
( The small group of black people sitting around a table right next to us looked pretty damn creeped - out , too . )
But because the place was packed , we would have had to crawl across a lot of people to get out .
Instead , we hunched up and waited for the end of the film , then slipped out before Reservoir Dogs .
To this day , I have n’t re-watched either film ; they both make me feel a little guilty by association .

Mine ’s almost too painful to recount , so I ’ll be brief : A friend and I went to see Darkman at a crumbling Dayton theater formerly known as the Kon - Tiki .
( It opened toward the tail end of the 1960s ’ South Pacific fixation and kept the theme until Loews bought it out in the 1980s . )
Several rows behind me sat a very , very large man , his nearly as large wife , and their on - their - way - to - being - large kids .
Not only did they talk through most of the movie , they noisily unwrapped and ate a chicken dinner .
I shot them dirty looks and shushed them to no avail .
Then , when the credits started to roll , I cheekily waved goodbye .
This was a mistake .
The very , very large man exited with his family , then returned and stuck his fist in my face .
He did n’t punch me , he just kind of put his fist on to the bridge of my nose and pressed .
Hard .
His hand smelled like his dinner .
A year later , I started working at the same theater as an usher , but I never saw that guy again .
I think I would have hidden if I did .

I may be pre-empting Noel ’s answer , but then again , surely he has horrible festival experiences to relate .
And it ’s an open question whether what I ’m about to describe is the most horrible film experience ever , or the most awesome .
Back when we were living in Virginia and I was going to graduate school , we went to see a sneak preview of As Good As It Gets .
About halfway through , a reel had been spliced in backward and upside down , leading to a couple of bizarre , hilarious minutes of out - of - context scenes with backmasked dialogue and legs walking in reverse on the ceiling .
The powers that be stopped the screening , and we sat for about 10 minutes talking about the impossibility of this being fixed , since it would involve cutting the reel out of the spool on the platter and rewinding it with the correct tail on the inside before splicing it back in .
Sure enough , when the movie started again , the entire reel had been skipped .
So suddenly we were 20 minutes later in the film .
And during those 20 minutes , something important to the plot had apparently happened .
( Much later , we found out that Nicholson arranged for Hunt ’s son to get treatment for his asthma . )
Characters kept talking about this amazing event , but maddeningly , no one would say what it was .
The audience started to chuckle every time a veiled reference to the mysterious deed was dropped into the dialogue .
The ridiculous culmination of this projectionist - mandated elision occurred when Helen Hunt said something like “ What you did — I ca n’t even talk about it . ”
Everyone in the theater broke into gales of laughter .
No carefully plotted parody of a missing reel could have been more perfect .
To this day , I still have n’t seen As Good As It Gets all the way through , no small feat given how universally that film was beloved of my middlebrow coworkers in 1997 .
I ’m in no hurry to replace the perfectly mangled movie of my memory with a film that makes some kind of pedestrian “ sense . ”

Up until a couple of months ago , my neighborhood was home to one of the cheapest theaters in Chicago , the Village North , affectionately referred to by locals as “ The Ghettoplex . ”
The Ghettoplex recently closed ( sob ) , but before it did , it hosted some of my very best moviegoing experiences , aided mostly by the staff ’s lax attitude toward sneaking in booze , and the very colorful clientele , which ranged from stoned college kids to homeless drunks snoring in the front row .
Needless to say , the Ghettoplex was n’t the place to go for highly anticipated movies , but for a $ 5 ticket — often scrawled out on a Post - It Note — it really could n’t be beat for entertainment value .
But a couple of years ago , the Ghettoplex ’s unique charms combined for the worst moviegoing experience of my life .
After finishing up a shift at the bar I worked at , a couple of my coworkers and I — lubricated by a shift drink or seven — decided to head over to the Ghettoplex for a midnight screening of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre : The Beginning .
( In our defense , it was a few days before Halloween , and we were drunkity drunk drunk . )
Once we got there , we were informed that the heat was n’t working , but we could still see the movie if we wanted to .
This was late October in Chicago , and I was wearing my gigantic winter parka that evening , and we figured the booze would keep us warm .
Our plan seemed to be working out great until about 45 minutes in , when my rapidly sobering - up body started to register the fact that it was about 40 degrees in the theater , and my increasingly clear head remembered “ Oh yeah , I hate horror movies . ”
However , my companions were still feeling no pain , and they ignored my pleas to leave .
And since the neighborhood is a little , um , rough , I did n’t feel safe stumbling home by myself .
So I stayed .
I think at one point I curled up in my seat under my jacket and cried for a little bit before going to sleep .
But hey , it only cost me five bucks .

I ’ve got two , neither of which were completely horrible , but they make vaguely interesting stories .
And that ’s what AVQ&A is all about , right ?
Vaguely interesting stories ?
At an afternoon screening of Ghost World , a man behind me and my girlfriend made loud proclamations of lust every time Thora Birch was onscreen .
( Not Scarlett ?
Seriously ? )
It was actually more scary than just boring and creepy after a while .
The first time , we might ’ve thought he was just some jock dude , but after a while , it was clear that he was a little mentally ill and obsessed .
But a far worse experience was way back in 1990 , when I went with my dad and my future wife ( yes , we ’re high - school sweethearts ) to see Total Recall .
Little did I know at that point that my delicate flower of a lady friend was both a ) totally averse to anything even remotely sci- fi , and b ) very queasy when it comes to onscreen violence .
As a 16 - year - old , I loved the movie , not realizing until afterward that my young , smart lil ’ girlfriend — her favorite movies at 15 were My Life As A Dog and Maurice — was ready to vomit or pass out for most of what she found to be a terrible , terrible movie .
I still think Total Recall is pretty good , but I ’m ready to admit at this point that My Life As A Dog is probably a little better .
( And Kurt Vonnegut considered it the greatest film ever made , so do n’t take my word for it ! )

I do n’t really remember this , but I ’ve been told that I totally freaked out during Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom when that guy reached into that other guy ’s chest and ripped his heart out .
I was 6 at the time .
Apparently I jumped out of my seat and ran to the back of the theater in sheer fucking terror .
I do n’t remember doing this , but my dad insists I did .
( Coincidentally , I had a strong urge to do the same thing during Witless Protection , but I had to stay because I was reviewing it for The A.V. Club . )
Anyway , I suspect my dad might be exaggerating the story to make it funnier — a practice I fully endorse — though Temple Of Doom did inspire the creation of the PG - 13 rating , so maybe I was n’t the only little kid who rioted during that scene .

I 'm with Hyden here .
One of my all - time worst movie experiences involved Temple Of Doom , but in a different situation than his .
My elementary school 's after - school program occasionally wheeled in the TV / VCR cart to let us watch a movie , which led to two traumatic events I distinctly remember 25 years later .
I used to get migraines as a kid , and my body was wracked by searing headaches and nausea when I had to endure the gross - out marathon known as Temple Of Doom .
I was just counting down the minutes until my mom showed up — I promptly puked when she did .
This after - school program also subjected me to The Watcher In The Woods , a Disney paranormal thriller ( co- starring a scary - looking Bette Davis ) that gave me nightmares for at least a month , .
It still ranks as the film that has done the most damage to my psyche .
I finally found closure a few years ago when I saw it again , but I still can't stomach Temple Of Doom .
Thanks a lot , St. Rose of Lima Elementary !

I do n’t know what it is , but I seem to have emerged from my filmgoing experiences relatively unscathed — unless you count Matrix 3 . ( Well - zinged ! )
I mean , one time I went to see Memento , and the film cut out halfway through , so we all got refunds .
That ’s about as bad as it ’s gotten .
But a friend of mine had a great story , which happened to him at The Sixth Sense .
[ Spoilerz aplenti ahead . ]
It was getting near the end of this , the only M. Night Shyamalan movie people can agree is great , and Bruce Willis was onscreen ; it was the scene where he drops the ring , where thoughts being to swirl in his head .
My buddy , and every other viewer , were starting to put the pieces together , when the guy sitting right behind him blurted out , “ Oh , I get it !
He ’s a ghost ! ”
At first , things were silent — no one was sure what had just happened , and whether he was just being sarcastic .
But people quickly realized that , in fact , the movie was spoiled — and at the absolute worst possible time .
I mean , it ’s one thing to ruin a perfectly good film before you even go , but the exact moment before the amazing reveal ?
There ’s a special place in hell reserved for those fools .

I actually have two worst film experiences .
The first came when I saw the justifiably forgotten Pras / Ja Rule vehicle Turn It Up ( Yes , Virginia , there was a time when the participation of Pras and Ja Rule was enough to get a terrible script both green - lit and shown theatrically ) at one of Madison ’s several monumentally shitty theaters .
I think I can speak with some authority when I say it ’s one of the worst films of the past 20 years , a glum , joyless hodgepodge of hood - and music - movie clichés further undone by Pras ’ mumbly , mush - mouthed anti-charisma .
Christ , if you think he ’s a terrible rapper , you really should see him act .
Or rather do n’t .
The line I always remember from the film is Pras scream - mumbling at an engineer , “ Da beat !
It ’s not hot !
The beat needs to be more hot ! ”
The heat was n’t working in the theater ( it was n’t hot enough !
It needed to be more hot , like Pras ’ beats ! ) so it was freezing .
I was part of an audience of about four people , three of whom left after 15 minutes .
Then 40 minutes into the film , the print started playing backward and upside down .
I think I actually preferred watching it that way .
It turned a terrible movie into a surreal , almost Dadaistic experience .
My other worst film experience was probably watching a Friday screening of Epic Movie right after talking to four or five editors interested in publishing my forthcoming memoir .
One of the best , most ego - inflating days of my life took a sour left turn as I watched in horror as an overflowing theater filled with easily amused teenagers brayed hysterically at every moronic poop joke , pratfall , and idiotic pop-culture reference .
It was awful enough to make me hate young people and movies in general .
I ’d never seen a Friedberg / Seltzer abomination before , so I was n’t fully prepared for its hate - inducing shittyosity .
I knew it was going to be bad , but Good Lord , I did n’t know it was going to be that bad .

There ’s nothing worse than going to a movie with people who clearly are n’t enjoying themselves , which is exactly what ruined Moonstruck for me the first time I saw it .
Moonstruck had just been nominated for a slew of Academy Awards , and had just opened in Nashville , so I talked a couple of high - school buddies into going with me , even though they really wanted to see Action Jackson .
I did n’t have a car back then , so if I wanted to feed my pop-culture habit , I had to rely on friends who ’d drive me to the record store and / or see awards - bait movies with me .
I convinced my buddies that the movie would be funny and profound and definitely worth their while , and for the next two hours they squirmed and sighed and snickered derisively to such a degree that I left the theater convinced that Moonstruck was an overrated hunk of junk .
I actively rooted against it at the Oscars that year .
Then a year later , during my freshman year of college , a bunch of my new friends were quoting Moonstruck so lovingly that I agreed to accompany them to a screening at the UGA student union .
And lo and behold , I did a complete 180 on the film , which seemed much sweeter and funnier when I was watching it with people who were into it .

I would consider my entire three - year sojourn in Miami , Florida to be one long bad moviegoing experience .
Every week , my friends and I would dutifully trudge out to the Cocowalk Theater or another sprawling megaplex to catch a movie or two , and every week , we ’d have our limits tested on how much chatter we could tolerate behind us .
There was always some talking , and we learned early on that if we turned around and politely asked people to quiet down , they ’d look at us like we ’d just urinated in their popcorn .
It was as if the battle on moviegoing decorum had already been fought and lost in this city , and the next generation was n’t even aware that talking during movies had been , at any point in history , considered rude .
We tried to devise exit strategies by sitting in empty rows or near the aisle so we could change seats if the people behind us were making too much noise .
But when you ’re seeing movies on opening weekend , as we often did , exit strategies were n’t always possible , and we had to deal with the chatter one way or another .
To that end , what stands out is two experiences when the least tolerant in our group vastly exceeded his authority and embarrassed the hell out of me in the process :
One was at a sold - out screening of Bulworth — no , seriously , Bulworth sold out !— when my friend , suspecting the people behind us were going to be trouble , tried preemptively to shut them down .
In other words , he was trying to shush them for having an animated conversation before the lights had even dimmed .
( Needless to say , they were not pleased , and they wound up talking through the entire movie anyway . )
The other was at a middlebrow foreign film called Character , where the subtitles were cropped very close to the bottom of the screen , making it very difficult to see them over people ’s heads .
Again , there was chatter , mainly from a guy who required virtually a line - for - line recapping of everything that was happening onscreen .
After the movie was over , my steamed - up friend whipped around and launched into a profane , spittle - filled rant … at an elderly man .
It was then that I learned that in the social code , “ respect your elders ” trumps “ do n’t talk during movies . ”

I was more or less raised by a single mother , so a lot of my formative years were spent blooming in the pot of dirt known as public daycare .
I was a “ lifer , ” inducted when I was a preschooler and not turned loose into a latchkey existence until I was nearly 11 , so most of the teachers there were pretty familiar with me — primarily for my smart - ass attitude and general disinterest in arts and crafts , but also as someone who could be trusted not to bully smaller children or play “ doctor ” with the ladies .
( Except that one time . )
This also meant I sometimes got the rare privilege of choosing which video would be used as a mid-afternoon pacifier , when our underpaid guardians wanted to go read old issues of People and bitch about how much they got paid , and its proportionate ratio to the need to put up with this shit .
Because I am a dork who thrills at any iota of authority , I took this role very seriously .
For a while there , I was an excellent programmer , selecting only the safest of Disney ’s G-rated fare like Pete ’s Dragon and The Sword And The Stone .
Then one week I fucked up and lobbied for Amazing Grace And Chuck — a PG - rated movie .
I remember arguing that its message — one boy ’s mission to foster peace in the Cold War by refusing to play baseball — was an important one .
( I guess because how else would we learn about the importance of nuclear disarmament through sports - related pacifism ?
Why , for all we knew , one of our classmates would be an NBA star , and one day he ’d disarm a Soviet ICBM by just taking a knee during the playoffs !
etc. )
Anyway , the movie itself is n’t particularly profane , but anyone who ’s ever been in a room full of 5 - to 10 - year - olds knows that the slightest curse word can spark a near - riot .
Needless to say , the first “ hell ” caused the entire assembly to erupt into uncontrollable hysterics , and I remember every pair of teacher eyes turned my way like I had just popped in a tape of German scat porn .
I spent the rest of that movie turning crimson at every “ damn , ” “ hell , ” and “ ass ” ( and there probably are n’t many , but at the time , it seemed like Charles Bukowski and Quentin Tarantino had collaborated on the script ) until our faux - principal Ms. Ellen finally popped the tape out to a swell of anticipatory “ Ooooo ”s .
I was absolutely mortified .
Ms. Ellen quietly informed me we would be having a talk with my mother later , I guess because she was concerned I might develop a potty - mouth if I continued watching films like that .
Fortunately , my mom did n’t give a damn hell ass shit , so fuck that bitch .
Amazing Grace And Chuck for life !
" The only problem and the only thing we fear are the [ Israeli military ] checkpoints , " says Elias Kahlil , G.ho.st 's director of research and development .
The company 's Palestinian employees say that passing the checkpoints is like going through airport security - they are required to show ID and a permit , walk through a metal detector and get their bags screened in an X - ray machine .
They also need to have their fingerprints taken and answer any questions the Israeli soldiers may have about their reasons for entering Israel .
The process can take anywhere from 15 minutes to two hours .
These delays can lead to awkward situations .
Earlier this year , representatives from the company were asked to meet in Jerusalem with Israeli President Shimon Peres , who runs a nonprofit dedicated to promoting peace and collaboration between Israelis and Palestinians .
G.ho.st 's Palestinian financial director , Khaled Ayyash , was scheduled to attend the event but missed it because he was stuck in line at the border crossing .
" Everyone was a little embarrassed , " Schreiber says of the incident .
" But they understood . "
In wartime , all bets are off .
During the conflict between Hamas and the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip last December , all borders between the Palestinian territories and Israel were closed .
" In times like that , a permit is just a piece of paper , " Kahlil says .
So as Israeli tanks traded fire with Hamas fighters wielding rocket - propelled grenade launchers , G.ho.st 's employees traded instant messages and Google Docs .
All meetings were held via Skype video .
" We got used to working this way , " adds Kahlil .
No one at G.ho.st , not even the upbeat Schreiber , claims Palestinian and Israeli colleagues found it easy to work together during the fighting .
" Of course there are tensions , " Schreiber said in January , at the height of the conflict .
" We 're all worried about families and friends in the south of Israel and in Gaza . "
One day Schreiber attended a funeral for a fallen Israeli soldier who happened to be his neighbor .
At the same time , his marketing and communications manager , Montasser Abdellatif , was frantically trying to reach a college friend who lived near a school in Gaza that the Israeli Army had just hit .
( Eventually he learned that the friend had taken shelter elsewhere . )
Both Schreiber and Abdellatif were badly shaken when they dialed in for their weekly conference call later that day .
Still , after inquiring about family and friends , they got on with the agenda .
" We want to know each other 's points of view , " Abdellatif says .
" But not during meetings . "
G.ho.st 's employees admit that discussions about the endless conflict can get heated - and are more common when they get together in person than when they talk online .
( Score one for videoconferencing technology . )
But they stress that these conversations have never degenerated into shouting matches .
Burying themselves in their work is a welcome distraction from conflict .
" We are a high - tech company , " Schreiber says .
" We remain focused on our product . "
Like any other tech startup , G.ho.st has plenty of nonpolitical hurdles to keep it occupied .
It needs to grow its user base with a limited marketing budget in a down economy .
And Schreiber knows that by offering an online operating system that could make Windows irrelevant , his team is suiting up for battle with an enemy far from the Middle East : Microsoft .
G.ho.st has already had a brush with the behemoth of Redmond .
Last fall , after Microsoft introduced its $ 300 million Life Without Walls ad campaign , Schreiber sent a letter to Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer complaining that its new slogan was in violation of G.ho.st 's pending trademark for the phrase " no walls . "
Schreiber claims G.ho.st started using the tagline to market its operating system before Microsoft began its campaign .
But Microsoft disagrees , saying the startup has no rights to the phrase .
" We are very respectful of intellectual property claims , " explains Microsoft spokesman Michael Marinello .
" But in this instance we found their claims to be without merit and informed them of our position . "
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office says it received Microsoft 's trademark application three days before G.ho.st 's arrived .
But because G.ho.st started using its slogan first , officials say the company might yet win the case .
A ruling is expected in the next six months .
For now , G.ho.st is busy perfecting its product and building its user base .
More than 100,000 have signed up since the service was unofficially launched in April 2007 , and that number is growing by about 30 % a month , according to G.ho.st .
( The company is planning an official launch for the service later this year . )
Many users are people who do n't own a PC and want to access their files from any computer .
The service is currently free to consumers , and G.ho.st does n't plan to generate revenue until 2010 , when it hopes to start charging other companies for providing embedded links to their online applications .
" The online app market is very nascent , " says Thomas Bittman , an analyst with Gartner .
" But it is moving fast , and we think 2009 will be all about experimentation . "
It may also be the year more cross - border companies follow in G.ho.st 's foot - steps .
" G.ho.st is the most visible [ Israeli ] company doing this , but there are a few others that are starting to work with Palestinians , " says Yossi Vardi , a leading Israeli tech entrepreneur and investor .
" In the high - tech world , everyone knows collaborating is important .
There 's already a culture of dialogue . "
Tahboub , Schreiber 's Palestinian partner , says Israeli companies such as pharmaceutical software firm Comply are starting to use his developers ' services .
An Israeli venture capital firm , Veritas Venture Partners , is setting up a fund dedicated to investing in Israeli - Palestinian businesses ( to date , the firm has not invested in G.ho.st ) .
Of course , all that economic progress could vanish if the political conflict boils over again .
But if a company like G.ho.st can launch its product in wartime , so can others .
" This is helping the Palestinian economy , " says marketing manager Abdellatif .

In my opinion it was a shame he wasnt hit square in the face !
Bush made a mess of that country .
Democracy is n't the answer to everyones problems and it doesnt work for every country .
The trouble is that Iraq had two groups , the Sunni and the Shia .
The Shia were the poor majority and dominated by the wealthier minority the Sunnis .
These Sunni were the middle class who were well educated doctors and teachers etc. and were the most secular of the Iraqi people .
But since the Shia , who were nonsecular and poorly educated , controlled the oil we ran in there supporting them and destroyed the sunni population or made them refugees and now the more radical bunch is in control all for the sake of friggin oil !
The sunnis could have been our most helpful ally in the fight on terror but now do u think those educated individuals will ever forget what we did to them ?
Were in more danger now than we were after 9/11 !
And democracy would only further the problems because with the majority being Shia they will have radical control of the country !
Way to go Bush !
As the most respectable general in the US military Petreas once openly said " If you know why we are here you tell me ! "
Shortly after he was fired by Rumsfeld because , while he actually made sense , it was against the Bush policies .
Thank goodness hes back in there now !
Hes the only one I trust !
Put it this way , if the US was invaded by another country and my countrymen , landmarks , and cities destroyed , and I had to take refuge to mexico and most of my family had been killed all for the sake of that country wanting to impose communism or whatever , but their main goal was to take control of our most valuable resources .
I dont think I would just throw my shoes at their ignorant leader , Id kill him and absolutely LOATH his country and probably swear revenge .... but then again im just a 19 year old girl who couldnt possibly know anything about how this world works right ?

REPORTER : " As you see , the shoe sailed over his head ... "
Hee - lar - yous .
I have now watched this video five times as holy catharsis .
O !
If only one shoe had landed true .
The trajectory is so promising !
Turns out our lame duck ai n't such a lame DUCKER .
This quick reflex - response belies his 8 years of pigeon dances , stumbles , pet - goat bumbles , and pretzel choking .
Maybe his intense Cheerleading training prepared him for just such a moment .
( Certainly had no problems ' ducking ' his Texas National Air Guard obligations . )
I wonder if the Secret Service will now mandate Press Conferences be shoe - less in the interest of National Security .
After all , " No one could have anticipated using shoes as projectiles to slam into the President 's head . "
As for Perino , well , if all she ever gets is a black eye for doing the dirty work of lying to the American People on behalf of this criminal administration , she will have , at least for now , ducked cancer .

This is the " throw a shoe on Bush " - game .
In the upper curve you adjust the angle .
In the lower curve you adjust the strength .
And if that was n't it , this guy has 3 shoes !

Excellent , 99 !
I 'd been looking for a link like that all morning .
Concerned when I could n't find any information re : what happened AFTER the shoe - throwing , and the video ends with Mr. al - Zaidi 's screams .
( Not surprisingly , they beat him to a pulp . )
Thanks for the link .
Still hoping to find a " thank you Mr. al - Zaidi " site , like the one someone put together for Stephen Colbert after the WH Correspondent 's dinner in '06 .

AntiWar dot com has scared the crap out of me , but al - Zaidi is 28 , not 25 .
I 've emailed everyone I can think of with the juice to start getting some real answers .
HE BETTER BE SAFE .
HE BETTER NOT BE DEAD .
I CAN'T BELIEVE NOBODY'S BEEN SITTING ON WHAT IS HAPPENING TO HIM !
I can't believe someone in *'s entourage , since it would never be * himself , did n't make sure he was n't harmed before he left .

I just heard Thomm Hartman talking about broken bones , " signs of torture on his thihgs " and so on .
What an outrage - it outrages even a jaded old realist like yours truly .
And to think the journalist was just tossing duhbaya his shoe phone , as Condi was trying to get duhbaya 's thoughts on her latest pumps .
The second shoe , presumably , was to draw attention to the first one , which was blaring a shock and awe standby riff from the Noriega kidnapping .
Seriously , I 'm genuinely afraid for the journalist , because if they have seriously beaten him up they may not be able to release him .
What story will The Big Dick and his cohorts cook up to explain his disappearance ?
Allah swooped in and took him up to his virgins ?
I 'm mailing some old shoes and a few bags of pretzels to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , addressed to the Dog in Chief .

Listen to Ron Paul .
Click the play button below .
This week , Congress and the administration once again showed their lack of economic understanding , as they ramped up spending to record levels .
On the surface , maybe it does look to some like the economic crisis is a liquidity problem , that the economy is in trouble because money is not changing hands at the pace it once did in the boom years .
They believe that to get back to a booming economy money needs to start changing hands again — and the quickest way to do this is for the federal government to massively expand spending to pump new money into the system .
If this is the extent of their understanding , no wonder they call for spending , taxing , bailouts and inflation .
If spending was the solution , we never would have had a problem .
During the last eight years , we ’ve blown up the size of government and certainly had no want of spending on foreign or domestic policy .
The Bush administration increased spending almost 20 % its first term , and nearly doubled the national debt by the end of the second term .
Certainly the case cannot be made that lack of government spending created the problem or can be the solution .
This is mirrored in American households .
According to CNN private sector debt is 365 % of private sector gross domestic product .
Many relied simply on steady and continued increases in home values to enable spending and secure more debt .
That trend has proven unsustainable and many Americans are adjusting their finances accordingly .
For the first time , household debt is beginning to fall as consumers wake up to the realities of paying off debt and living within their means .
Would n’t it be great if the government would do the same ?
A lot of capital and liquidity is out there waiting in the wings as the new administration is bringing about government uncertainty , a concept discussed by Robert Higgs as prolonging the Great Depression .
In other words , it is a foregone conclusion that government will act .
But , like a chicken with its head cut off , no one knows which way it will run , just that it will flail about wildly until it collapses .
Why start a business , when businesses could face the brunt of an increase in future taxation ?
Similarly , why hire a new employee if tax policy will just force you to fire them later on to stay afloat ?
Why buy a house , when you have no idea how future government meddling in the housing market will affect its value ?
Why spend at the shopping mall , or buy a new car when you do n’t know how tax policy will affect your family budget , or if your job will come under the axe because your employer ’s tax burden is increased ?
I argue that these kinds of questions and concerns contribute to the weakening economy .
This type of tax policy keeps capital out of third - world nations , and now is keeping capital in hiding here in the US .
People are concerned about security and savings again , retrenching their household and business budgets .
The economy could be helped if the government would just get out of the way and restore sound monetary and fiscal policies .

Though the media have been abuzz in recent years over the phenomenon of cougars -- older women dating much younger men -- a new study hints that pairings of older mothers and younger fathers might be optimal for the children 's IQs .
The study of more than 33,000 children in the United States looked at parental age and how it affected scores on intelligence tests at 8 months , 4 years and 7 years of age .
While the children of older fathers scored slightly lower , the children of older mothers tended to perform slightly better .
" In general , you would predict that the offspring of older parents would do better , because the parents tend to have better socioeconomic position , stability , education , health literacy , etc. , " said Dr. John McGrath , a psychiatrist and epidemiologist at the Queensland Brain Institute in Brisbane , Australia , and one of the study 's authors .
" This is exactly what we see for the offspring of older mothers .
This would probably be driven by understandable socio-cultural factors .
Thus , the fact that we see the opposite pattern for fathers ' age is startling . "
The deficits of the children of older fathers -- whose sperm will degrade as it replicates over time , in contrast to eggs , which are formed early in a woman 's development -- are worrisome , McGrath said , because of the trend of men waiting longer to have children .
That might even pose a problem to future generations .
" Over time , many societies are delaying parenthood , " he said .
" Worryingly , if the adverse health and educational outcomes we see are due to new mutations in dad 's sperm cell , these will probably be transmitted to the next generation . "
Given the size of the study , the small deficits found in the children of older fathers were still significant .
But while other researchers called the findings interesting , they expressed skepticism at how well the findings would translate to today , because the sample of children in the study was taken between 1959 and 1965 .
Older Dads ' Involvement May Be Key in Kids ' IQ
The finding , then , may be how an uninvolved father can impair a child 's development .
" Fathers born during this time [ 1909 to 1915 , based on the years of the study ] were fairly uninvolved in parenting and certainly more so with age , " said Melanie Killen , a professor of human development at the University of Maryland .
" Thus , fathers were not providing important cognitive stimulation for children through play and social interaction that is highly related to performance on the [ intelligence tests ] . "
Killen said that age means something different now , as well .
" Being 50 in 1960 means something very different from being 50 today , particularly in terms of early nutrition and development , " she said .
" It does n't surprise me that children born in the 1960s with ' older ' dads may have missed important opportunities for cognitive developmental engagement and stimulation . "
She added that older mothers may have been better positioned to help make up those gaps .
" Older mothers , however , would be significantly related to more advanced cognitive development given that they would have more maturity to handle the more developmentally important cognitive stimulation roles that a ' single ' parent plays , given the expectations of parenting during this time . "
Dr. Susan Klugman , a prenatal geneticist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City , said that the study should be replicated with children born now .
She noted that one complication might be that people smoked more when the data were taken , and that might have resulted in an increase in defects in the sperm .
A potential problem with reading too much into the study , noted Alan E. Kazdin , a professor of psychology and child psychiatry at Yale , is that it only followed children through the age of 7 .
Because of that , he noted , some of the findings may not show what happens to these children throughout their lives .
" Older parents sometimes provide more compensatory advantages [ if their financial means are better ] and experiences , and that these findings , while important , did not show that the results had any practical consequences in childhood or adulthood . "
One Less Worry for Older Moms ?
Perhaps the most important result from the study , noted Mark Reinecke , chair of psychology for child development at the Northwestern University School of Medicine , is that it might alleviate the fears of older women considering having children .
To them , he said , " the findings are reassuring .
A great deal has been written about the risks of having children after 40 years of age .
These findings allay these concerns , at least a bit . "
Reinecke noted that other factors would play a greater role in the child 's ultimate success .
" Beyond this , I would emphasize the importance of maintaining a nurturing , secure , predictable , and intellectually stimulating home environment .
...
That 's the key during the early years , " he said .
But the benefits that come with age do have a tradeoff , noted Dr. John Constantino , a child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis .
" There is a point at which maternal emotional maturity gets overshadowed by increased risk of birth defects in offspring , " he said .
McGrath cautioned that while his study 's findings need closer scrutiny , it is too soon to make any recommendations based on it .
" I am sure your viewers and readers will want some type of guidance , " he told ABCNews.com , " but , it is too early to make any recommendations .
Research needs to be replicated and confirmed in different settings , etc .
For the moment , our study suggests that paternal age , like maternal age , also should be ' on the radar screen ' for the research community . "
" As the research evidence builds , then we can put this knowledge into the public health equation .
...
Our small study is one part of the jigsaw . "

Microsoft has made headlines in recent weeks for devising new ideas to bolster a struggling global economy .
While the software giant expects to lose significant revenue this year , Microsoft is looking at the bigger picture in an attempt to stop the bleeding and start on the road to recovery .
One of the new Microsoft - endorsed initiatives is an online program called Elevate America , which hopes to teach , certify and secure employment for close to 2 million people .
Now , Microsoft is once again giving hope to an ever - increasing unemployment demographic by making way for an additional 3,000 positions within the company .
Some Will Gain , Some Will Lose
While offering 3,000 additional positions is a tremendous boost in morale , the figure is a bit deceiving .
The new jobs will be exclusive to research and development departments .
This means that while investment in this sector will increase by $ 1 billion , some jobs in other areas of Microsoft are set to be eliminated .
( Source : cnn.com )
Microsoft would not disclose whether or not the number of positions eliminated would surpass the number of new positions created , though analysts believe that this is not likely to occur since Microsoft has gone to great lengths in publicizing their realignment strategies .
2.5 Year Stimulus Plan
The move should not come as a complete shock to those who have been keeping close tabs on Microsoft in recent weeks .
In January , the company announced the possibility for 2,000 to 3,000 new jobs as part of a broader realignment plan set to occur within the next 18 months .
( Source : yahoo.com )
Microsoft 's 2.5 year realignment plan also involves increasing the investment made to research and development by $ 1 billion , bringing the total amount to $ 9 billion .
The money will be used to further research emergent realms like " cloud computing " and to develop even more Internet - based applications .
In any case , hiring close to 3,000 new employees will help out many families during these difficult times , while dedicating these people to research and development will ensure that Microsoft continues to stay on the cusp of the latest in technological advancements for some time .
This is a guest essay by Debbie Cook , former Mayor of Huntington Beach , CA and ASPO - USA Board member .
Debbie recently lost the election for the 46th Congressional district in California .
It is a testament to our nations current focus that we have few leaders like her in DC aware that energy and natural resources are ultimately what we have to spend .
Her essay looks at the energy required to turn ocean water into potable water .
The interrelationships of energy and water in our social systems will be paramount going forward -- as we need water to procure most energy and energy to procure most water .
And we are learning that more money wo n't magically procure more of either .
Energy Down the Drain
The Next Worst Idea
The next worst idea to turning tar sands into synthetic crude is turning ocean water into municipal drinking water .
Sounds great until you zoom in on the environmental costs and energetic consequences .
It may be technically feasible , but in the end it is unsustainable and will be just one more stranded asset .
In 2003 , I was one of two elected officials invited to serve on the California Desalination Task Force .
The task force was the result of Assembly Bill 2717 ( Hertzberg ) , authorizing the Department of Water Resources to study desalination facilities and “ report on potential opportunities and impediments ... ”
For nearly a year , an unwieldy group of individuals representing a multitude of agencies , industry , and environmental organizations convened around the state to study and prepare a report with their recommendations .
As you can imagine , the membership was largely divided into two camps — those with a horse in the race and those without .
The Task Force provided me with the opportunity to learn about this emerging technology but more importantly , to learn about the relationship between water and energy in California .
Within a few years my interest in water had blossomed into an obsession with our energy future and peak oil .
It is my knowledge of our energy and resource constraints that leads me to reject ocean desalination as the water of our future .

The Water / Energy Nexus
Make no mistake , California has a serious water crisis .
But it can not be addressed in isolation of our energy crisis .
The problem was summed up perfectly in a 2005 California Energy Commission ( CEC ) presentation title : “ There is no electricity crisis in California the water agencies ca n’t solve — or make worse . ”
Water is energy .
According to the CEC , 10 % of all electricity production in California is consumed in moving water around the state ; another 9 % for treating , disposing , pumping , heating , cooling , and pressurizing water .
Energy demand is at its highest July 1 to September 15 .
The hottest days of the year also coincide with the highest water demand .
Maintaining adequate electricity reserves is becoming a challenge in California .
According to California ’s Energy Action Plan , “ Because natural gas is becoming more expensive … reducing consumption of electricity and diversifying electricity generation resources are significant elements of plans to reduce natural gas demand ... ”
There is no more energy intensive water source than ocean desalination .
Figure 2 : Electricity consumption of various California water sources
Power plants require water for cooling .
Along the California coast , almost half of our existing electricity generation facilities utilize once - through cooling technology resulting in the intake of 17 billion gallons per day of water .
This results in the impingement and entrainment of millions of marine organisms .
While dry cooling can reduce the impacts on the marine environment , conversion is expensive , controversial , and limits a desalination proponent ’s plans for bootstrapping onto an existing intake / outfall pipe .
The Long Beach Water Department has been operating a demonstration desalination project for many years experimenting with a more responsible under ocean floor seawater intake and discharge .
Long Beach has pledged , “ not to pursue seawater desalination unless our research efforts determine it can be done cost - effectively , with little or no environmental impact . ”
A Mirage in the Desert
The teaser horse in California ’s ocean desalination race is a private water company called Poseidon Resources .
They and their lobbyists have spent the last 10 years wooing water boards , legislators , and consumers into believing technology could keep California ’s growing population satiated .
With the complicity of numerous water agencies , Poseidon has been largely successful .
Most Southern Californians have been convinced that ocean desalination is a good thing — a new drought - proof source of water in a state with diminishing resources .
Many environmentalists believe that this new water will be a surrogate for water withdrawals from endangered rivers and streams in Northern California .
Residents have been told that the projects will be constructed at no cost to the taxpayer and will produce water that is comparably priced to imported water .
Unfortunately the claims do n’t hold up to scrutiny .
All Politics is Local
The regulatory hurdles to ocean desalination are daunting .
The Poseidon adventure in California spans more than a decade beginning with a proposed project in Carlsbad California — a project that is still in the permitting process ( despite their website ’s claims to the contrary ) .
By comparison to Huntington Beach , their Carlsbad proposal was an easy sell .
San Diego imports almost all of its water from the Metropolitan Water District at a price close to $ 800 / AF .
In San Diego , water independence is at least as motivating as energy independence is to most Americans — and about as achievable .
In 2002 Poseidon filed an application with the City of Huntington Beach for a 50 million gallon / day project that would utilize existing intake and outfall pipelines belonging to AES , a global power company with generation and distribution businesses .
Surrounding AES in the Southeast area of the city is a hodge - podge of land uses including large gas - oil tanks , a wetland , a wildlife care facility , a sanitation district , a mobile home park , a waste dump- site , and hundreds of cranky homeowners who believe the area is an industrial dumping ground .
In other words , Poseidon chose to become part of a long history of distrust between the industrial users , the city , and the residents .
While Huntington Beach does not have interest in this new water source , it will be sharing the costs of a new water tank that had already been approved for the area .
As a member of the Orange County Water District , Huntington Beach meets most of its water needs from a well - managed aquifer , with only 25 % of its water imported from MWD at roughly $ 580 / AF .
In fact , to augment its water supply , OCWD embarked on its own desalination project using effluent from its next door neighbor the Orange County Sanitation District .
This partnership helped OCSD avoid construction of another outfall pipe and provided OCWD with a less energy intensive process .
Granted , water costs are sure to go higher for all Californians as we struggle with a warming climate and growing population , but energy costs will rise right along water .
Figure 3 : AES 450 MW natural gas power plant , Huntington Beach , CA
In 2006 , despite years of public protest , Poseidon won city approval and moved on to wrangling with other regulators and legal challengers .
They also continue to seek a public partner so that they will be eligible for subsidies from the Metropolitan Water District .
Like corn ethanol , ocean desalination would not be remotely competitive without huge subsidies .
In this case , $ 250 per acre foot plus publicly constructed and operated pipelines .
So much for the pledge of , “ no taxpayer money . ”
It is anyone ’s guess how long MWD will continue these subsidies .
But there is an even better captive market than thirsty California .
The Southern Nevada Water Authority is salivating at the chance to trade MWD for Colorado River water .
Perhaps we are seeing the first signs of another stranded asset : the Colorado River Aqueduct .
Too Costly to Flush
The story of desalinated water has been largely one of unkept promises .
Tampa Bay is a typical case .
In 1999 Tampa Bay Water received a binding commitment for water at $ 557 / AF .
By 2004 costs were updated to $ 827 .
By 2008 , after a month of operation , it was estimated the wholesale cost to be $ 1100 / AF .
Even if this were an inclusive accounting , there are two factors that work in Tampa ’s favor : the salinity of the source water and their electricity rate .
Both are critical to calculating water costs .
In 2003 , Water International estimated that 44 % of the cost of desalination was the energy component .
But whose energy costs were they using , Florida or California ?
Or maybe Saudi Arabia ?
In 2002 , Oil and Gas Journal ran a story on desalination facilities in Saudi Arabia .
They reported construction costs of 30 facilities at $ 20 billion , $ 4 billion for operations and maintenance , and water at $ 1356 / AF .
While there are differences between the thermal process used in Saudi Arabia and the reverse osmosis projects in the U.S. , the cost of natural gas in Saudi Arabia at that time was 75 ¢ / Mcf — a fraction of what we pay in the U.S .
California ’s checkered history with ocean desalination is equally unhelpful .
Of those projects that have operated , the following costs have been reported :
Gaviota Oil and Gas Processing Plant : $ 4000 / AF
Santa Catalina Island ( built and operated by Southern California Edison ) : $ 2000 / AF
U.S. Navy , San Nicolas Island : $ 6000 / AF
PG&E Diablo Canyon Power Plant : $ 2000
City of Moro Bay : $ 1,750 / AF
The City of Santa Barbara built a plant in the 1990s but never operated it .
The Yuma Desalting Plant may be the biggest white elephant in the world .
At the time it was built in the late 1980 ’s , it was the world ’s largest reverse osmosis plant capable of desalting 72 million gallons per day .
The $ 245 million project was constructed to comply with the 1944 treaty with Mexico to reduce salinity of Colorado River water from 2900 ppm to 115 ppm .
The estimated cost of operations and management was $ 24 - $ 29 million per year .
I ’m told it has never operated except for tests .
This paltry record coupled with a lack of transparency in the industry keeps everyone guessing .
It is difficult to challenge the wildly optimistic numbers that are perpetually paraded out at public meetings and in the press .
Environmental documents can sometimes fill in a few blanks .
The Huntington Beach EIR states that the Poseidon project will require 5476 kWh / AF .
If Poseidon were paying a Florida rate of 4.5¢ / kWh the cost of electricity alone would be $ 246 / AF .
If they paid what the average Californian pays ( which includes bond repayment for the 2001 energy crisis ) — 12¢/ kWh — their electricity costs alone would be $ 657 / AF .
Poseidon stated at one of the Task Force meetings that it was planning on electricity at 6 ¢ / kWh — a rate that is not available to any industrial user in the state .
With those kinds of savings they could perhaps purchase enough lobbying to get special dispensation .
Too much Water
One thing for sure , ocean desalination is not about California ’s water crisis .
We live in a desert and use too much water .
Our water needs can be solved if we follow the lead of agencies like Irvine Ranch Water District and take appropriate measures : allocation based rate structures , smart timers , landscaping codes , and conservation .
Ocean desalination is an example of our complete failure to recognize stark realities — water , food , energy , soil , air , and oceans are limited and our population and consumption keeps growing .
Once again we are applying a technical fix to an adaptive challenge .
Figure 4 : Typical California landscaping
We are rapidly approaching the time when we will not have enough money to throw at our problems .
We may be there now or we may be able to squeak out a few more stranded assets before our future catches up with our present .
I ’m betting on business as usual .
Debbie Cook is the former Mayor of Huntington Beach , President of Post Carbon Institute , and board member of ASPO - USA .
** Addendum
Since transparency is not a virtue practiced by proponents of ocean desalination , finding data from existing facilities is often a slog through countless documents .
After writing this article I discovered the California PUC resolution granting Southern California Edison a 2007 rate increase .
SCE is the overall water provider for the island .
The following paragraph from the CPUC resolution puts the energy intensity of ocean desalination into perspective :
Producing fresh water from sea water by desalination is a highly energy intensive process and should be utilized only when no other economical water supplies are available .
This is illustrated by the fact that for Catalina Island in 2005 desalinated water accounted for only 25 % of total water production , but desalination accounted for approximately 70 % of total electricity usage .
Also gleaned from the report is that the overall energy intensity ( 75 % local water / 25 % ocean desal ) of Catalina ’s water system is approximately 4000 kwh / AF .
The CPUC approved a 3 tiered rate , roughly calculated below :
• Tier 1 ( up to 2500 gallons ) : $ 2000 / AF
• Tier 2 ( 2501 - 10,000 gallons ) : $ 5000 / AF
• Tier 3 ( over 10,000 gallons ) : $ 7200 / AF
As a point of comparison , the average Huntington Beach household uses 9000 to 10,500 gallons per month .
I have seen many desalination reports quote water rates from Catalina of $ 2000 / AF .
It is now clear that using that figure is misleading at best .

Obama has prided himself on removing government waste and not allowing pork to infiltrate his controversial $ 787B stimulus package , but was he successful ?
According to many outspoken opponents such as Senator John McCain , the answer is no .
Looking at the overall package – most of it ( 34 % ) is much - needed tax relief which should help stimulate the economy .
But $ 308B of this bill is so called “ discretionary spending ” , which is where pork usually hides .
$ 48B of this $ 308B goes to the Department of Transportation for overall infrastructure improvement – another necessity that was brought blatantly to the public eye by the bridge collapse in Minneapolis last year .
This leaves $ 260B earmarked for what some consider necessary , but others consider pork .
Some of the most heavily contested portions of this bill are :
Aged Pork
Also known as the “ Blue - Hair Bailout “ , $ 650 M has been earmarked for coupons for the new digital converter boxes .
I have to agree on this one – I see no correlation between economic stimulus and digital converter boxes .
Pork on the Wall
$ 100 M was earmarked for reducing the hazards of lead - based paint .
I have a less expensive recommendation – DON ’T USE LEAD BASED PAINT !
Fossilized Pork
New green technology abounds and this bill DOES help a great deal in funding hybrid vehicles for government use and more .
But it is puzzling that $ 3.4B has been earmarked for “ clean coal “ .
Is n’t that an oxymoron ?
And could n’t this money have been better spent towards newer , greener , technologies ?
High on the Hog
$ 200 M has been allocated to “ design and furnish ” the Department of Homeland Security headquarters .
Are they planning to retain Martha Stewart ?
House of Pork
In effort to prop up the flagging housing industry , Mister Obama has extended the $ 8,000 first time homebuyer tax credit as well as various other incentives to further our American Dreams .
Not sure where I stand on this one , and whether it ’s green or not .
I mean if the houses are being built with local mud , I guess maybe .
Bacon – or Tasty Pork
$ 300 M has been set aside for NEVs , or neighborhood electric vehicles .
I personally support this one – why take a gas guzzler to the local grocery store to buy milk ?
Overall , this bill was MUCH needed and hopefully will hail a turnaround in our beseiged economy .
I just wish it could have been without some unnecessary items that will create generational debt .
Yet one person ’s pork is another person ’s economic mecca .
And many of the provisions that are near and dear to the hearts of the green movement are considered pork by those who support the coal industry , and use outdated TV converter boxes .
All this goes to prove that you ca n’t please everyone ….

Hours of Operation
For some strange reason , I 've been having a lot of fond memories lately of Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley , California .
In 2001 , I moved to the Napa Valley to experience the harvest and eventually settled in San Francisco for three years to work for a wine retailer .
My friends kept telling me about a wonderful - sounding place called the Gourmet Ghetto , and I 'm fairly sure I took BART to Berkeley on one of my first days off to see it for myself .
North Shattuck quickly became my preferred weekend spot to luxuriate , and only now do I realize how influential these excursions through the Trans - Bay Tube were for me .
Chez Panisse sparked my interest in Slow Food Cheeseboard changed the way I think about pizza , and Peet 's Coffee became an obsession .
All of that time I spent hanging around the original Peet 's on Walnut and Vine made me fanatical about roasting , brewing , and generally all things coffee .
I eventually moved on to the other - worldly coffee of cult roaster James Freeman and his superb Blue Bottle Coffee , and later discovered Ritual .
But I credit Alfred Peet and the North Berkeley store for making me a lifelong coffee enthusiast .
After San Francisco , I spent three years in Chicago , followed by another two in Boulder , Colorado .
With each move , I became anxious about finding a roaster or barista on par with those I 'd found earlier , but with every move , I have found excellent roasters and baristas .
In Chicago I discovered Intelligentsia , a roasterwith Peet 's ties .
And In Boulder I found that the religion of the Synesso reigns supreme , and Conscious Coffee taught me the details of crafting a perfect espresso .
Obviously , my anxiety arose again when I decided to return to my home state of Nebraska with every intention of building a Gourmet Ghetto to call our own .
My fear has once again proven to be unfounded with the discovery of Jon Ferguson and his top - notch brigade of baristas at Cultiva Coffee and Café Indigo in Lincoln .
I first heard of Jon Ferguson and Cultiva while living in Boulder , while flipping through an issue ofmagazine and landing on an article entitled " Coffee 's Lone Rangers . "
This is where I learned of Jon 's experience as a barista with Seattle 's Zoka Coffee and his roasting stint with Blue Bottle , names that jump off of the page for coffee enthusiasts .
I immediately picked up the phone and began ordering and drinking Cultiva 's coffee in Boulder , and after many cuppings and way too many espressos to count with my friends at Conscious Coffee , we collectively decided that Cultiva was on par with some of the best roasting in the country .
I am extremely happy that the baristas of Cultiva are equally skilled , and I am pleased to introduce them to you in this piece as we deconstruct the elements of the perfect shot of espresso .
One of the baristas at Cultiva Coffee in Lincoln is Ian McCarthy , who arrived in Lincoln via Chicago via Portsmouth , New Hampshire .
He trained with Metropolis in Chicago and Black Bear Micro Roastery in Portsmouth .
In the eight years I have paid attention to the world of coffee and chatted with baristas across the world , drinking espresso in places as far flung as Cremcaffé in Trieste and Monmouth in London , I have never encountered a more thoughtful and engaging coffee professional than Ian .
While Ian posses the skills to pull a world - class shot of espresso , his true passion lies in roasting , and he seems truly in his element behind the Diedrich IR - 12 small - batch roaster which Jon acquired from David Schomer 's Vivace Roasteria in Seattle .
Schomer , whom the Seattle Times has dubbed a " coffee prophet " and is seen by many in the coffee trade as a guru - like figure , is credited with perfecting espresso in America and is certainly a key figure in the influential Seattle school of coffee .
At Cultiva , the Diedrich Roaster still has a Vivace decal on it , which makes me smile every time I walk into the store .
Ian says that " it 's like having Schomer looking over my shoulder with every batch I roast , " which puts extra pressure on him to get it right every time .
Ian walked me through the entire roasting process for a small batch of espresso slotted for The Boiler Room restaurant in Omaha .
" Seasonality " is a buzzword in restaurants across America these days , and I was very pleased that Ian started our conversation with an explanation of the seasonality of coffee .
" Seasonality is the nature of agricultural products .
This , in my opinion , is cause for celebration .
Getting retailers and consumers to appreciate coffee as an agricultural product is an uphill battle .
Someday soon , coffee lovers will sit impatiently , twiddling their thumbs , waiting for fresh Yirgacheffe in December , not unlikein November , [ and ] first - flush Darjeeling in April .
" Ian went on to explain that variation in espresso blends is to be expected and welcomed with open arms .
" Flavors will change drastically throughout the year .
New seasons and crops mean completely different coffees from the year before " .
This means that Cultiva avoids any attempt at producing homogenized blends that taste the same to consumers year - round .
" [ That ] would be costly , difficult , and an injustice to the farmers .
If I taste something great , that I want to highlight in the espresso , then I will find coffees to complement it . "
A standard espresso roast is typically made up of coffees from several origins with coffees from Brazil commonly being a major constituent .
Currently , Cultiva 's Eco! Espresso is made from two parts Brazil , two Parts Mexican Chiapas , one part Ethiopian Sidamo and one part Sumatra .
Each of these coffees possesses unique characteristics which they impart to the whole .
This is not unlike the blending of Bordeaux , where Cabernet Sauvignon gives the wine its structure , Merlot its texture , and Cabernet Franc its aromatic complexity .
These coffees are blended together and roasted for 15 minutes to the " second crack , " which is an actual cracking sound heard inside the roaster which indicates a certain desired stage in the roasting process .
Importantly , the freshly roasted coffee is then allowed to rest for at least three days , allowing gas to dissipate .
A typical roasting batch is five pounds , which some may consider a small order , but this is the preferred batch size for Cultiva , where coffee is roasted in smaller amounts but more frequently .
Tamara Vigil 's family owns the Da Buzz coffee shop in North Platte , Nebraska , where she started pulling shots of espresso in 2002 .
Tamara was working as a coffee specialist with Whole Foods in Omaha when she heard that a new roaster had arrived in Lincoln .
After attending one of Cultiva 's roasting classes , Tamara made the move to Lincoln .
The result was Nebraska 's best barista joining Nebraska 's best roaster .
Tamara is now the manager at Café Indigo in Lincoln 's Haymarket , which is a partnership between Cultiva Coffee and Indigo Bridge Books .
Tamara is a United States Barista Championship Certified Judge , and has been a professional barista for seven years .
Being the coffee nut that I am , I spent a few days working with Tamara behind the bar at Café Indigo , soaking up as much information as I could about my second - favorite beverage .
Indigo is equipped with what is probably the best espresso gear in the state , including their awesome La Marzocco GB5 espresso machine and a couple of sweet Mazzer Super Jolly burr grinders .
Burr grinders or burr mills are the only way to get a consistent grind and are an absolutely essential investment for the coffee enthusiast .
The common propeller - blade grinders cut the coffee beans unevenly , resulting in an inconsistent brew .
These grinders can also heat up the grind , causing a burnt and bitter taste , so it 's best to demote that blade grinder to spices and herbs and instead use a burr grinder for your coffee grinding needs .
I learned from Tamara that the fineness of the grind is adjusted daily , if not hourly , due to a number of factors , including humidity and atmospheric pressure .
Also , I learned that most experienced baristas will have their grind and portafilters ( the baskets that hold the coffee ) set up for doubles .
Ordering a single shot of espresso will most likely mean that the barista will actually make a double and discard half of the shot , rather than changing their grind and portafilter setup .
Thus , to maximize your espresso experience , you should always order a double , which is what the best baristas are typically prepared to make .
It 's important that the portafilter is filled completely and evenly .
The coffee should mound up and look almost overfilled , which is then pushed back and forth with the flat part of the index finger .
This is one of the keys in preventing " channeling , " literally the creation of little channels that form in the compacted puck where water rushes through uneven extraction .
A double - shot portafilter will hold 18 - 22 grams of coffee , resulting in a 1.5 - 2.0 oz .
shot of espresso ( even less in a ristretto ) .
Next , the tamper ( another piece of equipment which can't be skimpped on ) is held so that it is aligned with the arm , and is gently placed on top of the coffee before applying approximately 30 lbs. of pressure .
This is another crucial moment in achieving a balanced shot as the barista must take great care in applying this pressure evenly .
If the resulting coffee puck has even the slightest slant , the water will rush to the lowest part of the puck , resulting in uneven extraction .
If all has gone well , it is time to pull the shot .
Omaha native Dallas Fowler is one of the barista - world 's rising stars .
Recently competing in the Midwest Regional Barista Championships in St - Louis , Missouri , Fowler impressed the judges with her performance , displaying her excellence in preparing espresso drinks , her knowledge of coffee , her professionalism , and her presence .
Dallas has her eyes set on the USBC next year and will be honing her skills in the meantime with Café Indigo .
Perhaps nothing is scrutinized more closely by USBC judges than the actual shot itself , where the selection of coffee beans , roasting skills , grinding , and tamping could all be for not if the barista over - or under - extracts the espresso shot .
The barista must so attentively monitor the shot that it is a wonder that espresso drinkers ever get a perfect espresso during the intense morning rush .
Never mind the one - or two - shot buttons on the espresso machines .
Almost all quality - minded baristas prefer to pull their shots manually .
Close attention must be paid to the speed at which the espresso is extruded from the portafilter .
The all - important color should display tiger - like stripes , resulting in a thick and persistent , a deep golden - brown color , and noticeable speckled foam ( noticeably so with the Cultiva espresso roasts ) .
This is the moment of truth where the coffee is extracted at approximately 199 to 201 degrees for 25 to 28 seconds , resulting in an espresso that tastes almost sweet rather than bitter , and rich rather than acidic , with balanced flavors like a chocolate - covered cherry .
Great espresso lingers on the palate for twenty minutes or more .
Great espresso gives us many of the same sensory pleasure as a great glass of wine .
When one considers the cost of an espresso versus , say a great Barbaresco , it 's no wonder that Italians regularly drop everything for sixty seconds to enjoy " " , a beautiful cup of coffee .

' The Jewish majority should be afraid '
guardian.co.uk
Fadi Mustafa is a successful young PR executive .
He has an office in Tel Aviv and another in the northern Israeli Arab town of Umm al - Fahm , where his family home is .
He encourages other young Israeli Arabs to break through the glass ceiling of discrimination .
He was what Israeli Arabs call a " straight back " , in contrast to a previous generation - the " bent backs " who were bowed down by the experience of the creation of the Israeli state and the wars that followed .
He will look any Israeli in the eye as an equal , he insists , and shows me a painting that was given to him by the Israeli artist Menashe Kadishman .
But right now Fadi is an angry man , enraged by the rise of Avigdor Lieberman and his Yisrael Beiteinu ( Israel Our Homeland ) Party .
On Tuesday , if all the polls are right , Lieberman will emerge as the most significant beneficiary of an Israeli general election campaign played out against the bloody background of the three - week assault on Gaza in which more than 1,300 Palestinians died , many of them civilians .
The rightwing Likud party of Benyamin Netanyahu will probably emerge as the winner ahead of the Kadima party of Tzipi Livni .
But most Israelis also recognise the wider significance of the moment : these elections are likely to mark the emergence of a far - right force , with a racist anti-Arab agenda , as the country 's power broker .
If Lieberman has his way - and his party has surged ahead of Labour to push it to a humiliating fourth place - Umm al - Fahm may be transferred out of Israel into the Palestinian Authority , something its residents forcefully oppose in exchange for Israeli " villages " , or settlements .
Its young people may be required to serve in the army , which they currently resist as they consider that army is fighting their own people in the Palestinian Territories .
They would , all in all , be required to demonstrate - in Lieberman 's own words - their loyalty to the state , both ordinary people and politicians , in exchange for citizenship .
But , even though his party is trailing Likud and the centre - right Kadimam , what Lieberman says matters .
It is expected that a Netanyahu government would find a senior post for him , possibly as either defence or foreign minister .
But his general influence is more important than any portfolio he might take .
Israel 's fifth elections in a decade have been characterised by incoherent campaigning by most of the parties and muddied by the effect of the campaign in Gaza .
Analysts believe that a large part of Lieberman 's success is that his message - racist as it is - has come through clearest .
" Listen , " said Mustafa , the PR executive , bitterly , " Who is Lieberman to say to me that I should be part of the West Bank ?
I speak Hebrew better than he does .
I know Jewish culture better than he does .
I got the highest score in Jewish history when I matriculated .
I doubt he even studied Jewish history .
" I work together with Jews in Tel Aviv .
We are the ones who are building the state together not him .
It is not for Lieberman to say , ' You are a bad Arab and you are a good Arab .
Who should stay and who should go .
He will not decide who I am , " he insists .
" I will decide who he is . "
It is not the first time that Umm al - Fahm has become a cause célèbre in Israeli politics .
In 1984 , the ultra- rightwing Kach organisation of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane - banned as a terrorist group - tried to rally here .
Then both Jews and Arabs blocked it .
At the beginning of the second intifada in 2000 , there were fatal riots here when the residents of the Ara valley , in which it sits , took to the streets .
But the religiously conservative town is regarded by Israelis with suspicion for two other reasons .
Since the 1990s it has been a stronghold for the Northern Islamic Movement .
Israelis claim , too , that prior to the construction of the separation wall , Umm al - Fahm was a point of infiltration for bombers from the West Bank .
Now , however , it has become a symbol of Israel 's growing attitude of harshness - not only to the Palestinians in the occupied territories , but also towards the Arabs in Israel itself .
A symbol of the uneasiness of the relationship between Jews and Arabs within Israel .
On the Arab side , the tension focuses on the discriminatory treatment of Arabs over everything from jobs to economic opportunities , as well as anger over the treatment of Palestinians in the occupied territories .
For some on the Jewish side , it focuses on the twin ideas of a fear of an enemy within , combined with a more general anxiety about the demographics of a state where Jews might - in the not too distant future - become a minority .
Lieberman 's discourse on loyalty and citizenship , as he defines it , has crept into other areas of the debate .
Last week , in response to Lieberman 's proposals , Kadima leader Livni , running slightly behind Netanyahu , framed her own vision of the loyalty question in a speech to 100 local mayors .
The speech differed only from Lieberman 's in insisting that ultra-orthodox Haredi Jews - who are also largely exempted from the army - should also do military service .
But it is not only Umm al - Fahm , a pretty little town of mosques and steep streets that is lacking in the Israeli flags so visible elsewhere - which is in Lieberman 's sights .
It is Israeli Arab politicians , too .
He believes that the parties should be banned from the Knesset ( the courts disagreed ) .
He has said they , too , should be dealt with like " other terrorists " and be tried for espionage or have their citizenship revoked .
Last week one of them was visiting the town : Ahmad Tibi , leader of nationalist Arab Ta'al Party .
In the back of his car , as he toured , Tibi warned that Lieberman poses a threat not only to Arabs but also in his view to " Jews and Israel " .
" The difference between Lieberman and [ Austria 's ] Jörg Haider and Jean - Marie Le Pen , to whom he has been compared , " said Tibi , " is that they were locals acting against immigrants .
Lieberman is an immigrant acting against the locals .
And while Umm al - Fahm is very much threatened , I think it is stronger than Lieberman .
I think it is the Jewish majority that should be afraid of this phenomenon . '
Said Abu
Shakr who runs Umm al - Fahm 's art gallery , which tries to bring Arabs and Jews closer together , voices a similar warning .
" Lieberman is bad for both Arabs and Jews .
We have to worry about Israel in general . "
While many Jewish voters disagree , there are some , still , who agree that the Lieberman phenomenon is a threat to all Israelis .
Among them is Leon Deouell , a professor of psychology at the Hebrew University .
Writing on the Yedioth Aharonot website
Ynet last week , he said : " Yisrael Beiteinu openly calls for undermining the most basic rights in a democratic society , including the right to express and promote one 's views .
Without these rights , there is no democracy , " he said .
" This is a clear and present danger that no voter may ignore . "
The residents of Umm al - Fahm would agree .
The road to Windows 7 for Vista - shy customers who want to jump straight from XP to the upcoming operating system wo n’t be an easy one .
Microsoft confirmed yesterday that Windows XP fans would be able to purchase a licence and media to “ upgrade ” to the new OS once it lands .
But this being Redmond there is a caveat : XP customers have to perform a clean install of Windows 7 .
This means wiping their computer hard drive ’s data first , which does n’t sound much like an upgrade to us .
Unsurprisingly , the transition from Vista to Windows 7 will be much more straightforward because customers will get an “ in - place upgrade ” of the OS that should mean their data and programs will remain intact .
“ I can confirm that customers will be able to purchase upgrade media and an upgrade license to move from Windows XP to Windows 7 - however , they will need to do a clean installation of Windows 7 , ” a Microsoft flack confirmed to The Register .
“ This requires the user to back up their data , install Windows 7 , re-install the programs and restore their data .
For PCs running Windows Vista customers have the option of an in - place upgrade of Windows 7 keeping their data and programs intact or to perform a clean install of Windows 7 . ”
Microsoft is remaining quiet on how much lighter an XP customer ’s wallet will be following the “ upgrade ” , but Windows plebs can presumably expect a cheaper price tag than if they simply walked into a store and bought the OS off the shelf .
The software giant revealed earlier this week that Windows 7 will come in six different flavours : Windows 7 Starter Edition , Home Basic , Premium , Professional , Enterprise , and Ultimate .
Many are predicting the OS will rock up at some point in 2009 , but MS has declined to offer a date when it thinks Windows 7 will ship . ®
Fruit growers in Israel have reported delays and reductions in orders from abroad since the military operation in Gaza was launched , due to various boycotts against Israeli produce .
Retribution ?
Israelis urged to boycott Turkish hotels Ilai Timor Email distributed in recent days calls on Israelis not to visit Turkey due to its objection to Gaza operation , includes picture documenting anti-Israel racism .
Only problem is photo was taken three years ago Israelis urged to boycott Turkish hotels
" We export persimmons , and because of the fighting a number of countries and distributors are canceling orders , " Giora Almagor , of the southern town of Bitzaron , told Ynet .
He said some of the produce had already been shipped while some was awaiting shipment in warehouses .
Almagor said a large number of cancellations came from Jordan .
" The produce stays packed in warehouses , and this is causing us massive losses , " he said .
" The longer the fruit waits in storage after sorting , the more its quality decreases .
We also have to pay for cooling the merchandise that should have already left , and the cost in considerable , " he added .
Ilan Eshel , director of the Organization of Fruit Growers in Israel , said Scandinavian countries have also been canceling orders .
" It 's mostly Sweden , Norway , and Denmark , " he said .
" In Scandinavia the tendency is general , and it may come to include all of the chains . "
Eshel says the boycott did not exist before the Gaza offensive was launched .
" It 's getting worse , and more voices can be heard calling to boycott Israeli merchandise , " he said .
" Until the operation began we had excellent business , though the economic recession in Europe was causing a slight fall in the market . "
He added that winter was an especially difficult season to be unable to export fruit , because the avocado , persimmon , and citrus markets are at their height .
The One Laptop Per Child ( OLPC ) project , which seeks to produce low - cost laptops for education , revealed on Thursday that it might drop the aging AMD Geode processor it has been using and replace it with ARM chips in its next - generation mobile computing device .
OLPC , which emerged from the MIT media lab and was founded by Nicholas Negroponte , has been plagued by an endless stream of technical problems and logistical blunders .
The cost of the hardware , which was originally targeted at an ambitious $ 100 , has climbed by 88 percent .
The software platform strategy has totally disintegrated , leading to significant friction within the organization .
Key figures have left in frustration and have vocally criticized Negroponte for taking actions that conflict with OLPC 's stated goals .
In January , OLPC downsized half of its staff and largely discontinued its involvement in the development of the Sugar software framework — an education - oriented software environment built with open source technologies that is designed to run on the Linux operating system .
Negroponte says that the cuts were needed because the organization 's large corporate sponsors are closing their wallets in the current economic climate .
In addition , the second Give 1 Get 1 program , a major source of funding for the project , fell flat and generated only a fraction of the revenue that was produced by the problematic first attempt .
OLPC could simply not afford to continue without major cuts and a serious change in strategy .
Negroponte attempted to reorganize the group and shifted the focus away from large - scale distribution .
The new approach is to produce hardware designs that can be manufactured and brought to market by commercial partners .
This approach is similar to the one that Intel has pursued with its Classmate PC , which has already shipped to students in greater number than the OLPC XO laptop .
OLPC says that they intend to use ARM processors for their next - generation hardware because the ARM chips will use less power and could potentially deliver better performance than the aging AMD Geode that runs the current OLPC model .
This seems like a reasonable move in principle , but it makes little sense when viewed in the context of the organization 's software strategy — though it 's hard to tell what the software strategy is even supposed to be anymore .
When OLPC began building closer ties with Microsoft and publicly criticizing Linux in press interviews , concerns were expressed by OLPC members that Negroponte might be preparing to abandon Sugar .
He vigorously denied it and claimed that OLPC was planning to significantly increase its commitment to Sugar .
Only months later , he reversed this position when he ended OLPC 's involvement in Sugar development and turned it over to the community .
Ongoing Sugar development is handled by Sugar Labs , which is run by former OLPC president Walter Bender .
The problem with moving to ARM is that Windows XP , which OLPC has increasingly been warming up to , wo n't run on it at all .
Even the existing , Fedora - based Sugar platform would probably require some tweaking .
Fedora 's ARM port is promising , but still somewhat experimental .
I suspect that the Fedora ARM port is mature enough that it could be adapted to meet OLPC 's needs within a reasonable timeframe ( an alternate approach would be to make Sugar and OLPC 's software customizations work well on Canonical 's officially supported ARM port of Ubuntu ) , but that would still require at least some software engineering .
It 's unclear if Sugar Labs is in a position to handle that kind of development at this stage .
Negroponte seems convinced that a Windows port for ARM would be advantageous to the project .
Microsoft might have an incentive to port XP to ARM in order to prevent Linux from gaining ground on the inevitable commercial ARM - based netbooks , but it seems more likely that Microsoft would rather invest in moving forward with Windows Mobile for that market .
Microsoft seems to have a clearly defined roadmap for Windows Mobile 6.5 and 7 , but Negroponte is n't crazy about the idea of using Windows Mobile for his device .
" Like many , we are urging Microsoft to make Windows — not Windows Mobile — available on the Arm .
This is a complex question for them , " Negroponte told IDG .
Some pundits are speculating that Google 's Linux - based Android platform could potentially be an option for an ARM - based OLPC device .
Although Android could probably be made to run on the hardware , it really does n't seem like a feasible choice .
As Google 's engineers have pointed out , Android uses the Linux kernel but is fundamentally not a Linux platform .
The Android stack does n't support Xorg and is not capable of running conventional desktop Linux software .
It 's absolutely not equipped to accommodate Sugar ( which is built with Python and GTK + ) and there is no conceivable glide path for making such a port .
The hardware plans — a device with a dual - touchscreen interface and an extremely low - power ARM chip — are intriguing .
I think that a device of that nature could have a lot of practical value if it 's designed well .
However , the general lack of direction at OLPC , the lack of staffing , the lack of resources , and the lack of a successful track record do n't really bode well .
The fact that Negroponte is publicly begging Microsoft for a Windows ARM port also adds to my skepticism .
The entire effort appears to have been in a steady downward spiral during the past year , and the potential for recovery looks slim .
The latest revelation — an unplanned architecture change without any clearly articulated software strategy — seems to further erode the odds of success .
5 Blackwater guards charged for Iraq massacre Andrew McLemore
Published : Friday December 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Five Blackwater security guards have been indicted on charges related to a 2007 massacre that left 17 Iraqi civilians dead , some of them children .
The federal investigation into the shooting remains under court seal , but sources say the guards have been asked to surrender to the FBI by Monday to face federal manslaughter and assault charges , ABC News reported .
A recent report suggests the guards could face up to 30 years in prison .
The State Department , which hires Blackwater guards to protect US diplomats and other military employees , has no comment on the development .
Blackwater and the Justice Department have both also refused to comment , CNN reported .
Blackwater 's involvement with the shooting became an anti-American rallying cry for insurgents and strained relations between the U.S. and Iraq .
But prosecutors face a hard battle , the Associated Press reported .
The law is unclear on whether contractors can be charged in the U.S. , or anywhere , for crimes committed overseas .
The indictment sends the message that the Justice Department believes contractors do not operate with legal impunity in war zones .
Blackwater maintains the innocence of its employees and said the guards were protecting a U.S. diplomatic convoy when they came under attack from armed insurgents .
Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell said , " We 've consistently said that we do not believe the guards acted unlawfully .
If it is determined they did , we would support holding them accountable . "
An Iraqi investigation called the killings " premeditated murder " and accused the guards of firing on civilians indiscriminately , CNN reported .
The State Department renewed Blackwater 's contract this year over strong objections from the Iraqi government .
Wire services contributed to this report .
Extraordinary pictures capture the moment a flying bullet tears through a strawberry , paintball and crayons
These are the amazing images that capture the exact moment a flying pellet comes into contact with its target .
Using an air rifle , a camera and a home - made flash , artist Alan Sailer was able to shoot at everyday objects and catch the moment on film .
Sailer used a laser to trigger the Nikon D40's shutter , while the special flash filmed the action in slow motion - despite the .177 pellet travelling with a velocity of about 500ft per second .
Berry nice : Using a laser to trigger the camera , Alan Sailer captured the moment a pellet hit a strawberry in slow motion
Sailer was able to adjust the delay on the laser , so that the camera went off at the ideal moment , controlling the amount of ' explosion ' visible in the final shot .
' The shooting is stressful .
It takes time to set up the shot and then , it 's all over , ' says the photographer .
' You may or may not have got a good picture and now there is a mess on your set - up , your camera , the garage . '
Having a ball :
The paintball explodes - making a mess - and a kaleidoscope of colour
' I have variable delay after the trigger .
So if there is too much mayhem , I lower the delay .
Not enough exploding parts , raise the delay . '
Photography that requires a microsecond flash to stop action has to be moving near the speed of sound and such events are usually high - risk .
To buy a fast flash is expensive , often costing many thousands of pounds , but Sailer was able to build one for about £ 200 .
He was exposed to high voltage , where a careless mistake could potentially be fatal .
Having a bauble :
The Christmas decoration shatters into colourful pieces

Science and Skepticism a Growing Trend ?
Shows based on mysterious investigations have been a staple of American television for years , and have had the public entranced by the logical explanations of Mr. Spock , fascinated by the resourcefulness of MacGyver , and wondering at the possibilities rattled off by Agent Fox Mulder .
But until this point , television was n’t necessarily concerned with the accuracy of what was represented , leading to episodes of Star Trek that made viewers pause and wonder at the plausibility of a giant hand in space .
We are at a strange point in time – one where what the public finds entertaining happens to be logic and science , even if the edges of the scientific accuracy are blurred .
At this particular moment in time , there are nine investigation shows where a scientist is a lead character .
Lie to Me , The Eleventh Hour , Fringe , Criminal Minds , House , Numb3rs , and of course , all three incarnations of CSI .
There is also a grouping of shows whose lead characters have honed real - life skills to become super investigators : Psych , Monk , and The Mentalist .
In fact , even though The Mentalist is only in its first season , it has been topping the ratings – and beating CSI , which regularly pulls in 18 million viewers .
By comparison , Medium , the show based on the life of psychic Allison Dubois , only has around eight million viewers .
And Ghost Whisperer ?
Just under ten million viewers .
In the past , I have slammed some of the science - based shows as being so impossible that I ’m continually shooting caffeine free Diet Pepsi out my nose when I watch as a shock reaction , but right now I ’m so awed by the fact that science is playing a part at all that my Diet Pepsi is staying where it belongs .
What is popular right now indicates a shift in public thinking that may well open doors for critical thinkers everywhere – and help bring new ones into the fold .
Maybe the public has gotten sick of the paranormal hullaballoo , and wants real answers .
This would seem to be the case , at least , if you have watched the most recent episode of House – ‘ Here , Kitty , ’ – which had a basis in the real - life exploits of Oscar , the psychic death cat , who predicted the deaths of several nursing home residents .
You can even see the shift in comedies , like 30 Rock , when Jack Donaghy explains to Liz that reiki is the art of laying on hands to improve one ’s life .
“ How does your life improve ? ” Liz asks , “ Do the hands have money in them ? ”
If you ’re reading this article at all , it is probably because you ’ve come to the JREF as a critical thinker and skeptic , and want that to be a major part of your life .
So the big question is :
What are we going to do with this shift ?

March 25th , 2009 ( 08:35 pm )
Sunday through today I was at the International Lisp Conference at MIT .
It was the first academic conference I 've been to .
( I 've been to IETF meetings , which have a strong academic feel , but are more oriented to getting work done . )
Sunday was tutorials .
I went to one on CLOS and the MOP , and one on ContextL , both given by Pascal Costanza .
The first was calibrated a little too low for a Lisp conference — Pascal said he usually gives it for Java programmers .
In fact , it turned out that I already knew most of what he said , since I 've read The Art of the Metaobject Protocol .
The talk on ContextL ( an extension to CLOS for context - oriented programming ) was more interesting , but focused too much on explaining how ContextL is implemented with the MOP and not enough on why or how one would use COP .
( COP is basically an extension of AOP , to be more dynamic .
Since " not dangerous enough " was not one of the reasons I was n't interested in AOP , I 'm still not convinced that COP is a good idea . )
Monday the talks started .
The morning talks were n't that interesting — the " software demos " , in particular , were a bad idea .
There was no software actually demoed ; instead , we had reports from people who had used Lisp in their projects and attributed their success to Lisp .
Well , yeah , we know Lisp is good ; that 's why we were there .
Things picked up after lunch , with a talk by David Moon on the macro system in a language he 's been working on — full - power macro systems are generally limited to homoiconic languages like Lisp , but he 's developed one that works by ( a ) standardizing the AST and ( b ) letting particular identifiers , when parsed , take control of the parser .
It 's an idea I 'll probably want to use sometime .
Other talks Monday afternoon included an interesting presentation on propagators , which are a dataflow - oriented approach to computation .
The tricky part comes when data may flow into the same node from more than one direction : if the data do n't agree , then backtracking may be needed .
The last session before dinner was a panel discussion on the future of Lisp — the theme of the conference ( since Lisp turned 50 last year ) was " the next 50 years " .
Everybody seemed to agree that , yes , if we want Lisp to thrive , we need to make it easier to find and use libraries , and we need to market Lisp better .
There was disagreement on whether the Common Lisp standard had held back innovation .
I think the best position I heard there was someone pointing out that , before the standard , half the community was complaining that the lack of a standard was holding back innovation ( since people did n't want to spend too much effort building on an unstable foundation ) ; this someone opined that the half of the community now complaining was the half that was n't complaining before .
After dinner , we convened for a debate : Are Macros A Menace ?
Nothing new there ; it basically rehashed the standard arguments — the pro-macro side saying they were so powerful they 're incredibly useful , the anti-macro side saying they were so powerful they 're incredibly dangerous .
It was interesting , though , to hear the details from a collection of people who really knew the topic , and could tell you what Lisp dialects had what kinds of macros when , over the past 50 years .
Tuesday morning , more papers .
The only two that really stick in my mind are one on reconciling CLOS generic functions with the actor model ( I do n't remember enough details to be useful , so I 'll have to read the paper ) and one on comparing the performance of object instantiation in CLOS versus C++.
Interestingly , CLOS was generally faster , sometimes much faster , especially in deep inheritance heirarchies — since C++ runs one constructor at a time , instead of initializing the whole object in one function .
After lunch there was a talk by Gerald Sussman ( coauthor of SICP ) on " Evolvability and Robust Design " , making the point that strict design - first discipline just can't work , and the best thing today is ( a ) build your components to tolerate slop in each other and ( b ) make sure you can improve the system later .
Tuesday night was a banquet at the Hyatt Regency , in a 16th - floor room overlooking the Charles ; that was nice .
The entertainment was n't something I can recommend , though : a guy and a robot arm ( not a real robot , just a machine ) playing chess and disputing the differences between humans and robots .
No real insights that are n't in , say , Asimov , but it was funny at first .
It dragged on much too long , though ; it should be cut in half .
Wednesday had some interesting papers .
First was one on an access control mechanism for CLOS — it was based on the idea of gates , as in Multics .
A gate is basically a function call that gets run with different permissions than the caller ( the most common example is a system call ) .
The all - in - CLOS implementation is n't perfect ( it 's still possible to subvert it by starting up with a different implementation of CLOS ) , but it points the way to what could be done with support from the OS and / or hardware .
Another was a study of evolving SAT solvers via genetic programming , which turned out to outperform the best known algorithms by a large margin .
There was also a talk on Bootstrap , an after - school curriculum for middle - school students , using Scheme in ways that let them do interesting things ( games , which can run on their laptop or on certain cellphones ) and that leverage and reinforce the algebra they 're learning in math class .
( It 's news to me that kids are taking algebra in middle school now ; I did n't get it until 9th grade . )
The interesting bit there , technically , was that they have the kids do all their work without mutable state ; instead , an event handler gets passed a World object , and returns a new World object with different values .
This will eventually allow for concurrency , for example , in ways that just would n't work if the program were messing around with global variables and such - like .
( It 's rather like monads , really . )
Some of the most interesting bits were lightning talks : 5 - minute talks , that anybody could sign up to give , on whatever they wanted to talk about .
( The 5 - minute limit was strictly enforced ; you then got 2 minutes to answer questions while the next speaker set up his laptop . )
I gave one on Adder , a Lisp - on - Python I 've been hacking on for about 3 months now .
That was fun ; I did n't get a whole lot of questions , but I did get people afterwards telling me it sounded cool .
To make it stick in people 's minds , I put out bowls of gummy worms at lunch , labeled " Gummy Adders " ( that was cvirtue 's idea ) .
I mentioned in the talk that , this weekend , I 'd be releasing the code , under the GPL .
So , of course , the first question someone asking why the GPL .
I had expected this , and was ready with an answer : " I do n't want to have that argument at this time . " .
See , there are lots of people who believe that a BSD - style license gives more freedom than the GPL 's viral approach ; I disagree — it 's really a choice between the freedom of anarchy and the freedom of a bill of rights — but the one thing that everybody can agree on is that it leads to long and bitter arguments , which would not have been appropriate for a Lisp conference .
Oh , and I wound up playing a little Magic — I had n't played in over 10 years , but Pascal Costanza had posted to the mailing list beforehand , asking if anybody wanted to play in gaps between talks .
I played with him , and Alexey Radul ( who gave the talk on propagators ) , and Mason Bliss ( who turned out to know dsrtao ) .
It was fun , even though I could n't come close to winning — I was using hastily - assembled weenie decks , which require a lot of time to power up , and I was playing against fast - acting decks .
( It seems that modern Magic includes many cards that let you get powered up faster . )
All in all , I 'm glad I went .
However , I 'm also glad I did n't have to travel for it .
So you say you 're a somewhat shady person , but you really want to confirm that trait for anyone who 's still on the fence about you .
Enter the Mobile Visor .
It 'll do the trick .
Easy .

Before the visor , people might have simply guessed that you were surfing porn on your mobile while at work .

But then , after you attach this loud , outrageous $ 9 black thing to your Blackberry , you will have confirmed what you 're really up to , and then some .
Either that , or you 're the world 's most paranoid business executive or pencil pusher .
Whatever .
It 's bad news all around .

White House general counsel Gregory Craig has seized control of Obama 's vetting process after a series of nominees with unpaid taxes .
But his wife 's business may also have avoided taxes .
Who vets the vetter ?
Derry Noyes , Craig 's wife , runs Noyes Graphics , a design business , out of the couple 's home in northwest Washington .
Between Craig 's work and hers , they 've been on Washington 's A - list for a decade .
PBS 's American Stamps aired a profile of her two days ago .
She designs specialty postage for the U.S. Postal Service , including a number of notable stamps .
One recent series celebrating the work of famous architect Charles Eames was featured in Metropolis .
Noyes herself is the daughter of architect Eliot Noyes , a friend of Eames .
Operating a business out of one 's home in D.C. requires a home occupation permit and registration with the city 's division of corporations .
Additionally , the government has instituted a new requirement for business license permits .
A spokesman at the Washington D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs told Gawker that no one has ever sought any kind of permit or registration for a business under the name of Noyes Graphics or at the Craigs ' home address .
By not registering Craig may have avoided local business taxes .
Private investigator Joseph Culligan looked into business records for Noyes Graphics , which is run out of the Craigs ' home , and found Dun & Bradstreet records showing substantial annual sales , a Yellow Pages listing , and an online listing inviting customers to visit the business at her home address ( now posted on Webofdeception.com ) .
And a source within the D.C. government has told Culligan that authorities have begun a full - fledged investigation into Noyes Graphics .
( The spokesman would not confirm or deny the existence of an investigation . )
An unregistered home business may seem like a " gotcha " scandal .
And were some new appointee to come along with this kind of problem , the public might shrug it off , even with the past tax scandals of Obama nominees .
But Craig was charged with putting an end to those problems .
As Politco explained it :
" A narrative was building , and the president asked us to be more vigilant in the vetting process , " said a source involved in the vetting .
Instead of closing a chapter , Craig has become part of the story himself .
The peacock 's tail gave Darwin considerable grief .
A single feather made him feel " sick " .
The bird 's cumbersome display seemed to confound the guiding principle of natural selection : that any evolved form should answer fittedness to environment .
Not until his last book , The Descent of Man , did he come up with a satisfactory answer based on " natural selection in relation to sex " .
Even in his final years , Darwin had little to say about aesthetics but his theory of evolution does prepare the way for a comprehensive understanding of what art is and why we make it .
Denis Dutton 's title is also his conclusion .
In 250 elegant pages , he demonstrates that aesthetics are linked at the profoundest level to our biological and cognitive prehistory , and that our " tastes " - those famously wavering and manipulable urges - emerged in the Pleistocene , and have n't changed in essentials since then .
For Dutton , cultural relativism is an academic parlour game .
Human arts speak to a universal human nature different only in plumage .
This is an interpretation that runs counter to the view - held by Stephen Jay Gould among others - that art is merely the by - product of an over - sized brain and should be excluded from the natural selection rulebook .
Evolutionary biologists have argued that human emotions emerged as a mechanism for orchestrating specific biological needs , harmonising potential actions in a useful way .
Fear is a way of getting the body prepared for potential dangers .
When risk and therefore fear are no longer aspects of day - to - day survival - no sabre - tooths on Hampstead Heath !
- fear remains with us as an objectless emotion , and evolution leads smoothly on to Hammer House of Horror .
Dutton wisely recognises this just does n't work , and not only because risk obstinately fails to disappear .
What troubles him is the separation of emotion , and thus art , from its causes , which remain ever with us .
In the same way , he attacks the relativism ( and shaky methodology ) of anthropologists who confidently , and self - protectively , announce that a given culture 's " concept " of art is " different " to ours .
Nonsense , says Dutton .
They either have a concept of beauty , or they do n't .
Like our remotest ancestors , we take delight in virtuosity , we admire personal expression and novelty , we enjoy intellectual challenges that give pleasure in being mastered , and we benefit immeasurably from the sense of communion and intimacy these experiences bring us .
This is art : then , now and always .
Is there a connection with the peacock 's tail ?
In The Descent of Man Darwin draws a line backwards from the present - day " orator , bard or musician " who " little suspects that he uses the same means by which his half - human ancestors aroused each other 's ardent passions " .
In his final cadences , Dutton manages to reference The Last Supper , the " Pastoral Symphony " , Fantasia , Duchamp , John Cage and Tracey Emin , and then scrolls back to the first daubs of red ochre on a human face .
How far apart ?
How close ?
" Preoccupied as we are with the flashy media and buzzing gizmos of daily experience , we forget how close we remain to the prehistoric men and women who first found beauty in the world .
Their blood runs in our veins .
Our art instinct is theirs . "

Here ’s that new trailer everyone has been talking about .
It looks good .
Surprisingly good .
I am now officially excited about this .
It looks different from the other Terminator films , and I am excited about exploring the machine plot .
Action looks top - notch , but that is par for the course for a movie of this size .
As long as McG can give me an interesting SCI - FI story with good characters , I ’ll be happy .

Typography is the art and techniques of arranging type , type design , and modifying type glyphs .
Display typography is a potent element in graphic design , where there is less concern for readability and more potential for using type in an artistic manner .
Type is combined with negative space , graphic elements and pictures , forming relationships and dialog between words and images .
Color and size of type elements are much more prevalent than in text typography .

From murder most foul to ripping off Crimestoppers , our corrupt cops run the gamut this week .
Let 's get to it :
evidence locker
In New York City , a former NYPD narc who resigned last year in the face of corruption charges was arrested Monday in the shooting death of his ex-girlfriend .
Former officer Jerry Bowens , 43 , was one of five officers arrested last year in a scandal in which they were accused of taking drugs and cash they had seized and using it to pay a confidential informant .
After those arrests , the Brooklyn District Attorney 's Office dismissed charges or vacated convictions in 183 cases involving those officers .
That investigation is continuing , but probably now means little to Bowens , who is facing a murder charge .
In Philadelphia , a jailed former Philadelphia police officer was charged March 3 with plotting from his jail cell to assault two suspected drug dealers he believed were cooperating with authorities against him .
Former officer Malik Snell is in federal detention awaiting retrial on charges he participated in an attempted robbery of a drug house and ripped off other drug dealers .
He is now accused of threatening " to inflict bodily injury " on the two men he suspected were government witnesses .
He also is accused of stealing $ 40,000 in cash at gunpoint from one of the men .
In Vivian , Louisiana , a Vivian police officer was arrested last Friday on charges he bought a stolen gun on the street and sold it back to a drug dealer when he found out it was stolen .
Officer James Arthur , 34 , went down after one of four rifles reported stolen in nearby Shreveport in March 2008 turned up in a drug raid in November .
The Caddo Parish Sheriff 's Department investigated and found out that Arthur had bought the gun , a Bushmaster XM15 assault rifle worth $ 1,250 , for $ 300 on the street , but had then resold it to a " known drug dealer " after checking a national firearms registry and seeing it listed as stolen .
In Erie , Pennsylvania , a former Erie police lieutenant was sentenced March 4 for repeatedly stealing cocaine from the department evidence locker .
Robert Liebel , 47 , had pleaded guilty in January to nine misdemeanors for the 2007 and 2008 thefts .
He was sentenced to at least 77 days in prison and between nine and 22 months on house arrest , plus three years probation .
Liebel admitted stealing the coke for his personal use .
In Lebanon , Ohio , a Warren Correctional Institution guard was charged March 5 with trying to sneak 200 grams of marijuana into the prison .
Guard Stephen Howard , 49 , was arrested two days earlier after being caught trying to smuggle the dope inside hollowed - out markers and a Subway sandwich .
He faces charges of attempting to convey drugs onto the grounds of a detention facility and possession of criminal tools , both felonies .
In Jacksonville , Florida , a Jacksonville Police narcotics detective was fired Wednesday over his role in a Crimestoppers hot - line scam .
Detective James Narcise was accused of providing inside information on the location of criminals to a female friend , who would then use it to collect the reward money .
The department apparently took that offense more seriously than his fatal shooting of an 80 - year - old man during a drug sting in 2007 .
He was cleared of any wrongdoing in that case .
Many strange things have happened in America , in this young age of Obama .
But none stranger , surely , than that the de facto leadership of the Republican Party has passed into the hands of a right - wing talk radio host .
The moment of that passage came on Saturday 28 February , when Rush Limbaugh was the closing speaker at CPAC , the annual Conservative Political Action Conference here in Washington , normally a festival for Republican true believers .
As I wrote in this space last week , the arriving delegates looked like stragglers from Napoleon 's army in the 1812 retreat from Moscow , shellshocked still by their crushing election defeat .
But when they left they were walking on air – or rather , the reverberating echoes of Limbaugh 's address , in which he reaffirmed conservative values and stated that he wanted the new President to fail .
For many , it was an unsettling moment : not because of the black shirt he was wearing ( Limbaugh 's bloviating has always had a whiff of Il Duce ) , or because John McCain , the party 's defeated White House candidate , had chosen not to attend .
What made it unsettling was that politics had not merely fused with entertainment .
It had surrendered to entertainment .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In some ways , this new hour of Rush is no surprise .
Ever since 1987 , when federal regulators dropped the " fairness doctrine " that required stations to balance competing points of view , conservative talk radio has been the trumpet section of the Republican orchestra .
And for almost as long , its acknowledged leader has been Limbaugh , heard on 600 radio stations and commanding a daily audience of 20 million or more .
In these 20 - odd years , conservative radio has come a long way .
By coincidence , on the very same day as Limbaugh was propelling the genre to new fame or infamy at CPAC , Paul Harvey died in Arizona at the age of 90 .
In many respects , Harvey was Limbaugh 's forerunner .
His show ran a mere 15 minutes , compared with Limbaugh 's three - hour blast every weekday .
But he offered his own mix of news and and conservative comment , with similar stratospheric ratings .
In his heyday , in the Sixties , Seventies and Eighties , Harvey had 20 million listeners .
But he was cheerleading not so much for Republicans as for the American way , at the zenith of the American century .
Never , one suspects , would he have lent himself to something like CPAC .
Limbaugh , however , is unabashedly , exultantly , partisan .
Indeed , when Bill Clinton recaptured the presidency for the Democrats , Ronald Reagan hailed Limbaugh as " the number one voice for conservatism " .
And Rush did not disappoint , stoking the voter anger that fuelled the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 , two years after Clinton entered the White House .
Inevitably , talk radio thrives in opposition .
No one had the hosts spluttering with indignation quite like Clinton , with his slippery ways and the wife they likened to Madame Mao .
George W Bush , on the other hand , ended up as much an embarrassment for Limbaugh and his kind as he was a liability for his party .
But now the Democrats are back , and it 's open season .
Limbaugh probably went too far by expressing the hope that Obama would fail .
But that has n't stopped his listenership soaring since the election , or his rotund frame from filling the void at the summit of the party .
Such power vacuums are normal here , but rarely as obvious as now .
Unlike Britain , America only has a real leader of the opposition for the brief period between nomination of a presidential candidate and the election .
The highest - ranking Republicans in Washington are now Mitch McConnell and John Boehner , minority leaders in the Senate and House respectively .
Neither is a galvanising figure .
Bobby Jindal , the 36 - year - old Governor of Louisiana who is touted as a future White House candidate , had his chance when he was selected to deliver the Republican response to Obama 's address to Congress , a couple of days before CPAC .
But Jindal blew it , with a performance that made even Republicans cringe .
And then there 's Michael Steele , the new chairman of the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) , who has a claim to leadership in his capacity as head of the national organisation .
But Steele , far from taking matters in hand , grovelled to Limbaugh .
One of the trustiest ploys in US politics is to demonise a celebrity figure of the opposing party .
The Republicans did so with Michael Moore , the documentary maker , whom they portrayed as a crazy liberal pulling the Democrats ' strings .
Now the Democrats are setting up Limbaugh as a similar target .
The day after CPAC , Rahm Emanuel , Obama 's chief of staff , proclaimed the radio host as the " intellectual force and energy of the Republican Party " .
The hapless Steele rose to the bait .
Nonsense , he said .
Limbaugh was merely " an entertainer " .
But when the entertainer hit back by saying that the RNC chairman had " got off to a shaky start " , Steele kowtowed .
He had , he said , been " inarticulate " – in other words : sorry sir , I wo n't get out of line again .
But it may already be too late .
Limbaugh 's supporters are outraged .
At least one committee member is calling for Steele 's resignation .
Such are the risks of crossing Rush Limbaugh .
He may not be leader of the party , but right now he is its most powerful figure .
For what other Republican has such an audience , not to mention communications skills rivalling those of Reagan himself .
But these same attributes make him a gift for Democrats .
The conservative base adores Limbaugh , but not many others do – certainly not the self - described independent voters who decide elections , and who currently dislike him by a three - to - one margin .
The louder Rush roars , the quicker the funds flow into the Democratic Party coffers .
However , there are dangers for Democrats , too .
" Always fight up , never fight down , " was Reagan 's advice for presidents : go after worthy targets , do n't get dragged down into the political gutter .
The Obama White House may be winning the mud-wrestling , but at the risk of betraying the lofty principles on which they won the election .
And one day , even Obama 's lustre will tarnish .
The Bush recession will turn into the Obama recession ( or depression ) , and even independents may think Rush has a point .

Cyanobacteria from a hot spring provided the key
Biologists have determined the structure of the cytochrome , a protein complex that governs photosynthesis in a blue - green bacterium .
According to Professor William Cramer of Purdue University in the US , the discovery is a great leap forward in the understanding of photosynthesis .
" Where we once could see merely the tip of the iceberg , we can now perceive the entire mechanism of photosynthesis , " he says .
The researchers say their work does not have any immediate applications , but it does provide an insight not only about a chemical process crucial to all life , but also about how cells handle and distribute energy .
Mobility , membranes and molecules
The key to the discovery was being able to crystallise cytochrome molecules , so that they could have their structure determined by an X - ray probe .
" Before we found a way to crystallise the cytochrome , we had a general picture of the photosynthetic process , but possessed only a fraction of a percent of the information we now have .
Part of the complexity of photosynthesis
The molecular layout of the cytochrome gives some indication of the complex motion of electrons and protons across the bacterium 's cell membrane , the boundary between the cell and its environment .
" Plant cell membranes are like the two ends of a battery , " says Professor Janet Smith of Purdue University .
" They are positive on the inside and negative on the outside , and they are charged up when solar energy excites electrons from hydrogen within the cell . "
" The electrons travel up into the cell membrane via proteins that conduct them just like wires releasing the energy a plant needs to stay alive .
" While this general picture has been common knowledge to scientists for decades , the complex motions of electrons and protons in the membrane have not . "
From a hot spring
The cell that provided the proteins for the team 's work was a cyanobacterium , a single - celled organism commonly found in hot springs .
The particular cyanobacterium used in these studies was isolated by Swiss researchers at a hot spring in Iceland .
While animals do not employ photosynthesis , their cells do make use of similar proteins for respiration .
The similarities could lead to a better understanding of our own metabolic processes .
" What we see when we examine these proteins is the nature of their partial similarity , " says Cramer .
" The differences can now be explored more easily . "
The research was published in the journal Science .

Thin -Film Solar Cells Get a Boost From Nanotechnology
March 16th , 2009 by Michael Ratliff
A new European Union funded research project called “ ROD - SOL ” aims to improve the efficiency of thin - film solar cells using nanotechnology .
The three year project has a budget of EUR 4 million and may yield a breakthrough for solar power .
Solar technology represents one of the most promising alternatives to traditional power sources .
Sunlight is free , available worldwide and produces no greenhouse gases .
While current photovoltaic cells have an energy conversion efficiency rate around 18 % ( Mitsubishi holds the world record at 18.9 % ) , this efficiency is set back by the extremely costly nature of producing such cells .
Thin - film solar cells are expected to dominate the future market due to their low production cost and versatile nature .
The goal of the EU - funded research is to boost the efficiency of thin - film cells ( currently around 10 % ) by implementing silicon nano - rods .
The ROD - SOL project hopes to develop and optimize the synthesis of silicon nano - rods onto either metal foils or glass .
Researchers propose that the tiny structures are perfect for trapping light energy in a way that it can be transformed into electricity .
I have been tracking the progress of thin - film solar materials for some time , and feel that this research will prove to be a definite benefit for the technology .

A full moon sends everyone a little crazy , but capturing good moon photos is an extremely difficult photography art to master .
A well done photograph of the moon can add atmosphere to a photo like nothing else , but most shots of the moon tend to be bland and disappointing .
So we decided to go and see what we could find in terms of fantastic moon photography .
Once again , the good Creative Common folks from Flickr have produces some exceptional photos of what is really an over - done , but usually poorly - done subject .
They certainly seem to buck the average trend with these awe inspiring moon photos .
As always , you can find some more information at the end of the post about photographing the moon and how it should be done to produce results like these .

Proposal : Enhanced String constructs for Java
Enhanced String constructs for Java AUTHOR ( S ) : Felix Frost ( felixf977 at gmail.com ) * OVERVIEW * Java is aging and failing to keep up with the needs of the modern internet age .
This proposal conservatively extends Java with some features found in more modern internet ready language in order to ensure its continued relevance .
FEATURE SUMMARY : This proposal extends Java with two new multi-line capable String constructs .
One is primarily concerned with embedded text , while the other simplifies the construction of helpful error messages .
The HAI ... KTHXBAI string expressions allow the use of embedded emoticons .
This multi-line string construct begins after the HAI keyword and ends with a KTHXBAI keyword .
It also allows the use of emoticons as literals in strings .
:o is usable as the system bell character ( ' \g ' ) . :) should be synonymous with character U - 263A ( White Smiley ) ( ☺ ) ( available from windows arial font ) :( should be synonymous with unicode character 0x2639 ( Sad Smiley ) ( ☹ ) :0 should be synonymous with character U - 203C ( Double Exclamation ) ( ‼ ) ( available from windows arial font ) :: parses as a regular : characters
The OMG ... DO NOT WANT string expressions allow for easier throwing of runtime exception .
This multi-line string construct begins after OMG and end with DO NOT WANT .
It converts directly into " throw new RuntimeException ( " < string > " ) ; "
This string also supports the embedded emoticons listed above .
MAJOR ADVANTAGE : Emoticons are common occurrence in most internet conversations .
They can be more expressive than words , and are fun to type .
MAJOR BENEFIT : This would help improve Java 's popularity among the new internet generation .
It will continue to stay relevant , as well as support feline developers .
MAJOR DISADVANTAGE : Associated costs in documentation , tutorials and overall language size .
The principle perceived disadvantage , however , is that it encourages , rather than discourages , the leveraging of hilarity in code .
There are some software shops in which humor is not appreciated .
For these shops , the author (s ) recommend using the traditional java syntax ALTERNATIVES :
It is possible to continue using the \g escape for bells , however this will likely decrease LOLs and general happiness of java developers .
* EXAMPLES * SIMPLE EXAMPLE : Exclaiming in Strings - try { if( unexpectedError ) { System.out.println( HAI O NOES :o KTHXBYE ) ; OMG Sistemz iz no gud !
DO NOT WANT } } catch ( RuntimeException e ) { // We will make it here } * DETAILS * SPECIFICATION : Lexical : HAI := ' HAI ' KTHXBYE := ' KTHXBYE ' OMG := ' OMG ' DO_NOT_WANT := ' DO NOT WANT ' Syntax : lolteral := HAI any_char * KTHXBYE can_haz_string := string_literal | lolteral o_noes := OMG any_char * DO_NOT_WANT
// Replace all occurences of string_literal with can_haz_string TESTING :
This feature can be tested by presenting the new java compiler to the developers pet cats , and determining the new level of programming ability .
LIBRARY SUPPORT : No library support is required .
REFLECTIVE APIS : No reflective APIs require any changes .
OTHER CHANGES : No other platform changes are required .
MIGRATION : No migration of existing code is recommended .
These new language features are mainly to be used for feline developers .
* COMPATIBILITY * BREAKING CHANGES :
No breaking changes are caused by this proposal .
EXISTING PROGRAMS : Because the changes are purely the introduction of new expression forms , there is no impact on the meaning of existing code .
* REFERENCES * URL FOR PROTOTYPE : No Java prototype exists at this time .
However , LOLCode [ 1 ] is the closest implementation .
OTHER REFERENCES [ 1 ]

In Torture Cases , Obama Toes Bush Line
Created : March 16 , 2009 15:02 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00

While Congress debates whether senior Bush administration officials should be called to account for the torture , humiliation and indefinite detention of prisoners taken during the “ war on terror , ” some of those prisoners are n’t waiting around for lawmakers to make up their minds .
A growing number of private lawsuits brought by former detainees against former Bush officials are slowly making their way through the courts .
And to the dismay of some of its strongest supporters , the Obama administration has , in every case so far , taken the side of the Bush administration , arguing that these cases should all be dismissed .
Illustration by : Matt Mahurin
What ’s more , Obama administration lawyers are not arguing for dismissal purely on procedural grounds .
In most cases , they ’re arguing that the courts should not second - guess the president ’s authority in national security matters .
They are also insisting that the right to not be tortured , to be treated humanely and to not be detained indefinitely without charge or trial were not clearly established back when government officials violated them .
Therefore , under the legal doctrine of “ qualified immunity , ” those officials should not be held responsible now , the Justice Department claims .
That stance outrages many of the lawyers handling these cases .
“ Torture has always been illegal , ” said Eric Lewis , a partner in the law firm Baach Robinson & Lewis , which is representing four British former Guantanamo detainees against former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
“ Affirming qualified immunity for torture seems contrary to the traditions of the military which abjure torture and contrary to the doctrine of qualified immunity which says you are protected within a large discretionary area , ” but not for acts that were clearly illegal .
“ It ca n’t be right that prior to Boumediene ” — the landmark Supreme Court case affirming Guantanamo prisoners ’ rights to challenge their detention in U.S. courts — “ anyone could have thought that torture was legal , ” said Lewis .
Lewis is among a group of formidable opponents the administration faces in these cases , including some of the nation ’s top lawyers and law schools making powerful legal arguments that former government officials are legally responsible for the torture , abuse and wrongful imprisonment that their policies directed .
In a federal court in San Francisco this month , for example , lawyers from Yale Law School ’s Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic argued that John Yoo , the deputy assistant attorney general at the Office of Legal Counsel during the Bush administration and author of several memos that effectively gave legal cover for U.S. authorities to torture prisoners , is now liable for the consequences of his legal advice .
The lawyers represent Jose Padilla , the U.S. citizen who was declared an enemy combatant and held for three years without charge or trial at a Navy brig in South Carolina .
Padilla ’s lawyers claim he was subjected to “ vicious interrogations , chilling sensory deprivation and total isolation . ”
And they claim that John
Yoo is responsible because he not only provided the legal justification for that treatment but , as a member of the Bush “ War Council , ” helped develop the administration ’s interrogation policy .
“ Yoo knew exactly what the natural consequences of his actions would be – because he intended them , because they were obvious , and because he was warned by others , ” the lawyers write in their brief opposing the government ’s motion to dismiss the case .
The Obama administration , stepping into the shoes of its predecessors , has now assumed the awkward position of arguing that the case against Yoo — whose opinions Obama administration officials have harshly criticized — should be dismissed .
The Obama Justice Department is arguing that Yoo , as a government lawyer , was not directly responsible for decisions regarding Padilla ’s treatment ; that allowing such legal claims against a government official would “ constitute an unprecedented intrusion into the President ’s authority in the areas of war - making , national security and foreign policy ” ; and that Yoo did not violate “ any clearly established constitutional rights . ”
The Obama administration is making a very similar argument in another case , Rasul v. Rumsfeld , now pending at the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit .
In that case , four British citizens who were abducted in Afghanistan and sent to Guantanamo Bay claim they were imprisoned in cages , brutally beaten , shackled in painful stress positions , forced to shave their beards and watch their Korans desecrated .
They were finally released in 2004 without charge .
They have sued former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other senior Pentagon officials for their treatment .
The case was dismissed at the urging of the Bush administration , but appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court .
In December , the court sent it back to the court of appeals in Washington for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court ’s landmark ruling last summer in Boumediene v. Bush that Guantanamo detainees have the right to challenge their detentions .
Rumsfeld , former Attorney General John Ashcroft and other former senior Bush officials also face a similar case brought by the Yale law clinic in South Carolina , where Padilla was being held .
Because
Yoo lives in California , he was sued separately in his home state to avoid potential jurisdictional problems .
Meanwhile , another torture damages case , Arar v. Ashcroft , involving a Canadian citizen abducted in New York and sent abroad to be tortured , is pending before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals .
Still other lawsuits , such as one filed by Khaled al - Masri , a former detainee allegedly held and tortured by the CIA for five months in Afghanistan , has been dismissed based on government arguments that all information about the case and the CIA program al - Masri was subjected to is a “ state secret ” that the government may not be forced to disclose .
( Other victims of so - called “ extraordinary rendition ” — or transfer to torture — are now suing the private flight data company that assisted the CIA in the hopes of getting around that problem , though as TWI has written , the Obama administration is maintaining — as the Bush administration did before it — that the “ state secrets doctrine ” should ban those suits as well . )
Many more such cases could still be filed : the Detainee Abuse and Accountability Project has documented more than 330 cases in which U.S. military and civilian personnel are credibly alleged to have abused or killed detainees .
Other detainees released from Guantanamo have told reporters that they are considering bringing lawsuits .
Victims Want an Accounting
The lawyers representing former prisoners say money is usually not the motive in these cases ; rather , their clients want the government to acknowledge that the harsh and humiliating treatment they endured was wrong , and to clear their names from the stigma of years in a military prison .
Jose Padilla and his mother , for example , are only asking for $ 1 from John Yoo .
“ Plaintiffs seek to vindicate their constitutional rights , ” their legal complaint says , “ and ensure that neither Mr. Padilla nor any other person is treated this way in the future . ”
The stigma and continued suffering of former Guantanamo prisoners is highlighted in a thorough report published in November from the University of California at Berkeley .
Researchers studied 62 former Guantanamo detainees and found that , having been labeled “ the worst of the worst ” by the U.S. government , they “ left Guantánamo shrouded in ‘ guilt by association , ’ particularly as their innocence or guilt had never been determined by a court of law . ”
This “ Guantánamo stigma ” made it difficult to find jobs and reintegrate into their communities .
Many had severe physical and mental health problems , but could not afford treatment .
And as the report emphasizes : “ To date , there has been no official acknowledgment of any mistake or wrongdoing by the United States as a result of its detention or treatment of any Guantánamo detainee .
No former detainees have been compensated for their losses or harm suffered as a result of their confinement . ”
President Obama has carefully avoided saying whether he would support either prosecutions of Bush officials or a non-prosecutorial truth commission , as proposed by Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) .
And as TWI has reported , proposals for broad investigatory commissions have so far not won a majority of supporters in Congress .
These private lawsuits therefore may provide the only means of finding out how the government developed and carried out its detention and interrogtion policies , and their impact on individual prisoners .
Still , they face significant hurdles .
Even if former prisoners can prove that the officials they ’ve sued developed and authorized the policies that led to their treatment , federal officials can usually win lawsuits involving work they did in government by claiming “ qualified immunity . ”
Under the doctrine of “ qualified immunity , ” federal government officials cannot be sued for actions taken in office unless they were intentionally violating clearly established rights .
Lawyers for the former detainees claim that the right not to be tortured , brutalized , humiliated , held indefinitely without charge and denied religious freedoms is well - established in American and international law .
The Bush administration , however , consistently denied that .
Now , much to the chagrin of many Obama supporters , the Obama administration is claiming the same thing .
The administration “ should not be arguing that there was not a clearly established right to be free from detention without trial , court access or abuse under the Fifth and Eighth amendments , ” said Michael Ratner , president of the Center for Constitutional Rights and a professor at Columbia Law School , and co-counsel on the Rasul case .
That ’s “ a grave disappointment ” and would “ justify many of the nasty Bush administration practices . ”
The position also seems to contradict earlier statements from President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder .
On the campaign trail , for example , Obama said about torture : “ When I am president America will once again be the country that stands up to these deplorable tactics .
When I am president we wo n’t work in secret to avoid honoring our laws and Constitution , we will be straight with the American people and true to our values . ”
At his confirmation hearing , Holder said unequivocally that “ waterboarding is torture ” and that “ the president does not have the power ” to authorize torture .
Now , to make the case that former Bush officials have “ qualified immunity , ” the attorney general is arguing that the law was actually not so clear just a few years ago .
While this may be the best legal defense these officials have , the contradictions could be putting the Obama administration in an ethical bind .
While it ’s not unusual for a subsequent administration to defend lawsuits filed against the previous one , lawyers usually try to refrain from arguing positions in one case that contradict their stance in another .
Then again , the Obama administration ’s position in these cases is consistent with at least some positions it has taken in other recent matters regarding detainees and “ enemy combatants . ”
For example , in moving recently to dismiss the habeas corpus petition of Ali Saleh Kahlah al - Marri , a U.S. resident held for six years in the same South Carolina Navy brig as Padilla before recently being transferred to federal prison , the Obama administration notably did not relinquish his “ military combatant status ” or the right to hold lawful U.S. residents indefinitely without charge or trial on U.S. soil .
And on Friday , although the Obama administration announced that it would stop using the term “ enemy combatant , ” it insisted that it maintains the right to hold indefinitely without charge or trial anyone that the president declares assisted al Qaeda or the Taliban .
It ’s not clear what the administration plans to call such prisoners now .
Legal Outcome is Uncertain
So do the prisoners suing the former government officials have a chance ?
“ So long as Yoo acted solely as a lawyer giving advice to his own client in good faith , even wrong advice , he will not be liable to those denied their constitutional rights , even if the denial is a direct result of the bad advice , ” said Stephen Gillers , professor of legal ethics at New York University Law School .
But many critics believe — based on the memos from the Office of Legal Counsel that have been released so far , on statements from former Bush administration officials such as Jack Goldsmith , who took over OLC and later denounced many of Yoo ’s memos , and on Yoo ’s role in Bush ’s “ war council ” — that Yoo was not providing objective , good - faith legal advice .
Rather , they claim he distorted the law to justify the actions the White House wanted to take .
If true , that could cause Yoo legal problems .
“ If Yoo stepped out of his role as a lawyer and distorted his advice in order to facilitate the harsh interrogation and other conduct , ” said Gillers , “ then he loses this professional immunity and is liable along with others for their violation of constitutional rights . ”
A still - classified internal report drafted by the Office of Professional Responsibility in the Department of Justice reportedly analyzes the memos regarding interrogation and detention produced by the Office of Legal Counsel during the Bush administration , and examines whether the authors of the memos , including Yoo , purposely slanted their legal advice to provide President Bush and other high - level policymakers with the the conclusions they wanted .
As for the government ’s argument that the court should not second - guess the judgments of policymakers making decisions about national security , Lewis , co-counsel on the Rasul case , insists that some decisions should be subject to review .
“ They argue that you do n’t want government officials doing their job with the threat of liability hanging over them , ” said Lewis , whose firm is handling the case pro bono .
“ But one would think that the threat of liability for torturing people is something you ’d want to put in there as a disincentive . ”
To be sure , some legal experts believe the court should stay away from judging policymaking , whether the ultimate policies applied turned out to be legal or not .
“ If we ’re talking about holding a particular individual liable , we ’re talking about drawing a straight line between opinions given and acts done , ” said Daniel Richman , a professor at Columbia University law school .
“ At the end of the day people who really were hurt by the government in ways that are legally offensive ought to have some sort of forum to get compensation or vindication .
But to go from there to say that part of that process should involve singling out one or two subpresidential actors in an area where the president really does dominate policymaking is a stretch for me . ”
As I ’ve written before , a broad investigatory commission , of the sort proposed by Rep. John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) or Sen .
Leahy could provide a means for torture victims to receive government reparations , as truth commissions frequently do in other countries , creating a more efficient alternative to these individual lawsuits .
Although it ’s impossible to predict what will happen in any of these cases , District Court Judge Jeffrey White , hearing arguments in Padilla ’s case against
Yoo earlier this month , seemed to at least take the claims against Yoo very seriously .
Yoo ’s recently released opinion concluding that the president can override the Fourth Amendment ’s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures , he reportedly said , is “ a pretty scary position . ”
Jonathan Freiman , a lawyer with the Yale law school clinic representing Padilla , noted that dismissing the case would be disturbing for another reason .
“ We ’ve seen the policymakers trying to get out of things saying we were just relying on legal advice , ” said Freiman .
“ Now the lawyers are trying to get out of things saying we were just giving legal advice , not making policy decisions .
So in this view of things no one is ever responsible for anything . ”
Indeed , former Attorney General Michael Mukasey , former Vice President Dick Cheney and others in the Bush administration insisted that there was no need for criminal investigations of policymakers because all of them had been relying on the advice of legal counsel .
If it turns out the advice of legal counsel was merely dictated by the policymakers , though , then maybe none of them will get off so easy .
Why is n't the economy getting better , even though the government is pumping trillions of dollars into bailouts and stimulus packages and intervening in markets left and right ?
Because the government is treating the wrong patient .
Let 's say you travel to the tropics and pick up a parasite .
You go to your doctor who gives you very powerful drugs that make you sick .
You go back to the doctor , he looks you over , and then adds more potent drugs to your prescription .
You go back a third time and say " Doctor , I 'm getting sicker and sicker , why is n't it working ? "
He responds " Oh , I thought the parasite was the patient .
The drugs are making it healthier " .
The Government is Strengthening the Parasite
(1) People making things or providing real , useful services ( 2 ) People saving money and ( 3 ) People investing the money they saved into productive businesses which will make more things or provide needed services .
riskier
The heads of the big banks and financial companies are also getting huge bonuses even though they have driven their companies so far into the ditch that they need government bailouts .
Even Paul Volcker says the incentive system is broken .
Indeed , the government is making the CEOs richer by giving them billions of dollars of bailout money with which to feather their own nests .
And credit derivatives act as a parasite on the real economy : credit default swap buyers bet that the referenced company will go down the tubes ( see this and this ) .
And yet the government is allowing the credit default swap trades to increase , driving CDS spreads against many companies and governments to reach all - time highs .
The Government is Poisoning the Real Economy
Not only is the parasite being boosted by government actions , but the patient - the real economy - is being poisoned .
Manufacturing has been shipped out of America for decades , and the government is still actively encouraging companies to move manufacturing abroad .
Taxpayers will be on the hook for trillions of dollars of obligations through taxes / or inflation ( even Bernanke has admitted that inflation is a tax , because people have less money in their pockets after buying necessities ) .
So Americans will be able to save less .

A financial report I encountered says that " President - elect Barack Obama , who takes office Jan. 20 , has said his first priority will be to pass an economic stimulus plan that will invest in public works and create or save 3 million jobs . "
I do n't doubt that it 's accurate , and so am horrified .
One thing he and his admirers have glossed over is that almost the entire infrastructure of the United States is already a vast , long - running " public works program . "
If there is a road so full of potholes that the cost of repairing damage to vehicles that use it exceeds the estimated cost of repairing the road ( and they now admit there are plenty ) , that fact is a stunning indictment of the public works program that put the road down in the first place and failed to maintain it ever since .
Government has had 100 % control of that infrastructure , ever since the market was almost totally excluded from road ownership " some time early in the 19th Century .
If it has failed -- and now its supporters say it has -- then the failure is a failure of government , and of public works .
For the almost - President to promise " investment in public works " therefore means that he plans to take a failed strategy and do more of it .
Some " change " !
Some " hope " !
If he was really interested in improving the infrastructure , he would auction it off to free enterprise and repeal all laws that impede its for - profit operation .
But I dare say his focus is not so much on that objective , as on the idea of putting idle hands to work .
Government has caused a major economic downturn , by pumping in artificial money that caused a housing bubble , and by forcing lenders to write unsound mortgages to make sure the bubble burst ( I do n't say that consequence was intended , just that it was so caused ) .
That financial collapse is already being allegedly solved by more of the same -- new injections of artificial money .
The patient is bleeding , so bleed him some more , that will do the trick ; in medicine , that 's called quackery .
And now , before even taking office , the activist who took a job in Chicago to urge unreliable borrowers to take advantage of those forced mortgage offers is now proposing to fix the crumbling public works of the last half century by dramatically increasing public works .
That , too , is sheer quackery ; and to the extent that it puts idle hands to work , it removes those idle hands from the pool of labor available to the productive sector if and when it is allowed to recover and hire people to do something productive .
Several years ago it was observed that on average , government is much less efficient than profit - seeking enterprise and the " bureaucratic rule of two " was formulated .
It says that by and large , if some function can be performed by ( a ) government or ( b ) unfettered private enterprise , the former will do it at twice the cost of the latter .
It does n't always hold ( sometimes the market does a bad job and sometimes government does a good one ) , but by and large , over time and over many functions , that 's the way it is .
It was an empirical observation without systematic proof that it must be so , but it's not hard to see a theoretical underpinning : people tend to work much better when their personal interests are at stake .
I grew up near a city known for its earthenware and fine china ; my first memory of the world of work was a report that workers in a certain roof - tile factory suddenly became several times more productive when they were changed from hourly labor to piece - work -- that is , they were paid by results .
Gee , whoever would have guessed .
So if Obama moves more of America 's labor force into public works and out of free enterprise , the first result will probably be a serious drop in productivity ; the Rule of Two will kick in .
The nation will prosper less in consequence .
That 's just the start , and it assumes that the objective is worth doing in the first place ; it 's not hard for example to " solve " unemployment by printing money to pay people , then having them dig large holes in the desert and fill them in again .
The Rule of Two merely says that if the hole - digging and refilling were contracted out to profit - seeking companies , twice as many would be dug and refilled than if government did it directly .
But ought they to be dug in the first place ?
That 's a key decision that ought not to be left to players the political arena , yet that 's exactly where the next President plans to place it .
The reason it ought to be taken instead in the market arena is that only there can " demand " be measured and satisfied .
" Demand " consists of the wish , plus the money ; we all wish to acquire good things , but someone else will work to make them available to us only if we offer something in exchange -- most conveniently , money .
Why would they do otherwise ?
If they did , they would be our slaves , contrary to the self - ownership axiom .
So if something ( a road , a bridge , an airport , a wind farm , a sewer ) is proposed , only the market can judge whether or not it 's actually worth building , for only in the market can true demand be measured .
But Obama's " public works " idea removes all those market indicators and substitutes political decision - making ; the choice of what to build ( or repair ) is left to those without any personal stake in the outcome .
Actually that 's not always true , for Pols are notorious for finding a way to profit from projects which they have the power to approve -- but even they sometimes call that " corruption , " and the latest to be caught with his hand in the till is Illinois Governor Blagojevich ; but the point is that it 's only in the market that a construction proposal is evaluated on the basis of what true demand exists for its completion .
To the extent that Obama moves more of them out of the market and into government control , the nation will suffer more waste of resources , more bridges to nowhere and fewer bridges to somewhere useful .
Then comes the matter of how a project is to be funded , assuming it is worth doing ' i.e. , that a true demand for it exists , that potential customers are willing to pay for it .
That might be a highway from A to B , with users paying a toll high enough to return the construction and maintenance costs as well as a profit to make the project worthwhile .
How is the capital to be raised ?
The market has an elegant solution ready : Capital is invested on the basis of how sound the business plan appears to those who own the money and will carry the risk , and how well it seems likely to yield profits in comparison to other possible ways to invest the same , fixed chunk of money ; in other words , the road - builders have to compete for the money on the basis of excellence , efficiency and anticipated usefulness to the community .
Sometimes the judgments made will be wrong ; but overall , there can be no finer way to allocate that scarce resource .
In contrast , in the political or " public works " arena , the capital required is merely stolen , by thieves who have enough guns and prisons to define the theft as non-theft and so get clean away with it .
The stealing as we know may be done by compelling the payment of taxes , or by borrowing today and compelling tomorrow 's taxpayers to repay the loan , or by simply printing it , which seems to be the current vogue .
The bill hits us all tomorrow , in the form of higher prices -- and if it 's not done with sufficient finesse , the process runs away Mugabe - fashion .
That fiat - money scam is perhaps the ultimate " public works " project .
Public works work all right , but they work only for the greater benefit of the government industry ; they extend the tentacles of political control to choke more and more economic life out of society .
Possibly Democrats salivate over them more than Republicans , but the difference is trivial ; it was the latter who begged the former ( on bended knee , if the tale of Paulson and Pelosi is correct ) for three quarters of a trillion stolen dollars to prevent the market rescuing the failing finance industry , as it would surely have done , and I cannot think of a single public work that Republicans have returned to the productive sector .
For everyone outside government , public works do n't .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Chrysler LLC is offering buyouts to all of its remaining U.S. hourly workers in its latest effort to cut costs and provide an exit for workers who are increasingly nervous about staying with the troubled automaker .
According to a letter from a United Auto Workers executive to union members , Chrysler is offering up to $ 50,000 to virtually all of its 27,000 U.S. hourly workers , along with a voucher good for up to $ 25,000 on the purchase of a vehicle .
The letter , which is posted on a Web site of one of the UAW locals , is from United Auto Workers union vice president General Holiefield , who is head of the union 's negotiating team with Chrysler .
Some retirement - eligible workers at plants that are set to close could get up to $ 115,000 in cash in addition to the $ 25,000 voucher .
The packages are similar to ones Chrysler offered to its hourly workers late last year , although the voucher replaces part of the cash that was offered in 2008 .
In fact , Chrysler rivals General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) and Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) also offered companywide buyouts to their hourly workers last year .
GM offered all 74,000 of its U.S. hourly workers and had about 19,000 leave the company .
Ford had about 7,000 of about 54,000 workers take various buyout offers .
Chrysler did not have numbers of workers offered or accepting the previous offers immediately available .
The latest buyout offer is another example of how the nation 's three struggling automakers are trying to cut costs .
The UAW agreed last week to eliminate a so - called " jobs bank " at Chrysler , as well as at GM and Ford .
The jobs bank had provided near full pay to UAW members whose positions were eliminated .
In his letter , Holiefield said he negotiated the new offer with Chrysler because of the rising concern among some members about the company 's future prospects .
He said that many workers may have accepted the earlier package if they had known about the end of the jobs bank and other difficulties facing the company .
The offer took effect Monday , and will run through Feb. 25 , according to the letter .
Holiefield and union spokesmen were not available for comment Monday afternoon , and company officials said they could not comment on the new offer .
The letter does not indicate how many jobs Chrysler hopes to eliminate , or how many positions would be filled by new hires .
Under terms of the 2007 labor deal , new hires at the three automakers receive a significantly lower pay scale , and with far less lucrative benefits than those who were on staff when the 2007 deal was struck .
David Cole , chairman of the Center for Automotive Research , said the fact that Chrysler was offering the voucher for a car , rather than all cash , in this round of offer , is a sign of the need to preserve cash , as well as the realization that workers might be willing to leave with less money in their pocket this time around .
" As people become more scared , a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush , " he said , adding that if enough workers chose to leave Chrysler , it could increase the chance that Chrysler would chose to combine with another automaker rather than hire new workers .
The offer comes the day before Chrysler and other automakers will report what are expected to be exceptionally weak January sales .
It could end up being the worst month for the industry since 1982 .
Sales tracker Edmunds.com is forecasting that Chrysler sales will plunge 48 % from a year ago , the largest drop expected among the major automakers .
Chrysler , which is owned by private equity firm Cerberus Capital , was in danger of running out of the cash it needed to operate at the end of last year until it received a $ 4 billion emergency loan from the Treasury Department .
Under terms of the loan , it must show progress towards bringing its labor costs in line with those at the nonunion U.S. plants of Asian automakers such as Toyota Motor ( TM ) and Honda Motor ( HMC ) , or risk having the federal loan recalled .
After signaling its intent to follow Apple 's wildly successful iPhone into the smartphone business , Dell 's first attempts to produce a phone have been rejected by the carriers for being too dull and lacking enough differentiation to stand out in a competitive environment , according to a report .
A research note published today by Kaufman Bros. analyst Shaw Wu said that Dell 's new prototypes , capable of running both Windows Mobile or Google 's Android , simply did n't interest the carriers .
Mobile service providers either want basic phones they can sell for free ( as the majority of LG units do ) or headline grabbing models that can stand out and hopefully pull new subscribers from rivals , such as AT&T's i Phone 3G , Verizon Wireless ' BlackBerry Storm , T - Mobile 's Android G1 , or Sprint 's hopeful Palm Pre .
" From our conversation with supply chain and industry sources , " Wu wrote , " it appears that it ultimately came down to lack of carrier interest and small subsidies , making it difficult for Dell to make a profit .
In our view , the last thing Dell needs is to enter another money losing business as it seeks to preserve its operating margins of 5 % - 6%.â 
Wu noted that those figures compares with HP 's 11 % margins and Apple and IBM at 15 % .
Wu said Dell is âgoing back to the drawing board in designing a cell phone with more differentiation , â that could âlikely involve vertical integration of some sort including software and / or services.â 
" PC guys are not going to just figure this out "
Dell 's failure to successfully step from the commodity PC business into the mobile handset market should come as no surprise , as smartphones requires expertise in software platform development , consumer design savvy , and portable device engineering , all things Dell has never demonstrated any proficiency in .
That calls to mind the quote from Palm CEO Ed Colligan , who said â PC guys are not going to just figure this out .
Theyâre not going to just walk in . "
He was specifically referring to Apple , which did " just walk in " with the iPhone launch , but carried with it a half decade of experience with the iPod and decades of experience in maintaining successful software platforms building highly customized hardware .
Some pundits have speculated that Dell may need to buy its way into smartphones , citing Palm as a target .
Palm is struggling to release its new webOS and the Palm Pre as the first phone to use it .
As sales of its aging Treo line collapse , Palm has been kept afloat only by millions of new venture capital injected by Elevation Partners .
Were Dell to buy Palm and inherit the webOS , it would come at the expense of Windows Mobile and Android , both of which are trying to line up new licensees .
Smartphone shakeout
Microsoft is being hit particularly hard , with two of its top names from last year ( Samsung and Sony Ericsson ) abandoning Windows Mobile for the Symbian OS in their new flagship phones demonstrated at this year 's Mobile World Congress , leaving Microsoft 's main licensees LG ( which also has plans to sell Android phones ) and HTC ( which makes 80 % of the phones that use Microsoft 's mobile OS , but is similarly planning Android phones and is apparently losing its business of building phones for Palm ) .
The smartphone market 's ability to resist collapse during difficult economic times , paired with the shrinking global market for PCs , has already sent other PC makers scrambling to enter the phone business , including Acer , Asustek and Lenovo .
However , the tough competition for attention in a complex market that requires building relationships with the carriers who control the retail sale of phones through service plan subsidies is not going to allow PC makers to " just walk in , " as Colligan stated .
Hate crime cases involving anti-gay sentiment shot up in Santa Clara County last year , a striking increase that a leading prosecutor attributes to controversy over Proposition 8 , the voter - approved ban on gay marriage .
Anti-gay incidents accounted for more than half of hate - crime cases last year — 56 percent — a big jump from only 15 percent in 2007 .
There were 14 anti-gay cases out of 25 hate - crime cases in 2008 , compared with only 3 out of 20 in 2007 .
“ My belief from having done this work for many years is that surges in types of hate incidents are linked to the headlines and controversies of the day , ” said Deputy District Attorney Jay Boyarsky , who is assigned to monitor hate crimes .
“ Marriage equality and Proposition 8 have been in the news , and we have seen an increase in gay - bashing . ”
A hate crime is defined as a criminal act committed in whole or in part because of one or more of the following actual or perceived characteristics of the victim : race / ethnicity , religion , sexual orientation , disability or association with a person or group with one or more of these characteristics .
“ Anyone can be a victim of hate crime , including white males , ” Boyarsky said .
“ We ’re not playing political favorites .
Certainly , we ’ve had Christian victims of hate crimes . ’
In Santa Clara County last year , hate - crime enhancements were added to criminal charges ranging from graffiti vandalism and disturbing the peace to assault and battery .
The increase in anti-gay acts in Santa Clara County saddened South Bay activists , who opposed the gay marriage ban that garnered 52 percent of the vote in November .
“ When there ’s a lot more information about gays and lesbians on TV or in the news , it brings out the worst in people who have an inherent bias against groups they do n’t belong to , ” said Leslie Bulbuk , president of BAYMEC , a regional political action group representing the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community .
“ It seems like visibility makes people come out of the woodwork . ”
But the former campaign manager for Proposition 8 said the statistics do n’t reflect cases in which opponents harassed and threatened supporters of the ban .
“ I certainly hope Proposition 8 did not result in more crime , ” said Frank Schubert of the group Protect Marriage .
“ But if it did , it did so on both sides . ”
Comparable data was not available for other Bay Area counties .
Those numbers will be released in July by the state Attorney General ’s Office in its annual hate crime report .
Boyarsky cautioned against reading too much from small statistical samples , pointing out that the vast majority of hate incidents do n’t get referred to the DA ’s office .
The FBI also collates hate crime statistics based on reports called in to police agencies each year .
More police reports are filed than actually become criminal cases , partly because there are no known suspects , Boyarsky said .
A review of that data dating back to 2004 shows that statewide , hate crimes based on sexual orientation consistently accounted for about 1 out of 5 of the police reports .
Incidents based on race or ethnicity are the most common .
In Santa Clara County , however , the percentage of hate crimes reported to police has fluctuated from a high last year of 28 percent to a low in 2006 of 9 percent .

I travel a lot .
And if you ’re a geek like me , you ca n’t go a full day sans internet access without experiencing some severe withdrawal symptoms .
Luckily , my iPhone , with all its WiFi and 3G goodness , has been instrumental in feeding my addiction while on the road .
But though Apple ’s smartphone provides the best mobile browsing experience out there , the small screen and touch controls still do n’t compare to the pixel real estate and tactile qwerty speed of a laptop .
Not to mention such luxuries as Flash compatibility , page caching , and tabbed browsing .
So the next time you ’re stranded without an open WiFi network ( but your 3G signal is going strong ) , you ’ll be glad you installed Addition ’s iPhoneModem 2 ( free to try , full license is $ 9.99 ) .
Unfortunately , Apple has apparently deemed the app to be in conflict with its App Store Terms and Conditions , so it is only available for jailbroken phones via Cydia .
Here ’s a quick guide :
1 ) Jailbreak your iPhone .
Download and install QuickPwn , an easy - to - use jailbreaking application for Windows and Mac ( the latest version works with iPhone OS 2.2.1 ) .
Run the software and follow the onscreen instruction very carefully !
2 ) Install iPhoneModem by Addition .
QuickPwn installs an app on your phone called Cydia , which is essentially the App Store for apps that were rejected from the official App Store ( or , for whatever reason , the developer chose not to release through Apple ) .
Run Cydia , search for iPhoneModem by Addition and install it .
Keep in mind you can only delete Cydia installed apps via Cydia ’s Manage - Sources function .
Now download and install the helper app on your laptop and you ’re almost ready to go .
3 ) Set up the network .
Run the helper app and hit Connect .
The helper app sets up an ad hoc wireless network that can be accessed via iPhone .
The default network it creates is called “ iPhoneModem ” and does not have a password ( you can change this in the Preferences of the helper app ) .
Now open up your iPhone ’s Settings and tap WiFi .
Make sure WiFi is turned on and select the network “ iPhoneModem ” ( or whatever you called it ) .
Type the password if you assigned one .
Open up the Modem iPhone app and everything else will configure automatically .
After a few moments the helper app and the iPhone app will confirm that a connection has been established and you can browse away with all the comforts of your laptop !
Shortcomings :
While 3G seems plenty fast on a phone , it feels a little slow on a laptop .
Also , most major web browsers work but not all are supported .
In addition , a lot of other internet applications are n’t supported , but for all intents and purposes , you should be able to browse just fine .
* Note : If you have n’t already discovered , jailbreaking your iPhone opens up a world of possibilities , including themes and apps that are n’t allowed in the App Store .
While it technically voids the warranty , you can easily return your device to its original state with the “ Restore ” feature in iTunes , wiping all traces of the jailbreak hack .
Republicans Make a Case for Prosecuting Bush Officials
Created : March 04 , 2009 13:26 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The Senate Judiciary Committee ’s “ Getting to the Truth Through a Nonpartisan Commission of Inquiry ” convened this morning to consider Sen. Patrick Leahy ’s ( D - Vt. ) proposal for a sort of “ truth and reconciliation ” commission .
The hearing was full of all the predictable , lofty statements from illustrious supporters about why a commission would further the American people ’s understanding of our nation ’s past and true values , and also demonstrate to the world our commitment to truth and justice — most of which I agree with .
But what was most surprising was that the Senate Republicans and their witnesses , in the process of ripping apart the idea , made the strongest case I ’ve heard yet for why the Department of Justice should prosecute former senior officials of the Bush administration .
Sen .
Arlen Specter , the ranking committee Republican , after noting his previous support for judicial review of the Bush administration ’s terrorist surveillance program , referred to the recent disclosures of Office of Legal Counsel memos as potentially supporting the case for prosecutions .
“ You ’ve had some rather startling disclosures , with the publicity in recent days about unusual — to put it mildly — legal opinions ” to justify broad executive actions , including homicide .
“ They ’re all being exposed now , ” he said , and noted that a forthcoming report from the Office of Professional Responsibility in the Justice Department will likely expose even more .
They ’re “ starting to tread on what may disclose criminal conduct , ” he said .
Rather than going off “ helter - skelter ” and conducting a “ fishing expedition , ” said Specter , “ it seems to me that we ought to follow a regular order here …
If there ’s reason to believe that these justice department officials have given approval for things that they know not to be lawful and sound , go after them . ”
The witnesses called to present the Republican opposition to Leahy ’s proposal made the same point .
David Rivkin , a former Justice Department official in the Reagan and first Bush administrations and now a partner at the law firm Baker & Hostetler , said a truth commission “ is a profoundly bad idea , a dangerous idea , both for policy and for me as a lawyer for legal and constitutional reasons . ”
Objecting that Congress would be improperly delegating its oversight power , and that witnesses would be called out for criminal conduct without the right to defend themselves in a trial , he said : “ this is to establish a body to engage in what in essence is a criminal investigation of former Bush administration officials , ” and that “ the subject matter areas , which such a commission would investigate – among them the interrogation and handling of captured enemy combatants and the gathering of electronic intelligence – are heavily regulated by comprehensive criminal statutes , and ensures that the commission ’s activities would inevitably invade areas traditionally the responsibility of the Department of Justice . ”
Jeremy Rabkin , a law professor at George Mason University who also opposes Leahy ’s idea , similarly insisted that in the United States , where we have a fully developed legal system , prosecutions — not truth commissions — are the appropriate course .
A truth commission is something that countries like South Africa and Chile have had , not something we should do here , he said .
“ In those countries they had to have commissions because they could n’t have prosecutions .
Peace was really in doubt in those countries … they had to trade off prosecutions for peace .
We ’re not in that situation .
If people think we need to have prosecutions , we should have prosecutions . ”
Proponents of the truth commission idea , meanwhile , while not ruling out the idea of prosecutions , saw a truth commission as serving a different , and broader , purpose .
But it was surprising that , at a hearing cautiously called to discuss “ a nonpartisan commission of inquiry , ” we heard the strongest case yet for the prosecution of former Bush administration officials — being made by Republicans .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Negotiators have worked out a disagreement between the Senate and House over education funding in the economic stimulus bill , Democratic leadership sources said Wednesday evening .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to iron out a snag in the bill .
Details on how they settled it were not immediately available .
Word that the final snags were being untangled came after back - and - forth reports Wednesday on the massive relief package 's status .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had announced a compromise bill early Wednesday afternoon .
But about 90 minutes later , aides to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that , although Pelosi had known Reid was planning the announcement , the two were meeting again to iron out differences over a provision on education spending .
Senators had cut a plan to provide direct funding for school construction -- a priority for some Democrats -- and instead set aside money for governors to use on school modernization and rehabilitation .
House Democrats did not believe that money would ultimately be targeted enough to school districts in need .
In the version announced by Reid , $ 10 billion had been added to the $ 44 billion previously allocated toward " state stabilization " to help school infrastructure .
Using that state stabilization vehicle , the money would be given to governors to parcel out .
But aides say House members would rather this $ 10 billion go through Title I , which would allocate the money based on need .
Senate and House leaders and Obama administration officials met to find yet another compromise .
After the disagreement was cleared , President Obama issued a statement saying : " I want to thank the Democrats and Republicans in Congress who came together around a hard - fought compromise that will save or create more than 3.5 million jobs and get our economy back on track . "
Four Democratic sources told CNN that Pelosi was angry when Reid called to tell her he was making his first announcement that the deal was done .
One administration official said House leaders did n't like the idea that Senate Republicans were effectively dictating to them the terms of the proposal .
After Reid announced the first compromise , Sen. Max Baucus , D - Montana , said it could be taken up by the two houses as early as Friday , meeting Obama 's timetable of having the bill on his desk by Monday .
" The bills were really quite similar , and I 'm pleased to announce that we 've been able to bridge those differences , " Reid said .
" Like any negotiation , this involved give and take , and if you do n't mind my saying so , that 's an understatement . "
He praised the three " brave " GOP senators who broke ranks to support the bill : Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine and Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania .
Watch Reid and Collins describe the deal »
Of the 219 Republicans in Congress , they were the only three to back the bill .
" Today we have shown that , working together , we can address the enormous economic crisis facing our country , " Collins said .
She said the compromise bill has a price of $ 789 billion , less than both the House and Senate versions .
Reid said this middle ground creates more jobs than the original Senate bill , and spends less than the original House bill .
Sen .
Ben Nelson , D - Nebraska , summed it up as a " jobs bill . "
" Today you might call us the ' jobs squad , ' " said Nelson , one of the key negotiators on the compromise .
" Because that 's what we 're attempting to do : to make sure that people will have the opportunity to hang on to their jobs that they have today , and they 'll be able to get jobs if they lose their jobs . "
Collins on Wednesday provided details of some of the measures she expects to be in the final bill :
The homeowner tax credit has been kept but significantly reduced .
The Senate version proposed a $ 15,000 credit , double that of the House bill .
A tax credit for people who buy a car in 2009 has been reduced .
Funding to patch the Alternative Minimum Tax is included .
The tax was intended to target the wealthy but now hits many middle - class families .
$ 90 billion of increased Medicaid match to states .
$ 150 billion for infrastructure , including $ 49.6 for transportation infrastructure .
Nelson confirmed that tax breaks for workers that had been set at $ 1,000 per family or $ 500 per individual would be scaled back to $ 800 per family and $ 400 per individual .
Multiple Democratic sources said 35 percent of the bill deals with tax cuts , 65 percent with spending .
Democrats in the Senate must hold on to at least two Republican votes to get the 60 votes needed to keep GOP opponents from blocking the bill .
Not a single Republican voted in support of the House version of the bill , but the House Democrats had enough votes to pass it , despite 11 Democrats voting against it .

Noting those numbers , Sen. Lindsey Graham , R - South Carolina , said the agreement is hardly bipartisan .
" You could n't pick up one Republican in the House , and you lost 11 Democrats .
You 've lost more Democrats than you 've picked up Republicans .
That 's not bipartisanship , " he said Wednesday on CNN's " The Situation Room . "
The three Republican senators who voted in favor of the package indicated Wednesday that they were pleased with the agreement .
" As I said , unless the bill remained virtually intact from what the agreement was last Friday , my support would be conditional on that , and we got there , " said Specter .
" I think it is an important component of putting America back on its feet . "
Watch Specter say , " We hung tough " »
Specter , who is up for re-election in 2010 , said earlier Wednesday he 's aware of the political danger he 's putting himself in , but action is needed to pump up the ailing economy .
" I understand the peril , but I did n't run for the United States Senate to further my own political interests , " he said on CNN's " American Morning . "
Asked about the possible political backlash from his vote supporting the bill , Specter said , " It 's a good plan .
Not a perfect plan , but a good plan and I 'll take my chances . "

The founding conference of the Nouveau Parti anticapitaliste ( NPA , New Anti-Capitalist Party ) was held just outside Paris over the weekend of February 6 - 8 , 2009 .
[ For more analysis of the NPA , click HERE . ]
The conference marks the conclusion of a process initiated following the encouraging election results ( 1.5 million votes ) of the Ligue communiste révolutionnaire 's ( LCR , Revolutionary Communist League ) candidate in the 2007 presidential elections , 34 - year - old postal worker Olivier Besancenot .
This process has involved thousands of activists and interested individuals organised in hundreds of committees across France .
The new party begins its life with some 10,000 members and in a context of deepening economic crisis and a big wave of strikes and protests against the hard - right government of president Nicolas Sarkozy .
This is a reportback from two Toronto - based socialists who attended the founding conference , and Paris - based NPA member and teachers ' union activist Miguel Concy .
It was organised by the Socialist Project and Toronto New Socialists .
The City of Subiaco , in Perth 's inner west , has warned a young man to stop hosting ping pong tournaments at his house in suburban Shenton Park .
On March 23 , council building and health services manager Wayne Chant wrote to Tim Wood explaining that table tennis paraphernalia was regarded as " specified equipment " under the council 's noise regulations .
The offending weapons ... ping pong bats and balls .
Mr Chant wrote that a neighbour had lodged a written complaint about allegedly illicit ping pong activity at Mr Wood 's Murchinson Street house .
The council officer formally warned Mr Wood not to play table tennis for more than two hours a day , or in an unreasonable manner .

Western Digital Releases Energy - Efficient 2TB Hard Drive
January 29th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
I do n’t have nearly enough information on my hard drive to make the WD Caviar Green a worthwhile purchase , but my inner geek is still excited about its release .
The 2TB hard drive features IntelliSeek technology to find the drive ’s optimal speed at any given point in time .
That means the Caviar Green only uses as much energy as it needs , resulting in energy savings of up to 40 percent compared to standard desktop drives .
The Caviar Green also utilizes Western Digital ’s GreenPower technology to ensure low temperatures for increased reliability and quiet operation .
And of course , the hard drive has impressive stats : 32 MB of cache , 500 GB per platter , and 26 to 29 dBA of noise from idle to seek mode .
The drive was released earlier this week for $ 299 .
1 TB and 1.5 TB versions will also be available .

OK , everybody thinks clean energy is a good idea .
But with electricity demand rising , new technology expensive and ever - increasing challenges to existing renewables like hydropower , can we afford it ?
Yes .
Dirty coal plants can be mothballed while providing more electricity for homes , businesses and public transport by asking consumers to pay less than a penny more per kilowatt hour , says a new report from the Northwest Energy Coalition .
The key is energy efficiency .
The group suggests that the region can save enough energy to meet 60 % of the region 's new power needs , and still cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 % by 2050 .
The prescription includes tax incentives for recycling waste heat from industrial on - site electrical generation , better top - to - bottom efficiencies , and development of 7-10,000 megawatts of new wind , solar , geothermal , biomass and other alternative energy by 2050 .
It wo n't cost that much more than building 25,000 new megawatts of capacity in new coal or gas , the report suggests .
To get there will take a federal mandate to the Bonneville Power Administration , which operates the Northwest hydropower system , to set an annual floor of 340 average megawatts of new energy efficiency and 270 megawatts of new renewable energy .
New state renewable energy standards must be in place , and coal plants must be phased out .
" Energy efficiency is the lowest cost and most environmentally responsible resource that 's available , " said Stan Price , director of the Northwest Energy Efficiency Council , an industry group that of course will benefit from all those weatherization contracts -- as will the regional economy , the report sponsors say , from all the jobs and products needed to get to energy nirvana .

Taxpayer cash is going to rescue so many people these days that it is hard to sort the truly awful ideas from the merely terrible .
Then we heard the doozy out of Pennsylvania , where Governor Ed Rendell has discussed a state bailout of the company that owns a pair of Philadelphia newspapers , the Inquirer and the Daily News .
Philadelphia Media Holdings is in default on its loans , having missed debt payments going back to June .
With no buyers knocking on the door , the Philadelphia Bulletin has reported , owner Brian Tierney went hat - in - hand to the Governor 's office to talk about giving the paper some public help .
Mr. Tierney wo n't comment on the record , while Mr. Rendell 's spokesman tells us the conversations were n't specific but that state help is a possibility .
Times are tough , but as they say in Philadelphia , this is nuts in eight different ways .
Starting as a business proposition :
When McClatchy bought Knight Ridder in 2006 , the Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News were spun off and sold for $ 515 million to investors led by Mr. Tierney , who made his money in advertising and public relations .
The buyers put up around 20 % in equity and took on some $ 400 million in debt , enough leverage to raise eyebrows even before the credit crunch .
Mr. Tierney is now no different than thousands of other Americans who borrowed too heavily during the credit mania .
Mr. Rendell 's spokesman , Chuck Ardo , plays down the possibility of the state government holding an equity share in the newspaper , but says direct state investment " is possible . "
Even if the bailout is designed simply to help the newspaper meet its default payments until the economy recovers , that is still a highly speculative taxpayer bet .
Everyone knows the big-city newspaper business model is under pressure , to put it mildly .
The Tribune Company and the Minneapolis Star Tribune have both filed for bankruptcy , while the publisher of Connecticut papers including the New Haven Register suspended its debt payments in December .
Philadelphia is a great city , but we 're not sure why taxpayers in Pittsburgh should finance readers on the other side of the state .
Mr. Ardo told us the state has an interest in saving the paper to protect jobs as well as a free press .
Newspapers are " the lifeblood of democracy , " he says .

Before I leave for a long - overdue vacation in Europe , I 'm going to get my iPhone in travel - ready condition .
Read on to find out how .
I 've been anticipating this vacation for a long time .
But in my planning , there was just one thing I was n't looking forward to : Doing without my iPhone , even if only for 10 days .
After a year and a half of integrating the device into my lifestyle , I decided it just was n't worth it .
Now , before you judge me as a tech - dependent freak , allow me to explain : I 'm going to Paris and London — two cities where an iPhone could certainly be useful just to find my way around ( as opposed to lugging around travel books ) .
If I were going somewhere like India , where an iPhone would disturb my spiritual journey toward self - discovery , then yes , I would more than happily leave the Jesus phone at home .
But given the circumstances , my iPhone 's coming with me .
Sure , I could just enable the iPhone 's data roaming feature , but I do n't want to come back home with a $ 2,100 bill from AT&T .
To roam internationally without breaking the bank , you need to take a few steps before you go : unlock and jailbreak the phone , get a pay - as - you - go SIM card that will work in the country you 'll be visiting , and preload your iPhone with useful travel apps .
Here 's a guide on what you need to do to travel with your iPhone to Europe — followed by some applications that should be helpful for your trip .
__ 1 . Jailbreak and unlock your iPhone
__
Before you get on the plane , you need to both hack and unlock your iPhone .
( Note : Jailbreaking is not illegal , although Apple is trying to make it so . )
Otherwise , you 'll end up sticking in an international SIM card , only to be greeted with the " Invalid SIM " message .
( Or if you 're on AT&T and you opt for an international roaming plan , you 'll likely end up paying more than your plane tickets just to use your iPhone . )
To clarify , I own a first - generation iPhone .
And I 've never felt better about not upgrading , because unlocking the iPhone 3G to work overseas , according to my peers , is a nightmare , including the complicated unlock process and the humongous 3G data fees .
On the other hand , the unlock process for the first - generation iPhone is extremely easy and reliable , and I can get by with cheaper 2G data services .
To simultaneously unlock and Jailbreak my original iPhone , I followed a very clear , intuitive tutorial at HackThatPhone .
It took about 45 minutes to perform .
In summary , the process involved downloading software called PwnageTool and configuring it to build custom firmware to manipulate the iPhone into working with other carriers .
( I can't wait to get away from AT&T 's shoddy service . )
2 . Find a pre-paid SIM card
Orange has the best data plan in Europe for 9 € ( $ 11 ) a month unlimited ; for calls you can opt for a pay - as - you - go plan .
That sounds great for me , because I 'd only make calls for an emergency , and for data I do n't want to get charged up the wazoo when I 'm looking up maps and subway schedules .
The best , cheapest way to score a SIM ?
Craigslist , says my tech journalist colleague Cyrus Farivar , who currently lives in France .
Otherwise , a SIM brand new costs about 20 € ( $ 25 ) .
I 'll be checking Craigslist periodically , but if that does n't work out in the next week I 'll just order a new one .
__
3. Download travel apps__
Here 's the most fun part — downloading apps for your trip .
Here are the ones I dug up :
Currency ( free ) : Obviously , a calculator that does currency conversions for you .
London Tube ( $ 1 ) :
An app that displays a map of the London Tube , as well as Subway line routes and directions to stations .
Metro Paris ( $ 1 ) : An app that displays a map of the Paris Metro , as well as the line routes and directions to stations .
Pano ( $ 3 ) : An app that works with your iPhone camera to create panoramas .
( See an earlier review of Pano from Wired.com 's Michael Calore . )
Cycorder ( free , for Jailbroken iPhones only ) :
An unauthorized video recorder for iPhone .
Any more tips from other Euro - bound iPhone users out there ?

While searching the internet I came across your article on the Leno - Palace tickets on ebay .
Yes , I was the seller .
While I never thought it would get to the point of what it 's become , you are right .
Being unemployed I would rather have the money from the tickets sold to help me .
I do feel if Mr. Leno wanted to help the ones down on their luck , he should n't object to someone trying to help me .
I just wanted to comment on your article , this whole situation just makes me chuckle .
It ’s spring , and birthday party season is upon our household , time again for my outrageous acts of culinary cluelessness .
A few years ago , you may recall , I regaled my daughter Julia and her friends with flat - as - a - pancake profiteroles .
This year , at Emilie ’s request , I made poulet à l’estragon ( tarragon chicken in our house ) for a noisy gathering of 11 .
This would not , for most people , be any kind of particularly heroic act .
After all , any idiot can roast a chicken — even three chickens , as I was convinced I had to do — add some potatoes and whisk some crème fraîche into melted fat .
But I am not just any idiot and cooking , for me , under the best of circumstances , is always a kind of adventure sport , fraught with mystery and peril .
This year , the mystery was how to cook three chickens simultaneously .
The peril lay in fitting all three into the oven in parallel .
The excitement came when one burst into flames and scorched its accompanying potatoes .
The other two birds sort of steamed their way toward doneness .
Why this happened , I do not know .
It is not given to me to know such things .
As the night progressed , though , and the revelers settled down to watch a movie , and I lay down , exhausted , on the couch to attempt to read the paper , I was visited by a revelation .
I closed my eyes and first saw leaden cream puffs .
I heard the voices of Times readers , particularly those who have on occasion scolded me for jumping through silly and unnecessary hoops to secure my children ’s happiness .
Here you go again , I thought .
Nothing ever changes .
Except that , in that tired moment , something did .
I realized that I was happy .
Not crazed , not self - indulgently wretched , not spinning in neurotic circles of perfection - seeking or self - flagellation , just happy .
Just as I ’d always been when I ’d succeeded in making my daughters ’ quirky , creative birthday party fantasies come true .
It ’s hard to write about , even admit to , simple happiness .
It feels somehow indecent .
Embarrassing .
Immodest .
Inappropriate as a topic of conversation for intelligent people .
What I ’m trying to get at is , I suppose , some variation of Tolstoy ’s observation about happy families , which always makes for a nicely quotable sentence but is , perhaps , wrong .
Perhaps happiness is interesting , because it is n’t , in fact , simple , or uncomplicated .
Perhaps the real thing is n’t just a Hallmark card sentiment .
For me , I realized in that moment , happiness is inextricably bound up in striving .
In straining for achievement , of whatever kind .
In having a challenge and making it to the other side .
It does n’t much matter what the challenge or object of achievement is .
If none is obvious , one always presents itself .
Last Thursday night , for example , I finished writing my book on children ’s mental health issues .
The one , you may or may not know , that was due in September 2005 .
Coming up the steps to my house late that evening , I felt as if I could float , such a weight of stress and worry and long - term self - doubt had been lifted .
“ You even look different , ” one of the mothers dropping off her daughter for Emilie ’s party said to me .
But in fact I was not different at all .
Thursday was the book .
Friday was the chicken .
Saturday morning dawned with the thought that it was perhaps a good time to lose 10 pounds .
On Sunday , I was plagued by the certainty that I ’d never get that done , and on Monday I met with my editor and learned that I had to rewrite the book ’s first 149 pages .
And I was saved .
Lifted out of darkness , I was on the road to happiness once again .
There are high roads of this kind and there are low roads .
In the grand scheme of things , is it really such a bad thing to throw yourself into creating slightly over - the - top holiday happiness for your kids ?
There are much more self - destructive ways to burn off that particular kind of psychic energy .
The pride of having your children think you can cook , and well enough that they want to show you off to their friends on their most important dinner of the year , is , I now think , a forgivable sin .
A permissible pleasure .
Perhaps some kinds of self - indulgence are healthy .
Speaking of pleasures and sin and surprisingly healthful practices :
This year , drunk on the awareness of my happiness , I threw all caution to the wind and suggested , when the movie ended 10 minutes before parents were scheduled to arrive , that Emilie open her presents .
In the presence of her friends .
This brought a look of shock from Emilie — Mommy , really , I never would have thought this of you ! — and utter jubilation from her guests , who gathered around her and then fell into place , their raucousness suddenly silenced by the seriousness of the proceedings .
Do n’t you remember this solemn ritual from childhood ?
The circle , with all eyes on the birthday child as he or she opened gift after gift ?
There was lots of angst associated with these moments : would your gift be appreciated ?
Would the birthday child have it already ?
Would some gifts be liked more than others ?
Would someone — shame of shames — have forgotten to bring one ?
This is just the sort of angst we ’ve now sterilized out of childhood .
Increasingly , my children attend birthday parties at which gifts not only are n’t opened , but are n’t permitted at all .
Sometimes there ’s a suggestion of making a donation to charity .
I ’ve always found this sort of sad , and watching Emilie ’s friends clustered around her , ooh - ing and ah- ing about the gifts and squeezing in until they were elbow - to - elbow in solidarity , I realized that it truly was a pity .
Every card , hand - made or store - bought , was painstakingly removed , read out loud and admired .
“ What beautiful hand - writing , ” I heard Emilie say .
Every effort was taken to preserve the gift wrapping .
“ What a beautiful ribbon . ”
Emilie ’s friends had tailored their gift choices to Emilie ’s interests and obsessions .
If they had not seen her open the presents , I realized , their pleasure in giving simply would n’t have been complete .
It was , for me , another little lesson in happiness , one that should perhaps lead us to question the current politics of birthday party gift - giving .
It ’s easy , for parents at least , to turn away gifts .
The prospect of all that stuff is associated with a loss of control — like the idea that some less advanced soul will feed your child junk food on a play date .
I fully empathize with parents who live in small spaces and are already being crowded out by their kids ’ possessions .
But there ’s a message that comes through the no-present policy — I do n’t want your junk cluttering up my house — that is n’t , let ’s say , warm and fuzzy .
We ’re very big these days on teaching our children self - control .
We make a virtue of scorning self - indulgence .
But there is , perhaps , a greater virtue to knowing how to graciously receive .
Self - denial can , after all , be so horribly self - indulgent .
I ’ve always indulged my penchant for negativity .
I ’ve kind of made a career out of it , in recent years .
But seeing that trait start to show up in Emilie has n’t been pretty .
Maybe it ’s time instead to start modeling how to take in joy .
Nobody can build up a straw man as well as Monsanto and its fellow biotech giants .
According to them , we need enough food to feed a growing population .
Thus far , I 'm in agreement - but that 's where my agreement with them stops .
You see , I 've read that food per capita has increased as hunger has increased over the past several decades .
That 's because our problem has to do with distribution , not production .
We 'd rather put corn in our cars than feed it to starving people .
And , a recent study found that organic agriculture can feed a growing world population using only the land that 's in cultivation today .
Despite those facts , you will hear from Monsanto that we need to grow more food to feed the world .
And that growing more food without increasing yields will mean plowing up rainforests in order to have more land for crops .
Neither of those things are true - even though the sure sound plausible !
And if you believe those myths , then who are you to say no to Monsanto as it offers you a solution ?
But let 's say that we need to boost yields .
And let 's say that we 're going to have increased drought and heat in the future due to global warming .
Is the best way to do that via drought resistant seed ?
I still say no .
Like I said before , sustainable or chemical ag is all one or all the other .
Either you nourish soil life or you kill it .
If you kill it , you need to do something to replace the functions it provided you - and our current set of tools does n't do that very well .
We 've got fertilizer , we 've got pesticides , we can till the soil , and now we can genetically modify our seeds .
Drought - resistant seeds are modified in a way that addresses the plant 's reaction to stresses like heat or drought .
They 'll still wilt away like a normal plant if you keep them in high heat with no water for a while , but if you water them they magically spring back to life whereas a regular plant would n't .
That may work ( although Natasha 's post on Change.org makes the case that these seeds basically shift losses from bad years onto good years ) .
And if it does and it's truly the solution , it means that we would need to come up with drought - tolerant varieties of every single plant we grow .
That 's gonna take a lot of R&D , a lot of money , and a lot of time .
And it will absolutely kill biodiversity because let 's face it , it 's not so profitable to come up with 300 different varieties of GM heirloom tomatoes if you can just make one and sell it to everybody .
The alternative approach would be switching to sustainable agriculture .
Done right , it will make plants more resistant to drought , heat , flood , and cold .
This approach is free , legal , time - tested , safe , and available NOW .
It WILL take farmers a few years to improve their lifeless soil to a point where sustainable ag is giving them the yields they need , but I think that 's worth it in the long run .
And what 's more , due to the increased carbon sequestration and the need for MUCH less oil , sustainable ag wo n't just help farmers tolerate the effects of global warming but it will take the first steps in preventing it .

UPDATE : I just want to say ( in response to some of the comments below ) that I do believe that many people in the biotech industry mean well , and I think that most of them probably believe that the world needs more food and biotech is the way to do it .
Also - for those who've asked , my book is now available for pre-order .
You can get it on Amazon ( $ 10.85 ) , Barnes & Noble ( $ 10.76 members , $ 11.96 otherwise ) , or at Powells ( $ 15.95 ) .
If you want to be alerted if / when I 'll be speaking or signing books in your area , email me at OrangeClouds115 at gmail dot com and tell me what city you live in or nearest to .
UPDATE 2 : I 've received an email suggesting that I do a better job citing my sources .
It 's well - deserved criticism in this case .
I 've also got several sources that I do n't quite know how to share - audio recordings of several panels at BIO 2008 , last year 's international biotech conference , including one about drought tolerant seeds .
If you want these , please email me and I can send them to you .
The last source that I wish I could share but can't is my trip to the Rodale Institute last year .
I have a recording of a talk there that I can send ( email me ) but we also took a tour and I did n't record that part .
I could n't even get a decent picture showing how the organic corn stood a few feet taller than the conventional corn ... hard to get good pics when you 're being pulled along by a tractor in a wagon .
The most expensive cars are a sign of an urge of supremacy and feeling special .
Elite class world over tends to grab the best of everything and stand out from the rest .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Energy Department on Wednesday said it plans to provide up to $ 84 million in funding for geothermal energy projects .
The department said it plans to award as much as $ 35 million for 20 or 30 research proposals addressing development of advanced geothermal technology .
In addition , up to $ 49 million will be provided for five to 10 domestic projects demonstrating enhanced geothermal systems that generate at least 5 megawatts of electricity a year .
“ President Obama has laid out an ambitious agenda to put millions of people to work by investing in clean energy technology like geothermal energy , ” Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in a statement .
“ The administration is committed to funding important research like this to transform the way we use and produce energy and reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil , ” he added .
Obama has pledged that the United States will get 10 percent of its electricity from renewable sources such as geothermal energy by 2012 and 25 percent by 2025 .
Geothermal energy , from heat sources deep in the earth , can produce electricity with few carbon emissions , or can be used directly to heat buildings , greenhouses or other facilities .
The United States is the world leader in geothermal electricity generation .
Some 29 geothermal power plants operate on federals lands , with total generating capacity of 1,250 megawatts , enough to power 1.2 million homes .
More information on applying for the department ’s funding for geothermal projects is available at www.grants.gov.
* Lexapro wins approval for adolescents
* Drug succeeded in one trial , failed in another
* FDA approval comes weeks after Justice Dept. charges ( Adds closing stock price )
NEW YORK , March 20 ( Reuters ) - Just weeks after prosecutors accused Forest Laboratories Inc of illegally marketing its anti-depressants Celexa and Lexapro to children and paying pediatricians kickbacks , U.S. health regulators have approved Lexapro for depression in kids .
Forest FRX.N said Lexapro , its biggest product with annual sales of more than $ 2 billion , was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat major depressive disorder in adolescents aged 12 to 17 and as a maintenance therapy , meaning to maintain control of symptoms .
It is already approved for adults .
But federal prosecutors have said that Lexapro and Celexa have long been used improperly to treat depression in children .
On Feb. 25 , after a five - year probe , the U.S. Justice Department accused Forest of wrongly attempting to sway pediatricians to prescribe Celexa and Lexapro , including inducements like spa visits , fishing trips and tickets to sporting events and Broadway shows .
Neither drug had been approved for kids until Lexapro won the FDA ’s nod on Friday .
The federal complaint accused Forest of pushing aside a study showing that Celexa was ineffective for pediatric use and instead urging its sales staff to promote a second , more positive study .
The FDA on Friday approved Lexapro ’s use for adolescents based on favorable results in two clinical trials , one involving adolescents taking Lexapro and another involving children and adolescents taking chemically similar Celexa , Forest said .
But effectiveness was not shown in another pair of studies , Forest said , one a Lexapro trial involving patients aged 7 to 17 and the other a study of Celexa in adolescents .
Moreover , the company said on Friday that Lexapro ’s ability to maintain control of symptoms in adolescents had not been demonstrated .
But the FDA concluded that maintenance efficacy can be “ extrapolated ” from adult data and from comparisons of how Lexapro is absorbed among adults and adolescents , Forest said .
“ A lot of these kinds of trials are not successful because it ’s very difficult to do depression studies , ” said Forest spokesman Frank Murdolo .
“ But we have two studies that were successful ” and will provide patients another treatment option , Murdolo said .
Lexapro , the 15th biggest drug in the United States by sales , is a derivative of Celexa , an older product that was once a blockbuster treatment but is now widely sold by generic drugmakers .
The FDA had approved Celexa to treat adult depression but declined to approve it for children .
The federal prosecutors , based in Massachusetts , last month said Celexa was no more effective than a placebo when taken by children or teenagers , and that more patients taking Celexa reported suicidal thoughts or attempted suicide .
They alleged that federal health care programs have paid “ thousands of false and fraudulent claims for Celexa and Lexapro prescriptions that were not covered for off - label pediatric use and / or were ineligible for payment as a result of illegal kickbacks paid by Forest . ”
New York - based Forest said depression affects about 2 million adolescents in the United States and that Lexapro is only the second anti-depressant approved for such younger patients .
Shares of Forest Labs closed down one cent at $ 21.13 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange .

We have looked at things that enhance sexual play within the BDSM life but what about tings that prevent sex ?
By this I mean a sub or slave can still please their owner but receive no pleasure themselves , maybe this is due to a punishment , or a training exercise or indeed because they might not have earnt the right to orgasm yet but what ever the reason I am seeing more and more chastity belts available on the market and some of them are actually quite attractive .
If you look up chastity belt in the dictionary the definition is …. chastity belt noun [ C ]
a device that some women were forced to wear in the past to prevent them from having sex .
It had a part that went between the woman ’s legs and a lock so that it could not be removed .
The key is usually kept by the Master and the device removed when
He deems the time is right , they are not usually kept on for more than the play period but as they do not interfere with urinating then they can be left on for longer periods of time if needed
Below are some examples of ones I have found , hope you like the look of them , who knows , with a bit of imagination you might find you are investing in one for your sub or slave whether they are male or female

( Photo courtesy Utah Department of Public Safety ) The Utah Highway Patrol confiscated nearly $ 200,000 in cash from a man they pulled over on Interstate 80 this afternoon .
Troopers think it is drug money but can't prove it , so they let the man go .
It 's a scenario that happens more often than you may think .
It all started this afternoon on I - 80 near 8800 West .
A trooper stopped a car for an equipment violation and improper lane change .
After he talked to the male driver and female passenger , the trooper believed there was something criminal going on .
Tank
" Their story was they were going from South Dakota over to California because they 've never been to California before , " explained UHP Trooper Chamberlin Neff .
The trooper found the cash inside the car and became more suspicious when Tank , the drug - sniffing dog , located a familiar scent .
" No narcotics inside the vehicle .
What the dog actually alerted to was the presence of the odor of narcotics that was on the cash itself , " Neff explained .
Photo courtesy Utah Department of Public Safety
The driver said the smelly cash was to be donated to a Catholic church in Sacramento , but details on which church and where he got the money he just would n't talk about .
" I believe that the money was going to California to purchase narcotics , " Neff said .
With the driver 's criminal history and everything else , UHP seized the cash .
The driver will now have to prove his story in court if he wants to get it back .
" If it 's a legit reason , he was really going to give it to the Catholic church , then he gets his money back .
It 's just very simple , " Neff said .
Again , both the driver and the passenger were let go .
Troopers say this kind of thing happens more often than you might think .
Utah highways are frequently used for drug trafficking .

As you may know , one of my job duties here is to manage our user - generated blog .
Every day I sift through the queue of blog entry submissions and publish posts about Internet marketing , business tactics , social media , web dev/design , etc .
While I publish one or two worthy , relevant blog entries each day , I delete several spam submissions .
I 've seen spam entries about buying World of Warcraft gold , pay day loans , auto loans , Halloween costumes , recycling batteries , hypnosis , GPS , song lyrics , eyeglasses , dogs , Asia travel , India tourism , car rentals , installing car DVDs , cosmetic surgery , t- shirt printing , civil engineering , UK vacation properties , fragrance products , food coloring , music festivals , fashion , and virtually everything in between .
At this point not many spam entries surprise or amuse me -- I pretty much delete them and continue through the queue .
Until now .
The other day I was going through the queue of submitted entries and came across a spam post that was so funny I decided to illustrate it .
Below is that spam entry , in illustrated form .
All of the copy at the top of each panel is actual verbatim copy from the blog submission ( I only provided the drawings ) .
I hope this entry brings you as much joy as it brought me .
Enjoy .

Fixing RANDR : current status
The other day I wrote about the state of RANDR in GNOME .
I have been working on some of the bugs around supporting multiple monitors .
These days , you get a confirmation dialog whenever you change your RANDR settings , because we still have to deal with sucky drivers that may crash when changing resolutions or the plugged monitors .
Gnome - settings - daemon brings up this dialog , as g-s-d is the central point for RANDR configuration changes in GNOME .
However , this dialog of course appears when you click " Apply " in the Display Properties capplet .
There was no way for gnome - settings - daemon to know the transient - parent window for the confirmation dialog , so the dialog could appear below the capplet .
This is fixed now ; g - s-d now lets you pass it a parent window ID and a timestamp .
I also fixed some bugs when restoring your original configuration during the first login .
Since in a first - time login there is no monitors.xml file , there was nothing to go back to , and your original configuration was not restored .
This is fixed now .
A silly crasher in gnome - display - properties , caused by me not actually plugging / unplugging monitors to test them ( I would just change their configuration , but leave them plugged in all the time ) .
Finally , two patches for gnome - panel which are awaiting review .
One is to fix the case where you plug in an external monitor to your laptop , and the panel moves to the external monitor .
The other one is for when the panel appears " in the middle " of a high - resolution monitor when you also have a low - resolution one plugged in , and you are using Mirror Screens mode .

American industry is constantly changing .
We have seen a recent decline in manufacturing , and an increase in high level information technology and software development positions , and also environmental / renewable resource careers .
We are becoming more and more high tech by the day , and as a result , many new jobs are being created .
In fact , there are millions of jobs available in America right now , but they are so specialized that we do not have enough qualified workers to fill them .
Whichever career you have chosen , you need to look at it from a long - term perspective .
Is your industry growing ?
If yes , can you start training yourself to become a high - level manager later in your career ?
If no , have you considered training in one of the many growing American industries , in order to protect yourself from the inevitable decline within your own ?
Sticking around in a career that will surely dissipate is not a good career decision .
There are several American industries that will grow at a high rate , including health care , elderly care , real estate , computer systems and software design , engineering , and environmental services .
As a result of this growth , many affordable training programs have come to the surface in order to give workers the necessary skills to land an entry - level position in the industry .
Our government has taken a lot of steps to provide us with the opportunity to learn these trades through college level training .
For example , the alternative energy industry is still relatively new , but it will be very important in the future as we rely less and less on fossil fuels .
The sun , wind , and geothermal energy are renewable , whereas fossil fuels are a finite resource .
As we make this switch , we also need highly specialized workers to facilitate the process .
The industry is growing fast , and it ’s hard to find qualified workers .
Engineers and technicians who concentrate in these areas are a valuable asset , so it would be an excellent idea to pursue a collegiate or certificate program to get yourself started .
Although these industries are still relatively small , they will grow significantly over time , so positioning yourself now to succeed later is in your best interest .
Getting your foot in the door at a growing industry is one of the best career moves you can make , because a growing industry means growing opportunities for upper management .
You might start out as an entry - level laborer or technician , but having expertise in a relatively new industry that is experiencing growth is always a great career move .
You will be promoted to management in no time .
On the other hand , working in an industry that is shrinking is very dangerous .
The American manufacturing industry is the perfect example .
Decades ago , it was the biggest and fastest growing industry in America .
Towns were built on manufacturing jobs , and it was the main source of income for millions of citizens .
However , outsourcing this work overseas eventually became the better option from a business standpoint , and as a result , factories closed and jobs evaporated into thin air .
Several communities are still feeling the effects .
Foreclosed houses are commonplace near these closed factories .
It ’s not anybody ’s fault for taking a job in this industry , but the decline was foreseen by economists worldwide .
If more people were armed with this information , they would have thought twice before taking a job in a fading business .
Train yourself in a position that will experience growth , and opportunities will soon follow .
You do not want to end up jobless with no options as we have seen happen to millions of Americans .
Finding training programs for new industry is simple .
Get online and research some colleges or technical schools .
As our country progresses industry changes along with it , so aligning yourself for success now is a great decision .
The competition is lower and the opportunities are greater .
If you are currently risking working in a declining industry , consider your options , because you do n’t want to end up jobless .
There are plenty of companies that will hire you with limited experience , just make sure you contemplate all of your educational options .
UCLA ’s Molecular Sciences Building was mostly closed for the holidays on Dec. 29 as research assistant Sheri Sangji worked on an organic chemistry experiment .
Only three months into her job in the lab , the 23 - year - old Pomona College graduate was using a plastic syringe to extract from a sealed container a small quantity of t- butyl lithium -- a chemical compound that ignites instantly when exposed to air .
As she withdrew the liquid , the syringe came apart in her hands , spewing flaming chemicals , according to a UCLA accident report .
A flash fire set her clothing ablaze and spread second - and third - degree burns over 43 % of her body .
Eighteen excruciating days later , Sangji died in a hospital burn unit .

“ It is horrifying , ” said her sister Naveen , 26 , a Harvard medical student .
“ Sheri was n’t out doing something stupid .
She was working in a lab at one of the largest universities in the world .
She gets these horrific injuries and loses her life to these injuries and we still do n’t know how it happened or why it was n’t prevented . ”
Sangji ’s death was more than a tragic workplace accident .
It also raised serious questions about the university ’s attention to laboratory safety .
“ It was totally preventable , ” said Neal Langerman , a San Diego consultant and former head of the American Chemical Society ’s Division of Chemical Health and Safety , whose members were given a detailed account of the incident by a University of California safety official .
“ Poor training , poor technique , lack of supervision and improper method .
This was just not the right way to transfer these things , ” Langerman said .
“ She died , did n’t she ?
It speaks for itself . ”

Two months earlier , UCLA safety inspectors found more than a dozen deficiencies in the same lab , Molecular Sciences Room 4221 , according to internal investigative and inspection reports reviewed by The Times .
Among the findings : Employees were not wearing requisite protective lab coats , and flammable liquids and volatile chemicals were stored improperly .
Chemical Safety Officer Michael
Wheatley sent the inspection report to the researcher who oversees the lab , professor Patrick Harran , as well as to the head of the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department and a top UCLA safety official .
The report directed that problems be fixed by Dec. 5 .
But the required corrective action was not taken , records show , and on Dec. 29 all that stood between Sangji ’s torso and the fire that engulfed her was a highly flammable , synthetic sweater that fueled the flames .

Under scrutiny
The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health is investigating , as are the Office of the State Fire Marshal , the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board .
A spokeswoman for Cal / OSHA , the lead agency , said she could not comment on the investigation .
UCLA officials say they are cooperating with all of the agencies .
“ We consider this a profoundly tragic accident , and the campus community is still reeling from the loss of Sheri as a member of the Bruin family , ” said Kevin Reed , vice chancellor for legal affairs .
Advertisement
Harran , the organic chemistry professor for whom Sangji worked , said he could not comment on the accident because of the pending investigations .
But he said he ’s heartbroken .
“ Words can not convey my grief or that of those who work in my lab , and our pain cannot possibly compare with the immeasurable anguish felt by Sheri ’s family , ” he wrote in an e-mail .
“ Sheri ’s death is a tragedy that has left her friends , colleagues and co-workers here in our department devastated . ”
UCLA has launched a comprehensive review of lab safety protocols and has stepped up inspections and shortened the time allowed to correct serious violations .
Chancellor Gene Block also established a campuswide lab safety committee and ordered enhanced accountability measures .
Such efforts are of little comfort to Sangji ’s family .
Her parents , Shaukat Sangji , a small - business owner who lives in Toronto , Canada , with his wife , Maimoona , a Montessori schoolteacher , were too distraught to be interviewed , said Naveen , who relayed an e-mail message to The Times from her father .

“ They say time will heal , but I know for sure nothing can heal this , ” he said .
“ This has completely destroyed our lives forever . ”
Born and raised in Pakistan , Sheharbano “ Sheri ” Sangji followed her older sister to Pomona College , a small , top - tier liberal arts school in Claremont , in 2003 .
Their parents and younger brother moved to Canada .
“ Sheri always loved science and fell in love with chemistry , ” Naveen said , but she also was interested in the rights of women and immigrants , environmental policy and law .
She decided to become an attorney , with an eye toward a career that would blend her interests .
“ She was brilliant , just so impressive , ” her sister said .
Advertisement
Daniel O’Leary , Sheri ’s chemistry professor for nearly three years at Pomona , recalled her as being upbeat , with a good sense of humor , and an independent problem - solver who published two papers as an undergraduate in professionally vetted chemistry journals .
“ She was a talented researcher and a very involved student in the chemistry department , ” said O’Leary , who earned his doctorate at UCLA and now teaches at Bowdoin College in Maine .
Sangji graduated in May and had applied to some of the nation ’s top law schools .
In October , she took a job in a lab run by Harran , a rising star who joined the UCLA faculty in July as the first Donald J. Cram Chair in Organic Chemistry .
In 2007 , Harran and colleagues at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center gained notice for their work on a synthetic toxin that shrinks cancerous tumors in mice .

“ Sheri was excited about this job . . . and was so happy when she got it , ” said her friend Jahan Bruce , 24 , a special - education teacher .
“ She wanted to be in the research area and wanted to be in a university setting .
All of her friends thought this was perfect for her . ”
On Dec. 29 , Sangji was performing an experiment related to Harran ’s work on a potential anti-obesity drug , UCLA ’s Reed said .
She was trying to transfer up to 2 ounces of t- butyl lithium , which was dissolved in pentane , another highly flammable chemical , from one sealed container to another .
It was the second time she had performed that procedure in Harran ’s lab , UCLA officials said .
“ The barrel of the syringe was either ejected or pulled out of the syringe , causing liquid to be released , ” the UCLA accident report stated .
Advertisement
Sangji ’s rubber gloves caught fire , searing her hands .
Her sweater , made of a synthetic material , was so flammable that Langerman , the chemical safety expert , compared it to “ solid gasoline . ”
It , too , was quickly engulfed .
The panicked young woman ran away from a nearby emergency shower instead of toward it , records state , costing her precious time .
“ She might have been fine ” had she quickly made it to the shower , said Russ Phifer , head of the American Chemical Society ’s safety division , who also reviewed the UC official ’s account of the accident .
A postdoctoral researcher , who UCLA officials say was just a few feet away , rushed to Sangji ’s aid and tried to smother the flames with a lab coat .
Another ran in from an adjoining room , helped douse the fire , then called 911 and summoned Harran , Reed said .
Advertisement
“ He said when he got there Sheri was sitting with her arms outstretched in front of her and someone was throwing water at her from a sink , ” said Naveen , who spoke with Harran later at the hospital .
That account squares with the UCLA accident report .
From the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center , Sangji was transferred to the Grossman Burn Center in Sherman Oaks .
It is unknown whether a typical cotton lab coat would have saved her .
But even if it caught fire , it could have been removed much more easily than a burning synthetic sweater , safety expert Phifer said .
“ I ca n’t imagine why she did n’t have protective clothing if she knew she was working with chemicals that dangerous , ” Sheri ’s friend Bruce said .

Training questioned
But just how much Sangji knew about the procedure that took her life is an open question .
“ The employee may not have been using best work practices while handling the syringe to transfer a pyrophoric liquid , ” a UCLA accident report concluded .
“ The employees should be instructed in safer handling techniques . ”
Advertisement
Harran told a UCLA investigator the day after the fire that a syringe “ was the appropriate method ” for transferring t- butyl lithium -- and that Sangji had been trained how to do it .
But according to the investigator ’s report , Harran did not know when that training occurred and had no record of it , as required by Cal / OSHA and UCLA lab safety standards .
UCLA ’s Reed said Sangji “ was trained by senior chemists within Dr. Harran ’s lab to conduct this specific experiment and handle these specific chemicals . ”
But he could n’t say why there was no record of it .
“ We ’re still trying to figure that one out , ” he said , adding that Cal / OSHA is also looking into it .
At the hospital , Naveen said , her sister told her that she was not given safety training : “ She was very clear about the lack of safety training , because I asked her directly . ”
Advertisement
It was not unheard of for people in Harran ’s labs to work without protective gear , UCLA records show .
On Oct. 30 , two months before the fire , an annual safety inspection uncovered more than two dozen deficiencies in his four labs , including the one where Sangji worked .
Among other things , inspectors found excessive amounts of flammable liquids and missing chemical spill cleanup kits .
“ Eye protection , nitrile [ rubber ] gloves and lab coats were not worn by laboratory personnel , ” the inspection report said .
The Nov. 5 report said lab coats “ must be worn while conducting research and handling hazardous materials in the lab ” and assigned the Dec. 5 deadline to correct the deficiencies .
Advertisement
After the accident , however , Bill Peck , UCLA manager of occupational safety and employee health , wrote in his report that “ most of the corrections in the laboratory were not accomplished by 12/30/08 . ”
A first - aid kit and spill cleanup materials were still lacking ; flammable materials and water - and air - reactive chemicals were still being stored improperly ; and employees still were n’t using protective equipment , the report said .
Cal / OSHA is investigating why the deficiencies were not corrected sooner , UCLA officials said .
One potential factor , they said , is that Harran had planned to move the lab .
Phifer and Langerman saw other potential problems :
At the time of the fire , Sangji worked at a cupboard - like “ fume hood , ” which pulls potentially harmful vapors out through an exhaust system .
It has a tempered - glass vertical sash that probably was not lowered enough , they said , because if it had been , only her hands and forearms would have been burned .
Advertisement
In addition to the fume hood , Sangji would have been better protected if she had used a “ blast shield , ” a free - standing portable device made of brass that chemists put between themselves and potentially dangerous experiments , the experts said .
A blast shield was not required for that experiment , Reed said , and it is unknown if one was available .
Langerman also questioned the safety of transferring t- butyl lithium with a syringe .
“ The preferred method is to use pressure to push the liquid out of the source bottle into your receiver through a stainless - steel tube , ” he said .
Both experts also wondered if Sangji and the postdoctoral researchers who risked their lives to help her had received adequate fire safety training .
UCLA officials say they had .
Advertisement
“ The response afterward is probably most responsible for her death , ” Phifer said .
“ The fact that she immediately turned away from the shower and went in the opposite direction is a problem .
It means that she was n’t properly trained in what to do in the event she caught fire . ”
--
Final days
At the burn center , Sangji ’s family found her wrapped in bandages , her arms suspended from the ceiling .
Deep burns covered her back , legs , torso and ears .
Advertisement
“ It was really hard to see her like that , ” Naveen said .
“ They gave her a lot of sedation and oxygen therapy , but she was in a lot of pain .
Her big concern was her hands .
She really worried that she would n’t get function back .
She kept asking about her hands : ‘ Will they get better ?
How long will it take ? ’ ”
Naveen said her sister could not bring herself to discuss the accident : “ She was having flashbacks and nightmares , and she did n’t want to talk about it . ”
Only family members were permitted visits , so friends dropped off cards and posters with photos and messages of encouragement for Sheri , an avid soccer player .
She seemed to make progress for about a week , her sister said , but began to decline at about the time of a second surgery to remove burned tissue .
On Jan. 16 , she succumbed to respiratory failure , infection and other complications , according to a coroner ’s report .
Advertisement
“ Sheri was such a fighter that it just never entered our minds that she would n’t make it through , ” her sister said .
A day before her funeral in Toronto , her family learned that she had been accepted to UC Berkeley ’s Boalt Hall School of Law .
“ It was her dream school , ” Naveen said .

Times staff writer William Heisel contributed to this report .
Newly released academic research suggests that Sarah Palin 's sexiness , while great for selling copies of Vogue magazine and political buttons about the hottest governor from the coldest state last fall , may actually have hurt her vote - getting ability , which seems to be what elections are about .
Of course , standing next to John McCain is bound to make pretty much anyone look pretty much prettier .
Which may be one reason the crowds often chanted " Sar - RAH ! Sa-RAH ! " when the Republican governor and Republican senator appeared together as the GOP presidential ticket .
According to an article by Tom Jacobs on the website of Santa Barbara 's Miller - McCune Center , recently completed research at the University of South Florida indicates that , at least among a select group of students there , those who found the hockey mom more attractive also judged her less competent , less intelligent and less capable .
This did n't seem to have much impact in Palin 's 2006 primary upset victory and statewide election as the largest state 's first female governor .
But the finding , being published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , does conform with previous research that found attractive women in high - status jobs were perceived as less competent .
Both outcomes would seem to strongly indicate there 's more to the glass ceiling for females than the actual glass .
No news to them .
According to Nathan Heflick , a psychologist and one of the research authors , it was n't Palin 's appearance per se that turned off the research subjects .
" It was the effect her appearance had on their perception of her competence and humanity , " Heflick said .
" Those variables made people less likely to vote for her . "
All of which would seem to suggest that , for any hope of success in 2012 or beyond , the 45 - year - old governor needs to whack off that hair , pork up a bit and get some cheap , baggy pantsuits over at the Wasilla Wal - Mart .
And instead of that come - on wink that many thought they liked , she 'd do well to develop an uncontrollable facial twitch .
Also lose the kids , stop smiling , get angrier , so she can look more congressional .
That 's been working real well for Republicans the last two elections .
For olde time 's sake , we 've thrown in a video down below of Palin addressing a crowd that seems to like her the way she is .

Chandra Levy D.C. Murder Case Breakthrough ( Photos )
The disappearance and murder of , who at age 24 went missing on April 30 , 2001 , is back in the headlines once again with an arrest imminent , according to sources in both Washington D.C. and California .
The Federal Bureau of Prison 's intern met Rep. Gary Condit , D - Cal. through his congressional intern and the two reportedly engaged in a romantic relationship .
Her seven month internship was coming to an end and she was about to return to California when she would be graduating from the University of Southern California with a master 's degree in public administration .
That all ended when she mysteriously vanished .
Condit was on the hot seat as police investigators delved into his extramarital affair and many speculated that he harmed her in order to end a relationship that could have caused him political ruin .
He left Congress at the end of his term in January 2003 after losing a reelection bid in his first ever primary defeat .
Chandra 's remains were discovered on May 22 , 2002 in Washington D.C.'s Rock Creek Park .
Considered one of the most high profile unsolved murders in recent years , police are reportedly ready to act on their evidence in the case - eight years after she went missing .
In July 2008 The Washington Post published a comprehensive expose after doing their own year long investigation .
In Chapter 10 , they revealed that a Salvadoran named Ingmar Guandique allegedly told a jailhouse informant that he had been walking the Adams Morgan neighborhood when a car pulled to the curb .
Condit offered him $ 25,000 to kill a woman .
The congressman provided him with her picture and a location where he could find her .
According to the allegation , Guandique told the informant that he had killed Chandra Levy .
CNN affiliate KGO - TV is reporting that police have secured warrants and are ready to make an arrest in the case .
Police told Levy 's parents , Robert and Susan Levy of Modesto , that an arrest was imminent , according to the San Francisco television station .
Susan Levy told KXTV in Sacramento , " You want justice .
You want the person incarcerated .
It is still painful no matter what .
Your child is dead and gone .
But we are glad the police are doing something and making a difference . "
We 've provided a link to The Washington Post expose for an in depth look at the case .

As voters express concern about surveillance technology , is it becoming second nature to the Facebook generation – used to publishing intimate details of their private lives on the worldwide web – who , in later life , may be less vociferous in their opposition to such schemes ?
An increasing number of today 's schoolchildren are forgoing the humiliating daily name call of registration , and are instead having to " fingerswipe " in and out of class , or to give it its proper name : biometric registration .
According to campaign group LeaveThemKidsAlone , schools have fingerprinted more than two million children this way , sometimes even without their parents ' consent .
A statement on its website claims : " It 's part of an enormous softening - up exercise , targeting society 's most impressionable , so they 'll accept cradle - to - grave state snooping and control . "
Hard - pressed schools and local councils with tight budgets are being enticed by a new generation of software that promises to cut administration costs and time .
In the last 18 months , several Guardian readers have written into the paper expressing concern at this new technology being trialled on their children .
Everything from " cashless catering schemes " to " kiddyprints " instead of library cards is being introduced by stealth into the nation 's schools , it is claimed .
The software companies that are jostling for a stake in this lucrative market , such as VeriCool and CRB solutions , boast several testimonials on their websites , arguing that this technology not only minimises lunchtime queues and paperwork , but also tackles more serious problems such as truancy and bullying ( a cashless system negates the need to be biffed for your lunch money ) .
They even claim that their systems promote healthy eating , as pupils accrue points for eschewing sugary snacks .
Furthermore , CRB solutions is quick to reassure pupils and staff that " this was n't the same sort of fingerprinting that the police did … in fact , parts of the ' fingerprint ' are converted ( using a mathematical algorithm ) into digital data which can then be used for future recognition . "
However , the police and security services do use coded algorithms when taking the fingerprints of a suspect , as well as taking inky fingerprints that are kept on paper file .
And it is this data that they use to match fingerprints at the scene of a major crime .
The implications are vast – the nation 's schools are n't exactly the safest place for the storage of this sensitive data – and anyone with access to the system and a mobile SIM card can download the information from a computer , increasing the chances of identity theft .
Unless the computer system is professionally purged , before this data has a chance to be leaked , it can remain in cyberspace for eternity to be retained for all sorts of dubious purposes .
It 's odd that this drive towards fingerprinting children coincides with the government 's keenness to expand the national DNA database – we already have one of the largest in the world – with more than four million people on file , including nearly 1.1 million children .
Odd too that VeriCool is reported to be part of Anteon , an American company that is responsible for the training of interrogators at Guantánamo and Abu Gharib .
It seems that in the blink of an eyelid ( or iris scan ) , our children are losing the civil liberties and freedoms we are fighting so hard to preserve .
This little prik reminds me of Ann Coulter and Tucker Carlson both of whom got a huge kick out of belittling Canada time after time .
It was an obvious smear campaign that happened when we did not bend over for Bush and his girlfriend Dick Cheney when they said " Either you 're with us , or you 're with the terrorists " .
Here are Coulter and Carlson in action .
I wonder how many points they think they got for this grade 6 tirade , from the citizens of the USA ?
: It just makes ya wanna go down there and kick some heads in , does n't it ?
These people are the biggest babies in the world .
This is how they behave when we do n't kiss their butts on demand .
Other people might kiss their asses but Canadians are just so damned tired of it ... and they just can't stand it when we tell them to go F themselves .
God I hate these people with a passion .
No wonder the USA and it 's people are the most hated in the history of mankind .
These days though , in all honesty I feel really bad for the American people .
I 've come to realize that it is n't their fault that they 've been misled all these years down the road to believing they 're great .
They 've been led down a path to tyranny so masterfully , and none of us saw it coming .
They ( and we ... every citizen of the planet ) are all in very serious trouble now thanks to the dark manipulations for over 200 years now by that inbred Rothschild family .
They own the Fed , all the major banks , the bank of England and it is said that they actually own half the wealth of the planet .
But they want it all .
And in the process , they totally ruined the USA forever .
We 're all in for a nasty 10 years or so , but the people of Europe and USA and are in real , real bad trouble .
God bless them ( and we ) all .
Iowa Democrats Tweet Limbaugh 's drug addiction in healthcare debate
Stephen C. Webster

It appears the Democrats ' plan to enshrine Rush Limbaugh as the true " de facto leader " of the GOP is having its very own trickle - down effect .
Legislation which would allow Iowa workers to choose their own doctors through the workers compensation program is meeting stiff resistance from state Republicans and business groups .
The fear , they say , is that allowing a citizen to choose their doctor would encourage " doctor shopping . "
Iowa House Democrats bit back with a single sentence and link , fired off from their Twitter page .
" Doctor shopping ... is this what ABI means ?
http://tinyurl.com/boc5dh "
The tinyrul link points to a Palm Beach Post story about Republican pundit Rush Limbaugh 's admitted addiction to OxyContin from 1998 - 2002 .
He professed to obtaining the drug , also commonly known as " hillbilly heroin , " by " doctor shopping , " or obtaining overlapping prescriptions from multiple practitioners .
" The ABI mentioned is the Association of Business and Industry , which has launched a series of radio ads in Iowa opposing the choice of doctor legislation , " said the Iowa Independent .
The Iowa GOP Tweeted back , in a manner of speaking , paraphrasing Iowa Republican party chairman Matt Strawn , who alleged that allowing workers to choose their doctors will " devastate area 's small businesses . "
The feed did not provide any links to supporting evidence .
" Currently , 35 states have some form of employee choice of doctor , including all of Iowas surrounding states except Missouri , " the paper reported .
Limbaugh was facing a third degree felony for his doctor shopping , an offense punishable by up to five years in prison .
He struck an agreement with the Palm Beach County State Attorney 's Office , ultimately paying a $ 3,000 bond and agreeing to a common court diversion program .
The charges were dropped after 18 months .
Following his repeated sentiment that he hopes President Obama " fails , " Democrats have gleefully piled on , even launching a parody Web site that mocks top Republicans in government who 've been embarrassed by and apologized to the pundit .
The wish for failure is " arguably treasonous , " remarked Daily Show host Jon Stewart .
" He 's a fat , pill - popping idiot , " exclaimed Rolling Stone 's Matt Tiabbi during a recent appearance on MSNBC .
Shortly after the Iowa GOP 's semi-response , state Democrats added another Tweet , insisting " Iowa GOP taking lead from Limbaugh . "
The link provided , however , went back to the Independent 's story about the original slap at Limbaugh 's addiction .
During the 2008 primaries , Iowa Republicans who describe themselves as " very conservative " largely ignored Limbaugh 's tirades against former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee , giving Huckabee a larger portion of their votes than any other candidate .
The ballots led a writer for Accuracy in Media to question whether Republican talk radio is losing its influence .
In 2004 , Limbaugh and Iowa Senator Tom Harkin , a Democrat , sparred over the pundit 's presence on taxpayer - funded armed forces radio , where he suggested political alternatives to the abrasive Republican should be made available .
Limbaugh accused Sen .
Harkin of trying to censor him , but the Democrat insisted he simply wanted to see differing opinions carried on the military 's signal .
A recent poll found Limbaugh 's favorability ratings are lower than those of former Preisdent George W. Bush .
The odd fates of 25 legendary tech products that are forgotten ... but not gone .
Old computer products , like old soldiers , never die .
They stay on the market–even though they have n’t been updated in eons .
Or their names get slapped on new products–available only outside the U.S.
Or obsessive fans refuse to accept that they ’re obsolete–long after the rest of the world has moved on .
For this story –which I hereby dedicate to Richard Lamparski , whose “ Whatever Became of … ? ” books I loved as a kid–I checked in on the whereabouts of 25 famous technology products , dating back to the 1970s .
Some are specific hardware and software classics ; some are services that once had millions of subscribers ; some are entire categories of stuff that were once omnipresent .
I focused on items that remain extant–if “ extant ” means that they remain for sale , in one way or another–and did n’t address products that , while no longer blockbusters , retain a reasonably robust U.S. presence ( such as AOL and WordPerfect ) .
If you ’re like me , you ’ll be pleasantly surprised to learn that some products are still with us at all–and will be saddened by the fates of others .
Hey , they may all be inanimate objects , but they meant a lot to some of us back in the day .

Dot -Matrix Printers
What they were :
The printer you probably owned if you had a PC in the home from the late 1970s until the early - to - mid- 1990s .
Models like the Epson FX - 80 and Panasonic KX - P1124 were noisy and slow , and the best output they could muster was the optimistically - named “ near letter quality . ”
But they were affordable , versatile , and built like tanks .
What happened : Beginning in the early 1990s , inkjet printers from HP , Epson , and Canon started to get pretty good – their output came far closer to rivaling that of a laser printer than dot - matrix ever could .
And then , in the mid-1990s , they added something that killed the mass - market dot - matrix printer almost instantly : really good color .
( I still remember having my socks knocked off by the original Epson Stylus Color when I saw it at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1994 . )
There was simply no comparison between even the best dot - matrix printer and a color inkjet .
Current whereabouts :
Nobody ever thinks about dot - matrix printers anymore , but they have n’t gone away–my local Office Depot still stocks them , in fact .
That ’s because they have at least two valuable features that inkjet and laser models can’t match :
The fact that the dot - matrix printhead hits the paper with a hard whack means they ’re perfect for printing multiple - part forms , and their use of tractor - feed mechanisms rather than dinky trays lets them print thousands of pages without a paper refill .
Consequently , small businesses everywhere refuse to give them up .
It wo n’t startle me if there are still Epsons productively hammering out invoices and receipts a couple of decades from now , assuming we still use paper at all .
Hayes Modems
What they were : Dial - up modems from the company whose founder , Dennis Hayes , essentially invented the PC modem in the 1970s .
The commands he devised became such a standard that all dial - up modems use them to this day .
Hayes dominated the modem business for years–it was as synonymous with the product category it pioneered as any tech company before or since .
What happened :
Well , dial - up modems do n’t matter as much as they once did , in case you had n’t noticed .
But Hayes ’ decline and fall dates to well before the death of dial - up :
The company stubbornly kept prices high even in the face of much cheaper competition , and thought its future lay in making ISDN modems , a market that never took off .
It declared bankruptcy in 1994 and again in 1998 , and was liquidated in 1999 .
Current whereabouts :
In 1999 , Zoom Telephonics –the company whose dirt - cheap modems played a major role in crushing Hayes–bought the Hayes name .
It continues to market a few Hayes - branded modems .
But it ’s a pretty obscure fate for a once - mighty brand –I did n’t know it was still extant at all until I checked .
MiniDisc
What it was :
Sony ’s format for pint - sized recordable audio discs , introduced in 1992 .
The idea was that it combined the best qualities of compact discs and cassette tapes into one high - quality , portable package that could contain up to eighty minutes of music .
What happened : MiniDisc found some fans–it was popular in Asia , and among musicians .
But it never gained much support from the music industry , so few prerecorded albums were available .
And within a few years of its introduction , it found itself competing with digital downloads–and while Sony introduced NetMD , a MiniDisc variant that supported MP3 , it made it remarkably unappealing by adding copy protection to your tracks as you transferred them to disc .
Why would you choose NetMD when a multitude of players , such as those from Diamond and Creative , let MP3s be MP3s ?
Good question !
Current whereabouts :
In 2004 , Sony upgraded the MiniDisc format with Hi-MD , a higher - capacity , more flexible standard that was backwards compatible with MiniDiscs .
It garnered some admiration among audiophiles for the high quality of its recording capabilities .
But as of 2009 , only one Hi-MD device remains in Sony ’s lineup , the MZ - M200 .
It ’s aimed at musicians and journalists who need to make recordings on the go .
The moment it disappears , we can officially declare MiniDisc dead .
Monochrome Displays
What they were :
The black - and - white CRT that most businesses and many homes used with computers from the 1970s through the late 1980s –and they worked just fine , since most DOS applications made little use of color , and early Macs did n’t support it at all .
What happened : Graphical user interfaces , multimedia , and games all made universal use of color inevitable , but it took a long time before it truly conquered computing .
Well into the 1990s , lots of folks who would n’t dream of using a black - and - white display with a desktop PC still toted monochrome notebooks .
But today , even a $ 200 netbook has a perfectly respectable color display .
Current whereabouts :
You do n’t want a monochrome display .
But if you did , you would n’t have trouble finding one–even Dell still stocks them .
They ’re still out there in large quantities , being used for electronic cash registers and other unglamorous but important text - based applications .
And hey , monochrome is making its own unexpected sort of comeback :
My brand - new Kindle 2 e-book reader has an e-ink screen that does sixteen shades of gray , and nothing else .
Hercules
What it was :
An extremely popular line of graphics cards for IBM PCs and compatibles .
Hercules first appeared in 1982 , the year after the IBM PC was launched , and was known for its high - quality text ; it was as synonymous with graphics in the 1980s as Creative ’s Sound Blaster was with audio a decade later .
What happened :
When fancy color graphics replaced spartan text displays , Hercules continued to be a prominent brand for years , though it never dominated as it did in the early years .
But in 1998 , it was bought out by competitor ELSA , which then went bankrupt and sold the Hercules brand to French tech company Guillemot .
( Researching this article , I ’ve come to the conclusion that one sale or merger is usually bad news for a venerable brand , and a second one is usually near - fatal . )
Guillemot continued to make cards under the Hercules name for several years .
But industry consolidation in the graphics biz was ongoing and brutal , and in 2004 it ceased production of them .
Current whereabouts :
The Hercules name lives on , but on an array of tech gadgets that does n’t include graphics cards : Guillemot uses it for notebooks , Wi-Fi and powerline networking gear , sound cards , speakers , iPod accessories , laptop bags , and more .
I wish them luck .
But it ’s a little as if McDonalds stopped selling burgers to concentrate on tuna salad , Philly cheese steaks , BLTs , and Reubens .

Friends - well - meaning friends - occasionally flatter my ego by telling me I 'm intelligent .
Not brilliantly clever , but relatively smart when compared side - by - side with , say , a tangerine .
They 're kind , my friends .
But I know they 're lying .
Inside , I feel dumb as a backward monkey .
Especially when I watch the news .
That 's because when I watch the news , I do n't always fully comprehend what 's happening .
Tuning into the news can be like stumbling across episode 908 of the world 's most complicated soap opera ; a soap with an immensely labyrinthine plot which has been unfolding for centuries .
It 's a backstory I 'm not familiar with .
Unless you strain to pay attention , or are naturally addicted , it 's easy to fall behind , to lose track of current affairs , and be left with a fuzzy sense of what 's going on ; a smudge of images and headlines and buzzy phrases : Carbon Footprint , Credit Crunch , Broken Britain , Quantitative Easing .
To make matters worse , everyone else in the world seems to inherently understand precisely what 's happening , and furthermore , to hold pretty strong opinions on what to do about it .
They debate and debate till they 're blue in the face , on Question Time , on the internet , in the front of a cab or the back of a pub .
Where are they getting all this information from ?
And why does the world seem so simple to them ?
It rarely looks black and white from where I 'm sitting ; more a swirl of grey smears which grow more indistinct the more you look at them .
Still , ignorance is a shameful thing to confess to .
We point and chortle at the stupidity of reality TV stars who think Palestine is a type of modelling clay , but if we ourselves are n't 100 % sure if the IRA are Catholics or Protestants , we dare n't admit it when Northern Ireland comes up in conversation ( I myself was n't sure about that one for years , and feel incredibly embarrassed even now to come clean in print ) .
And , as the real world gets more complex and the other world - the virtual realm of fictional distractions - grows more sophisticated , more alluring and hypnotic , keeping abreast of current events is surely harder than ever .
It does n't help that the news has to travel through a series of distorting Crazy Straws before entering your brain .
TV news now comes packaged as a dazzling CGI cartoon , with the names of star anchors included in the programme title , and an absurdly theatrical air of bombast underpinning every second of every broadcast .
Traditional newspapers , beaten to the punch by the immediacy of the internet and 24 - hour news networks , are becoming less and less bothered with breaking actual news than celebrity gossip , or provocative comment , or shouty campaigning .
The internet , meanwhile , can be a great source of rapidly updated information , but is also home to an endless range of partisan news sources , paranoid imaginings , and outright hoaxes .
Is it possible for anyone to truly know what the hell 's going on ?
Probably not .
But in a wild and possibly ill - advised attempt at self - improvement , I decided to immerse myself completely in the world of news by trying my hand at a current affairs - based spin - off of my BBC4 show Screen Wipe .
Screen
Wipe , if you have n't seen it , largely consists of me sitting at home hurling abuse at various television programmes and occasionally pretending to masturbate until people write in to complain .
Newswipe is - as the title suggests - essentially the same , except this time I 'm way out of my comfort zone .
I 'll be reviewing the news as though it's an entertainment show .
Which it both is and is n't .
It 's one thing to take the piss out of Britannia High .
It 's another entirely to sift through hours of reportage on quantitative easing looking for funnies , or a point .
Right now my life consists of rolling news networks and daily deliveries of countless news bulletins on DVD .
I 'm at the point now where I can actually picture Robert Peston 's face more clearly than my own .
Interestingly , the first thing I 've learned is that the more news you ingest , the less you actually know .
For one thing , your brain - or my brain at any rate - can't hold that much information .
And all stories are fractal : the closer you look , the more detail emerges , and it 's apparently infinite , down to the atoms .
When it comes to complex issues such as the economy , there are a billion differing points of view , and the only thing that can be said with any certainty is that there is no certainty whatsoever .
The news does n't like this kind of ambiguity one bit , of course , and tries to break everything down into an exciting two - sided mud-slinging match that helps no one .
Another thing I noticed is that my timing 's absolutely dreadful .
At the time of writing , the news seems to consist solely of financial apocalypse , celebrity illness , terrorism , and spree killings .
They may as well replace Sky News with a channel called Abyss 24 ; a dark , bottomless chasm for the viewer to stare into .
Although it might prove hard to sell advertising space .
Current Affairs
Land is a profoundly depressing place to visit .
I preferred my time on Ignorance Island .
At least it was warm there .
Newswipe is not aimed at politics junkies or ( for want of a better term ) Radio 4 listeners .
It 's aimed at people like me : average types who feel like they 've fallen behind and are a touch ashamed about it ; people who feel the world has become a dark joke they do n't fully understand .
And people who appreciate bum jokes and swearing .
Not that it 's all bum jokes and swearing .
Thankfully , to counterbalance ( or possibly just distract attention from ) my ignorance and inborn puerility , we also have contributions from people who know what they 're talking about and rarely , if ever , resort to cheap wank jokes : Bad Science columnist Ben Goldacre , Flat Earth News author Nick Davies , and political journalist Peter Oborne .
The documentary maker Adam Curtis has made us a lovely little film about the rise of " Oh Dearism " , and there 'll be specially - made pieces from comedian - reporters Shazia Mirza and Natalie Haynes and some funny topical poetry from Tim Key .
Basically what I 'm saying is that the show will consist of a very stupid person ( me ) surrounded by some very clever people ( them ) , trying to make sense of a very complex thing ( the world ) , in a way that will entertain you ( the viewer ) .
Yes , entertainment is the ultimate goal , and possibly a bit of explanation along the way .
Although it could well turn out to be absolute shit .
I have no idea , just as I do n't know what 's going to happen next in the news .
And news being news , things could go horribly wrong between now and the first transmission .
You could be reading this in a bunker for all I know .
Still , that 's what makes the world exciting , I guess .
The uncertainty of it all .
• Newswipe , 10 pm , Wed , BBC4 ;
Things I 've learned from watching the news
' If it bleeds , it leads '
It 's a cliche , but a depressingly accurate one .
On the day thousands of people took to the streets of Northern Ireland to denounce violence , their efforts were shunted down the news menu by a lone German maniac 's random shooting spree .
Bad news wins .
Robert Peston 's delivery
His speed up / slow down speech patterns make him sound like a man receiving a blowjob under the desk who 's desperately trying to cover it up .
Just like the chief of police in that scene in Police Academy .
Terrible wordplay is in
Sky 's Dermot Murnaghan spent a week travelling the UK by bike to see how the recession was affecting ordinary people .
The item 's name ?
Dermot 's Economic Cycle .
The economic crisis is vague
It 's so complex , and so non-visual , the news networks send themselves insane trying to illustrate what , say , quantitative easing is .
They cook up so many different metaphors - one minute the economy is like a frozen fish tank , the next it 's a faulty car engine - that the more reports you watch , the more confused you get .
Still , this bafflement qualifies you as an expert , since the pundits do n't know what 's happening either .
Because the government can hold those mortgages as long as it wants , officials are betting the government will be repaid and that taxpayers may even earn a profit if the market value of the loans climbs in the years to come .
To entice private investors like hedge funds and private equity firms to take part , the F.D.I.C. will provide nonrecourse loans  that is , loans that are secured only by the value of the mortgage assets being bought  worth up to 85 percent of the value of a portfolio of troubled assets .
The remaining 15 percent will come from the government and the private investors .
The Treasury would put up as much as 80 percent of that , while private investors would put up as little as 20 percent of the money , according to industry officials .
Private investors , then , would be contributing as little as 3 percent of the equity , and the government as much as 97 percent .
The government would receive interest payments on the money it lent to a partnership and it would share profits and losses on the equity portion of the investment with the private investors .
Image The F.D.I.C.  headed by Sheila C. Bair  will provide loans to entice private investors to participate in the program .

Ever since last fall , industry analysts and policy makers in Washington have argued that the banking system ’s biggest problem was the huge pile of troubled mortgages and other loans on bank balance sheets .
Risk - taking institutional investors , like hedge funds and private equity funds , have refused to pay more than about 30 cents on the dollar for many bundles of mortgages , even if most of the borrowers are still current .
But banks holding those mortgages , not wanting to book huge losses on their holdings , have often refused to sell for less than 60 cents on the dollar .

When to Consult a Gas Fitters Gas has replaced other fuels originally used and is now among the major fuels used in industries and at homes .
Liquid petroleum gases ( LPG ) and Natural gas are the main gases used .
They are highly combustible hence need to be handled with care , a few people have specialized in these field hence our safety in handling gas is assured .
Uses of gas include : water heating , space heating , cooking and for commercial and industrial processes .
Who are gas fitters ?
They are individuals specialized in installation of gas pipes or appliances , testing them , altering and repairing appliances .
The aim is to minimize risks of mishandled gas and ensure safety of all users .
When does one require the services of a gas fitters ?
For government and large organization projects such as commissioning of gas pipes ; being highly flammable , care has to be taken to minimize the risks as possible and if it can't be avoided ensure few casualties .
Gas fitters Calgary are tasked with checking that the pipes are in proper condition to carry the gas to the destination , the control room s fully operational and all machines working such that they can regulate the amount getting in and out of the pipes , on the due day confirm that the project can be successfully launched .
Designing of the operation room in an organization where the gas equipment are to be located and coordinated from , their main role being to ensure adequate ventilation in case of leakage , cooling environment and measures in case the machines overheat and adequate space between pipes and other appliances to ensure ease of movement .
When disposing of unwanted or excess gas ; this is done through combusting the gas , the role of the gas fitters here is to ensure the gas will be fully combusted , releasing carbon dioxide and not partially combusted releasing carbon monoxide which is lethal especially when the ventilation is n't adequate .
In the hotel and catering industry ; where they are tasked with ensuring proper ventilation in case of leakage and fitting of cookers , aligning them properly to the gas supply to avoid destroying the supply as on moves which will cause leakage and properly fitting them to the cookers , they are also tasked with educating the chefs and other users on safety precautions they should take more so if the working spaces is limited .
In industries that use gas boilers , to safely install the gas boilers and test them and put across the safety precautions to take .
In homes ; installation of the gas for cooking , enlightening on the safest place to put the gas cylinders , testing that they work properly .
In case you suspect a leakage in your gas flow system call the gas fitters to fix the problem .
The gas fitters is an important player in our safety field regarding our gas usage at ll levels , Calgary has a number of them , contact one and start making the safety of your family count .
Family always comes first , donât forget your business too , your car , ship , boat all equipment that use gas in one way or another , they will fix .

They say we 're beaten down , beleaguered , ready to collectively empty our 401 ( k ) s and slit our wrists with our sliced - in - half Visa cards .
But if the several hundred high - heeled , high - smiled women standing in a line that stretched halfway around downtown Denver on Tuesday for an America 's Next Top Model open casting call were any indication , then trust me : America still has the swagger of yesteryear .
America is still bullish on itself .
And mortgage crisis be damned , it appears we still possess the confidence to walk into a situation for which we are not remotely qualified and stake our futures to it .
For America does not run on Dunkin ' , people .
It runs on delusion .
I arrived at Vinyl nightclub , the site of the Top Model roundup , at around five o'clock -- eighteen or so hours after the first reality - TV hopefuls started camping out .
That 's right : camping out .
A young woman named Deja told me she spent Monday afternoon driving past the building to see if anyone else had claimed the first spot .
Once the line started forming , she and her dream plopped down , for what was no doubt a nervous night 's sleep .
This casting call was a little different than most .
This time around , the CW is asking for girls 5 - foot - 7 and under -- virtual midgets by modeling standards .
They must be doing a show about how even short girls can get modeling contracts -- especially short girls who win contrived reality shows in which the winner gets a modeling contract .
So , yeah , most of the girls were kind of short , which you would think would be cool for me , since I 'm built like Dakota Fanning .
But the women there seemed to doubt that Top Model 's producers were seriously looking for short models , because they were all wearing heels the size of samurais .
So , yes , even in a room full of women who were only in the room because they were short , I was pretty much the shortest person there .
Thanks again , Dad .
Oh , did I mention there were CW producers there ?
Because there were n't .
The hundreds of people standing in line probably thought there were , because there were some important - looking people milling about with walkie - talkies .
And when the girls were finally herded upstairs for their big moment , there were indeed some charming fellows armed with a laptop , a camera and a boom mic .
But those were just the guys who make commercials for the local affiliate .
At first I thought they must have drawn the longest straws at the office to get such a cool gig , which appeared to come with free beer .
But when six o'clock rolled around and they 'd only gone through a handful of girls , I realized they probably drew the shortest straws .
Or maybe they were getting punished for dubbing a bunch of F - words into Drew Carey Show reruns .
Who knows ?
Anyway , I do n't think the girls realized how powerless the men before them were .
I guess it did n't even matter .
The camera was there .
The camera was who they needed to win over .
But I do know this :
Many of the aspiring reality - TV foils were very disappointed by the brevity of their face time .
It was less than a minute , all told .
They introduced themselves , explained why they were the next top model and did a little walk on the cat walk .
Yeah , on the catwalk .
On the catwalk .
Yeah .
( Actually , it was just a floor with some tape on it .
Yeah .
With some ...)
After their fifteen minutes seconds were up , the girls walked off , still nervous , and huddled with each other to dissect their performances .
" I screwed up , " Deja told another girl , with whom she 'd waited outside for hours .
They seemed to know their dream of making it big would have to wait .
Now they'd have to go back to working their way up from the bottom , toiling behind the scenes and --
What 's that ?
There 's a casting call for So You Can Think You Can Dance on Thursday ?
The dream lives on !
I bailed after the first ten or so girls .
Seen one attractive - but - not - really - Fashion - Week - material woman , seen 'em all .
When I got outside , the line was even longer than before .
( Our photographer tells me 1,200 people showed up in total , but only about 500 got on camera ) .
I was walking toward the end of it with another girl -- nice enough looking , I guess , but more suited for America 's Next Greek Diner Waitress -- when suddenly she stopped .
She recognized someone in line .
" What are you doing here ? " she asked .
Her friend shrugged : " Same thing as you . "
In a report released Sunday , the World Bank predicted that the global economy would shrink in 2009 for the first time in more than half a century and forecast that global trade would decline for the first time since the early 1980s .
“ Depreciation is n’t enough now to offset the global contraction , ” said Mr. Setser , noting that export powers like Japan , Korea , Taiwan and Brazil have had rapid declines in sales in recent months .
“ Everybody ’s looking vulnerable .
All commodity exporters are potentially subject to currency crises . ”
Fears are growing that a much broader group of countries will plunge into trouble .
Mr. Prasad ’s list of potential danger zones includes Vietnam , the Philippines , Malaysia and Indonesia , as well as Pakistan and Ecuador .
In the Asian financial crisis , countries at the center of the storm were particularly vulnerable because the values of their currencies were mostly pegged to the dollar .
Once central banks ran out of dollars to exchange for their own currencies , they lost their ability to influence the exchange rate .
As a result , their currencies fell , turning already large debts into impossible debts .
Many more countries now allow their currencies to float with the whims of the market , removing this grim chain of events .
Still , as economic activity slows and banks are stuck with larger losses , the damage could swell beyond the ability of governments to finance bailouts , said Kenneth S. Rogoff , a former chief economist at the I.M.F. and now a professor at Harvard .
“ Debt collapses are going to wreak havoc with exchange rates , ” Mr. Rogoff predicted .
“ A lot of countries in Europe are already on the brink of default . ”
Only two years ago , many analysts were suggesting that the I.M.F. — created more than 60 years ago to rescue countries in financial distress — no longer had a clear reason to exist .
Now , the fund is scrambling for contributions from developed nations to bolster its $ 350 billion war chest .
Mr. Setser suggested it needed $ 1 trillion for all that might yet unfold .

Israeli aircraft continued to bomb Gaza overnight as the UN urged an immediate end to nearly two weeks of conflict between Israel and Hamas militants .
A Security Council resolution called for a ceasefire , access for aid workers and a lasting solution to the conflict .
Overnight , at least 50 air strikes hit Gaza , one attack reportedly killing five Palestinians .
Militants fired several rockets into southern Israel .
It is estimated 770 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have been killed so far .
Meanwhile , witnesses have told the UN that about 30 Palestinians died earlier this week as Israeli forces shelled a house in Gaza City into which Israeli soldiers had previously moved more than 100 people , half of them children .
Israel said the allegations into the shelling of the house in the Zeitoun district were being investigated .
After the Security Council vote , Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said Israel would continue to act bearing the security of its citizens in mind .
Yigal Palmor , an Israeli foreign ministry spokesman , told the BBC that Hamas must not be able to rearm itself , and that the UN resolution " does not provide practical means to create a sustainable ceasefire " .
The Israeli security cabinet is meeting to consider its reaction and next steps .
The BBC's Tim Franks in Jerusalem says there is no guarantee that the UN 's call for an immediate end to hostilities will be met .
Hamas officials dismissed the UN resolution as not being " in the best interest " of Palestinians .
Ayman Taha , a Hamas spokesman in Gaza , said : " Even though we are the main actors on the ground in Gaza , we were not consulted about this resolution and they have not taken into account our vision and the interests of our people . "

In another development , a prominent Egyptian cleric called on Muslims across the world to stage rallies on Friday to demonstrate anger at the violence .
Yusuf al - Qaradawi , who heads the Union of Islamic Scholars , said Friday prayers should be dedicated to expressing solidarity with the Palestinians .
Israel has stationed thousands of extra police in east Jerusalem , in case of protests after Muslim Friday prayers .
' Durable ceasefire '
Early on Friday , Israeli planes launched fresh strikes on targets in Gaza .
At least five members of one family were killed in one attack , witnesses said .
In a report which could not be verified independently , Hamas said a bomb had flattened a five - storey apartment block in northern Gaza .
Reports of new attacks emerged as 14 out of 15 Security Council members backed a resolution on the crisis .
The resolution called for an " immediate , durable and fully respected ceasefire " leading to the " full withdrawal " of Israeli forces from Gaza .
It also called for " the unimpeded provision and distribution throughout Gaza of humanitarian assistance " , measures to prevent arms smuggling to Palestinian militants and the opening of border crossings into Gaza .
It is the first time the Security Council has acted since the Israeli offensive in Gaza began on 27 December .
The US chose to abstain , thinking it " important to see the outcomes of the Egyptian mediation efforts , in order to see what this resolution might have been supporting " , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice explained .
Israeli officials visited Cairo on Thursday to hear details of a plan put forward by Egypt and France .
A Hamas delegation is also expected in the Egyptian capital at some stage for parallel " technical " talks , Egyptian diplomats said .
Israel wants to stop rocket attacks on southern Israel and to stop Hamas smuggling weapons into Gaza via Egypt , while Hamas says any ceasefire deal must include an end to Israel 's blockade of Gaza .
The Security Council 's near - unanimous vote represents an important diplomatic punctuation mark in this crisis , correspondents say .
But the US abstention weakened the impact of the vote because Washington 's support would have placed more pressure on Israel to halt its offensive , they add .

In a meeting with financial analysts last week , Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer laid out who he thinks are the biggest threats today to Windows on the client side .
Surprisingly , Apple was n't number one .
It was n't number two or three either .
Referring to a pie chart at the meeting that gauges threats to Windows , Ballmer said that Windows itself , both licensed and pirated , were the top two threats to Microsoft in the client OS space , followed by Linux , then Apple .
Ballmer quipped : " Windows license , number one market share .
Number two market share goes to Windows pirated , or unlicensed .
That 's a competitor that 's tough to beat ; they 've got a good price and a heck of a product , but we 're working on it . "
Ballmer followed with a carefully - worded mockery of Apple 's " point or more " market share growth over the past year .
" A point of market share on a number that 's about 300 million [ number of PCs shipped worldwide in 2008 ] is interesting .
It 's an interesting amount of market share , while not necessarily being as dramatic as people would think . "
" Number two market share goes to Windows pirated , or unlicensed .
That 's a competitor that 's tough to beat ; they 've got a good price and a heck of a product . "
Steve Ballmer , Microsoft CEO , quipping about how Microsoft has to compete with itself .
Though Linux 's 0.88 percent OS market share hardly qualifies as a threat , Linux does compete with Microsoft in more areas than Apple and it is much cheaper .
" Cheap " takes on an appealing sound in an economic recession .
Clearly , Apple has been hit by the economic downturn in the past two months .
It has seen dips in Mac sales and market share , and even announced a small round of layoffs today .
But is Ballmer truly wary of Linux ?
Is he just trying to disparage Apple as usual ?
It 's hard to tell .
Industry experts interviewed for this story say the folks at Redmond will continue to face threats on all sides and even from within .
Linux Attacks on More Fronts
Matt Rosoff , an analyst with independent research firm Directions on Microsoft , mostly agrees with Ballmer about the threat pecking order , saying that Linux trumps Apple as a threat , but that Microsoft 's biggest rival is itself .
" Macintosh computers are a threat in precisely one market — upscale consumer PCs , a small part of the overall PC market , " Rosoff says .
" Linux is a bigger threat because it competes in more areas such as server OSs , embedded systems and increasingly on client PCs with the rise of low - cost netbooks , " he says .
But Microsoft 's biggest threat to Windows OS growth , says Rosoff , is the idea that existing PCs with older versions of Windows are good enough .
" Consumers and businesses may have no incentive to replace them until they break , " he says .
Apple Clout May Increase with New OS
Veteran industry analyst Roger Kay , president of research and consulting firm Endpoint Technologies , says he does n't see Linux as a threat to Microsoft now or any time in the future , and says it would be a mistake for Microsoft to take its eye off Apple .
" Apple can move as a unit .
The Linux crowd can't , " Kay says .
" Linux is just a collection of philosophically aligned developers without a well - financed backer .
I 'd be much more leery of Apple , a company with $ 25 billion in cash and a crack team of technologists and marketeers . "
Likewise , Tim Bajarin , president of tech consulting firm Creative Strategies , says that Microsoft is in no position to take Apple lightly .
He believes Apple has the superior client OS , but that Windows 7 is a big improvement over Vista and should help Microsoft keep their market share steady .
" However , Apple 's newest OS will be rolled out this summer and could bring more attention to the Mac platform , especially if it is rated better than Windows 7 , " Bajarin says .
Linux Sits Pretty on Smartphones , Netbooks
In addition to competition on client PCs , Bajarin points out a potentially more fierce battle brewing : smartphones .
The clash for OS dominance in the smartphone market puts Microsoft up against the wall , says Bajarin .
Here , Microsoft is dueling with not only Apple , but Linux - based Android from Google as well as the Palm and Symbian OSs .
And Google , of course , poses a much larger threat to Microsoft overall , with its dominance of the search market and ever - strengthening grip on Web - based applications that threaten Microsoft 's productivity app market share .
Bajarin expects to see major vendors backing Google 's Android OS on smartphones and netbooks starting this year .
" In this space , Microsoft has to be just as concerned about Android as Apple , " he says .
The Enemy Within
Another Directions on Microsoft analyst , Michael Cherry , contends that Microsoft 's size requires that it watch all sides .
" Apple and Linux both create some pain for Microsoft , " he says .
Cherry says that Apple will continue to threaten Microsoft on laptops , desktops and smartphones , plus has set the bar very high for customer satisfaction .
He adds that " even if Apple does not gain market share , there will always be comparisons to its design and quality . "
The threat of Linux , Cherry says , depends on how the consumer market moves , and whether or not corporations follow .
" If there is truly a migration to low - cost machines with less hardware resources , then customers may be more open to Linux than a version of Windows that is restricted only to work on the available hardware . "
He adds that the economic recession may accelerate Linux adoption .
" I think customers will pay a slight premium to get Windows , but at some point they could become indifferent to the OS to save money . "
Like his Directions on Microsoft colleague Rosoff , Cherry thinks Microsoft 's biggest threat is Windows users that do not feel compelled to change to a newer version of the OS .
" This means Microsoft not only has to convince us that they are better than Apple or Linux , but also that their latest version is better than the one we are using — so much better that we are willing to go through the expense of upgrading . "

Further evidence has emerged revealing how the Pentagon is in the business of responding to blog posts critical of the U.S. government .
Noah Shachtman , writing for Wired , posts an Air Force flowchart used for “ counter - blogging ” purposes .
Air Force flowchart used for “ counter - blogging ” purposes .
Click image to see a larger version .
“ In a twelve - point plan , put together by the emerging technology division of the Air Force ’s public affairs arm , airmen are given guidance on how to handle ‘ trolls , ’ ‘ ragers ’ — and even well - informed online writers , too .
It ’s all part of an Air Force push to ‘ counter the people out there in the blogosphere who have negative opinions about the U.S. government and the Air Force , ’ Captain David Faggard says , ” Shachtman writes .
In the case of the Infowars and Prison Planet websites , Centcom operatives do not respond to trolls and ragers .
In fact , many of them seem to be the most vociferous trolls and ragers .
On October 16 , 2006 , Raw Story reported that the United States Central Command sent an email to bloggers on the subject of the GWOT , or so - called “ global war on terror , ” as part of the Pentagon ’s “ engagement operations . ”
“ Now [ online readers ] have the opportunity to read positive stories .
At least the public can go there and see the whole story , ” said Maj .
Richard J. McNorton .
“ The public wants to hear these good stories . ”
In fact , the public gets these ostensibly “ good stories ” via the corporate media that acts as a propaganda conduit for the government and the Pentagon .
“ I ’ve always thought that a military - like process would be a good bridge to connect the services with the blogosphere .
There ’s a field manual for everything in the military , so this flow - chart presents online communications in a DoD [ Department of Defense ] friendly format , ” former military spokesman Steven Field told Wired .
Mr. Field ’s assertion is seriously at odds with Pentagon policy , however .
A 2003 Pentagon document entitled the Information Operation Roadmap , released to the public after a FOIA request by the National Security Archive at George Washington University in 2006 , characterizes the internet as if it were an enemy “ weapons system . ”
“ We Must Fight the Net. DoD [ Department of Defense ] is building an information - centric force , ” the document states .
“ Networks are increasingly the operational center of gravity , and the Department must be prepared to ‘ fight the net ’…
DoD ’s ‘ Defense in Depth ’ strategy should operate on the premise that the Department will ‘ fight the net ’ as it would a weapons system . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Unleashing trolls and ragers who consider blogs and websites opposed to the government as an enemy “ weapons system ” is only part of the overall plan to conquer and dominate the internet .
“ Part of the Information Operation Roadmap ’s plans for the internet are to ‘ ensure the graceful degradation of the network rather than its collapse . ’ ( pg 45 ) This is presented in “ defensive ” terms , but presumably , it is as exclusively defensive as the Department of Defense , ” notes Brent Jessop for Global Research .
As far as the Pentagon is concerned the internet is not all bad , after all , it was the Department of Defense through DARPA that gave us the internet in the first place .
The internet is useful not only as a business tool but also is excellent for monitoring and tracking users , acclimatizing people to a virtual world , and developing detailed psychological profiles of every user , among many other Pentagon positives .
But , one problem with the current internet is the potential for the dissemination of ideas and information not consistent with US government themes and messages , commonly known as free speech .
Naturally , since the plan was to completely dominate the “ infosphere , ” the internet would have to be adjusted or replaced with an upgraded and even more Pentagon friendly successor .
A renowned Russian author , Dmitry Glukhovsky , told Russia Today the internet may very well be in decline .
“ Glukhovsky predicted that the network would become clogged with traffic and may grind to a halt in the near future , ” writes Steve Watson .
“ We have previously warned that the rumors of the internet ’s decline have been much exaggerated and used as a pretext for calls to designate of a new form of the internet known as Internet 2 . ”
Of course , Internet 2 would be greatly regulated and only “ appropriate content ” would be accepted by an FCC or government bureau .
Everything else would be relegated to the “ slow lane ” internet , the junkyard as it were .
In tandem with broad data retention legislation currently being introduced worldwide , such “ clean slate ” projects may represent a considerable threat to the freedom of the internet as we know it .
EU directives and US proposals for data retention may mean that any normal website or blog would have to fall into line with such new rules and suddenly total web regulation would become a reality .
This “ clean slate ” and “ appropriate content ” agenda dovetails with the objectives of the Pentagon as it “ fights the net ” and strives to disseminate “ good stories , ” that is to say counter the research of “ well - informed online writers ” with pro-government propaganda .

The Imperial Unconscious
Afghan Faces , Predators , Reapers , Terrorist Stars , Roman Conquerors , Imperial Graveyards , and Other Oddities of the Truncated American Century
By Tom Engelhardt
Sometimes , it 's the everyday things , the ones that fly below the radar , that matter .
Here , according to Bloomberg News , is part of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates 's recent testimony on the Afghan War before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee :
" U.S. goals in Afghanistan must be ' modest , realistic , ' and ' above all , there must be an Afghan face on this war , ' Gates said .
' The Afghan people must believe this is their war and we are there to help them .
If they think we are there for our own purposes , then we will go the way of every other foreign army that has been in Afghanistan . ' "
Now , in our world , a statement like this seems so obvious , so reasonable as to be beyond comment .
And yet , stop a moment and think about this part of it : " there must be an Afghan face on this war . "
U.S. military and civilian officials used an equivalent phrase in 2005 - 2006 when things were going really , really wrong in Iraq .
It was then commonplace -- and no less unremarked upon -- for them to urgently suggest that an " Iraqi face " be put on events there .
Evidently back in vogue for a different war , the phrase is revelatory -- and oddly blunt .
As an image , there 's really only one way to understand it ( not that anyone here stops to do so ) .
After all , what does it mean to " put a face " on something that assumedly already has a face ?
In this case , it has to mean putting an Afghan mask over what we know to be the actual " face " of the Afghan War -- ours -- a foreign face that men like Gates recognize , quite correctly , is not the one most Afghans want to see .
It 's hardly surprising that the Secretary of Defense would pick up such a phrase , part of Washington 's everyday arsenal of words and images when it comes to geopolitics , power , and war .
And yet , make no mistake , this is Empire - speak , American - style .
It 's the language -- behind which lies a deeper structure of argument and thought -- that is essential to Washington 's vision of itself as a planet - straddling goliath .
Think of that " Afghan face " / mask , in fact , as part of the flotsam and jetsam that regularly bubbles up from the American imperial unconscious .
Of course , words create realities even though such language , in all its strangeness , essentially passes unnoticed here .
Largely uncommented upon , it helps normalize American practices in the world , comfortably shielding us from certain global realities ; but it also has the potential to blind us to those realities , which , in perilous times , can be dangerous indeed .
So let 's consider just a few entries in what might be thought of as The Dictionary of American Empire - Speak .
War Hidden in Plain Sight :
There has recently been much reporting on , and even some debate here about , the efficacy of the Obama administration 's decision to increase the intensity of CIA missile attacks from drone aircraft in what Washington , in a newly coined neologism reflecting a widening war , now calls " Af - Pak " -- the Pashtun tribal borderlands of Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Since August 2008 , more than 30 such missile attacks have been launched on the Pakistani side of that border against suspected al - Qaeda and Taliban targets .
The pace of attacks has actually risen since Barack Obama entered the Oval Office , as have casualties from the missile strikes , as well as popular outrage in Pakistan over the attacks .
Thanks to Senator Diane Feinstein , we also know that , despite strong official Pakistani government protests , someone official in that country is doing more than looking the other way while they occur .
As the Senator revealed recently , at least some of the CIA 's unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) cruising the skies over Af - Pak are evidently stationed at Pakistani bases .
We learned recently as well that American Special Operations units are now regularly making forays inside Pakistan " primarily to gather intelligence " ; that a unit of 70 American Special Forces advisors , a " secret task force , overseen by the United States Central Command and Special Operations Command , " is now aiding and training Pakistani Army and Frontier Corps paramilitary troops , again inside Pakistan ; and that , despite ( or perhaps , in part , because of ) these American efforts , the influence of the Pakistani Taliban is actually expanding , even as Pakistan threatens to melt down .
Mystifyingly enough , however , this Pakistani part of the American war in Afghanistan is still referred to in major U.S. papers as a " covert war . "
As news about it pours out , who it 's being hidden from is one of those questions no one bothers to ask .
On February 20th , the New York Times ' Mark Mazzetti and David E. Sanger typically wrote :
" With two missile strikes over the past week , the Obama administration has expanded the covert war run by the Central Intelligence Agency inside Pakistan , attacking a militant network seeking to topple the Pakistani government ...
Under standard policy for covert operations , the C.I.A. strikes inside Pakistan have not been publicly acknowledged either by the Obama administration or the Bush administration . "
On February 25th , Mazzetti and Helene Cooper reported that new CIA head Leon Panetta essentially bragged to reporters that " the agency 's campaign against militants in Pakistan 's tribal areas was the ' most effective weapon ' the Obama administration had to combat Al Qaeda 's top leadership ...
Mr. Panetta stopped short of directly acknowledging the missile strikes , but he said that ' operational efforts ' focusing on Qaeda leaders had been successful . "
Siobhan Gorman of the Wall Street Journal reported the next day that Panetta said the attacks are " probably the most effective weapon we have to try to disrupt al Qaeda right now . "
She added , " Mr. Obama and National Security Adviser James Jones have strongly endorsed their use , [ Panetta ] said . "
Uh , covert war ?
These " covert " " operational efforts " have been front - page news in the Pakistani press for months , they were part of the U.S. presidential campaign debates , and they certainly can't be a secret for the Pashtuns in those border areas who must see drone aircraft overhead relatively regularly , or experience the missiles arriving in their neighborhoods .
In the U.S. , " covert war " has long been a term for wars like the U.S. - backed Contra War against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in the 1980s , which were openly discussed , debated , and often lauded in this country .
To a large extent , when aspects of these wars have actually been " covert " -- that is , purposely hidden from anyone -- it has been from the American public , not the enemies being warred upon .
At the very least , however , such language , however threadbare , offers official Washington a kind of " plausible deniability " when it comes to thinking about what kind of an " American face " we present to the world .
Imperial Naming Practices :
In our press , anonymous U.S. officials now point with pride to the increasing " precision " and " accuracy " of those drone missile attacks in taking out Taliban or al - Qaeda figures without ( supposedly ) taking out the tribespeople who live in the same villages or neighboring compounds .
Such pieces lend our air war an almost sterile quality .
They tend to emphasize the extraordinary lengths to which planners go to avoid " collateral damage . "
To many Americans , it must then seem strange , even irrational , that perfectly non-fundamentalist Pakistanis should be quite so outraged about attacks aimed at the world 's worst terrorists .
On the other hand , consider for a moment the names of those drones now regularly in the skies over " Pashtunistan . "
These are no less regularly published in our press to no comment at all .
The most basic of the armed drones goes by the name of Predator , a moniker which might as well have come directly from those nightmarish sci- fi movies about an alien that feasts on humans .
Undoubtedly , however , it was used in the way Col.
Michael Steele of the 101st Airborne Division meant it when he exhorted his brigade deploying to Iraq ( according to Thomas E. Ricks ' new book The Gamble ) to remember : " You 're the predator . "
The Predator drone is armed with " only " two missiles .
The more advanced drone , originally called the Predator B , now being deployed to the skies over Af - Pak , has been dubbed the Reaper -- as in the Grim Reaper .
Now , there 's only one thing such a " hunter - killer UAV " could be reaping , and you know just what that is : lives .
It can be armed with up to 14 missiles ( or four missiles and two 500 - pound bombs ) , which means it packs quite a deadly wallop .
Oh , by the way , those missiles are named as well .
They 're Hellfire missiles .
So , if you want to consider the nature of this covert war in terms of names alone : Predators and Reapers are bringing down the fire from some satanic hell upon the peasants , fundamentalist guerrillas , and terrorists of the Af - Pak border regions .
In Washington , when the Af - Pak War is discussed , it's in the bloodless , bureaucratic language of " global counterinsurgency " or " irregular warfare " ( IW ) , of " soft power , " " hard power , " and " smart power . "
But flying over the Pashtun wildlands is the blunt - edged face of predation and death , ready at a moment 's notice to deliver hellfire to those below .
Imperial Arguments :
Let 's pursue this just a little further .
Faced with rising numbers of civilian casualties from U.S. and NATO air strikes in Afghanistan and an increasingly outraged Afghan public , American officials tend to place the blame for most sky - borne " collateral damage " squarely on the Taliban .
As Joint Chiefs Chairman Michael Mullen bluntly explained recently , " [ T ] he enemy hides behind civilians . "
Hence , so this Empire - speak argument goes , dead civilians are actually the Taliban 's doing .
U.S. military and civilian spokespeople have long accused Taliban guerrillas of using civilians as " shields , " or even of purposely luring devastating air strikes down on Afghan wedding parties to create civilian casualties and so inflame the sensibilities of rural Afghanistan .
This commonplace argument has two key features : a claim that they made us do it ( kill civilians ) and the implication that the Taliban fighters " hiding " among innocent villagers or wedding revelers are so many cowards , willing to put their fellow Pashtuns at risk rather than come out and fight like men -- and , of course , given the firepower arrayed against them , die .
The U.S. media regularly records this argument without reflecting on it .
In this country , in fact , the evil of combatants " hiding " among civilians seems so self - evident , especially given the larger evil of the Taliban and al - Qaeda , that no one thinks twice about it .
And yet like so much of Empire - speak on a one - way planet , this argument is distinctly uni-directional .
What 's good for the guerrilla goose , so to speak , is inapplicable to the imperial gander .
To illustrate , consider the American " pilots " flying those unmanned Predators and Reapers .
We do n't know exactly where all of them are ( other than not in the drones ) , but some are certainly at Nellis Air Force Base just outside Las Vegas .
In other words , were the Taliban guerrillas to leave the protection of those civilians and come out into the open , there would be no enemy to fight in the usual sense , not even a predatory one .
The pilot firing that Hellfire missile into some Pakistani border village or compound is , after all , using the UAV 's cameras , including by next year a new system hair - raisingly dubbed " Gorgon Stare , " to locate his target and then , via console , as in a single - shooter video game , firing the missile , possibly from many thousands of miles away .
And yet nowhere in our world will you find anyone making the argument that those pilots are in " hiding " like so many cowards .
Such a thought seems absurd to us , as it would if it were applied to the F - 18 pilots taking off from aircraft carriers off the Afghan coast or the B - 1 pilots flying out of unnamed Middle Eastern bases or the Indian Ocean island base of Diego Garcia .
And yet , whatever those pilots may do in Afghan skies , unless they experience a mechanical malfunction , they are in no more danger than if they , too , were somewhere outside Las Vegas .
In the last seven years , a few helicopters , but no planes , have gone down in Afghanistan .
When the Afghan mujahedeen fought the Soviets in the 1980s , the CIA supplied them with hand - held Stinger missiles , the most advanced surface - to - air missile in the U.S. arsenal , and they did indeed start knocking Soviet helicopters and planes out of the skies ( which proved the beginning of the end for the Russians ) .
The Afghan or Pakistani Taliban or al - Qaeda terrorists have no such capability today , which means , if you think about it , that what we here imagine as an " air war " involves none of the dangers we would normally associate with war .
Looked at in another light , those missile strikes and bombings are really one - way acts of slaughter .
The Taliban 's tactics are , of course , the essence of guerrilla warfare , which always involves an asymmetrical battle against more powerful armies and weaponry , and which , if successful , always depends on the ability of the guerrilla to blend into the environment , natural and human , or , as Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong so famously put it , to " swim " in the " sea of the people . "
If you imagine your enemy simply using the villagers of Afghanistan as " shields " or " hiding " like so many cowards among them , you are speaking the language of imperial power but also blinding yourself ( or the American public ) to the actual realities of the war you 're fighting .
Imperial Jokes :
In October 2008 , Rafael Correa , the president of Ecuador , refused to renew the U.S. lease at Manta Air Base , one of at least 761 foreign bases , macro to micro , that the U.S. garrisons worldwide .
Correa reportedly said : " We 'll renew the base on one condition : that they let us put a base in Miami -- an Ecuadorean base .
If there 's no problem having foreign soldiers on a country 's soil , surely they 'll let us have an Ecuadorean base in the United States . "
This qualifies as an anti-imperial joke .
The " leftist " president of Ecuador was doing no more than tweaking the nose of goliath .
An Ecuadorian base in Miami ?
Absurd .
No one on the planet could take such a suggestion seriously .
On the other hand , when it comes to the U.S. having a major base in Kyrgyzstan , a Central Asian land that not one in a million Americans has ever heard of , that 's no laughing matter .
After all , Washington has been paying $ 20 million a year in direct rent for the use of that country 's Manas Air Base ( and , as indirect rent , another $ 80 million has gone to various Kyrgyzstani programs ) .
As late as last October , the Pentagon was planning to sink another $ 100 million into construction at Manas " to expand aircraft parking areas at the base and provide a ' hot cargo pad ' -- an area safe enough to load and unload hazardous and explosive cargo -- to be located away from inhabited facilities . "
That , however , was when things started to go wrong .
Now , Kyrgyzstan 's parliament has voted to expel the U.S. from Manas within six months , a serious blow to our resupply efforts for the Afghan War .
More outrageous yet to Washington , the Kyrgyzstanis seem to have done this at the bidding of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , who has the nerve to want to reestablish a Russian sphere of influence in what used to be the borderlands of the old Soviet Union .
Put in a nutshell , despite the crumbling U.S. economic situation and the rising costs of the Afghan War , we still act as if we live on a one - way planet .
Some country demanding a base in the U.S. ?
That 's a joke or an insult , while the U.S. potentially gaining or losing a base almost anywhere on the planet may be an insult , but it 's never a laughing matter .
Imperial Thought : Recently , to justify those missile attacks in Pakistan , U.S. officials have been leaking details on the program 's " successes " to reporters .
Anonymous officials have offered the " possibly wishful estimate " that the CIA " covert war " has led to the deaths ( or capture ) of 11 of al Qaeda 's top 20 commanders , including , according to a recent Wall Street Journal report , " Abu Layth al - Libi , whom U.S. officials described as ' a rising star ' in the group . "
" Rising star " is such an American phrase , melding as it does imagined terror hierarchies with the lingo of celebrity tabloids .
In fact , one problem with Empire - speak , and imperial thought more generally , is the way it prevents imperial officials from imagining a world not in their own image .
So it 's not surprising that , despite their best efforts , they regularly conjure up their enemies as a warped version of themselves -- hierarchical , overly reliant on leaders , and top heavy .
In the Vietnam era , for instance , American officials spent a remarkable amount of effort sending troops to search for , and planes to bomb , the border sanctuaries of Cambodia and Laos on a fruitless hunt for COSVN ( the so - called Central Office for South Vietnam ) , the supposed nerve center of the communist enemy , aka " the bamboo Pentagon . "
Of course , it was n't there to be found , except in Washington 's imperial imagination .
In the Af - Pak " theater , " we may be seeing a similar phenomenon .
Underpinning the CIA killer - drone program is a belief that the key to combating al - Qaeda ( and possibly the Taliban ) is destroying its leadership one by one .
As key Pakistani officials have tried to explain , the missile attacks , which have indeed killed some al - Qaeda and Pakistani Taliban figures ( as well as whoever was in their vicinity ) , are distinctly counterproductive .
The deaths of those figures in no way compensates for the outrage , the destabilization , the radicalization that the attacks engender in the region .
They may , in fact , be functionally strengthening each of those movements .
What it 's hard for Washington to grasp is this : " decapitation , " to use another American imperial term , is not a particularly effective strategy with a decentralized guerrilla or terror organization .
The fact is a headless guerrilla movement is nowhere near as brainless or helpless as a headless Washington would be .
Only recently , Eric Schmitt and Jane Perlez of the New York Times reported that , while top U.S. officials were exhibiting optimism about the effectiveness of the missile strikes , Pakistani officials were pointing to " ominous signs of Al Qaeda 's resilience " and suggesting " that Al Qaeda was replenishing killed fighters and midlevel leaders with less experienced but more hard - core militants , who are considered more dangerous because they have fewer allegiances to local Pakistani tribes ...
The Pakistani intelligence assessment found that Al Qaeda had adapted to the blows to its command structure by shifting ' to conduct decentralized operations under small but well - organized regional groups ' within Pakistan and Afghanistan . "
Imperial Dreams and Nightmares : Americans have rarely liked to think of themselves as " imperial , " so what is it about Rome in these last years ?
First , the neocons , in the flush of seeming victory in 2002 - 2003 began to imagine the U.S. as a " new Rome " ( or new British Empire ) , or as Charles Krauthammer wrote as early as February 2001 in Time Magazine , " America is no mere international citizen .
It is the dominant power in the world , more dominant than any since Rome . "
All roads on this planet , they were then convinced , led ineluctably to Washington .
Now , of course , they visibly do n't , and the imperial bragging about surpassing the Roman or British empires has long since faded away .
When it comes to the Afghan War , in fact , those ( resupply ) " roads " seem to lead , embarrassingly enough , through Pakistan , Kyrgyzstan , Uzbekistan , Russia , and Iran .
But the comparison to conquering Rome evidently remains on the brain .
When , for instance , Joint Chiefs Chairman Mike Mullen wrote an op -ed for the Washington Post recently , drumming up support for the revised , age - of - Obama American mission in Afghanistan , he just could n't help starting off with an inspiring tale about the Romans and a small Italian city - state , Locri , that they conquered .
As he tells it , the ruler the Romans installed in Locri , a rapacious fellow named Pleminius , proved a looter and a tyrant .
And yet , Mullen assures us , the Locrians so believed in " the reputation for equanimity and fairness that Rome had built " that they sent a delegation to the Roman Senate , knowing they could get a hearing , and demanded restitution ; and indeed , the tyrant was removed .
Admittedly , this seems a far - fetched analogy to the U.S. in Afghanistan ( and do n't for a second mix up Pleminius , that rogue , with Afghan President Hamid Karzai , even though the Obama - ites evidently now believe him corrupt and replaceable ) .
Still , as Mullen sees it , the point is : " We do n't always get it right .
But like the early Romans , we strive in the end to make it right .
We strive to earn trust .
And that makes all the difference . "
Mullen is , it seems , the Aesop of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and , in his somewhat overheated brain , we evidently remain the conquering ( but just ) " early " Romans -- before , of course , the fatal rot set in .
And then there 's the Washington Post 's Thomas Ricks , a superb reporter who , in his latest book , gives voice to the views of Centcom Commander David Petraeus .
Reflecting on Iraq , where he ( like the general ) believes we could still be fighting in " 2015 , " Ricks begins a recent Post piece this way :
" In October 2008 , as I was finishing my latest book on the Iraq war , I visited the Roman Forum during a stop in Italy .
I sat on a stone wall on the south side of the Capitoline Hill and studied the two triumphal arches at either end of the Forum , both commemorating Roman wars in the Middle East ...
The structures brought home a sad realization :
It 's simply unrealistic to believe that the U.S. military will be able to pull out of the Middle East
It was a week when U.S. forces had engaged in combat in Syria , Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan -- a string of countries stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean -- following in the footsteps of Alexander the Great , the Romans and the British . "
With the waning of British power , Ricks continues , it " has been the United States ' turn to take the lead there . "
And our turn , as it happens , just is n't over yet .
Evidently that , at least , is the view from our imperial capital and from our military viceroys out on the peripheries .
Honestly , Freud would have loved these guys .
They seem to channel the imperial unconscious .
Take David Petraeus .
For him , too , the duties and dangers of empire evidently weigh heavily on the brain .
Like a number of key figures , civilian and military , he has lately begun to issue warnings about Afghanistan 's dangers .
As the Washington Post reported , " [ Petraeus ] suggested that the odds of success were low , given that foreign military powers have historically met with defeat in Afghanistan .
' Afghanistan has been known over the years as the graveyard of empires , ' he said .
' We can not take that history lightly . ' "
Of course , he 's worrying about the graveyard aspect of this , but what I find curious -- exactly because no one thinks it odd enough to comment on here -- is the functional admission in the use of this old adage about Afghanistan that we fall into the category of empires , whether or not in search of a graveyard in which to die .
And he 's not alone in this .
Secretary of Defense Gates put the matter similarly recently : " Without the support of the Afghan people , Gates said , the U.S. would simply ' go the way of every other foreign army that 's ever been in Afghanistan . ' "
Imperial Blindness :
Think of the above as just a few prospective entries in The Dictionary of American Empire - Speak that will , of course , never be compiled .
We 're so used to such language , so inured to it and to the thinking behind it , so used , in fact , to living on a one - way planet in which all roads lead to and from Washington , that it does n't seem like a language at all .
It 's just part of the unexamined warp and woof of everyday life in a country that still believes it normal to garrison the planet , regularly fight wars halfway across the globe , find triumph or tragedy in the gain or loss of an air base in a country few Americans could locate on a map , and produce military manuals on counterinsurgency warfare the way a do - it - yourself furniture maker would produce instructions for constructing a cabinet from a kit .
We do n't find it strange to have 16 intelligence agencies , some devoted to listening in on , and spying on , the planet , or capable of running " covert wars " in tribal borderlands thousands of miles distant , or of flying unmanned drones over those same borderlands destroying those who come into camera view .
We 're inured to the bizarreness of it all and of the language ( and pretensions ) that go with it .
If The Dictionary of American Empire - Speak were ever produced , who here would buy it ?
Who would feel the need to check out what seems like the only reasonable and self - evident language for describing the world ?
How else , after all , would we operate ?
How else would any American in a position of authority talk in Washington or Baghdad or Islamabad or Rome ?
So it undoubtedly seemed to the Romans , too .
And we know what finally happened to their empire and the language that went with it .
Such a language plays its role in normalizing the running of an empire .
It allows officials ( and in our case the media as well ) not to see what would be inconvenient to the smooth functioning of such an enormous undertaking .
Embedded in its words and phrases is a fierce way of thinking ( even if we do n't see it that way ) , as well as plausible deniability .
And in the good times , its uses are obvious .
On the other hand , when the normal ways of empire cease to function well , that same language can suddenly work to blind the imperial custodians -- which is , after all , what the foreign policy " team " of the Obama era is -- to necessary realities .
At a moment when it might be important to grasp what the " American face " in the mirror actually looks like , you can't see it .
And sometimes what you can't bring yourself to see can , as now , hurt you .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. House of Representatives swiftly passed a bill on Thursday to recoup controversial bonuses paid to American International Group Inc as Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner tried to calm the furor by taking responsibility .
In the face of public outrage at the fact that AIG paid $ 165 million in bonuses after receiving $ 180 billion in government aid , the House voted 328- 93 to approve a 90 percent tax on bonuses for certain executives at companies that are getting taxpayer - financed help .
The number two Republican in the Senate , Jon Kyl of Arizona , blocked an initial bid to approve a Senate version of the legislation that would put a 70 percent excise tax on bonuses for employees at companies that have received at least $ 100 million in bailout aid .
Kyl objected to a request to agree by unanimous consent to pass it , saying more study was needed and putting into question when the Senate might again try to pass the legislation .
‘ BUBBLE AND BUST ’
President Barack Obama urged lawmakers to press on with measures that he can sign into law , calling AIG bonuses a symptom of “ a bubble and bust economy that valued reckless speculation over responsibility and hard work . ”
Meanwhile , U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner took some blame for the controversy over the AIG payments , telling CNN Treasury was concerned that trying to squelch bonuses agreed previously might come under legal challenge .
Senator Christopher Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , had been scrambling to explain how a tough provision to restrict bonuses got watered down in a recently passed stimulus bill .
In response to questions , Geithner said Treasury staff had expressed concern that provisions originally in the bill that would have prevented bonus payments might not survive a legal challenge .
The U.S. Treasury chief , who has come under criticism for not doing more to stop the AIG bonuses , repeated he only learned “ the full scale and scope of these specific bonus problems ” on March 10 and conceded he was partly at fault .
WHO ’S TO BLAME ?
“ You know , it ’s my responsibility , I was in a position where I did n’t know about these sooner , I take full responsibility for that , ” Geithner said .
He dismissed calls for his resignation as something that “ just comes with the job . ”

It is still not widely known who at AIG received the bonus payments , which were supposed to be aimed at keeping highly skilled employees on the job at the troubled insurer .
AIG complied with a subpoena to provide details of bonus recipients to New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo .
But he said his office -- aware of threats made against AIG employees -- would conduct a risk assessment before releasing any names .
The House proposal ’s hefty tax provision would apply to executives with incomes over $ 250,000 who work for companies that get at least $ 5 billion in federal aid .
That could include others besides AIG , such as mortgage financing company Fannie Mae .

“ The whole idea that they should be rewarded millions of dollars is repugnant to everything that decent people believe in , ” said Representative Charlie Rangel , the Democratic chairman of the tax - writing Ways and Means Committee .
In a measure of the widespread outrage over bonuses , small crowds of protesters marched in cities across the United States to denounce the idea that AIG employees who helped push the insurer to the brink of collapse should be rewarded for it .
In New York , Cuomo said he had details in hand on who received the bonuses at AIG .
He also said Bank of America Corp was expected to hand over the names of the 200 top bonus earners at Merrill Lynch &
Co from last year , another potential embarrassment for the bailout process .
Goldman Sachs Group
Inc plans to respond publicly to what it described as misperceptions about its trading relationship with AIG after it was paid $ 12.9 billion by AIG from bailout funds .
Amid the furor , some Senate Republicans urged a slower approach to trying to claw back bonus payments .
“ Until we have hearings and we understand all this , we are not going to know what kind of fix to implement , ” Kyl told reporters .

" I am happy to be free and to see the light of day again , " said an exhausted looking Mr Foucher .
The CEO had gone to the factory on Thursday to meet its 311 workers one last time before its closure on April 17 .
The Associated Press brought a copyright lawsuit Wednesday , alleging that Los Angeles street artist Shepard Fairey used " computerized paint by the numbers " and " copy - and - paste style " to create the highly recognized " Hope " image of Barack Obama .
The nation 's oldest and largest operating news - gathering organization sought unspecific damages from Fairey , who the wire service accuses of misappropriating a 2006 AP photo of Obama when he was a senator from Illinois .
Last month , Fairey filed a preemptive lawsuit seeking to have a court rule that his computerized image was a fair use of the photo snapped at National Press Club on April 27 , 2006 .
" Simply put , the fair use doctrine cannot be contorted to permit Fairey to wholly replicate a photographer 's prescient photograph and exploit it for his own commercial benefit , " ( .pdf ) the AP wrote in its New York federal counter suit .
The AP claims Fairey has generated $ 400,000 in sales of the image , which has adorned websites , posters , stickers , shirts and buttons .
And the AP said Fairey vigorously defends his copyrights , even threatening to sue Texas artist Baxter Orr who reconfigured a Fairey drawing by adding a surgeon 's mask .
The news agency added " Fairey essentially has engaged in a form of computerized paint by the numbers with The AP 's copyrighted image – taking the work in its entirety .
The amount and substantiality of plaintiffs ' use is unmistakable – it is a wholesale copying of The AP photo . "
Fairey has acknowledged his popular " Hope " image was based on the AP picture taken by Mannie Garcia .
But Fairey said in his suit that his rendition transformed the photo into a " stunning , abstracted and idealized visual image that creates powerful new meaning and conveys a radically different message . "
The AP disagreed , writing that Fairey 's depiction retains " the heart and essence of The AP 's photo , including but not limited to its patriotic theme . "
In a statement , Fairey said :
I am disappointed the Associated Press is persisting in its misguided accusations of copyright infringement .
I believe that my use of the Mannie Garcia photo as a reference , which I acknowledged off the bat as an AP photograph , falls under “ fair use ” provisions laid out in the law .
I am even more disappointed the AP is now trying to distort the facts surrounding my work .
They suggest my purpose in creating the poster was to merchandise it and make money .
It was n't .
My entire purpose in creating the poster was to support Obama and help get him elected .
Money was never the point .
The proceeds that were generated from the poster were used to create more posters and donated to charity .
I look forward to disproving the AP 's accusations once and for all and upholding the free expression rights at stake here .

Days before President Bush left office in January , his administration fired a parting shot at Professor Lyle Craker 's eight - year quest to cultivate marijuana for medical research by abruptly denying him a federal license despite a nearly two - year old Drug Enforcement Administration law judge 's recommendation that he receive one .
But the new administration led by President Obama , who has publicly backed the use of marijuana for medical purposes to stave off pain , might reverse the decision and keep Craker 's license application from going up in smoke .
A source familiar with the case said the White House will likely demand that the decision be reviewed .
" Basically they want to do an autopsy of what occurred and have it go through a proper review , " the source said .
[ National Journal ]
Wow , it 's almost hard to keep up .
Here 's yet another potentially major breakthrough on the medical marijuana front :
Anonymous sources can be misleading , so I called Aaron Houston at MPP , who told me the story is true and graciously did not request anonymity .
Of course , it remains to be seen whether the administration 's review ultimately results in reversal of the research blockade , but the fact that they 're looking into it is a very positive indication .
It should prove difficult to examine this issue without seeing it for what it is : a prolonged and transparently dishonest effort to obstruct medical marijuana research by preventing researchers from producing marijuana and denying them access to existing sources .
Given yesterday 's reaffirmation of Obama 's pledge to respect state medical marijuana laws , it seems that a positive pattern has emerged here .
The new administration is re-evaluating the issue from multiple angles and finding that medical marijuana has been mishandled at the federal level in more than one way .
It 's tremendously encouraging to see the executive branch taking interest in corrupt political obstructionism at the DEA .
I 'd encourage them to expand the inquiry beyond just medical marijuana .
In a desperate attempt to reverse 25 years of failure to develop an Aids vaccine , scientists have a new approach : studying people who have been infected with HIV for many years without any signs of ill - health .
The patients ' secret ?
Natural immunity .
The researchers have investigated the virus - fighting antibodies found in the blood of six long - term survivors of HIV whose own immune systems appear to be capable of shrugging off the virus .
Results of tests show that a prototype vaccine made from several of the antibodies produced by those long - term survivors can prevent HIV from infecting human cells .
The experiments have been successful on human cells growing in a test tube .
Now further trials are planned on laboratory animals and human volunteers .
The search for an Aids vaccine has suffered a series of setbacks over the years .
The most recent was the failure of the most promising potential vaccine , in a major clinical trial by the US drug company Merck .
The trial , which had involved thousands of volunteers , had to be abandoned at the end of 2007 because of fears that the trial vaccine might in fact make patients more susceptible to Aids .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The results of the latest study , published in the journal Nature , come from the most preliminary stage of vaccine development .
However , the scientists are optimistic that studying the natural immunity of long - term HIV survivors will eventually lead to a vaccine – something which is seen as the only effective way of controlling a global epidemic that kills about two million people a year .
Professor Michel Nussenzweig of The Rockefeller University in New York said the new approach is based on nature 's way of fending off HIV , with antibodies produced by the human body itself , rather than trying to stimulate immunity with the more synthetically - produced " magic bullet " antibodies used in conventional Aids vaccines – which have all failed .
Long - term survivors of HIV have been known to live for 20 years or more without taking anti-viral drugs or even without showing any of the recognised symptoms of Aids , such as the fall in the number of certain white blood cells attacked by the Aids virus .
It is thought that they can do this because they are born with an HIV - resistant immune system .
Professor Nussenzweig said the immune systems of these rare patients – who may represent just one in every 1,000 people infected with HIV – produce a set of antibodies that collectively are able to " neutralise " the virus , preventing it from infecting the blood cells of the immune system that it needs to replicate itself .
" We wanted to try something different , so we tried to reproduce what 's in the patient , " said Professor Nussenzweig .
" And what 's in the patient is many different antibodies that individually have limited neutralising ability but together are quite powerful .
This should make people think about what an effective vaccine should look like .
" So here 's a way of copying what exists in nature and that we know can work because of the long - term survivors .
Instead of inventing something that does n't exist , it 's trying to copy something that does exist . "
The scientists identified about 500 antibodies produced by these long - term HIV patients and used genetic techniques to mass produce them in the laboratory before testing them on live HIV and human cells in test - tube experiments .
Kai Brothers : ' My immune system is stable with no anti-virals '
Few people can say they have been infected with HIV for three decades without any ill - effects and ever having to take anti-viral medication .
Kai Brothers is one of the lucky few , writes Steve Connor .
When Mr Brothers , who lives in San Francisco , first learnt that he was HIV - positive in the 1980s , he quit his job , spent his life savings and waited to die .
Now , at the age of 46 , he fully expects to live a normal life - span .
Like so many gay men of his generation , Mr Brothers has seen close friends die of Aids – including his own partner .
Although he is aware that he could infect others , Mr Brothers does not have to swallow a daily cocktail of anti-retroviral pills .
Even though he did not take part in the latest study into long - term survivors , Mr Brothers said that his medical history is very similar to those who did .
" HIV for 28 years , no progression to Aids and my immune system is stable with no anti-virals or meds of any kind , " he said .
Some people are known to succumb to HIV within a few years of infection , others are able to cope for much longer without having to turn to drugs .
But a few – and perhaps as few as one in 5,000 – may have natural immunity to HIV .
Mr Brothers appears to be one of those people lucky enough to be born with an immune system that can fend off HIV .

HAILSHAM , England , Feb. 19 ( UPI ) -- A 13 - year - old British boy was put up to claiming he was the father of a 15 - year - old girl 's baby in an attempt cash in on the story , the Daily Mirror reports .
The British tabloid reported exclusively Wednesday that a close friend of Chantelle Stedman 's parents said the girl was told by her mother to name Alfie Patten of Hailsham as the father of her baby .

Clive Sim , 39 , contends the teen mom was ordered to keep mum about sleeping with other boys so the " teenage dad " story could be sold to newspapers for thousands of dollars , the Mirror reported .
" They know that Alfie being the dad makes a better story , " Sim said .
" I think there 's a big scam going on here . "
Other teenagers have claimed to be the father of Maisie Roxanne , the baby born to Chantelle this month .
Alfie has said he wants to take a genetic test to prove his paternity .
Sim claims
Alfie is being " exploited " by the families for financial gain .
" It 's all pretty sordid , " he told the Mirror .
" Alfie may not be an angel and nor is Chantelle .
But at the end of the day they are only children and it is the adults around them making bad decisions based on money , not their welfare . "
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - Google on Monday launched free downloads of licensed songs in China , while sharing advertising revenue with major music labels in a market rife with online piracy .
Lee Kai - Fu , president of Google in greater China , said one reason Google lagged in the mainland search market was because it did not offer music downloads , the missing piece to its strategy in a market where it trails leader Baidu.com .
" We are offering free , high quality and legal downloads , " Lee told reporters .
" We were missing one piece ... we did n't have music . "
The service offers downloads of some 350,000 songs — from Chinese and foreign artists — a number that will rise to 1.1 million in the coming months , said Gary Chen , chief executive of Google 's partner www.Top100.cn, a Chinese music website co-founded by basketball star Yao Ming .
Music from artists signed by Sony Music , Warner Music , EMI and Universal Music will be available on the service , which Google has no current plans to expand beyond China , said Lee .
" This is the first serious attempt to start ( monetizing ) the online market in China .
I can't overestimate how important this is , " said Lachie Rutherford , president of Warner Music Asia Pacific and Asia chairman of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) .
Users will be able to search by musical measurements such as the level of " beat " in a song and " instrumentality , " as well as by artist and song name .
IFPI said last year that more than 99 percent of all music files distributed in China are pirated , and the country 's total legitimate music market , at $ 76 million , accounts for less than 1 percent of global recorded music sales .
The new service will attract users away from illegal download sites because the music and service will be of a higher quality , said Warner 's Rutherford .
Downloads of unlicensed music and videos are rampant in China , the world 's biggest Internet market by number of users .
While Google dominates the global web search market , in China Baidu holds more than 60 percent of the market , more than double Google 's share .

Ant colonies could be key to advances in biofuels and antibiotics .
Studies of bacteria on leaf - cutting ants could yield new antibiotics .
M. MOFFETT / FLPA
In a mutually beneficial symbiosis , leaf - cutting ants cultivate fungus gardens , providing both a safe home for the fungi and a food source for the ants .
But this 50 - million - year - old relationship also includes microbes that new research shows could help speed the quest to develop better antibiotics and biofuels .
Ten years ago , Cameron Currie , a microbial ecologist then at the University of Toronto in Ontario , Canada , discovered that leaf - cutting ants carry colonies of actinomycete bacteria on their bodies ( C. R. Currie et al. Nature 398 , 701–704 ; 1999 ) .
The bacteria churn out an antibiotic that protects the ants ' fungal crops from associated parasitic fungi ( such as Escovopsis ) .
On 29 March , Currie , Jon Clardy at the Harvard Medical School in Boston and their colleagues reported that they had isolated and purified one of these antifungals , which they named dentigerumycin , and that it is a chemical that has never been previously reported ( D. - C .
Oh et al .
Nature Chem. Bio. doi : 10.1038/nchembio.159 ; 2009 ) .
The antifungal slowed the growth of a drug - resistant strain of the fungus Candida albicans , which causes yeast infections in people .
“ These ants are walking pharmaceutical factories . ”
Because distinct ant species cultivate different fungal crops , which in turn fall prey to specialized parasites , researchers hope that they will learn how to make better antibiotics by studying how the bacteria have adapted to fight the parasite in an ancient evolutionary arms race .
" These ants are walking pharmaceutical factories , " says Currie , now at the University of Wisconsin , Madison .
That 's not the end to the possible applications .
The ant colonies are also miniature biofuel reactors , Currie reported on 25 March at the Genomics of Energy & Environment meeting at the Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek , California .
Each year , ants from a single colony harvest up to 400 kilograms of leaves to feed their fungal partners .
But no one has worked out how the fungi digest the leaves , because samples of fungus grown in petri dishes can't break down cellulose , a tough molecule found in plant cells .
Researchers are keenly interested in better ways to break down cellulose , because it might allow them to make more efficient biofuels than those made from sugary foods , such as maize ( corn ) .
So Currie and his colleagues sequenced small segments of DNA from bacteria and other organisms living in fungus gardens in three Panamanian leaf - cutting ant colonies .
They then compared the DNA against databases to identify what species were living in the fungus gardens , and what genes they contained .
This ' metagenomics ' approach found that there are many species of bacteria in the fungus gardens that are capable of breaking down cellulose .
The team also detected the genetic signatures of fungal enzymes that can break down cellulose , which raises the question of why the fungi can't break down cellulose in the laboratory .
Currie suggests that the newfound bacterial and fungal enzymes might be efficient at digesting cellulose because they have evolved for centuries along with the ant - fungal symbiosis .
This could mean that the fungus can only break down cellulose in its natural context , or that the enzymes Currie detected are brought into the colony from outside .
" The idea is that the ants ' long evolutionary history may help us in our own attempts to break down plant biomass , " he says .
Other researchers call Currie 's findings interesting , but say they wanted to see a more thorough analysis of the data .
" It 's interesting that he found these fungal enzymes in the gardens that he did n't expect [ based on ] what the fungus was capable of doing by itself , " says John Taylor , a mycologist at the University of California , Berkeley .
Taylor says that Currie 's continued scrutiny of the lives of ants provides insights into the web of interactions necessary for the survival of any single species .
" I think the coolest thing about this is that you start with one organism , and then you find more and more organisms involved in the relationship , " he says .
It may take a village to raise a child ; it seems it also takes a village to break down cellulose .

As people age , memory and the ability to carry out tasks often decline .
Scientists looking for ways to lessen that decline often have focused on the " gray matter " -- the cortical regions where high - level functions such as memory are located .
But there are signs that the search may need to be expanded : A new study by MIT neuroscientists has found that memory and cognitive impairments were more associated with loss of brain " white matter , " which forms connections within and between brain regions .
" Historically a lot of people have put their eggs in the gray matter basket .
This study suggests that what might really be important are the connections and the integrity of the connections , " said David Ziegler , a graduate student in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and lead author of a paper on the work that appeared in the online edition of Neurobiology of Aging in December .
Enhancing white matter in older people through drug intervention or changes in diet or cardiovascular fitness could offer a new approach to countering some of the cognitive declines that are typical of advanced age , said Ziegler , who works in the laboratory of Suzanne Corkin , professor of behavioral neuroscience .
The study is the first to examine changes in both white and gray matter and correlate those changes with declines in memory and cognition , said Ziegler .
White matter consists of bundles of neuronal axons that form connections between neurons , allowing brain regions to communicate with each other .
Gray matter , or cortex , is where the bodies of neurons are located .
The researchers used a new MRI brain scanning technique , known as diffusion tensor imaging , to study the white and gray matter of two groups of healthy adults -- one group aged 18 to 30 , and the other aged 60 to 85 .
They also measured subjects ' performances in three categories -- memory for specific events ; memory for vocabulary ; and ability to plan and carry out everyday tasks .
In the older subjects , the researchers found a correlation between decline in cognitive performance and deterioration in the white matter of the frontal brain regions , where planning and executive functions are located .
Similarly , deterioration of white matter in the parietal and temporal lobes , which are involved in memory , was associated with memory impairment .
" Thus , age - related impairments in specific cognitive capacities may arise from degenerative processes that affect the underlying connections of their respective neural networks , " the researchers wrote in their paper .
Other authors of the paper are former MIT postdoctoral associates Olivier Piguet , who is now at the Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute , Sydney , Australia ; David Salat , now at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging ; and former MIT laboratory technicians Keyma Price and Emily Connally .
The research was funded by the National Institute on Aging .

Pope Benedict XVI said on his way to Africa today that condoms were not the answer in the continent 's fight against HIV , his first explicit statement on an issue that has divided even clergy working with Aids patients .
Benedict had never directly addressed condom use .
He has said that the Roman Catholic Church is in the forefront of the battle against Aids .
The Vatican encourages sexual abstinence to fight the spread of the disease .
" You ca n't resolve it with the distribution of condoms , " the Pope told reporters aboard the Alitalia plane headed to Yaounde , Cameroon , where he will begin a seven - day pilgrimage on the continent .
" On the contrary , it increases the problem . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Some priests and nuns working with those living with HIV / Aids question the church 's opposition to condoms amid the pandemic ravaging Africa .
Benedict 's first papal trip to Africa will take him to Cameroon and Angola .
Africa is the fastest - growing region for the Roman Catholic Church , though it competes with Islam and evangelical churches .
The Pope also said today that he intends to make an appeal for " international solidarity " for Africa in the face of the global economic downturn .
He said that while the church does not propose specific economic solutions , it can give " spiritual and moral " suggestions .
Describing the current crisis as the consequence of " a deficit of ethics in economic structures , " the Pope said : " It is here that the church can make a contribution . "
On the plane , Benedict also dismissed the notion that he was facing increasing opposition and isolation within the church , particularly after an outreach to ultraconservatives that led to his lifting the excommunication of a Holocaust - denying bishop .
" The myth of my solitude makes me laugh , " the Pope said , adding that he can count on a network of friends and aides whom he sees every day .
In a letter to Catholic bishops released last week , the Pope made an unusual public acknowledgment of Vatican mistakes and turmoil in his church over the rehabilitation of Bishop Richard Williamson .
While acknowledging mistakes were made in handling the affair , Benedict said he was saddened that he was criticised " with open hostility " even by those who should have known better .
WASHINGTON -- Everyone from President Barack Obama on down to fans has criticized how college football determines its top team .
Now senators are getting off the sidelines to examine antitrust issues involving the Bowl Champion Series .
The current system " leaves nearly half of all the teams in college football at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to qualifying for the millions of dollars paid out every year , " the Senate Judiciary 's subcommittee on antitrust , competition policy and consumer rights said in a statement Wednesday announcing the hearings .
Under the BCS , some conferences get automatic bids to participate in series , while others do not .
Obama and some members of Congress favor a playoff - type system to determine the national champion .
The BCS features a championship game between the two top teams in the BCS standings , based on two polls and six computer ratings .
Behind the push for the hearings is the subcommittee 's top Republican , Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah .
People there were furious that Utah was bypassed for the national championship despite going undefeated in the regular season .
The title game pitted No. 1 Florida ( 12 - 1 ) against No. 2 Oklahoma ( 12 - 1 ) ; Florida won 24 - 14 and claimed the title .
The subcommittee 's statement said Hatch would introduce legislation " to rectify this situation . "
No details were offered and Hatch 's office declined to provide any .
Hatch said in a statement that the BCS system " has proven itself to be inadequate , not only for those of us who are fans of college football , but for anyone who believes that competition and fair play should have a role in collegiate sports . "
In the House , Rep. Joe Barton of Texas , the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee , has sponsored legislation that would prevent the NCAA from calling a football game a " national championship " unless the game culminates from a playoff system .
Cut Loose from the Car
Detroit ’s Dequindre Cut is a walking - and - cycling trail running below street level along a stretch of abandoned rail line just east of downtown .
Designed by JJR , a locally based landscape - design firm , the project cost $ 3.75 million , a drop in the bucket compared to the $ 110 million the region has already invested in greenway development .
Still , the graffiti - lined trench has captured the area ’s imagination like no mere bike path could .
“ The physical characteristics of the Dequindre Cut are unmatched anywhere in this region , ” says Tom Woiwode , the director of the Community Foundation for Southeast Michi­gan ’s GreenWays Initiative , one of the project ’s main funders .
“ It ’s developed a level of enthusiasm that we ’ve never seen . ”
The trail ’s first phase is a mile - long segment that includes restrained landscaping , two strips of asphalt ( one for pedestrians and the other for bikes ) , light­ing , security phones , and benches .
A full half of its width is left untouched to accommodate a prospective light - rail line .
But what the trail connects is as important as how it looks .
Its three access points are the recently redeveloped Detroit Riverfront ; Lafayette Park , a well - established residential community that boasts the world ’s largest collection of Mies van der Rohe buildings ; and the southern end of Eastern Market , a popular outdoor market with specialty shops and restaurants .
For many locals , the best part of the Dequindre Cut is its colorful graffiti .
During the 25 years that the rail line went unused , it became a kind of open - air gallery overgrown with brush and home to wildlife such as pheasants , foxes , and rabbits .
The trail ’s promoters have used the project to preserve the graphic remnants of its days as a dystopian nature trail visited only by graffiti artists , urban explorers , and the homeless .
“ It was like a wilderness in the middle of the city , ” says Jim Griffioen , a Lafayette Park resident .
“ It was splashed with an ever - changing archaeology of color that even the most stodgy decrier of vandalism could n’t deny was art . ”
The Cut will eventually be just one short link in the city ’s recently adopted nonmotorized - transportation plan , which calls for 400 miles of bike lanes .
It wo n’t exactly compensate for the failing fortunes of the automobile industry , but at least it ’s a sign of a new way of thinking that ’s gaining ground in the Motor City .
“ This is about having a vision , ” Woiwode says .
“ The Dequindre Cut really is a great way to talk about what could be .
It makes people able to imagine just how profound a change there can be in how we get around in southeast Michigan . ”
" The two most important things in a FPS title are framerate and control — if you do n't have those , you 're going to be fu**ed , " Neil Young tells me .
He 's playing LiveFire in front of me , the first - person title that gave the company so much buzz at Apple 's SDK event .
It 's just as impressive in person , with a great framerate and controls that look solid ... although no one will let me actually play .
" We 'll get this running faster , " Young says , unsatisfied with even this impressive demonstration .
Young , the CEO of ngmoco , is an intense , gray - haired man who is very , very passionate about mobile gaming .
A reader sent in a question for him : will there be support for user - made maps ?
" It 's not anything we 've talked about seriously , " he replies , although the possibility is there .
" Here 's a question for your readers : would people be interested in being part of a beta test ? "
Would Apple allow a publisher to release a beta test on the app store ?
Young looks up for a moment .
" There are a few ways you could do it .
You could release a version and then take it off the app store when you have as many people as you want for your test . "
That way you can have people trying the online play and giving feedback , before the full , for - pay version hits .
Young tells a story about playing online via 3G while driving .
It almost caused a wreck , but it worked beautifully .
" There will also be voice over IP ; we did n't show that at the Apple event , " he says .
" It took a little while , we have some phenomenal engineers on our team , " Young tells me when I ask how long it took to get such a smooth experience on the iPhone .
" This is actually the Quake 3 engine .
We completely rewrote the renderer , and we completely rewrote the control system and the animation system .
We started from that baseline and then we 've went from there . "
Let that sink in : the Quake 3 engine is running — very well — on the iPhone .
The controls mimic dual - analog sticks from consoles , with your thumb on the left side controlling forward and backward motions , as well as strafing , and your right thumb controlling aiming .
" I think this does a really good job of showing what you can do , " Young says after telling me they 're shooting for a release to coincide with the 3.0 firmware .
This shows just how powerful the iPhone can be as a gaming platform : online play with multiple players , talk of a beta test , the Quake 3 engine , the possibility of user - created maps .
It does n't look or feel like a casual game , something that seems to suit Young very well .
Update :
Ars was contacted by ngmoco to stress that the maximum number of players online has not been finalized .

Killzone 2 is coming out next week , so we are pretty sure you PlayStation 3 owners will be quite busy .
But if you are looking for that gem of a game , that you may have missed , we are going to list the Top 5 PS3 games that did n’t get the attention they deserved .
Whether it be because you did n’t own a PS3 yet , or because you just did n’t pick up the title , does n’t mean you should miss out on these games .
Here is our top 5 …
# 5) Heavenly Sword
You play as Nariko , the strong willed , fiery red haired heroine , with the goal of defending your clan from the evil King Bohan .
Tales the clan passed down from generation talks about a cursed sword that has the power to vanquish all evil which you eventually come to wield .
With gorgeous level design , some of the best character animation I have seen to date , and compelling storyline , this game was n’t appreciated as it should have been .
# 4 ) Gran Turismo 5 : Prologue
While even before it was released , it had already received the stigma , that it was just a “ demo ” .
If that were the case , it would be the very best demo I have ever experienced .
It ’s lacking in the track department , but not in the variety of vehicles , or the amount of gameplay you can squeeze out of the most recent release from Polyphony Digital .
Sporting some of the best graphics to date on a racer , and one of the slickest presentations I have seen , calling this a $ 40 demo is completely unjustified .
# 3) Motorstorm : Pacific Rift
Having been released among other smash titles during the past holiday season , Motorstorm : Pacific Rift , did not get it ’s time in the limelight , although it deserved it .
A sequel to one of the top selling PS3 games to date , went above and beyond improving on it ’s already solid formula .
Off road , arcade style racing has never controlled so well , and at the same time offered so much eye candy when you crashed and burned .
Stunning , lush landscapes make up the majority of the tracks , with only a few stages being a throwback to the original Motorstorm which was relatively a brown , muddy mess .
Trophy support , and solid multiplayer round out the game ’s vast feature set .
# 2) Ratchet and Clank Future : Tools of Destruction
Ratchet and Clank games are known to be some of the best platformers ever to grace the PlayStation 2 , and on it ’s PS3 debut , it certainly does n’t disappoint .
With near Disney Pixar quality graphics , a variety of gameplay elements , and some of the most hilarious , enjoyable weapons you will ever wield …
Ratchet & Clank Future , has me looking forward future installments .
I am sure many of you missed out on the game due to is “ kiddy ” looks , but I assure you , if you can get past that , it ’s a very charming , and deep game .
#1 ) Valkyria Chronicles
The best PS3 game that nobody played .
Seriously .
This strategy RPG has everything going for it other than sales .
With one of the most enjoyable casts , a deep and interesting storyline , and totally kick - ass gameplay mechanics , this is my favorite PS3 game to date ( other than MGS4 ) .
The game boasts beautiful anime / story book style graphics , and 40 + hours of gameplay , you WILL NOT regret picking this title up .
Try out the demo on the PSN , I did , and that day I went out and hunted this game down .
DLC should be arriving soon , that lets you play as the bad guy , which I must admit , I cannot wait to sink my teeth into .
Bay Area homes lost $ 202 billion in value in 2008 , according to a real estate valuation service .
The jaw - dropping number , courtesy of Zillow.com , totals the equity lost in all homes in the nine counties as real estate values tumbled under the pressure of foreclosures , recession and tightened lending standards .
" It 's an increasingly negative picture in that market , " said Stan Humphries , vice president of data and analytics for Zillow in Seattle .
Zillow said home values for the area fell 18.3 percent in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago , reaching a median value of $ 503,397 .
That was bigger than the overall U.S. decline of 11.6 percent in the quarter .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
The Bay Area " is definitely in the pack of metropolitan areas that are declining worse than the national average , " Humphries said .
" Those areas are our usual suspects - metro areas in California , Florida , Phoenix , Las Vegas and Detroit . "
What those areas have in common is boom - time speculation mania that artificially fattened prices , which are now deflating .
Unlike monthly median sales prices , which are skewed by the mixture of homes sold - more low - cost homes means a lower median sales price - the Zillow figure attempts to calculate the change in value for every single home , not just those that changed hands .
Zillow's ZIP code breakdown of valuation changes around the Bay Area showed that only 12 of 228 ZIP codes inched out valuation gains in 2008 compared with the previous year .
Those rare " appreciating " ZIPs are in affluent areas such as Atherton , Palo Alto , Menlo Park , parts of San Francisco , Berkeley and Bodega Bay .
About 60 other ZIP codes , also in affluent areas of Marin , the East Bay and the Peninsula , saw their valuations decline by single digits .
The other 146 ZIP codes all had double - digit depreciation .
Foreclosure - ridden areas such as eastern Contra Costa County , parts of San Jose and Vallejo experienced declines of more than 35 percent .
Zillow 's report showed that 27 percent of Bay Area homeowners now have negative equity , meaning they owe more than their home is worth .
That 's a grim indicator , because being underwater , as the condition is also known , increases the likelihood of foreclosure .
Nationally , about 1 in 6 ( 17.6 percent ) of all homeowners were underwater at year - end , Zillow said , up from 1 in 7 in September .
" Negative equity is a definite driver for foreclosure rates , " Humphries said .
" That plus a triggering event like death , divorce or loss of a job - the options for navigating that distressing event will be limited . "
Increasingly , homeowners with significant negative equity are choosing to surrender their house to foreclosure even without a " trigger " event like losing a job , Humphries and other experts say .
" People feel some futility in making those payments and are walking away from homes , " he said .
Looking at sales data , Zillow found that 50 percent of the homes sold in the Bay Area went for less than the original purchase price .
Nationally , Zillow said that U.S. homeowners lost a total of $ 3.3 trillion in home value during 2008 .
Value fell faster as the year progressed - $ 1.4 trillion was wiped out during the fourth quarter alone , more than the $ 1.3 trillion lost during all of 2007 , Zillow said .
A total of $ 6.1 trillion in U.S. home value has evaporated since the house market 's peak in 2006 , according to the Zillow .
__1850 : __Edward Bellamy is born .
He 's the American socialist and visionary author best known for penning the forward - looking utopian novel , Looking Backward .
Bellamy grew up in western Massachusetts , a desultory law student who knew he wanted to be a writer .
He soon ditched law for journalism and worked for a couple of newspapers – the Springfield Union and New York Post – before turning to fiction .
He wrote short stories and several popular Victorian novels – The Duke of Stockbridge ( 1879 ) , Dr. Heidenhoff 's Process ( 1880 ) and Miss Ludington 's Sister ( 1884 ) – but attained fame with the publication in 1888 of Looking Backward , the story of a young man who falls into a hypnotic sleep in 1887 , only to wake up in 2000 when the world has evolved into a great socialist paradise .
Bellamy embraced a central pillar of socialism , that cooperation among humans is healthier than cutthroat competition .
This conviction formed the basis of Looking Backward and emerged as its central theme .
Boston in the year 2000 , Bellamy 's setting for the novel , is indeed a world where socialism has emerged triumphant and the world is harmonious because of it .
Bellamy predicted a revolution in retail , with something like today 's warehouse clubs and big - box stores .
Transactions would be handled by a card system much like a modern debit card .
People could use enhanced telephone lines to listen to sermons and classical music .
The book was a hit , selling over a million copies and ranking behind only Uncle Tom 's Cabin and Ben- Hur : A Tale of the Christ as the top best - seller of the era .
Bellamy 's success led to a slew of other utopian - themed novels , although none reached Looking Backward 's level of popularity .
The book also spawned experiments in communal living and fed the Nationalist movement , which urged the nationalization of all industry and the elimination of class distinctions .
Socialism , of course , had different connotations in the 19th century when it rose , principally as a backlash to the brutalities of industrialization and the exploitation of the workers by the ruling class .
( Were he alive today , Bellamy might note , with interest , that while the worst excesses of the industrial age are gone , the exploitation continues . )
Had Bellamy lived to the ripe old age of 150 , he no doubt would have been disappointed to find capitalism running amok , and his fellow man no less greedy and self - serving than in his own time .
But he did n't live to be 150 .
In fact , Bellamy was still a relatively young man when he died of tuberculosis in 1898 .

The Tibetan capital Lhasa is a popular destination for adventurous tourists China says it is reopening Tibet to foreign tourists in early April .
The region has recently been closed to travellers because of security fears linked to a number of sensitive anniversaries .
The Chinese news agency Xinhua quoted Tibet 's head of tourism as saying the region was now " harmonious and safe " .
But there is still a heavy Chinese military presence in the area , and foreign journalists and human rights groups cannot operate freely .
China claims
Tibet as part of its territory , but many Tibetans dispute this .
Closed communities
Even at the best of times , foreigners needed special permission to visit Tibet , according to the BBC 's correspondent in Beijing , Quentin Somerville .
But getting there has been even more difficult since last year 's violent protests against Chinese rule .
Tibet is known for its distinctive culture and traditions Analysts say that the main reason for the recent closure was the 50th anniversary of the uprising that led to the Dalai Lama , Tibet 's spiritual leader , fleeing over the border to India .
But now the anniversary is over , the authorities say that visitors can return from 5 April .
" Travel agencies , tourist resorts and hotels are well prepared for tourists , " Tibet 's head of tourism , Bachug , told Xinhua .
Like many Tibetans the director goes by only one name .
The closure has dealt a huge blow to Tibet 's tourism industry , with visitor numbers down by nearly half in the first nine months of last year , according to Xinhua .
The clampdown was the second time that Tibet has been sealed to foreign tourists recently .
The government banned travellers from going to the area in the immediate aftermath of the riots which erupted in Lhasa in March 2008 , on the 49th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising .
The launch of the first luxury train service from Beijing to Tibet has reportedly been postponed from April until next spring .

Fox News passes off GOP press release as original research , later apologizes for typo John Byrne
Published : Tuesday February 10 , 2009
Print This Email This Even repeats typo -- Dec. 19 , 2009 Fox News Channel has hit a new low .
A GOP press release was turned into a series of graphics and passed off as the network 's own research -- so exactly that the graphics even included the Republicans ' original typo .
Fox host Jon Scott , speaking on Fox News ' " Happening Now , " asserted that " the Senate is expected to pass the $ 838 billion stimulus plan -- its version of it , anyway .
We thought we'd take a look back at the bill , how it was born , and how it grew , and grew , and grew . "
" We thought , " apparently includes the Senate Republican Communications Center .
Not only do the dates and sources of the stimulus history on the graphics match , the sources even follow in the same order as the press release .
All of the sources and cost figures cited were mirrored in the Republicans ' release .
Scott on Wednesday apologized on the air ... but only for the incorrect date .
The similarity was first noticed by Media Matters for America , a media watchdog group .
Fox News ' accompanying on - screen text was also contained in the Republicans ' release .
" One on - screen graphic during the segment even repeated a typo from the GOP document , further confirming that Scott was simply reading from a Republican press release , " Media Matters remarked .
" The Fox News graphic and the GOP press release both claimed that a Wall Street Journal report that the stimulus package could reach " $ 775 billion over two years " was published on December 19 , 2009 " -- even though December 2009 remains a good 10 months in the future .
To be fair , media outlets often use press releases as bases for their stories , especially when reporting on breaking news .
Most outlets , however , identify the information as being part of a release .
The practice of repeating press releases is reminiscent of the escort - turned - reporter Jeff Gannon , whose now - defunct GOP USA and Talon News website would often push Bush Administration talking points and then be circulated as news .
Gannon was often called on in the White House briefing room as a reporter .
Strangely , White House press secretary Ari Fleischer , speaking about Obama 's press conference Monday night , disparaged an online news outlet that asked a question -- just a day before a major cable network he 'd surely have classified as a media outlet was found to have turned a press release directly into a series of graphics posing as in - house research .
" There are some reporters , you know , in that briefing room , you can imagine , Bill , you get a lot of dot coms and other oddballs who come in there , " Fleischer said .
" Like the Huffington Post .
Now it gets called on .
" I used to seat them all in one section , " Fleischer added .
" I would call it ' Siberia . ' "
And I told the president , ' Do n't call on Siberia . ' "
Fleischer 's comments were highlighted by Think Progress , which also has video .
Examples of the press release content Fox News ran as research follow .

Other World Computing has begun selling 4GB SDRAM memory modules for the Quad - Core Nehlaem Mac Pros that were introduced in March .
A reader emailed OWC and confirmed that 4GB modules had been successfully tested on the Quad - Core Mac Pros .
According to Apple 's official specs , the Quad - Core Mac Pros only support up to 2GB modules in its 4 memory slots resulting in a maximum installed memory of only 8GB .
This finding by OWC means the maximum installed memory in these new machines is at least 16GB .
While the cost of 4GB modules is somewhat prohibitive at the moment , this should ensure future expandability as the price of memory drops .
In contrast , Apple 's 8 - Core models carry 8 memory slots total and can officially support 4GB modules bringing their maximum installed memory capacity to 32GB .
This advertised 8 GB max vs 32 GB max RAM discrepancy between the Quad and 8 - Core machines has been a major issue for some customers .
Apple has been known to under - advertise the maximum ram capacities for their machines in the past .
Steve sez , " Currently , the National Institutes of Health require NIH - funded research to be published in open - access repositories .
In a cop to for - profit science publishers , Congressional Representative John Conyers ( D - MI ) has re-introduced a bill ( HR801 ) that essentially would negate the NIH policy concerning depositing research in OA repositories .
The bill goes further than prohibiting open access requirements , however , as the bill also prohibits government agencies from obtaining a license to publicly distribute , perform , or display such work by , for example , placing it on the Internet , and would repeal the longstanding ' federal purpose ' doctrine , under which all federal agencies that fund the creation of a copyrighted work reserve the ' royalty - free , nonexclusive right to reproduce , publish , or otherwise use the work ' for any federal purpose .
The bill is bad news . "
Stand for Open Access , Oppose HR801

IDF Denies Human Rights Watch , B'Tselem Access to Gaza
( Jerusalem , February 22 , 2009 ) - Israel continues to obstruct independent investigations into allegations of laws of war violations by the Israel Defense Forces ( IDF ) and Hamas military forces in Gaza by preventing independent human rights monitors from entering Gaza , Human Rights Watch and B'Tselem said today .
After submitting applications for permission to enter via the Erez crossing in January 2009 , the groups faced continued delays from the IDF unit reviewing the applications .
In February , the IDF told Human Rights Watch that it had rejected its application .
The Israeli military denied B'Tselem 's first request to enter Gaza and has failed to respond to a second .
“ Israel 's refusal to allow human rights groups access to Gaza raises a strong suspicion that there are things it does n't want us to see or the world to know about its military operation there , ” said Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East director at Human Rights Watch .
“ If Israel has nothing to hide , why is it refusing to allow us in ? ”
Human Rights Watch requested permission to enter Gaza on January 5 .
After weeks of delay , the IDF rejected the application on February 9 , on the grounds that Human Rights Watch “ was not registered with the [ Israeli ] Ministry of Social Affairs . ”
On all previous occasions , including several times in 2008 , Israeli authorities permitted Human Rights Watch staff to enter and leave Gaza via the Erez crossing .
The IDF never previously suggested such a requirement for access to Gaza , and Human Rights Watch is not aware of any such Israeli law or regulation .
The IDF has not responded to Human Rights Watch 's requests for clarification .
Israel does not allow Jewish citizens of Israel , other than security forces , to enter Gaza on the grounds that their security would be at risk .
B'Tselem , the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories , on January 20 requested permission from the IDF to allow the organization 's fieldwork director ( a Palestinian citizen of Israel ) to enter Gaza .
The IDF refused the request nine days later .
B'Tselem submitted an additional request on January 29 for entry for three staff members and an international consultant .
The Israeli military has not responded to this request .
Human Rights
Watch and other international human rights groups were able to enter Gaza via Egypt in late January to carry out initial investigations .
The international researchers left Gaza just before February 5 , when Egypt had announced it would close the Rafah crossing .
The IDF had told Human Rights Watch that because its researchers had entered Gaza through Rafah , they would not permit the researchers to exit through Erez .
B'Tselem has not managed to gain access for its Israeli or West Bank staff , or for international consultants .
Only the organization 's two field researchers , who are residents of the Gaza Strip , have been able to conduct research on the ground .
“ Israel puts itself in the same league as Burma , North Korea , and Syria in keeping out independent human rights monitors , ” said Jessica Montell , executive director of B'Tselem .
“ The people of Israel deserve to know the truth about the conduct of our forces in Gaza .
It is also in Israel 's best interest that the full picture comes out . ”
The IDF prevented journalists from entering Gaza during the 22 - day military operation , called “ Operation Cast Lead , ” even after an Israeli Supreme Court ruling on January 2 ordered the state to allow entry to members of the Foreign Press Association .
Since the escalation of fighting in Gaza on December 27 , 2008 , both Human Rights Watch and B'Tselem have documented serious violations of international humanitarian law by Israel and Hamas .
On January 10 , Human Rights Watch exposed Israel 's unlawful use of white phosphorus in civilian areas , an allegation the IDF initially denied but now claims to be investigating .
B'Tselem has expressed grave concern over violations of the principles of proportionality and distinction , including the deliberate targeting of civilian installations , such as government ministries and the Palestinian Legislative Council .
Both organizations have , for over two decades , documented violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories .
Article 6 of the Human Rights Defenders Declaration ensures that everyone has the right , individually and in association with others , “ To know , seek , obtain , receive , and hold information about all human rights and fundamental freedoms . ”
In addition , the apparent blanket denial of access to Gaza by human rights groups violates the right to freedom of movement .
Although human rights law permits restrictions on freedom of movement for security reasons , the restrictions must have a clear legal basis , be limited to what is necessary , and be proportionate to the threat .
How AIG Fell
American International Group , AIG , reported the largest quarterly loss in U.S. economic history on Monday .
The $ 61.7 billion three month loss is mind boggling and leaves U.S. taxpayers shaking their collective heads and seemingly holding the bag .
Global markets reacted similarly .
The DOW fell 300 points as the insurance giant ’s 12 month loss stood at more than $ 100 billion .
During this time , AIG has lost 99 % of its market value .
Once again , taxpayers have come to the rescue as government officials revealed another infusion of cash totaling $ 30 billion and raising taxpayer investment to a startling $ 173 billion .
The terms of the loan are dramatically changed from previous infusions and signal the severity of the deepening crises .
The new deal includes equity , lower interest rates and more credit clearly aimed at keeping AIG afloat .
Even more importantly , the government has transitioned from “ tough - love lender to a little more friendly equity investor , ” say Terry Connelly , Dean of Business at Golden State University .
With taxpayers already heavily invested in troubled institutions like Citigroup , Bank of America and mortgage monsters Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the public has difficulty relating to the AIG dilemma .
The reality is that the failure of AIG would impact most persons who buy a home , purchase a vehicle , have a student loan , have insurance coverage or who are employees .
American taxpayers may not realize it , but AIG is squarely in the middle of our economic profile .
How Bad is AIG ?
The AIG statistics are overwhelming .
The company has 74 million customers around the globe .
30 million of those clients are American based .
AIG operates in more than 130 countries .
Prior to the current market conditions , the company backed more than $ 298 billion in assets globally .
The company ’s quarterly loss sent world markets into a spiraling crises .
As the DOW lost 300 points , Asian markets toppled to new lows .
Even a favorable A+ rating on the company ’s four major Asian holding companies could not influence the lack of consumer confidence .
In fact , global investors correlate AIG ’s demise to the breadth and depth of the recession .
Many American taxpayers have begun to question the government ’s strategy and handling of the bailout .
As issues arise about AIG ’s distribution of the proceeds from the initial bailout , President Obama ’s stimulus package continues to receive criticism .
Billionaire Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway suffered its biggest - ever loss of 4.7 % on Monday .
Buffett echoed the popular theme that “ the economy will be in shambles throughout 2009 ” and that AIG typifies the “ reckless lending policies ” that have led to the demise of world markets .
Realistically , President Obama arrived late to the bailout party .
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said on Monday , “ we are focused on taking the steps necessary to restructure AIG that , in the long run , no longer pose the type of systemic threat that it poses right now . ”
The AIG problem existed long before the Obama administration took over , but the new president ’s handling of AIG may very well become his benchmark for fiscal crisis management .
AIG Affects us All
Even as good news regarding gains in household income and increased consumer spending in January hit the markets , AIG dominated the scene .
With more than half of the American population owning stocks and with markets reacting violently to AIG releases , every sector of the American economy , and indeed , the global economy , is affected by governmental actions to restructure the insurance monster .
Considering that since October of 2007 when the DOW hit 14,167 , investors have lost 52 % of their value and with a 25 % fall since January 1st 2009 , the bottom does not seem around the corner .
Remarkably , the DOW has fallen from 8000 to below 7000 in just 14 trading sessions .
On Monday , amidst the turmoil , crude oil dipped 10 % and magnified the intensity of the product ’s fall .
On Friday of this week , new labor department numbers will most likely reflect another 600,000 job losses .
Unemployment has now reached more than 5 million Americans .
Even as new stimulus jobs begin to kick in , production levels continue to shrink and layoffs outpace any growth .
Taxpayers and the government have so much invested that they cannot allow AIG to fail .
And , the pit seems bottomless .
Some economists project another $ 200 billion may be necessary to steady the wavering AIG flagship .
These figures leave taxpayers shaking their heads and wondering if the tail is wagging the dog .
Accompanying Monday ’s cash infusion , a joint statement from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve saying that “ given the systemic risk AIG continues to pose and the fragility of markets today , the potential cost to the economy and the taxpayer of government inaction would be extremely high ” did little to inspire confidence .
What ’s Ahead for AIG ?
Simply put , AIG is not a viable company .
As such , the repercussions are far reaching and pose the biggest obstacle for the Obama recovery plan .
The government now controls the company and CEO Edward Liddy ’s representations that taxpayers will be reimbursed seem unfounded .
American International Group is a public burden that requires a systematic reduction in scale and definition of the size of future funding .
The company then needs to be dismantled and broken into small corporations that can be profitable .
Although AIG is committed to pay down $ 38.9 billion by December 2009 by divesting itself of its two largest international life insurance divisions , there appear no takers in the wings .
These companies are expected to yield a $ 26 billion return , but their values are declining by the day .
Additionally , AIG has provided the government with rights to the cash flow generated from thousands of life insurance policies .
While the cash flow exceeds $ 8.5 billion , it seems a drop in the bucket compared to the giant ’s exposure and risk .
Even the U.S. Treasury describes AIG as a “ systematically significant failing institution . ”
The company is headed to a government reorganization and liquidation sale .
The hope is that as the layers are peeled off , they can sustain market value .
If AIG were to fail , Americans could expect a global chain reaction that would include a deeper recession and monumental unemployment .
As the government sets about returning the company to the private side , it is hoped that a broader sense of optimism will take place .
Given the American propensity for entrepreneurial success , a rebound will occur and employment will rise as markets stabilize .
To everyman , AIG is a burden , but its new look will most likely attest to the resurrection of the U.S. and world economy .

Souce : mikecann.net
It took California only three weeks after passing a $ 41.6 billion budget deal to fall back into the financial rabbit hole .
How much did analyst miss ?
Try $ 8 billion .
You need to remember that the budget battle started back in fall of 2008 and lingered for months so when the budget passed , it had rosy assumptions from a few months ago .
Of course , things since then have deteriorated even further .
More and more toxic mortgages in California are imploding and people are walking away from their homes .
The California median home price is now off by over 50 percent and much of this occurred in one devastating year .
Unemployment now stands at 10.1 percent and nearly 2 million people are out of work in the state .
What the $ 8 billion short fall tells us is people are still too optimistic in their economic projections of our present predicament .
California benefited the most from the housing bubble .
Sales on the most expensive homes , mortgage equity withdrawals from these inflated homes spurred sales on other items , and employment directly linked to the debt bubble expanded .
So it would follow that the bursting of the housing bubble is hitting the state harder than any other state especially in industries directly related to the housing market .
We also had state revenue projections that are directly tied like a scout knot to massive consumption which of course , are contracting as we speak .
In this article , we are going to dig deeper why California is going to have structural problems for years to come .
We ’ll examine revenue projections , the housing market , rising unemployment , and the change in consumer psychology .
Michael Jackson is coming back on tour just in time to see fans moonwalk away from their mortgages .
Exhibit # 1 – Revenue Projections
The above chart comes from the budget agreement reached in February of 2009 .
The problem for California is that it draws an unusually high percentage of its revenue from the personal income tax and sales tax .
Of course , after the massive wealth destruction last year and rapidly changing employment climate , you can see why the number one source of revenue has fallen off dramatically .
In fact , they have massively miscalculated the employment situation .
Let us go back to the initial budget projections back in the fall :
That is a major miscalculation .
They were projecting a high unemployment rate nationwide of 8.2 percent being reached in 2010 and statewide of 9.4 percent being reached at the same time .
Well as you all know , the unemployment rate as of February of 2009 is now 8.1 percent nationwide and 10.1 percent statewide .
That is a massive understatement especially when you consider that personal income tax is your number one source of income .
So it is n’t any surprise that the projections are off and we now face a $ 8 billion short fall .
Yet look at the initial chart once again .
The state is projecting that we will have a $ 4.4 billion increase in personal income tax collections and $ 3.8 billion in sales tax collections .
Keep in mind this is for the fiscal year that begins on July 1st .
Are you telling me the state is still buying that second half recovery notion ?
Personally , I think these projections are still much too optimistic .
Yet the reason why this is occurring is the experts in the field are failing to look at unprecedented changes :
“( SignOnSanDiego )
As an example of how bad it is , Taylor said his office projects a slight decline – one - tenth of 1 percent – in personal income this year .
Although not much , Taylor said he looked back as far as 1950 and could find no prior year in which personal income declined in California . ”
They ’re projecting a slight decline in personal income tax ?
There is the problem .
What do you think people are going to be doing with the massive losses of 2008 ?
Many of the wealthy California contingent lost money in the stock market in 2008 .
In fact , many of these people are going to be able to write off a sizable portion of losses and will cut their tax liability lower and lower .
Those that are unemployed are n’t paying taxes but instead are drawing on unemployment insurance .
So this is a cash flow problem .
Yet even the new proposals are betting on high time again :
“ This assumes not only a turnaround that does n’t begin until ( the first quarter of ) 2010 , but very modest growth thereafter , ” Taylor said .
“ We do n’t see anything like the kind of recovery we ’ve had in past recessions , where we can bounce back with 8 percent , 10 percent growth . ”
Interesting that they now have modest projections yet the revenue in the budget still reflects a rosier picture .
These projections are still betting on some sort of new industry rescue .
In the 1980s we re-emerged and had the technology bubble in the 1990s .
California took in massive amounts of money but developed a structural budget deficit that bet on these high times .
When things were settling out in the early 2000s , we get another whiff of a bubble with housing and we were riding high again .
I think many of these people think some other bubble is going to save us but we may be reaching a bubble fatigue point .
My colleague John Rubino over at DollarCollapse put out an excellent book called Clean Money examining the new technologies that will emerge from green technologies .
I correspond with John on a weekly basis and he was spot on regarding the housing bubble so I tend to listen to people that have been right for many years .
Reading the book , you realize that many of these technologies will require massive government spending which I ’m not sure is priority number one at this time .
In addition , the drop in oil has pulled back that vigor that we had when oil was at $ 147 a barrel .
In the moment , I think some of our politicians are clinging for a third bubble but I just do n’t see it happening .
The wizard behind the curtain of our economic system has been shown and I think most Americans will now have a hard time believing in the way things once were .
If we want something , we will need to pay for it out of more immediate financing .
Exhibit # 2 – Housing Inventory and Sales
California still has a glut of homes .
In fact , more homes are coming onto the market that will keep us from reaching a bottom for many years .
The 10 reasons for a California housing bottom in 2011 still hold true , especially given these budget deficits .
Why ?
The only way to fix the problem is with job cuts or tax hikes .
Most likely we ’ll have a painful combination of both .
What that means is we will have more tax hikes and job cuts in the upcoming years .
How does this bode well for housing , which we have just pointed out , was part of the reason California gained so much wealth this past decade ?
Much of that bubble wealth is now gone .
In January of 2009 29,458 new and resale homes and condos were sold in the state .
The median price for the state has now fallen to a stunning $ 224,000 .
This is a far cry from the peak reached in May of 2007 of $ 484,000 .
That is a $ 260,000 drop or a 53.72 percent decline .
We ’ve been in this decline for close to 21 months now .
Keep in mind the above data is from DataQuick .
If we look at the California Association of Realtors ( CAR ) data we find that the peak was reached in April of 2007 at $ 597,640 and their current median price is $ 253,350 ; that amounts to a drop of 57.44 percent .
Either way , the housing market is falling across the state faster than most would have imagined .
So let us try to figure out how much inventory is in the state .
First , there is some suspect business going on because banks are not putting up all their REOs for sale at least in places where the public can see it .
In fact , many are selling them to private investors in bundles and never listing them on the MLS .
How so ?
Let us do a bit of investigative reporting here :
February 2009 California Data
Notice of Defaults filed : 43,072
Notice of Trustee Sale : 18,831
Real Estate Owned : 18,872
Total distressed for Feb 2009 : 80,775
Total Sales for January of 2009 : 29,458 *
* 60.4 percent of all the January 2009 sales were foreclosure re-sales .
What this means is 17,793 homes sold were once foreclosed homes .
Meaning , only 11,665 homes sold were naturally done .
That is , a seller puts the home up for sale and a buyer purchases it .
No bad history .
So even looking at this , we realize that only with the February distress data , we have 4.5 months of inventory with one month of distress properties !
So let us now look at what is currently on the MLS :
Keep in mind this data is not complete .
We are missing parts of northern - northern California but this is only to give you a sense of the inventory in the larger areas .
With this data , we see that a total of 165,000 homes are on the market not including many of the distressed homes .
So assuming only 11,665 home are selling naturally each month , we have 7 months of this natural inventory .
But that is n’t the entire picture .
Most of the distress homes do end up REOs so let us aggregate the data :
165,000 + 80,775 = 245,775
Sales for January of 2009 : 29,458
Total months of inventory : 8.3 months
Keep in mind that we are uncertain how big the REO portfolios of many of these banks are .
We are simply using a lower rung estimate here and we have already found 8.3 months of inventory .
I would venture to estimate that we have anywhere from 12 months to 14 months of inventory if we had a clearer way of gathering all the data .
Bottom line ?
Until we start seeing 4 to 6 months of true inventory , we are not anywhere close to a bottom .
Prepare yourself to hear many people start quoting this but beware of the shadow inventory .
Exhibit # 3 – Employment
California now has one of the highest unemployment rates in the country .
The current unemployment rate is 10.1 percent and 1,863,000 Californians are out of work .
This is up by 754,000 since last January .
How big of a jump is this ?
That means in raw numbers , there are now 67 percent more unemployed Californians in one year .
Stunning numbers .
Of the unemployed 990,600 were laid off , 126,700 left voluntarily , and the rest were new entrants into the job market or were on temporary assignments .
However you slice it , the unemployment situation is dire :
We are now back to the early 1980s level of unemployment .
In fact , the highest unemployment on record with the BLS is 11 percent reached in November of 1982 .
We will breach that .
Some are calling for massive cuts and that will only flood the market with more unemployed .
We already have 1,863,000 people without work in the state .
Those on unemployment insurance reached a record 717,525 , a jump from 480,858 from only one year ago .
It is harder and harder to find work for many .
And of course , those 1.8 million are people that are not paying personal income taxes at normal levels or are probably buying stuff and consuming thus lowering the sales tax the state collects .
All in all it is a difficult situation .
As I have argued before , the only way to solve this mess is with a combination of cuts but also tax hikes .
This is the worst of both worlds and we should n’t be here in the first place but we are .
Those calling for no spending cuts are simply living in a different planet .
We are in a deep hole and many will need to cooperate to help .
Those calling for no tax hikes fail to examine the depth of our problem and do n’t bother to examine that we already have nearly 2 million people unemployed .
Adding more people to the unemployment lines is not cost effective either .
There has be a balanced approach but seeing how the state has failed to see this $ 8 billion short fall tells me that they are too optimistic with their projections .
While millions suffer in a silent depression many are looking for that next perma - growth model .
There is one growth area for California housing .
Housing for prisoners :
One thing that we know how to do as a nation is provide housing for prisoners :
I think at this point we as a society need to examine where we want our money to be spent .
We need to strategically think of what to cut and be smart about it .
Instead , we have ideologues on both sides saying “ no cuts ” or “ no taxes ” yet fail to miss the nuisances of this problem .
Given how things are moving , I have little hope that we will come up with smart solution and instead will continue on this path of measured resistance that will keep our economy depressed for years to come .
Exhibit # 4 – Alt - A and Option ARMs
The sliver of good news with the new mortgage and housing plan is that most Californians in toxic option ARMs or exotic mortgages will receive little help .
And before thinking this is callous , just realize that many of these people went with zero down or very little down so they technically will lose nothing except their credit scores .
Of course , there are exceptions but the data does n’t support this view .
So what will occur is they can stay in their place until they are evicted or move , and then they will become renters .
California has one of the lowest homeownership rates and this bubble bursting will bring us back to the lows again .
These toxic mortgages are the worst of the worst and the irony is after all the shenanigans in the global markets , we have yet to decide how we will deal with them .
The problem is that the only way to deal with theses mortgages in a morally fair way is to have them go back to the bank and have them sell it off .
Yet that is the issue .
With the flood of these mortgages coming back to the banks books , we are going to see numerous bank failures ( of course those too big to fail will get unlimited lifelines which is even worse than nationalization which I have been calling for ) .
Banks are running on razor thin margins so further write - downs will be enough to sink many .
And we still have people saying “ no nationalization ” failing to realize that we have some quasi - form of nationalization where the taxpayer is subsidizing the losses and allowing the banks to keep the profits .
Awesome !
Great thinking .
The fact that Citigroup and Bank of America claimed they have a profit is laughable .
Assuming what ?
Zero write - downs ?
We ’ll find out soon enough once the Q1 earnings start rolling out .
Remember BofA is now owner of Countrywide , the uber - perveyor of toxic mortgages especially here in California .
What is going to happen when all those mortgages recast ?
There is still an enormous amount of toxic loans in California :
January 2009 :
Subprime loans in California : 391,959
Average balance : $ 323,117
Total outstanding : $ 126,648,616,203
Alt - A loans in California : 666,386
Average balance : $ 441,909
Total outstanding : $ 294,481,970,874
So combining Alt - A loans and subprime loans , we still have over $ 420 billion in toxic mortgages residing in the state from the January 2009 data .
Many of those option ARMs are in the Alt - A category .
Many banks used optimistic models since Alt - A borrowers had “ better ” credit and therefore their loss ratios are just as optimistic as the state ’s models on the economy of California .
Now do the quick math .
If the median price of a home in the state is now $ 224,000 and the average balance of a subprime loan is $ 323,000 and for Alt - A loans it is $ 441,000 , do you think we have a tiny problem ?
The new mortgage program only goes up to 105 percent of the home ’s market value .
So most of these loans are not going to qualify , as they should not .
If we help these mortgages out , it is bailing out bubble priced homes .
This is like bailing out Pets.com during the tech bust at a high share value .
The irony here is the average Alt - A credit score is 709 .
Bwahahahaha !
Now that is a good one .
It does n’t matter , 50 percent will be recasting in the next year or so .
Exhibit # 5 – Consumer Psychology
Finally , we come back full circle to consumer psychology .
We have heard many pundits claiming that our political leaders should be “ optimistic ” and more “ positive ” regarding our economy .
I agree that our politicians should not be downers but I rather have someone be honest and straightforward than a Pollyanna ideologue who is preaching the gospel of infinite prosperity .
It is hard to believe someone when they are so wrong and frankly , many Americans I think simply want someone that can be upfront about the facts .
Look , we have a major crisis on our hands and I think most do not expect miracles .
Just do n’t tell us to go out shopping because it is patriotic .
The thing is , most Americans have an accurate assessment of reality :
* Source : Gallup
Most Americans are having a hard time economically but also , this has filtered down to their quality of life .
Consumer mood is at a record low .
This does not bode well for a country where approximately 70 percent of our GDP depends on consumers running a non -stop marathon of consumption .
Yet another disturbing number is that 53 percent of Americans now say they are struggling .
This again highlights the reality of the silent depression that many are dealing with .
The silent depression is a more accurate test of the state of our country because many people are living paycheck to paycheck and realize they are only one missed check from eviction .
Many realize that they are simply moving along because of access to credit .
Yet as we know , many credit card companies are now cutting back .
The truth of the matter is many Americans are now shifting into an austerity mindset .
And make no mistake about it , many baby boomers ( those with wealth to spend ) are now more reluctant to save or invest because of very public cases like that of Bernard Madoff .
I ’m sure many of you saw the public smack down of Jim Cramer by Jon Stewart this past week .
If you have n’t seen the clip , you can watch it here but it strikes once again at what is happening with consumer psychology .
I have talked about Jim Cramer and Ben Stein many times and how they ridiculed those that saw a housing bubble or saw things in a different light from them .
Now , it is very easy to be apologetic .
I know one of the internet memes going around is “ but they are entertainers ! ”
Of course they are .
But keep in mind that we are bailing out many companies that they were pumping up and using for “ entertainment . ”
There were consequences .
If you invested following their advice , the market has punished you enough .
Yet it is another thing when they are advocates for the same institutions that ALL of us are now bailing out ( i.e. , Bear Stearns ) .
One clip found in the interview is the notion of pumping and moving stocks through hedge funds .
The clip is simply reminiscent of the crony capitalism that has been pervading our system for too many years .
Ultimately , the show was one of the most watched shows on The Daily Show in its 12 - year history .
Why ?
People are flipping angry and want to see some sort of justice even if it comes in the form of a comedy show .
Many of our politicians are bought .
I am stunned that we have yet to see any CEOs going to jail .
In fact , instead of claw - backs we are still giving bonuses out !
AIG just announced they will be paying out $ 165 million in bonuses after receiving $ 170 billion in taxpayer money !
You ca n’t make this stuff up .
The fact that we now have a realistic push for legislation forcing the Fed to disclose amounts given out to institutions is a step in the right direction .
It is starting to look like the oligarchs in power are facing populist resistance .
Just look at the consumer sentiment indicators above .
People are struggling .
They do n’t trust the markets anymore .
So the markets had a technical rally last week .
Does that mean the housing market problems are gone ?
Does that mean banks are now coming clean ?
Does that mean we stop bailing out the toxic institutions ?
I doubt it .
Either way , consumers on the ground are pulling back and I see this as a permanent change in the psychology of many .
People wo n’t forget this crisis that easily .
Sure , we ’ll go back and do crazy things because that is human nature .
But people act as if we are out of this mess already .
I do n’t see a recovery until 2011 .
And after that , it will be moderate growth .
Here in California , I have seen people pulling up in Escalades full of aluminum cans and plastic at recycling centers .
Something I have never seen .
In fact , this weekend I saw a middle - aged couple pulling up in their Mercedes with Hefty bags full of crushed aluminum cans at the recycling center .
And I think things like this is what will make this recession different from those in the past .
You see many people in leased or newer cars driving around but they are flat broke and in debt .
That is something you would have never seen in the Great Depression .
Pain was very apparent then with people losing farms and soup lines everywhere .
Now , we have people with a negative net worth driving around in $ 75,000 cars .
It just does n’t compute but the outcome is the same .
Many people are broke especially here in California .
The fact that we are now $ 8 billion in the hole after a $ 41.6 billion budget passed three weeks ago tells you a lot .

The point here is that nuclear power , as I said before , is going to be an important part of our energy mix .
It ’s 20 % of our electricity generation today , but it ’s 70 % of the carbon - free portion of electricity today .
And it is baseload .
So I think it is very important that we push ahead .

Why CIOs Have to Work Harder Than Other Executives
I was having dinner with a CIO who had retired after a long and distinguished career .
The conversation had been mostly small talk , but suddenly a thought occurred to him , and he sat up straight in his chair .
“ Why is it , ” he asked vehemently , “ that CIOs have to work so much harder than every other executive at making their role in the business understood ? ”
It was a rhetorical question , but I made an attempt to answer it anyway .
“ It ’s partly because of the ‘ magic ’ around IT that I ’ve described in my book , ” I said .
“ Business executives do n’t have a fundamental understanding of what IT is all about , and they compartmentalize IT and use the CIO as an intermediary .
They talk to the CIO , and they rely on the CIO to translate what they need into the technical double - talk they think is used in the IT organization .
It ’s like the wizard role I talk about in my book ; the CIO is perceived as the chief wizard , but everything inside the wizard ’s organization is too mystical for business people to understand . ”
“ But that ’s crazy , ” he answered .
“ You do n’t see the same sort of attitude toward other complicated parts of the business .
Business executives go out of their way to learn all of the important aspects of finance and accounting .
They do n’t view the CFO as an intermediary – they know what the CFO has to do and they hold the CFO accountable for doing it .
Finance is just as complicated as IT , but business people take classes in it until they understand it . ”
I paused to reflect on his statement .
He was right – you never hear about CFOs looking for “ alignment ” with the business , nor do you hear about alignment issues in other parts of the business .
I searched my brain for an answer .
What ’s fundamentally different between finance and IT ?
I thought about the classes he mentioned .
“ I do n’t think the classes in IT really teach the right things to business people , ” I conjectured .
“ Introductory finance classes cover fundamental accounting principles , income statements , balance sheets , double - entry accounting , budgeting and capitalization .
The more advanced finance classes cover sources of business funding , and the use of various approaches to underwrite the day - to - day financial needs of the business , and to reduce business risk through diversification and the use of offsets . ”
“ IT classes on the other hand , ” I continued , “ cover things like computers and data storage , networking and software development .
If finance were taught the same way then they would teach you how to use a spreadsheet , how to close out a financial period , and how to write an annual report .
IT classes emphasize tools , while financial classes emphasize principles and how to apply the principles to the business .
IT principles that are important to the business – like the ones in my book – seldom get taught . ”
I went on , “ Finance also has a uniform way of presenting its current position – a standard scorecard using well - understood definitions of balance sheets and income statements .
IT has nothing like that ; there is no uniform way to present the status of IT .
There is no standard for an enterprise architecture view of the systems in a business .
There is no standard way to represent the status of IT projects .
There is no standard for showing the state of IT infrastructure , revealing areas of risk and areas of excessive investment . ”
“ OK , ” he answered , “ Maybe you ’re right about finance , but what about other complicated parts of a business ?
What about operations in a manufacturing business ?
Or research and development in a pharmaceutical company ?
Or even marketing in a consumer products company ?
There are no standard ways to show the state of those parts of a business .
They ’ve each got complicated things going on , but they are n’t viewed as mystical by the CEO . ”
“ That ’s an interesting point , ” I said .
“ Let ’s go through your examples one by one .
In a manufacturing business you can portray the process with a diagram showing inputs and outputs : you put raw materials in , you ‘ turn the crank , ’ and you get manufactured products out the other end .
Sure the turning - the - crank part is complicated , but it can usually be represented in some sort of high - level process diagram , and then you can ‘ drill down ’ to show more and more detail underneath each part of the process diagram . ”
“ When a CEO looks at the diagram , ” I went on , “ he or she can see the fundamental manufacturing process .
Bottlenecks – or limits to production – can be represented in the diagram , and anyone can see where you could invest to make the process smoother .
So even though manufacturing is often complicated , in almost every case someone goes to the trouble of using a pictorial representation of the manufacturing process to convey simple information about the status .
The CEO may not understand all of the technology used in manufacturing , but each piece of manufacturing equipment can be viewed by the CEO as a ‘ black box ’ in the diagram with inputs , outputs and operating characteristics . ”
“ Your second example was R&D in a pharmaceutical company , ” I continued .
“ R&D is generally viewed by business executives using the classic ‘ investment portfolio ’ model : each R&D investment can be viewed as having an investment amount , a risk , and a probable return .
The probabilities of the success of each R&D investment will vary greatly , but taken together , the R&D investments will generally provide a payback to the company .
It ’s like drilling oil wells :
You know you ’re not going to hit oil with every hole you drill ( although you use science to help you pick the very best spots ) , but you know that you ’ll hit oil on some reasonable percentage of the holes you drill , and that makes it all worthwhile . ”
“ What was your last example again ? ” I asked .
“ Marketing in a consumer products company , ” said the CIO .
“ Surely you ’ll agree that marketing is n’t viewed as mystical . ”
“ Well , it ’s complicated , ” I said .
“ But again , it ’s like R&D investment or drilling oil wells :
You invest in various marketing campaigns , and you hope to find a few that will generate a significant increase in your sales revenue .
Then you fine - tune them to maximize the revenue . ”
“ The trick with marketing , ” I said laughingly , “ is to figure out whether a revenue increase is in fact related to a marketing campaign at all .
At least with oil wells , you know which wells are producing oil .
With marketing , you ’re never quite sure which marketing campaigns cause your sales increase .
It ’s mystical , all right , but it ’s more like gambling than investment . ”
“ I see your point , ” said the CIO , “ but I still do n’t understand why CEOs ca n’t relate to IT .
If they can deal with manufacturing and all its complexities , and if they can cope with R&D and marketing with all of their uncertainties , then why ca n’t they just treat IT like any other part of the business ? ”
“ Maybe it ’s because they just do n’t want to , ” I ventured .
“ It ’s like having a car mechanic to take care of your car .
If you trust the mechanic then you do n’t have to worry about how the car works , and so you do n’t bother learning . ”
“ But that ’s terrible , ” exclaimed the CIO .
“ IT is n’t just about mechanics – it ’s about all the data and information processes in the business .
Isolating IT as if the IT organization is just a bunch of infrastructure mechanics is like closing your eyes to all of the wonderful contributions that can be made by IT throughout the business .
It ’s as if the CEO is assuming that everything is good enough ‘ as is , ’ and IT ’s job is just to take requests from various business units .
That ’s not the way to get the most out of IT . ”
“ You ’re right , of course , ” I replied .
“ but in a lot of companies , the view of IT as a trusted mechanic – dismal as it is – is just an aspiration .
In many companies IT is treated as a mechanic , but without the trust .
That makes things even worse :
You take requests , you ’re not involved in business strategy discussions , and your organization is n’t trusted to deliver what ’s been requested .
In those companies there ’s an adversarial relationship between IT and other business organizations .
I ’ve worked with a few companies like that , and it ’s no fun . ”
“ I ’ve seen a few of those myself , ” said the CIO .
“ In a situation like that you have to first build a trusting relationship between IT and the business .
Only then can you try to take IT into more of a strategic role . ”
“ So let ’s get back to the original question , ” continued the CIO .
“ Why is it that CIOs have to work so much harder than every other executive at making their role in the business understood ? ”
“ Your guess is as good as mine , ” I concluded .
“ But it ’s a shame , is n’t it ? ”
[ Note : I really was at a recent dinner with a retired CIO , and he really did ask the question mentioned in this article .
The conversation started out the way I describe , but the rest of this hypothetical conversation took place later in my head .
It ’s a lot harder to come up with good answers on the spur of the moment . ]
Charities tap skills of jobless professionals
Althea Collins takes in the scent from a yellow orchid in the Conservatory of Flowers at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco , Calif. , on Friday , March 20 , 2009 .
Collins , who was laid off from her job several months ago , has been volunteering at the Conservatory as a marketing manager .

When the economy slumped , Althea Collins was among 100 people let go in November from Fair Isaac Co. in San Rafael , the firm that created the FICO credit score system to determine loan interest rates .
She 's been looking for work ever since , but " no one is even calling back . "
Now the 30 - year - old Mill Valley resident is helping the Conservatory of Flowers in San Francisco redesign its Web site .
For free .
The rising waves of layoffs are creating a whole new pool of well - educated , highly skilled volunteers like Collins who are looking for a way , any way , back into the working world .
Whether charity work provides an opportunity to network in a bad economy , the ideal chance to try social work as a possible career , or simply a reason to get off the couch and stay engaged , it 's what many professionals are doing to ride out the recession .
" In this market , networking is the only way to get interviews , " said Collins , who recently interviewed with the Marin Community Foundation after a friend at the conservatory got her in the door .
The command center of this swelling underground workforce is the Taproot Foundation in San Francisco , which places 2,000 business executives in charities annually to work as pro bono charity consultants .
Taproot saw a 171 percent increase in volunteer interest in January over the previous year , largely driven by the economy .
Three - fourths of those wanting Taproot volunteer positions are people who lost their jobs , said Taproot founder Aaron Hurst .
Charities ' waiting lists
At HandsOn Bay Area , an online volunteer - matching service , volunteer projects are booked six weeks in advance for the first time in the agency 's 20 - year history .
The trend is showing up nationwide .
Similar reports are coming from New York , where traffic on Web - based volunteer - matching services is up 30 percent .
The Big Brothers Big Sisters program in Philadelphia has 25 percent more requests from potential mentors .
" Volunteering in the nonprofit world is a good balance for me after spending so many years in corporate America , " said Michael Gilman of San Francisco , who was laid off six months ago from his job as a senior business manager in Hewlett - Packard 's Web services and software division in Palo Alto .
Insight into nonprofits
He 's now volunteering through Taproot as a project manager at the Community Music Center in the Mission District , helping it improve its professional business environment .
The work keeps him grounded , he said , as he navigates the difficult job market .
He 's applied for a dozen jobs and made it through the final interview of a few , only to be told in each case that the company had decided to freeze the position until the economy improves .
In the meantime , he is leading a neighborhood support group for laid - off executives .
After gaining a little insight into the nonprofit world , Gilman has broadened his search and interviewed at nonprofits such as GreatSchools .
net .
" I 'm learning that the nonprofit world is just as organized as the corporate world , " he said .
HandsOn Bay Area and VolunteerMatch , another online service , are filling projects months in advance .
In November , HandsOn Executive Director Lou Reda said he noticed the months started booking up , and by January , people started bypassing the online calendars and calling the office trying to find a project to join .
Glut of volunteers
" We 've never seen that before .
It 's absolutely stunning , " Reda said .
" It 's getting harder to put together enough projects for all the volunteers . "
This illustrates an enormous missed opportunity for nonprofits .
As charities scale back in the face of dwindling donations , many are laying off staff , including volunteer coordinators .
While charities can easily add volunteers who want to ladle soup or clean a creek , absorbing professionals with complex skills takes management hours charities no longer have .
The glut of laid - off volunteers has forced Taproot to stop all marketing and start turning away applicants , Hurst said .
" Can you imagine working for all those years and then offering your services for free only to be told , ' Thanks , but no thanks ? ' " Hurst said .
" There needs to be some level of investment on the philanthropic and government side so nonprofits can leverage all this surplus of human capital , " he said .
Collins , who also found her volunteer job through Taproot , is thankful to have a routine to keep her from the depression spiral .
She 's spent a lot of time thinking about aligning her passion and her work and has decided she 's a better fit in the nonprofit world .
" The exposure volunteering provides is wonderful , and there 's always the possibility of ' catching on fire , ' " Reda said .
" You find something that really speaks to you , and all of a sudden you find more purpose , value and connection in your life . "
POEMS OF SAPPHO
TRANSLATED BY JULIA DUBNOFF
1
Immortal Aphrodite , on your intricately brocaded throne , [ 1 ]
child of Zeus , weaver of wiles , this I pray :
Dear Lady , do n’t crush my heart
with pains and sorrows .
5 But come here , if ever before ,
when you heard my far - off cry ,
you listened .
And you came ,
leaving your father ’s house ,
yoking your chariot of gold .
10 Then beautiful swift sparrows led you over the black earth
from the sky through the middle air ,
whirling their wings into a blur .
Rapidly they came .
And you , O Blessed Goddess ,
a smile on your immortal face ,
15 asked what had happened this time ,
why did I call again ,
and what did I especially desire
for myself in my frenzied heart :
“ Who this time am I to persuade
20 to your love ?
Sappho , who is doing you wrong ?
For even if she flees , soon she shall pursue .
And if she refuses gifts , soon she shall give them .
If she does n’t love you , soon she shall love
even if she ’s unwilling . ”
25 Come to me now once again and release me
from grueling anxiety .
All that my heart longs for ,
fulfill .
And be yourself my ally in love ’s battle .
16
Some say an army of horsemen ,
some of footsoldiers , some of ships ,
is the fairest thing on the black earth ,
but I say it is what one loves .
5 It ’s very easy to make this clear
to everyone , for Helen ,
by far surpassing mortals in beauty ,
left the best of all husbands
and sailed to Troy ,
10 mindful of neither her child
nor her dear parents , but
with one glimpse she was seduced by
Aphrodite .
For easily bent ...
and nimbly ...[ missing text ] ...
15 has reminded me now
of Anactoria who is not here ;
I would much prefer to see the lovely
way she walks and the radiant glance of her face
than the war - chariots of the Lydians or
20 their footsoldiers in arms .
31
That man to me seems equal to the gods ,
the man who sits opposite you
and close by listens
to your sweet voice
5 and your enticing laughter —
that indeed has stirred up the heart in my breast .
For whenever I look at you even briefly
I can no longer say a single thing ,
but my tongue is frozen in silence ;
10 instantly a delicate flame runs beneath my skin ;
with my eyes I see nothing ;
my ears make a whirring noise .
A cold sweat covers me ,
trembling seizes my body ,
15 and I am greener than grass .
Lacking but little of death do I seem .
sapphic fragments

Come now , luxuriant Graces , and beautiful - haired Muses .
2
I tell you
someone will remember us
in the future .
3
Now , I shall sing these songs
Beautifully
for my companions .
4
The moon shone full
And when the maidens stood around the altar ...
5
“ He is dying , Aphrodite ;
luxuriant Adonis is dying .
What should we do ? ”
“ Beat your breasts , young maidens .
And tear your garments
in grief . ”
6
O , weep for Adonis !
7
But come , dear companions ,
For day is near .
8
The moon is set .
And the Pleiades .
It ’s the middle of the night .
Time [ hôrâ ] passes .
But I sleep alone .
9
I love the sensual .
For me this
and love for the sun
has a share in brilliance and beauty
10
I desire
And I crave .
11
You set me on fire .
12
A servant
of wile - weaving
Aphrodite ...
13
Eros
Giver of pain ...
14
Eros
Coming from heaven
throwing off
his purple cloak .
15
Again love , the limb - loosener , rattles me
bittersweet ,
irresistible ,
a crawling beast .
16
As a wind in the mountains
assaults an oak ,
Love shook my breast .
17
I loved you , Atthis , long ago
even when you seemed to me
a small graceless child .
18
But you hate the very thought of me , Atthis ,
And you flutter after Andromeda .
19
Honestly , I wish I were dead .
Weeping many tears , she left me and said ,
“ Alas , how terribly we suffer , Sappho .
I really leave you against my will . ”
And I answered : “ Farewell , go and remember me .
You know how we cared for you .
If not , I would remind you
... of our wonderful times .
For by my side you put on
many wreaths of roses
and garlands of flowers
around your soft neck .
And with precious and royal perfume
you anointed yourself .
On soft beds you satisfied your passion .
And there was no dance ,
no holy place
from which we were absent . ”
20
They say that Leda once found
an egg —
like a hyacinth .
21
“ Virginity , virginity
Where will you go when you ’ve left me ? ”
“ I ’ll never come back to you , bride ,
I ’ll never come back to you . ”
22
Sweet mother , I ca n’t do my weaving —
Aphrodite has crushed me with desire
for a tender youth .
23
Like a sweet - apple
turning red
high
on the tip
of the topmost branch .
Forgotten by pickers .
Not forgotten —
they could n’t reach it .
24
Like a hyacinth
in the mountains
that shepherds crush underfoot .
Even on the ground
a purple flower .
25
To what shall I compare you , dear bridegroom ?
To a slender shoot , I most liken you .
26
[ Sappho compared the girl to an apple .... she compared the bridegroom to Achilles , and likened the young man ’s deeds to the hero’s . ]
Himerius ( 4th cent .
A.D. ) , Or. 1.16
27
Raise high the roofbeams , carpenters !
Hymenaon ,
Sing the wedding song !
Up with them !
Hymenaon ,
Sing the wedding song !
A bridegroom taller than Ares !
Hymenaon ,
Sing the wedding song !
Taller than a tall man !
Hymenaon ,
Sing the wedding song !
Superior as the singer of Lesbos —
Hymenaon ,
Sing the wedding song !
— to poets of other lands .
Hymenaon !

The Marriage of Hektor and Andromakhe
... Cyprus ...
... The herald Idaios came ... a swift messenger
... and the rest of Asia ... unwilting glory ( kleos aphthiton ) .
Hektor and his companions led the dark - eyed
luxuriant Andromakhe from holy Thebes and ... Plakia
in ships upon the salty sea .
Many golden bracelets and purple
robes ... , intricately - worked ornaments ,
countless silver cups and ivory .
Thus he spoke .
And his dear father quickly leapt up .
And the story went to his friends through the broad city .
And the Trojans joined mules to smooth - running carriages .
And the whole band of women and ... maidens got on .
Separately , the daughters of Priam ...
And the unmarried men led horses beneath the chariots
and greatly ... charioteers ...
... like gods
...holy
set forth into Troy ...
And the sweet song of the flute mixed ...
And the sound of the cymbals , and then the maidens
sang in clear tones a sacred song
and a divinely - sweet echo reached the sky ...
And everywhere through the streets ...
Mixing bowls and cups ...
And myrrh and cassia and frankincense were mingled .
And the older women wailed aloud .
And all the men gave forth a high - pitched song ,
calling on Apollo , the far - shooter , skilled in the lyre .
And they sang of Hektor and Andromakhe like to the gods .
29
Blessed bridegroom ,
The marriage is accomplished as you prayed .
You have the maiden you prayed for .
30
I do n’t know what to do : I am of two minds .
31
For gold is Zeus ’ child .
32
I have a beautiful daughter
Like a golden flower
My beloved Kleis .
I would not trade her for all Lydia nor lovely ...
33
When you lie dead , no one will remember you
For you have no share in the Muses ’ roses .
No , flitting aimlessly about ,
You will wildly roam ,
a shade amidst the shadowy dead .
34
Death is an evil .
That ’s what the gods think .
Or they would die .
35
Because you are dear to me
Marry a younger woman .
I do n’t dare live with a young man —
I ’m older .
KEY PASSAGES RELEVANT TO THE POETICS OF SAPPHO
TRANSLATED BY GREGORY NAGY
1 . And they passed by the streams of Okeanos and the White Rock
and past the Gates of the Sun and the District of Dreams .
Odyssey 24.11-12
2. ... they say that Sappho was the first ,
hunting down the proud Phaon ,
to throw herself , in her goading desire , from the rock
that shines from afar .
But now , in accordance with your sacred utterance ,
lord king , let there be silence
throughout the sacred precinct of the headland of the White Rock .
Menander F 258K
3 . One more time taking off in the air , down from the White Rock
into the dark waves do I dive , intoxicated with lust .
Anacreon PMG 376
4 . I would be crazy not to give all the herds of the Cyclopes
in return for drinking one cup [ of that wine ]
and throwing myself from the white rock into the brine ,
once I am intoxicated , with eyebrows relaxed .
Whoever is not happy when he drinks is crazy .
Where it is allowed to make this thing stand up erect ,
to grab the breast and touch with both hands
the meadow that is made all ready .
And there is dancing
and forgetting [ root lêth- ] of bad things .
Euripides Cyclops 163-172
5. Related sources ( summaries and commentary by G.N. ) : According to the account in Book VII of the mythographer Ptolemaios Chennos ( ca. A.D. 100 ; by way of Photius Bibliotheca 152 - 153 Bekker ) , the first to dive off the heights of Cape Leukas , the most famous localization of the White Rock , was none other than Aphrodite herself , out of love for a dead Adonis .
After Adonis died ( how it happened is not said ) , the mourning Aphrodite went off searching for him and finally found him at ‘ Cypriote Argos ’ , in a shrine of Apollo .
She consults Apollo , who instructs her to seek relief from her love by jumping off the white rock of Leukas , where Zeus sits whenever he wants relief from his passion for Hera .
Then Ptolemaios launches into a veritable catalogue of other figures who followed Aphrodite ’s precedent and took a ritual plunge as a cure for love .
For example , Queen Artemisia
I is reputed to have leapt off the white rock out of love for one Dardanos , succeeding only in getting herself killed .
Several others are mentioned who died from the leap , including a certain iambographer Charinos who expired only after being fished out of the water with a broken leg , but not before blurting out his four last iambic trimeters , painfully preserved for us with the compliments of Ptolemaios ( and Photius as well ) .
Someone called Makês was more fortunate : having succeeded in escaping from four love affairs after four corresponding leaps from the white rock , he earned the epithet Leukopetrâs ‘ the one of the white rock ’ .
We may question the degree of historicity in such accounts .
There is , however , a more important concern .
In the lengthy and detailed account of Ptolemaios , Sappho is not mentioned at all , let alone Phaon .
From this silence we may infer that the source of this myth about Aphrodite and Adonis is independent of Sappho ’s own poetry or of later distortions based on it .
Accordingly , the ancient cult practice at Cape Leukas , as described by Strabo ( 10.2.9 C452 ) , may well contain some intrinsic element that inspired lovers ’ leaps , a practice also noted by Strabo ( ibid . ) .
The second practice seems to be derived from the first , as we might expect from a priestly institution that becomes independent of the social context that had engendered it .
Abstracted from their inherited tribal functions , religious institutions have a way of becoming mystical organizations .
Another reason for doubting that Sappho ’s poetry had been the inspiration for the lovers ’ leaps at Cape Leukas is the attitude of Strabo himself .
He specifically disclaims Menander ’s version about Sappho ’s being the first to take the plunge at Leukas .
Instead , he offers a version of “ those more versed in the ancient lore , ” according to which Kephalos son of Deioneus was the very first to have leapt , impelled by love for Pterelas ( Strabo 10.2.9 C452 ) .
The myth of Kephalos and his dive may be as old as the concept of the White Rock .
I say “ concept ” because the ritual practice of casting victims from a white rock may be an inheritance parallel to the epic tradition about a mythical White Rock on the shores of the Okeanos ( as in Odyssey 24.11 ) and the related literary theme of diving from an imaginary White Rock ( as in the poetry of Anacreon and Euripides ) .
In other words , it is needless to assume that the ritual preceded the myth or the other way around .
6 . Others say that , in the vicinity of the rocks at Athenian Kolonos , he
[ Poseidon ] , falling asleep , had an emission of semen , and a horse
Skuphios came out , who is also called Skîrônîtês [ ‘ the one of the White Rock ’ ] .
Scholia to Lycophron 766
7 .
Poseidon Petraios [ ‘ of the rocks ’ ] has a cult among the Thessalians ... because he , having fallen asleep at some rock , had an emission of semen ; and the earth , receiving the semen , produced the first horse , whom they called Skuphios ....
And they say that there was a festival established in worship of Poseidon Petraios at the spot where the first horse leapt forth .
Scholia to Pindar Pythian 4.246
8 . But I love luxuriance [ ( h ) abrosunê ] ... this ,
and lust for the sun has won me brightness and beauty .
Sappho F 58.25-26 V
Welfare groups say the economy needs more than just a cash injection from the Federal Government if Australia is to survive the worsening global economic crisis .
Representatives from social and community organisations are meeting in Sydney with Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard .
The president of the Australian Council of Social Service , Lynne Hatfield - Dodds , says the Government needs to look at measures such as increasing the minimum wage to ease the plight of workers .
" But we 've also been calling for a serious investment in social services and that 's about money , but it 's not just about money .
It 's about looking at the regulatory and compliance and legal environments that we all need to work in as well , " she said .
Welfare groups say up to 140,000 Australians are expected to lose their jobs this year as companies slash costs to deal with the financial downturn .
Charities want the Federal Government to make sure banks do not foreclose on the homes of people who are experiencing temporary hardship .
Julia Gillard says no one wants to see families living on the street .
" That 's an issue for Government - an issue for the Federal Government , for state governments , but clearly it 's also an issue for our banks , " she said .
" I think we would be saying to them that thinking about the welfare of Australians in these circumstances is very important . "
Ms Gillard also says it is important for the Federal Government to hear firsthand from the welfare sector about how Australians are coping with the global economic downturn .
She says she expects to talk about housing issues and the growing pressure on carers .
" We want to make sure we 're talking to these groups because they 're the ones who can give us the best of intelligence about what 's happening out on the ground , about how Australians are weathering the global financial crisis and what they expect to see for 2009 , " she said .
" This was the opening of discussions ; the Government did n't come here today to make commitments and that was clear .
" We came here today to start a process of discussion about these important issues as the nation works its way through the consequences of the global financial crisis . "
Catholic Social Services Australia says it will ask Ms Gillard for more money for under - resourced employment services .
The social service provider will also make suggestions for a special taskforce to encourage the Government to do more to help the unemployed .
Bill Nye Boo'd In Texas For Saying The Moon Reflects The Sun Posted by Pile ( 366752 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
[ Astronomy ]
Bill Nye , the harmless children 's edu-tainer known as " The Science Guy , " managed to offend a select group of adults in Waco , Texas at a presentation , when he suggested that the moon does not emit light , but instead reflects the light of the sun .
As even most elementary - school graduates know , the moon reflects the light of the sun but produces no light of its own .
But do n't tell that to the good people of Waco , who were " visibly angered by what some perceived as irreverence , " according to the Waco Tribune .
Nye was in town to participate in McLennan Community College 's Distinguished Lecture Series .
He gave two lectures on such unfunny and adult topics as global warming , Mars exploration , and energy consumption .
But nothing got people as riled as when he brought up Genesis 1:16 , which reads : " God made two great lights -- the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night .
He also made the stars . "
The lesser light , he pointed out , is not a light at all , but only a reflector .
At this point , several people in the audience stormed out in fury .
One woman yelled " We believe in God ! " and left with three children , thus ensuring that people across America would read about the incident and conclude that Waco is as nutty as they 'd always suspected .
This story originally appeared in the Waco Tribune , but the newspaper has mysteriously pulled its story from the online version , presumably to avoid further embarassment .

Posted by Jethro ! on 2007-08-16 07:39:19
The article does n't quote exactly what was said or the context , but if he was parsing Genesis 1:16 in order to take a jab at Christians , he deserves to be booed .
If Nye claimed that Genesis 1:16 said God created two " light sources , " then Nye is wrong -- it says : " God made two great lights ... "
That the " lesser light " is reflected light , does not make it any less a " great light . " sounds like jethro does n't get the point
Posted by drolar on 2007 - 08 - 16 23:01:00 nye did n't say it was less of a great light .
it was the god believers that took it that way .
technically something that reflects light is not necessarily a light .
if that were the case , your car window would be a light .
such silliness .

ANYTHING that even suggests that it could be a superstitious myth or that discredits even one word of that text , ( written thousands of years ago , by people who thought god wanted them to cut the throats of goats and then burn them in sacrifice ) , is OF THE DEVIL ....

Ridiculous as it may seem , I have encountered critics of religion who cite Genesis 1:16 as an example of error in the Bible .
That may have been what Nye did to offend this audience .
Most Christians , even in Waco , realize that the Bible is not a science book .
Hopefully the atheists will catch on at some point .
Posted by Sheryl on 2007-08 - 17 23:12:28
We realize that many Christians do n't believe the bible is a science book .
However you can't deny that there are those who do , there are even some who take the bible so literally that they refuse to believe the earth revolves around the sun .
They deserve to be called out for their denial of reason and willingness to put blind belief in an ancient book over observable reality .
To do otherwise would be to encourage and condone ignorance , and everyone regardless of whether they are atheist , Christian , or Hindu , should strive to eliminate ignorance .

I am as pro-atheism as anyone and I do n't doubt that whenever you think you have come up with the stupidest possible belief there is something worse out there .
And I would probably be on Nye 's side for a lot of stuff but it does sound like the audience was not given a fair shake here .
No one can tell from this story if they were booing his " news " about the moon or his apparent assumption that the only reason they believe the Bible is because they do not possess a second grade education .
People do n't convert from their beliefs because someone talks to them as if they were slack jawed yokels .
Nye may not have intended to sound like this but he may very well have given that impression .
I am not saying there might not have been someone in the audience who did boo the moon news but to make this presumption of them seems rather hasty .
Was " We believe in God " their response to the moon news or to his ( perceived ) intent ?

They are slack jawed yokels , are arguing any differently is an affront to those that are n't .
There are plenty of people in this country that can understand the fact that evolution AND a belief in God are not mutually exclusive .

They were mad that he seemed to be attacking religion !

Posted by Jago on 2007-08- 18 06:07:51
I can totally see how it's appropriate to attack the biblical quotations during a presentation at a school , especially when the English translation of the old testament so clearly states that the moon is exactly the same as the sun and emits light rather than reflecting it .

Stupid is believing that people would be upset that Nye says the moon reflects light from the sun .
Stupid is believing that they were not upset that he was putting the bible down based on his own personal interpretation of the bible .
Stupid would be believing the audiance / city of Waco was represented by the one woman who " yelled " We believe in God ! " and left with three children " .

With all things , there is always something in - between that makes the most sense .
God is that which provides the spark of inspiration and love .
Pure science is that which provides solace in understanding .
Sometimes the two cross paths .
As long as you have a good grip on both , you can see both .
If you limit yourself to only one , you run the risk of never being happy .
For what it 's worth , that is how I maintain sanity and faith and knowlege all at the same time .

I read the replies on the misunderstanding in Waco I can only conclude one thing .
You call those in Waco wackos !
Can you here yourselves ?
The bottom line here is that the Bible proves science and , as evidence of the origin of man , it is an important part of the puzzle .
Hating the Master Creator which some by faith and understanding have come to know within the pages of the Holy Bible is as closed - minded as anything else .
Those who believe and know beyond a shadow of a doubt will and are comforted in this present world and the next .
The Bible is without doubt the only link with our Creator that we have and to ignore it and its scientific advancements is blindness and foolishness .
So you 're not really sure what is said within those pages .
Why do n't you look for yourselves instead of listing to another foolish person .

Alan makes the following assumption , " The Bible is without doubt the only link with our Creator that we have and to ignore it and its scientific advancements is blindness and foolishness . "
Excuse me Alan , but on what evidence do you base your findings ?
Let me answer that question for you , " faith . "
You base your findings on faith alone .
Too bad for you that science does not base their findings on faith , they base their findings on provable facts .
That 's why science and religion have nothing to do with one another .
They are completely incompatible systems , so the Bible proves nothing about science , and science can't prove much about the Bible either , unless you base your findings on faith .
But then that would n't be science , that would be religion again .
But , besides that , Alan is also wrong about the link we have with God .
He tries to claim a monopoly on God through the Bible .
That old trick has been around since they wrote the Bible .
The truth is the light of God dwells in all hearts .
You do n't need a bible , or a preacher or anyone to show you the way .
The true way is within .
Posted by yeranalyst on 2007-08- 20 23:22:23
There is no purpose in arguing with a person of faith about faith or almost anything else .
They see the world through their filter of faith .
Faith precludes rationality .
Faith can not be reasoned with .
It is steeped in the supernatural .
There is no logic in it .
Reason requires logic and vice versa .
Faith is purely emotional .
You may as well try to reason with a serial killer about the innate value of life .
Fanatacism can be religious , ideological , political , nationalistic , whatever a person wants to submerge and vest their emotional being in .
Faith is very much involved in the authoritarian personality , the need to believe somebody or something knows what 's going on and tells you what to do .

Ok for future reference if you are planning to try to argue for the understanding of people you should first check your spelling .
secondly this idea you propose is extremly close minded you are saying that we , as science minded indviduals , are limiting our scientific understanding by not reading the bible .
well i was raised in a heavily christian household and have read the bible multiples times cover to cover , and the only thing that really ever struck me were the inconsistancies .
the faults in science that the bible makes make it very hard to accept it as anything more than a painfully hard to read fairy tale .
for one thing bats are not birds ...
i understand that the people who wrote the bible might make this mistake but if your god were the one that was behind the writing of the bible and he knew everything dont you think he would make sure they got the details right ... there are also parts in the bible that strike me as not only fallible but down right criminal .
for instance it states in the bible that a father should have the choice to sell his daughter into slavery for seven years ... if that book holds as much athourity in waco as it sounds i may have to go there and get me a maid ...

- I have read through every post on this site and , while I do n't claim to be an expert on the Bible , I have to say that it sounds really weird to me :
God is all knowing ;
God is omnipotent ;
God is everpresent and everlasting and God makes mistakes ?
How can that possibly be ?
How can any human know God 's thoughts ?
People who say they " know " God , do n't know .
People who say they " do n't know " , know .
H/T ( Joseph Campbell , " The Power of Myth " ) God is such a huge concept , it gives me a head - ache trying to grasp it .
Personally , I believe in the God of the founders : the " god " of nature .
" In God I trust " does n't make me a Christian , but I do believe in Science after all .

Posted by voice of reason on 2007-08 - 22 15:33:23 Alan ,
You blindly assumed that the violently anti-Christian atheists who are posting on this board have not read / studied the Bible .
Of course we 've read it .
The question of God 's existence is THE question , and the Bible is a major topic in the debate .
It would be ignorant and illogical to denounce a book we 've never read .
And if nothing else , we believe in logic .
I know it might be hard for you to accept , be we have read and studied the bible , and have found it wanting .
Finally , the incident in Waco is upsetting because it is another example of the iron curtain of faith being drawn across potentially open minds .
Fanatics , and i'm speaking of Christian Fundamentalists here primarily , shut down their capacity for reason whenever they so much as smell religious dissent .
The audience in Waco stopped listening and got angry without any legitimate provocation , all because they realized they were in a room with someone who thought differently from them .
These are the same people who will tell you that Global Warming is a myth without ever having investigated it , just because their sworn enemies ... those dirty , immoral , pot smoking liberals ... are championing the cause .
That is the definition of a closed mind : the inability to listen / hear / understand a viewpoint that differs from your own .
I suspect that if you were to take an honest look at yourself , and your actions in the defense of your religion , you would find yourself guilty of this particular crime .
On the other hand , I respect your willingness to engage in a debate ( rather than declaring your faith and turning on your heels ) .
I sincerely hope everyone is right ... and that the end , when it comes , is what we have anticipated .
That in the afterlife the multitude of faiths find a way to co-exist .
But at the end of the day all I have is hope ... not true knowledge .
I choose to live my life to the fullest of my ability in light of that .
I urge you to look inward and see if this is n't true for you as well .
Faith is Hope , disguised as Truth .

So , I am interested in this Book for those reasons .
I guess I just want to know what the people that are telling me how to live my life are reading .
Quite frankly I found it wordy and poorly thought out !
More importantly , this book is filled with hypocrisies , and is completely misogynistic ( to an alarming degree ) .
I was raised catholic until I reached the age of reason , and feel , now , that these religions are created by men in power to pray on the weak and keep them that way .

Could be struck down Was Bill right ?
Posted by Galileo on 2007-08-28 11:33:22
We were not there .
We did not hear everything ( including the tone and the prelude ) .
Maybe , just maybe , Bill was boo'd for using a " proof " that was not a proof .
The fact that the Moon reflects light may be a poor proof that the Genesis passage is not correct .
Galileo was tried for something that was not totally related to the debate about the centre of the solar system .
However , the public reason for his trial was the debate between sun-centred and earth - centred systems .
When Galileo found satellites orbiting Jupiter , that was certainly NOT a proof that planets orbited the Sun .
It may have been an indication that not everything orbited the Earth , but that was already known then ( Venus and Mercury were often displayed as orbiting the Sun , which was orbiting the Earth ) .
Of course , even if Bill did use a poor ' proof ' , that does not make the other version correct .
PS : I went to a door and window store and they do count windows as " lights " .
As in " here is a nice model with four lights " .

" WE BELIEVE IN GOD PLOX " The Genesis verse is not what you think
Posted by Erin on 2007-08-29 21:00:02 Genesis 1:16 , which reads : " God made two great lights -- the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night .
He also made the stars . "
Is misunderstood by BOTH Christians AND atheists .
The verse is referring to the solid fact that the universe is composed of positive and negative energy .
Sadly most people both Christian and non Christian have no understanding of this solid fact .
Paul Dirac and Erwin Shroedinger both independently discovered , as did others such as Viktor Schauberger , that there is a sea of negative energy electrons that is invisible to our devices which are designed to push around positive energy electrons .
This negative energy sea can be tapped for anti gravity , endless free overunity energy , and more .
God was showing us this in that Genesis verse .
The " night side light " has nothing to do with the Moon .
Its the negative matter / negative / dark matter / dark energy sea which fills the universe :
The quantum vacuum negative energy .
I propose that both Christians and Atheists put aside your differences and help us mass produce machines and devices that tap into this " night side energy " .
PS
The " Dark " and " Negative " does NOT mean evil .
It means opposite to positive or poorly understood .
The word " occult " in and of itself is not bad :
It simply means secret .
Go to www.cheniere.org and www.zpenergy.com for info on this negative energy .
Oh jesus ....

How does the bible handle lunar eclipses ?
Posted by ReadyTeddy on 2007-08-30 14:43:51
Maybe the all mighty turns the moon off for a short while just to remind people who 's in charge ?

I 'm sure there is a good spirtually - based explanation .
Nye wrong on multiple levels
Posted by Objective Person on 2007-08-31 09:08:03 Quantum mechanically speaking , the moon does produced the photons we see coming from it .
Photons from the sun are absorbed by the surface of the moon and “ new ” photons are emitted .
Semantically speaking , a light is “ something that makes things visible or affords illumination ” .
Any bright object , depending on its use , can serve as a light .
It sounds like Nye was trying to be offensive .
He succeeds in offending both Christians and the educated .

Well technically the " reflection of a photo occurs when the photon is absorbed by a electron in orbit of an atom which raise the energy level of the electron which then drops back down and re-emits a photon .
So it is a source of light that is optically pumped by the sun .. and it was good Regional Earth Days ?

Sorry to hear the once famous Bill Nye is reduced to doing lectures in towns like Waco .
That 's a ways down the scale from national TV .
Maybe he and Paul Zaloom ( Beaker 's World ) could join forces and barnstorm the Bible belt .
With Nye 's odd demeanor and Zaloom 's puppet skills they'd be a hit in spite of the close - minded peckerwoods in the audiences .

And do n't forget that in Texas , a bill has been passed that would allow students to use religious arguments in class , tests , and homework , and it would be considered a valid answer .
If the science scores sucked before , it 's nothing compared to what the scores will be in some areas of Texas if this becomes law .
I hope it does n't , and if it does , I can't wait until someone sends their non-Christian kid through and they use their religion 's answers .

Posted by DanM on 2007-09-04 18:13:24
" Close - minded fundamentalist atheists are just as bad a s close - minded fundamentalist theists "
I fail to understand how it is close minded to not believe in something when the only evidence for it is an ancient book that we are told was inspired by God .
To make matters worse it is a book that has hundreds of different versions because many of the words that were originally written do not have a direct translation nowadays .
The results are that whoever decides to translate the text makes up their own words to fit their own beliefs .
Yes , science always changes too .
It , however , changes on new discoveries and by questioning previous held beliefs .
When a scientist or an atheist do n't know something they look for the answer .
This is far from being close minded .
Saying that " God did it " any time that you do not know the answer , on the other hand , is about as close minded as you can get , not to mention that it is incredibly lazy .

That they believed in God and left with the children .
While reading the posts I thought these people writing these comments really believe THEY are smart .
Goes to show that most people will get on the road that is most traveled and just follow the masses .

Posted by Me on 2007-09-05 08:39:58
The bible was written when everyone thought the earth was flat and at the center of the universe .
Bill Nye was n't dissing the bible or Christians or any specific group .
He was merely using that phrase as an example to make a scientific point .
It 's been pretty common throughout the centuries for scientists at lectures to do that .
Although it 's pretty sad that now , in the 21st century , it still needs to be explained and is met with ridicule .
So I guess Waco is the moronic capitol of the world .
I 'm so ashamed to be American right now .

The meaning of the word circle in Hebrew ( which is the language that was used in Isaiah & Job ) is sphere or orb indicating that the world is round .
So when the Bible was written it was telling us the world is round .
How would they have known that so long ago ?
They could n't have known .

"
To Coragyps
Posted by Joan on 2007-09-06 17:06:10 Glad to see you agree with me .
That was my point .
Someone here said when the Bible was written the people in the world thought it was flat .
I directed them to the Bible , where it says it was round .
Job is the oldest book in the Bible .
It refers to the circle .
( sphere , orb ) But Columbus 's time came a long time after the book of Job was written and if you remember during their time the world was thought to be flat by the Europeans .
There were eclipses during that time also .
They knew the sun , moon etc was round , but they thought the earth was flat .
That was in our history books anyway .
I am interested did anyone else have that taught in school ?
Uh , No ...
Posted by Bill Nye on 2007-09-06 18:30:43 Genesis 1:16 does not say that the moon emits its own light , so the comment by Nye was not necessary .
It is a canard .
It speaks of a " great light " by day " and a lesser light " by night .
Obviously , this is correct .
Even you wacko atheists have to admit it is brighter in the daytime than it is at night .... or do you not believe in the existence of Day and / or Night either ????

Posted by Mr. Porter on 2007-09 - 10 09:14:45 Ladies and gentlemen , lassies and laddies ( and Bill Nye ) :
Please understand the Bible is using phenomenological language when it refers to the moon being a light .
This is similar to making the statement that the sun rises .
Most people know that the sun does not rise , but we still describe it as such because in everyday speech we tend to speak more phenomenologically than scientifically .
Posted by Ron B. on 2007-09-10 10:08:14 I agree with Mr. Porter 's comment .
What if we were to contend that everyone who lives in the same city as a weatherman who refers to the " sunrise " is an idiot .
After all , if there 's one idiot in a city , then the whole city must be filled with idiots .
Makes sense to me .
You bet !
I guess we 'll have to condemn the whole country as idiots then , right ?
To assume that everyone in Waco , TX is an ignorant moron because of the actions of one moron is even more idiotic than saying the moon does n't reflect light .

Posted by Kadaken on 2007-09-10 17:59:36
All
I have to say , is if you ever wanted the truth , religion , science , all knowing intelligence of this entire existence , then you would literally have to cover every possible element in existence ... which means every lie every truth and every thought that can be thought .
Every sight sound and feeling that can be achieved ( which automatically excludes us at our point in time because we can't hear , see , and feel everything ) is all included .
Skipping over things means you do n't get the experience and facts become faiths as well .
I do not follow religion at all but realize with out at least understanding it .. we'd have nothing else to compare our thoughts NOW to .
And perhaps it 's not possible to come up with science until we realize the fallacies in the bible .
Maybe even that was the point of the bible .
who knows .. but the fact is ..it 's hear .. and must be researched to claim our intelligence over our BELIEF of what is real .

photons of light do not bounce off of an object when they reflect .
the reflection is made of new and DIFFERENT photons .
so technically he is wrong anyway , because there ARE two light sources .
the moon is reflecting the light of the sun , but the light is not the SAME light .
maybe when scientists and religious people embrace a faith where science and religion are one , people will spend less time fighting themselves , and more time united .

Christianity is nothing more than modern day sun worship , with ' Jesus ' in place of the sun .
The story of Jesus is actually a plagiarized version of the Egyptian story of Horus .
The ten commandments ?
Taken right out of the Egyptian Book of the Dead , Noah 's Ark ? plagiarized version of the Epic of Gilgamesh .
The bible is literally one big rewrite of Egyptian beliefs !
LOL !
Do n't believe me ?

Only defective christian religions are like this ...
Baptists , Lutherans , Mormons , Baptists again ... Eastern Othodox ....hmm what else ...
Anyways , the Roman Catholic church actually accepts evolution as a fact [ none of the defects accept this ] .
The moon glowing because of the sun as a fact [ none of the defects accept this ] .
Blacks , Asians , Indian [ non of the defects accept this ] .
The only thing they say is that soul has no evolved which has been the debate between philosophers for thousands of years , and will always be a debate for eternity .
The only that the church actually stands on is that god created the universe .
Big bang included , since obviously it will never be explained why the fundemental elements existed in the first place .

It is sad , and terribly wrong , to take the words and actions of the few and , with rushed pride and ignorance , apply them to your pre-existing world - view of such a group with a shout of victory .
For instance , the former would apply to me if I made a jab at " the obvious lack of Jesus " in the words of a poster named " spaceman " , who said the following :
" most christians i know are lunatics .
they all need to be burned " .
Now , to be fair , perhaps we would all do good to read the post of the poster , " Objective Person " , who said :
" Quantum mechanically speaking , the moon does produced the photons we see coming from it .
Photons from the sun are absorbed by the surface of the moon and “ new ” photons are emitted .
Semantically speaking , a light is “ something that makes things visible or affords illumination ” .
Any bright object , depending on its use , can serve as a light .
It sounds like Nye was trying to be offensive .
He succeeds in offending both Christians and the educated . "
Also , since I like the rake the fire , check out this quote from Darwin :
" In scientific investigations it is permitted to invent any hypothesis , and if it explains various large and independent classes of facts it rises to the rank of a well - grounded theory " .
- Charles Darwin
" Hypothesis non fingo . " - Issac Newton
Think about it .
the disrespect of intelligence
Posted by bone on 2007 - 09 - 12 05:52:55 in our culture , from a very young age , we 're taught that intelligence is not cool , words like geek , nerd , 4 eyes , spring to mind .
is it no wonder that the masses react like this when asked to think or consider theories to the contrary ?
intelligence and thus knowledge is not only under valued today , they are interpretted as disrespectful to the norm .
aborted fetuses look like road kill .

Look to criticize ...
Posted by Zav Dur on 2007 - 09 - 12 15:59:36 first off , the sun is n't light - but it produces light , the moon is n't light - but it reflects light ; I do n't see any contradiction in this Bible verse , mearly a contradiction in how it was interpretated to imply it was refering to what the source of light is ... gotta remember who God was originally talking too , he had to dumb it down a bit .
Shame on Bill for creating a contradiction and then pointing it out ...
( Bill Nye is awesome though ~loved watching his shows in school ) Posted by wil on 2007-09 - 12 18:49:14 Actually this " incident " occurred in April , 2006 - 16 months ago .
Bill Nye appeared on Keith Olbermanns MSNBC show the next night and basically said it was no big deal ( msnbc.msn.com/id/12252465 ) , one lady did leave with her children and that was it .
It 's amazing how the internet can blow things completely out of proportion .

Wonder what would happen if someone made those people watch a Michael Tsarion or Zecharia Sitchin conferance !!
Or what if you make them take a closer look at the 1 Dollar bill and pointed out the over abundant amount of items by the count of 13 on it ?
Or the presence of Lilith and her twin owls ?
I 'm sure that it's in " God " that " We Trust " .
There 's a million things wrong with the world around us , and I give the man credit for being tame enough to point out something that simple .
At the same time , I must inevitable discredit people who get offended so hastily when someone points out that the bible is in no way a substitute for science .
Yes , the man brought it up ... probably as part of a common tactic used by public speakers to capture the interest of the audience : refer to something they know about , and add to it .
Bottom line is : anyone who gets offended that easily has a few more things to learn before they can make any claims at understanding the greater works of the universe .

There are countless religions , they can't all be right .
Religion has been responsible for more wars and suppression of people than anything else in history .
When the creationist theory is being taught in schools over scientific fact it really is time to worry .
I may not be religious but I follow a few simple rules .
Treat everybody as an equal .
Respect others beliefs and customs and measure success as what you do for others , not the money you make .
Peace to all dudes .

You guys take the Bible too literally .
Back then , how much good would it do if God told whomever that wrote Genesis " And God created a source of light , and an object that reflects light off that source to make it appear as a light source , which in fact it is not " ?
Which is easier for people to comprehend : what I said above , or " God made two great lights -- the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night .
He also made the stars . "
You decide .

Genesis 1:16 NLT
Posted by TJF588 on 2008-02-23 08:47:04
Taken from the New Living Translation :
" For God made two great lights , the sun and the moon , to shine down upon the earth .
The greater one , the sun , presides during the day ; the lesser one , the moon , presides during the night .
He also made the stars . "
Now , do n't go swingin ' your victory [ insert swingable item here ]s , yet .
This is one translation , mind , not the original text .
From the Bible Translation Team list :
PENTATEUCH
Daniel I. Block , General Reviewer
The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary
GENESIS
Allas Ross , Trinity Episcopal Seminary
John Sailhamer , Northwestern College
Gordon Wenham , The Cheltenham and Gloucester College of Higher Education
With a few more people at the end as overall handlers ( or whate 'er they did toward the NLT ) .
I got over halfway through the comments , but to the point I stopped , no mention of the ways in which the original language ( assumably Hebrew ) could be interpretted for that verse had been discussed .
For what it 's worth though , I doubt that Bill Nye would outrightly try to be offensive .
Dumbass'd , perhaps , but no " fire and brimstone " of the non-God calling .

Wow .
I 've been one to enjoy a lot of debate in my time , as an ex-christian - zeitgeist .
I do n't think less of anyone for their beliefs ; and I always try to acquire a fair understanding of the beliefs of others .
That 's not to say that I wo n't poke my finger through if I see a hole in the fabric of one 's belifes , but I 'm respectful .
So , at least there are a few of us who have read ( and even preached ) the bible , and are n't insane neanderthals .
None of us were there , I wish there were a recording , so we could really see it ; many people here are saying " No , he meant it this way ! " which is foolish because none of us saw his expression , or heard his intonation , no one knows .
Personally , I respect him a lot , he garnered much of my early thirst for knowledge , which has continued to this day .
Anyone who encoruages that kind of free thinking , and answer - seeking is fantastic in my book .
I do n't know if he really meant something mean , or was just spicing up a speech ; but he 's historically shown a good , strong sense of character , so I do n't think he 's out gunning against anyone 's faith , personally .

They have video of his lectures on PBS in the wee hours of the morning , I 've watched many of them , they seemed to be continuous and there were no uprisings nor did the crowd greatly diminish .
Interesting lecture though , Bill Nye does point out the fact that all scientific advancements have been based one one fundamental theory , molecular theory , which is only a theory and not a law ... title ?

Posted by some fella on 2008 - 12-07 15:04:51 here is something funny :
Most of the people who bring up the subject of the Bible are the very ones who dislike it .
If God does n't exists then your disbelief is just a result of the pizza you had last night , because everything is just part of a chemical reaction , or its in your genes to dislike the idea of a God .
If everything happened by chance then your very existence is pointless and you should just go sit in the corner and leave everyone else alone so they can enjoy life and make the best of it .
If God does n't exist then nothing matters .
If He does exist then everything matters .
If God does n't exist then why further education to begin with ?
Life has no point then why bother ?
If God does n't exist then why get married and have kids ?
Our existence on this rock was an accident anyways , why further the advancement of it ?
If you do n't believe in God then why are you so into fighting Him ?
why do you hate Him ?
why do you want to see
His removal from society ?
why bother to voice your opinion ?
Sometimes it is a misunderstanding that gets people into arguments , but a lot of the time its someone attacking someone else for their belief or lack there of .
I do n't attack anyone for what they think .
If you want to debate then I have no objections and would take great glee in conversing with you .
But to attack someone and completely shun them ?
that is not of God !
God said that He will accept anyone who comes with a humble heart and an open mind .
That is all I got for now ... have fun !!

There was no reason to bring religion into his science lecture .
He could have just explained what makes the moon shine and leave religion out of it .
Unless Bill is a complete moron he would have to expect that type of response .
If anyone knows Bill he is a bit arrogant and likes to irritate .
Oh yea Bill is totally guilty of ignorance of his own .
He stated the Gulf stream is controlled by ocean currents when in fact its mostly WIND driven .
He has guts to talk about topics he knows nothing about .

It 's amusing for me to read comments that claim that faith and reason are mutually exclusive , or that people with faith are blinded from logic .
Read Justin Martyr , St. Augustine , St. Anselm , Thomas Aquinas , C.S. Lewis , or any other of the great Christian thinkers .
They 're not perfect , but collectively they provide a strong foundation for Christian intellectualism .
And stop assuming that Christians in general read the entire Bible literally .
Christians have been reading Scriptures allegorically ( and in many other senses ) since before the canon was made official .
Lastly , I 'm sick and tired of people dissing Waco , particularly its residents .
It 's not a city of crackheads and hicks .
I go to school here , and I see a city in need of help and a city with much to offer .
How about you figure out how to help rather than sit back and insult it .

I am amazed , and not in a good way , when to this day I hear people make this sort of argument .
You do n't need much more than your power of observation to know that lightly colored objects here on Earth reflect light .
The moon itself cannot create light ...
This is why it disappears once a cycle ...
Because the light of the sun does not reach it ...
How needy do you have to be to feel that God 's greatness needs to be fought for over something like this ...
The beauty of the Moon , if you choose to believe , can be proof of God 's power to make everything in the universe shine in his light ...
And your argument , to people like me , is only proof of your stupidity ...
Or your need to bend people to your beliefs ...
Is God so powerless than He needs you to make such poor arguments ?
The Moon is a beautiful mirror hovering above our heads .
But I am thrilled to see what length religious people will go to to defend Pagan symbolism :P Comment

The word is luminous
Posted by mcm on 2009-04-01 17:07:18 First Bill
Nye considers himself agnostic not atheist ( he is quoted as answering " You really can't know " to the God question ) .
Second the Hebrew word for light in Genesis 1:16 is " ma'owr " which means luminous , this applies to radiating OR reflecting light .
So Genesis 1:16 is factually , scientifically , and theologically correct ( sorry Bill ) .

I went to a Physician 's Assistant today with a rather large , solid lump on my tibia , which did n't appear on the x-ray films .
He then told me to be " prayerful . "
That was his diagnosis .
IDK , PRAY ?

You need to maintain some grasp to your religion ; otherwise , you wo n't be happy because you 'll feel like a heathen for abandoning your beliefs .
You were programmed to think this way .
You can live life using common sense , and even believe in a God or force that holds the universe together , without believing what men with limited and outdated knowledge wrote down thousands of years ago .
( Not to mention the constant revisions and varying translations . )
If you take any monotheistic religion and slightly dilute it with science , you 'll get what you described .
Huge flaws are apparent in all religions ; there 's no logical reason that yours is more right .
What 's to say that Christianity is the true faith ?
Go a step further .
You 're getting there .

Another reason that the branch of my family from Texas completely dodges Waco .
I shit you not , they will drive hundreds of miles out of their way to get somewhere if it means that they wo n't have to pass through Waco .
But personally , being from Wisconsin myself , I think that few things that are truly great have come from Texas ... and most of them are musicians .

It never ceases to amaze me how Christians , when faced with scientific and / or historical proof of the inaccuracy of the Bible , then claim no one takes it literally .

Much like a handful of others that have posted , I too have read this Bible you all are fighting about .
I 've also read Dawkins , Freud , Jung , Joseph Campbell , and Thomas Merton .
I grew up in the Baptist church , and also watched Bill Nye as a young child .
All I can say is that both of these influences educated me and helped me to gain truth and perspective about life .
If you want to just write off Waco as a bunch of Bible - belt crackheads , that is your choice , but the truth I see here is that the article provides very little information .
If there were more details , or comments from Nye himself , we could make a clear judgment .
I actually find the debate on religion and faith that has followed more interesting .
It seems each side is a photo - negative of the other : the Atheist is disgusted at the blind faith of a religious man and their refusal to accept clear reason , while the ones with Religious beliefs might be willing to accept reason , but find ultimate truth in their faith .
I am not sure what is so evil about either way of thinking , other than they can both lead to evil actions by humankind .
Does this mean that without religious belief that we would have less violence ?
Or without scientific inquiry , we would have less evil in the world ?
I cannot see this as being the case , therefore we should perhaps respect the beliefs of others and understand that our very existence is a miracle enough to justify a belief in god , and our individual suffering is enough to justify both our faith and denial of him .
It is no one 's choice but our own .

Ummm so the verse does n't state that the lesser light is not reflected .
It does state that the lesser light governs the night .
Which is wrong since the orbits have the moon in The night only 50 % of the time .

I have seen bill speak at UTA , where he was recieved with an overwhelming welcome .
Also , i feel the need to mention that nowhere in his lecture did he mention anything of religion .
The people of Waco are obviously just small minded and misconstruing a lecture about science to be more than it really is .
I feel deeply ashamed for my beloved state of texas , that UTA is only an hour drive from Waco but that they could be so uninformed .
Bill is an awesome public speaker and has been capturing the imagination of children ( including mine ) for years .
He never ever deserved to be booed .

A belief that the moon gives off its own light may seem stupid , but the current superstition that global warming is caused by tiny increments of CO2 rather than by the demonstrated variability in the sun 's output seems just as backwater .
Both notions are closed systems that demand unquestioning faith .
Both reflect a failure to put down the beer and do a little research .
This would show the first group that the moon does in fact reflect the sun and the other group that global warming is currently taking place on other bodies in our solar system .
The difference I see is that one group is composed of smart asses who compound their idiocy by ridiculing others to elevate themselves , seeing their own reflection in others as light when in fact the source of light is as far removed from them as the first group .

“ Huge flaws are apparent in all religions “
Like what exactly , and all religions ?
Do you even know anything about the others like Buddhism , Hinduism , Shintoism and Zoroastrianism ?
Considering that India has the smallest prison population , I ’d say Hinduism has a pretty good effect .
It ’s funny because you Athiests are no different from the fundamentalists , in that : you take whatever scripture says absolutely literally and ignoring that they have been lost in translation and edited by corrupt people and the real meanings have been lost and yet to be found by scholars and archeologists , act like self - righteous jerkwads , lot ’s of hypocrisy , act like there is only one religion etc , the scumbag Athiest meme sums this all up .
Encyclopedia Dramatica
Posted by Jmariofan7 on 2018-08-20 21:34:57 Quote from ED : “ They mock religion because they dont have anything to say .
They claim to be for progress and free thinking but only talk about suppressing those who disagree with them .
They are the atheists , long - dormant cancer to society in the bloom ..
Atheism is a fad cult whose followers worship Richard Dawkins instead of God .
It is most notably the only religion that is self - deluded enough to claim to be backed up by science .
Its followers are even more ignorant , dogmatic , and fanatical about their chosen spiritual path than they claim Muslims , Christians , Hindoos or Jews to be .
They use science as their excuse for said dogmatism , and , unfortunately , some of them truly believe their own bullshit in this regard .
Ironically , atheism is the most fundamentalist religion known to man .
Atheists are hypocritical enough to think that killing 5 billion theists equates to world peace , or , more precisely that as long as people dont agree with them humans still possess the ability to hurt each other .
However , there is a key difference .
People who convert to Islam or Christianity do so because they want to have a more fulfilling life , or because they had a genuine religious experience .
People who become atheists do so because they got picked on in high school .
Rummage through an atheists emotional baggage and you will find a pile of leftover teenage angst , a few cases of repressed rage at mommy and daddy , and an overpowering urge to feel superior wrapped around a stupendous amount of self - loathing .
Ultimately the " atheist movement " is just another Internet fad , mostly made up of attention whores , sycophants , stupid arrogant twats , bigots , assholes , and demagogues . ”

Collapsing your own argument

“ I fail to understand how it is close minded to not believe in something when the only evidence for it is an ancient book that we are told was inspired by God .
To make matters worse it is a book that has hundreds of different versions because many of the words that were originally written do not have a direct translation nowadays .
The results are that whoever decides to translate the text makes up their own words to fit their own beliefs . ”
You just answered your own question , scholars and archeologists have yet to find the true meaning some goes for the other scriptures like the Torah and the Quran and many others , and all those obnoxious pure Athiests do is take whatever mistranslated and edited text completely literally just like the fundamentalists do , and the fact that they do n’t see the irony in this is really grating .
This quote and also this link to this other page brings up a pretty great idea on what the scriptures of the bible really mean : “ Genesis 1:16 , which reads : " God made two great lights -- the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night .
He also made the stars . "
Is misunderstood by BOTH Christians AND atheists .
The verse is referring to the solid fact that the universe is composed of positive and negative energy .
Sadly most people both Christian and non Christian have no understanding of this solid fact .
Paul Dirac and Erwin Shroedinger both independently discovered , as did others such as Viktor Schauberger , that there is a sea of negative energy electrons that is invisible to our devices which are designed to push around positive energy electrons .
This negative energy sea can be tapped for anti gravity , endless free overunity energy , and more .
God was showing us this in that Genesis verse .
The " night side light " has nothing to do with the Moon .
Its the negative matter / negative / dark matter / dark energy sea which fills the universe :
The quantum vacuum negative energy .
I propose that both Christians and Atheists put aside your differences and help us mass produce machines and devices that tap into this " night side energy " .
PS
The " Dark " and " Negative " does NOT mean evil .
It means opposite to positive or poorly understood .
The word " occult " in and of itself is not bad :
It simply means secret .

I was glued to the set when this first aired .
I 'd never seen Jon Stewart like this , and developed a whole new appreciation of him .
After his evisceration of Cramer , my appreciation grew ( I did n't think that was even possible ) .
Stewart not just some well - informed , hilarious comic .
He 's a top notch , independent - minded , tough interviewer .
Tucker Carlson , Jim Cramer ...
Who 's next ?
A flashback to October 15 , 2004 , the day that Jon Stewart destroyed Crossfire .
A few years ago , after spending a lot of time thinking about peak oil , and then watching the price of oil break out of its historical trading range and head higher , the idea of Peak Lite came to me .
Over time the price of oil had bounced between $ 10 and $ 30 a barrel , but about 5 years ago it broke from that pattern and started the steady climb that culminated in $ 147 / bbl last summer .
I had been having various debates about whether we were or were n't at the global peak in oil production ( I was taking the ' not yet but soon ' position ) , but it started to become clear to me that we did n't require a global peak before we started to feel the impact of peak oil .
I proposed the following to explain what I thought was happening .
( Do n't get too fixated on the dates or prices as they are just there to illustrate the concept ) .
Figure 1 shows the sort of price behavior if spare oil production capacity is constant .
Of course spare production fluctuates up and down , as does price , but my thesis is that constant excess capacity should keep the price relatively stable - as long as the excess is large enough that several different producers have the ability to step up and fill shortfalls .
This concept is illustrated by Figure 1 , with a constant four million barrels per day ( bpd ) of excess capacity and an oil price of $ 25/bbl .
Figure 1 . Simulated Oil Price Behavior at Constant Spare Capacity
Figure 2 . Simulated Oil Price Behavior at Eroding Spare Capacity
Figure 2 illustrates the case in which demand growth is outstripping supply growth , leading to diminishing spare capacity .
This is the mode that we have been in for the past few years .
Spare capacity was eroded by several million barrels during the first half of this decade , and as a result the price of oil climbed higher , and became increasingly volatile .
This was caused by a combination of stronger demand worldwide , and an oil industry that had not anticipated such strong demand growth .
As a result , the global oil industry did n't invest aggressively enough to meet demand , and while capacity did grow , it did n't grow quickly enough to keep prices stable .
Figure 3 . The Next Five Years ?
Figure 3 illustrates a future in which world demand has collided with world supply , and then demand growth continues to stay ahead of supply growth .
In the world of peak oil , this happens because supply is falling .
In the peak lite world , it can occur even if supply is increasing .
In the figure , I show an example of supply and demand colliding in 2010 , then demand exceeding supply in future years .
Of course demand as defined in Economics 101 wo n't actually exceed supply , demand will just be destroyed by rising prices ( as shown on the right axis ) to keep it in equilibrium with supply .
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate what Peak Lite is all about ; that you do n't have to have falling supplies to start experiencing the effects of peak oil .
I created the original figures in mid-2007 , and as we know by mid-2008 oil prices had risen much higher than the $ 95 / bbl I illustrated on the figure .
But circumstances have changed .
As a result of climbing oil prices , new projects have begun to come online .
Strong price signals from the previous five years had resulted in major investments into new oil production ( but it takes a few years to bring new projects online ) ; about 5 million bpd of new capacity was expected to come online in 2008 alone .
At the same time , oil prices climbed much too quickly for the economy to even begin to adjust , and this contributed to the overall economic collapse .
The combination of high prices and the economic troubles have taken a bite out of demand ( at least temporarily ) .
So we essentially find ourselves back in the position of having perhaps three or four million barrels of excess capacity around the world , and oil prices back in the $ 40's .
Thus I think Figure 4 explains where we are now - and where I think we are headed .
Figure 4 . When Do Prices Bounce Back ?
In Figure 4 , the year 2007 shows a world in which oil is at $ 80 and the demand has nearly caught up with supply .
2008 shows an example of no spare capacity , and the oil price sharply higher .
Then 2009 shows the situation with reduced demand , some incremental capacity increase over 2008 ( new projects scheduled to come online in 2009 will generally be too far along to cancel ) , and the corresponding price collapse arising from the largest spare capacity situation in several years .
So , where do we go from here ?
I think it depends on how quickly demand bounces back .
The Next Five Years
What might the next five years look like ?
Do we revert back to Figure 1 , in which we see steady prices for years ( except this time in the $ 40 region ) ?
Or do we return to the eroding capacity case of Figures 2 and 3 ?
I have reason to believe the latter is the case .
One reason for this is that the oil industry needs higher prices to warrant new projects .
Sig Cornelius , the Chief Financial Officer of ConocoPhillips , recently stated that oil needs to average $ 52 / bbl in order for the company to break even .
The cost of finding and developing oil has gone up , and recently Eni CEO Paolo Scaroni said that oil prices would need to be $ 60 to keep up the needed investments .
As a result of low oil prices , drilling rigs are being underutilized and projects are being canceled :
The International Energy Agency estimates that about $ 100 billion of worldwide oil production capacity expansion projects have been cancelled or postponed over the past half year .
According to Barclays Capital , oil companies have cut worldwide exploration and production spending by 18 percent so far this year .
Deutsche Bank estimates that U.S. energy exploration - and - production spending will drop $ 22.5 billion this year , a 40 - percent , year - on - year decline .
Saudi Arabia has cancelled the development of several fields such as the Manifa and Dammam oil field , which would have added about 1 million barrels per day ( MMBpd ) of capacity .
Refinery projects have also been delayed or cancelled while Saudi Aramco reviews cost estimates in the light of the significant weakening of oil prices .
Saudi Aramco will consider re-issuing a tender for Manifa 's development at a later date , assuming bids from contractors reflect a reduction in raw materials to match lower oil prices .
Such cancellations come at a price , which the article summarizes :
New oil - and - gas projects usually take several years of development before starting commercial production .
According to Cambridge Energy Research Associates , the scaleback in exploration and production could reduce future global oil supplies by up to 7.6 MMBpd in five years , or 9 percent of current production .
If demand suddenly comes back as it did in 2003 - 2004 , there could be a resulting shortfall of production and much higher energy prices .
The International Energy Agency ( IEA ) also warns that the credit crisis and project cancellations will lead to no spare crude oil capacity by 2013 .
The longer oil prices stay low , the worse the shortfall will be due to the project cancellations and increasing demand .
Incidentally , these factors also explain a big part of why the oil industry is historically cyclical ; in the good times producers spend money , and then when supply gets ahead of demand and the price falls , they slow down on investing .
This eventually leads to tightness again , so the good times return .
The steepness of the World Oil Price curve in Figure 4 could be much steeper if demand recovers sooner rather than later .
The prospect of sharply higher taxes on the oil industry is a second factor that threatens to slow the development of new oil projects .
A recent study by the American Petroleum Institute concluded that this number is " at least " $ 400 billion over the next 10 years .
That seemed quite high to me , so I wrote to the API for a breakdown .
Jane van Ryan , Senior Manager of Communications at the API , responded :
The figure is , according to our tax experts , “ at least $ 400 billion ” and could be significantly higher .
Using EIA numbers , our tax analysts have examined the impact on the industry of the administration ’s cap - and - trade proposal using five scenarios .
The results indicate that about 60 percent of the administration ’s proposal , which would raise $ 645.7 billion in “ climate revenues , ” would be funded by the oil and natural gas industry .
This means the industry would pay about $ 400 - 450 billion .
We have opted to use the lower figure .
The industry ’s share of business - wide tax provisions as well as new taxes on the industry are estimated at $ 80 - 90 billion over ten years .
Again , we have opted to use the lower figure .
These tax provisions include the reinstatement of the Superfund Tax , the repeal of the LIFO provision , internal enforcement / reform deferral / related tax reform policies , an excise tax levy on federal offshore leases in the Gulf of Mexico , the repeal of the enhanced oil recovery credit , the repeal of the marginal well tax credit , the repeal of the expensing of intangible drilling costs , the repeal of the deduction for tertiary injectants , the repeal of the passive loss exception for working interests , the repeal of Sec. 199 for oil and natural companies , the increase of the G&G amortization period for independent producers to 7 years , and the repeal of the percentage depletion for oil and natural gas .
While I wo n't get into all of the pros and cons of new taxes , higher taxes will provide a disincentive for projects which are projected to have a marginal financial return .
If this further contributes to underinvestment , it will worsen the overall tightness in the oil markets , which will put more upward pressure on prices .
Thus , high oil prices will likely again be a campaign issue in the 2012 presidential elections .
Conclusions
While the oil industry is historically cyclical , I believe we are approaching the point at which the industry will no longer be able to build out enough new projects to stay ahead of demand .
This could manifest itself as peak oil , in which case the rate of depletion permanently overtakes the rate at which new production comes online .
Or it could first manifest as peak lite , in which case new production still stays somewhat ahead of depletion , but can't keep up with new demand .
In either of these situations , I think the historical cyclicality of the oil industry will disappear .
In early 2008 I thought we had reached that point , but it appears that we had at least one more cycle ahead .
While it is too early to tell with a high level of confidence just where we are on the depletion curve , the summer of 2008 provided of taste of life in an oil - constrained world .
The current level of underinvestment and the prospect of higher taxes are setting up another situation in which spare capacity erodes , leading to higher oil prices and greater volatility .
Add to this the prospect of a global oil production peak , and I have trouble seeing a case where oil prices will remain stable in the coming years .
As an investor , I use blue chip oil stocks as a defensive measure against much higher prices .
I am not one who subscribes to the idea that oil companies are going to be put out of business by running out of oil , or by ethanol , algal biodiesel , or any other combination of alternative fuel technologies .
In fact , I strongly believe that if an alternative technology begins to look attractive enough , oil companies have deep enough pockets to shift their business in that direction .
But I think that 's unlikely to happen any time soon .
As a consumer , it would probably pay to evaluate just how much higher prices might impact your budget - and then take action .
Can you sustain oil prices that return to $ 150 / bbl or more ?
Even if you can , do you want that uncertainty hanging over your budget ?
If not , then it would be prudent to take steps to minimize the personal impact of high oil prices .
Steps to consider include utilizing more fuel efficient transportation , public transportation , ride - sharing , and if possible locating closer to your place of employment .
Plan ahead and do n't get caught off - guard like so many did last summer .
It is only a matter of time before history repeats itself .
Here 's hoping our political leaders make policy decisions that wo n't worsen the impact .

This is America Happening – It Sure Is [ PIC ]
In this image from NASA TV , the international space station begins the process of opening new solar wings while orbiting Earth , Friday , March 20 , 2009 .
( AP Photo / NASA TV )
( AP ) -- Astronauts successfully unfurled the newly installed solar wings at the international space station Friday , a nerve - racking procedure that went exceedingly well and brought the orbiting outpost to full power .
To NASA 's relief , both wings went out smoothly , one at a time .
Nothing hung up , and none of the panels stuck together like they had on previous panels .
The wings stretched more than 240 feet , a glistening golden hue in the sunlight and a dazzling sight for the astronauts and everyone else involved .
" It 's just really amazing , " said Mike Fincke , the space station 's skipper .
He said there was " a shout of triumph " aboard the linked station - shuttle complex once the two wings were fully extended .
The work was a highlight of shuttle Discovery 's mission .
Completed 220 miles above Earth , the new panels are the final pair of electricity - generating wings and should boost the amount of science research at the orbiting outpost .
" Great work , guys , " Mission Control told the astronauts .
" We 've got a whole bunch of happy people down here , "
The long , deliberate procedure began the morning after this last set of solar wings was hooked up to the orbiting complex .
Right on cue , astronaut John Phillips pushed the button that commanded the first wing to start unfurling .
It slowly stretched out like a folded - up map .
When the wing was halfway open , Phillips stopped the motion for nearly an hour so the panels could soak up sunlight and be less likely to stick .
The second wing , which had been boxed up for years , opened just as easily .
A slight crinkle was spotted near the bottom , but flattened when the wing was stretched out .
Most if not all the astronauts watched the wings unfold , peering out windows and through camera lenses , ready to hit the " abort " button in case of trouble .
Flight controllers as well as managers anxiously monitored everything , given the past problems .
The last time a solar wing was unfurled in 2007 , it caught on a guide wire and ripped .
Emergency spacewalking repairs were needed to fix it .
" We learned from that and made it very smoothly , " Fincke said .
After 10 years of assembly , the space station now has eight full wings .
Altogether , the wings will be capable of generating enough electrical power for about 42 large houses , according to NASA .
On Thursday , a pair of spacewalking astronauts hooked up the $ 300 million framework that holds the wings .
This last major American - made addition increased the mass of the space station to 670,000 pounds ; it is now 81 percent complete .
Construction is scheduled to wrap up next year with the retirement of NASA 's shuttles .
Discovery is due to leave the space station Wednesday .
Its landing , though , may be moved up a day to preserve science samples being returned from the station .
Right now , touchdown is scheduled for March 28 .

January 21 , 2009 – 6:14 am by John
Partly because I like quotations so much and partly because I have n’t perused many blags recently , my favorite blag post of the last several days was this one by Michael Rozeff .
He compares the unifying , nationalistic theme of Obama ’s four - year presidential campaign to the ideas and slogans of the Nazis .
People keep talking about one America .
Having searched on this , I find it has been an Obama theme since 2004 at least .
In one speech he says : “ With the challenges and crises we face right now , we cannot afford to divide this country by race or class or region ; by who we are or what policies we support .
There are no real or fake parts of this country .
We are not separated by the pro-America and anti-America parts of this nation — we all love this country , no matter where we live or where we come from . ”
How close can he come to the Nazi slogan ?
One people , one empire , one leader .
Awfully , awfully close .
Can we not divide ourselves by “ policies we support ? ”
He does n’t want that ?
What kind of totalitarian sloganeering is that ? …
With the challenges we face , it is exactly divisions that we need .
We need to challenge bad ideas with good ideas .
We need to confront evils .
We do not need conformity to the wishes of ein fuhrer .
We exactly need to challenge such ideas as Obama is expressing .
Well , there are ( at least ) two problems with comparing the relatively young Obama ’s speeches with the writings and speeches of Adolf Hitler .
First is that Obama — as is admitted by many of his supporters on the left — is notoriously non-specific and metaphorical in his speeches , whereas Hitler , at least in Mein Kampf and some of his speeches , was much more specific .
Second is some of the stuff Hitler was most specific about : racial purity , the specifics of his fascist socialism , his role as the autocratic leader of all , and Germany ’s right to conquer Europe to expand its lebensraum ( I do n’t know how specific he really was about this last , but my impression is that he openly asserted it as Germany ’s duty and its right , at least during the war ) .
Either way , I think a lot of ideas in Obama ’s inauguration speech are rightly seen as nationalistic and not at all individualistic , and so you can compare these to Hitler or any other nationalist leader you please .
( Probably George W. Bush , for all I know . )
One recurring theme throughout Obama ’s inauguration speech was the role of the military in Protecting Our Freedoms ™ .
Now , this is one of the most nationalistic ideas out there .
In almost every case throughout history and especially in the United States , the military is used for purposes that decrease individual economic and social freedom .
The military serves the desires of the government , not the people , and the desires of the government are in direct conflict with the desires of the people ; if they were n’t , why would the government have to exist and operate by coercion and extortion with literally every action it takes and every function it performs ?
Caveat : I think this could be done with a lot of inaugural addresses and other speeches by a lot of presidents , but if any one of them was truly a great man with great ideas about economic freedom and individualism , he would have stressed these subjects above all else , especially at a time like this when so much government meddling into economic matters has impoverished so many and its meddling into the affairs of other nations has killed so many and endangered so many more .
But , after all , the megalomaniacal criminals who have held the office of President and the people who voted them in believe that those men should be the leaders of the nation , and furthermore they believe that the nation voted them in .
Some of the more apropos writings and sayings of Hitler that I found :
“ The broad masses of a population are more amenable to the appeal of rhetoric than to any other force . ”
[ Does that apply to anyone alive today more than it does to Barack Obama ? ]
“ We do n’t say to the rich ‘ Give to the poor , ’ we say , ‘ German people , help each other . ’
Rich or poor , each one must help thinking , there ’s someone even poorer than I am , and I want to help them as a fellow countryman . ”
“ So we have come together on this day to prove symbolically that we are more than a collection of individuals striving one against another , that none of us is too proud , none of us too high , none is too rich , and none too poor , to stand together before the face of the Lord and of the world in this indissoluble , sworn community .
And this united nation , we have need of it . ”
These are all from Obama ’s inauguration speech :
On this day , we gather because we have chosen hope over fear , unity of purpose over conflict and discord .
[…]
In reaffirming the greatness of our nation , we understand that greatness is never a given .
It must be earned .
[…]
They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions ; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction .
[…]
Now , there are some who question the scale of our ambitions , who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans .
Their memories are short , for they have forgotten what this country has already done , what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage .
[…]
The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product , but on the reach of our prosperity ; on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart — not out of charity , but because it is the surest route to our common good .
[…]
We honor them [ military servicemen ] not only because they are guardians of our liberty , but because they embody the spirit of service : a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves .
[…]
… those values upon which our success depends , honesty and hard work , courage and fair play , tolerance and curiosity , loyalty and patriotism .
[…]
What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility — a recognition , on the part of every American , that we have duties to ourselves , our nation and the world , duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly … .
Lastly , in all fairness , I really liked this line from the Savior ’s inauguration speech :
Rather , it has been the risk - takers , the doers , the makers of things — some celebrated , but more often men and women obscure in their labor — who have carried us up the long , rugged path towards prosperity and freedom .
The overriding theme of all of Obama ’s speeches ( to the extent , admittedly minimal , that I ’ve paid attention to them ) has been along the lines of ein Volk , ein Reich , without the ein Führer part .
As unilateral as the power of the President of the United States is by nature and as megalomaniacal as its holder must necessarily be , I ca n’t recall any particularly autocratic rhetoric from Barack Obama .
It is usually more “ we ” than “ I ” .
He sees himself as the leader of America , for sure , but not as autocratically or as deserving of worship as dictators of the past ( or present ) .
( That does n’t mean he does n’t receive it . )
Comparing speeches from different times is almost pointless ; indeed , even using a 21st - century American politician ’s speeches as predictors of what he will actually do is n’t such a high - probability venture .
What is more important is the degree and type of national socialism the Obama administration will inflict upon its subjects .
I predict that he will tend to mean what he says and that he will give us a ghastly mix of Keynesian New Deal–type socialism and more modern corporate - State socialism , in addition to a general continuation of neoconservative foreign policy and police - state measures , all under the guise of civic duty , religious destiny , national unity , national greatness , national security , national everything and individual nothing .

Google likes to tout the advantages of self - regulation and the free market when its dominance in search and advertising is called into question , but the Web giant does n't seem to mind letting the government intervene in the browser market .
In an announcement posted today at Google 's official public policy blog , Google VP of product management Sundar Pichai says that the company will be participating as a third - party in the European Commission 's ( EC ) ongoing investigation of Internet Explorer .
Opera filed a complaint with the European Commission in 2007 alleging that Microsoft has undermined competition in the browser market by providing its own Internet Explorer Web browser in the dominant Windows operating system .
Opera says that its browser never gained mainstream traction because of Microsoft 's bundling tactics .
The EC concurred with Opera in a statement that it issued in January which accused Microsoft of damaging browser innovation .
In a follow - up statement that was issued this week , the EC says that Microsoft will face hefty fines and could be forced to provide other browser options in Windows that the user can select when installing Windows or ordering computers .
Mozilla announced earlier this month that it would be participating in the investigation and offering its assistance to the EC .
Mozilla chairperson Mitchell Baker argued that the success of Firefox does not constitute productive competition and that the lack of successful commercial browser offerings reflects an unhealthy market ecosystem .
Google is now applying with the EC to participate in the proceeding in the same capacity as Mozilla .
Pichai argues that the browser market today is still highly uncompetitive and that the advancement of emerging Web technologies could be significantly accelerated by imposing some constraints on Microsoft 's bundling .
He acknowledges , however , that finding an effective remedy will be difficult and that the process comes with risks .
" Google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive , which holds back innovation for users .
This is because Internet Explorer is tied to Microsoft 's dominant computer operating system , giving it an unfair advantage over other browsers , " he wrote in the blog entry .
" We learned a lot from launching our own Google Chrome browser last year and are hoping that Google 's perspective will be useful as the European Commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices .
Of course creating a remedy that helps solve one problem without creating other unintended consequences is n't easy — but the more voices there are in the conversation the greater the chances of success . "
Although the numerous deficiencies of Internet Explorer are well documented and Microsoft 's historical resistance to compliance with open standards has created many challenges for Web developers , the browser market today is highly competitive and richly innovative .
Mozilla has achieved significant traction in Europe and already has nearly half of the browser market in several countries .
It 's also highly questionable whether bundling is still a truly relevant factor .
Indeed , the fact that Google 's brand new Chrome browser has already exceeded the marketshare of Opera seems to demonstrate that Opera 's woes are n't entirely Microsoft 's fault .
In a recent interview with PC Pro , Mozilla 's Mike Conner , one of the chief Firefox engineers , argued that Opera 's claims that bundling harms competition are " provably false " and suggested that Opera 's desktop browser is unpopular because it is too complex and distracting .
The EC has a poor track record with respect to Microsoft unbundling remedies .
When the government body forced Microsoft to produce a version of Windows XP without Windows Media player , it was universally shunned and OEMs largely refused to ship it on hardware .
The EC appears to be heading in a different direction this time , but it 's unclear if it will have any impact on browser choice in the European market , where Firefox has already gained mainstream acceptance .

Some of this post arguments are inspired by the great talk by Guy Steele : Growing a Language .
So I was checking out the new JavaScript spec. ( ECMAScript 4 ) lately , and I was very surprised ( and disappointed ) to see that Operator Overloading was n't even accepted as a proposal for ECMAScript 4 .
I 've noticed last year that the proposal was denied by all browser vendors , as you can see in the ECMAScript 4 progress spreadsheet created by John Resig , under the name of " Operator Overloading " .
This is heartbreaking for me ... let me explain you why .
Operator Overloading is a special case of polymorphism , in which operators like + , / , * , ... can be overloaded by the user .
This is very useful in languages where the user can define special types ( or classes ) , since it allows the developer to use notation that is closer to the target domain , and allows user types to look like types built into the language .
What Guy Steele said about Operator Overloading is that : " If we grow the language in these few ways , then we will not need to grow it in a hundred other ways ; the users can take on the rest of the task . "
To see why , think about these structures :
One thing all these structures have in common is that their sum and product operations have a different definition than the one we give to integers .
There 's also an interesting fact about these structures : a lot of people use them , but a lot of people do n't .
For example , Matrices might be used by OpenGL / Direct3D developers , but it 's not very common to use this structure for manipulating the DOM or building AJAX applications .
However , each of these structures must be considered in any programming language .
Adding them all into some standard library might be too much .
However , sooner or later , some developer will want to use them .
Here 's the dilemma as exposed by Guy Steele : " I might saytoof these , but it is clear that I must saytoof them ! " .
Operator Overloading solves this problem by giving the user the power to overload built - in operations and turn a non-domain specific language into a perfect tool for a developer 's specific needs .
By using Operator Overloading a developer can define operations on any custom type and its use will blend perfectly well into the language .
Would n't be just beatifull if a and b beeing Complex Numbers , we could do this : instead of this ?
: Ok , so now that I made my point about the power of operator overloading , let me explain you why I think this should be more carefully considered by the new JavaScript spec .
To see why we should take seriously Operator Overloading in JavaScript , we first have to take a look at what happened to JavaScript in the last few years .
Only one thing happened to JavaScript in the last few years , AJAX .
The XMLHTTPRequest concept was first created by Microsoft , and was n't part of the web standards .
They first used it in the year 2000 , but a couple of years later Mozilla , Safari and Opera were also implementing it .
The standards covered that topic a lot of time after it was already implemented in all major browsers , and AJAX was already in the wild .
One strong aspect of JavaScript that was pretty important and that , IMHO , made the adoption of the " AJAX paradigm " a lot easier , is that JavaScript was already compliant with the " event - driven " programming paradigm , and the use of the XMLHTTPRequest object did n't add anything new to this paradigm .
Just as callbacks were added to respond to DOM Element 's events , callbacks were used to handle server side answers .
Although AJAX changed the way web applications were created , it did that by mantaining the event - driven programming paradigm .
Oh , another thing happened to JavaScript in the last couple of years , is following the same trend the XMLHTTPRequest object followed .
It has been adopted by most browsers ( Opera , Gecko , Webkit ) and despite Internet Explorer 's efforts to not adopt this new feature , libraries already exist to make Canvas compatible with IE ( to a certain point ) .
A couple of nice libraries that used Canvas were released last year : John Resig published Processing JS .
Some other libraries that make use of canvas were also released , one of them is the JavaScript InfoVis Toolkit ( my library ! :) ) .
The number of Canvas related stories really grew at Ajaxian , and there were also new breakthroughs by Opera and Firefox on the implementation of Canvas 3D .
There is one caveat to this Canvas thing though , it does n't use extensively the event - driven paradigm .
Since all these Canvas implementations are related to Cairo and also take things from OpenGL and Direct3D ( this is notably the case for the Canvas ' 3D API ) , IMO these concepts are more related to a functional programming paradigm than anything else .
I mean , 2D / 3D graphics are all about geometrical operations .
And geometrical operations are mathematical functions .
These concepts might be harder to grasp than the " " AJAX paradigm " " , and that 's why the adoption curve wo n't be as high as the AJAX one , but there 's no doubt that Canvas developers are a niche .
And do you know which objects / types / classes are related to geometrical computation , Canvas , Canvas 3D , Cairo , OpenGL and Direct3D ?
That 's exactly what I mean .
The next logical step to bring a easier use for Canvas related programming should be operator overloading .
This is the one feature that will be extensively used by JavaScript Canvas developers , since they have to deal with points , 2D and 3D coordinates all day .
For a last example , consider an interpolation function between two complex numbers
The same thing with operator overloading would be :
You would make a developer 's life happier .
Performance Impact of CSS Selectors
A few months back there were some posts about the performance impact of inefficient CSS selectors .
I was intrigued – this is the kind of browser idiosyncratic behavior that I live for .
On further investigation , I ’m not so sure that it ’s worth the time to make CSS selectors more efficient .
I ’ll go even farther and say I do n’t think anyone would notice if we woke up tomorrow and every web page ’s CSS selectors were magically optimized .
The first post that caught my eye was about CSS Qualified Selectors by Shaun Inman .
This post was n’t actually about CSS performance , but in one of the comments David Hyatt ( architect for Safari and WebKit , also worked on Mozilla , Camino , and Firefox ) dropped this bomb :
The sad truth about CSS3 selectors is that they really should n’t be used at all if you care about page performance .
Decorating your markup with classes and ids and matching purely on those while avoiding all uses of sibling , descendant and child selectors will actually make a page perform significantly better in all browsers .
Wow .
Let me say that again .
Wow .
The next posts were amazing .
It was a series on Testing CSS Performance from Jon Sykes in three parts : part 1 , part 2 , and part 3 .
It ’s fun to see how his tests evolve , so part 3 is really the one to read .
This had me convinced that optimizing CSS selectors was a key step to fast pages .
But there were two things about the tests that troubled me .
First , the large number of DOM elements and rules worried me .
The pages contain 60,000 DOM elements and 20,000 CSS rules .
This is an order of magnitude more than most pages .
Pages this large make browsers behave in unusual ways ( we ’ll get back to that later ) .
The table below has some stats from the top ten U.S. web sites for comparison .
Web Site # CSS Rules
# DOM Elements
AOL 2289 1628 eBay 305 588 Facebook 2882 1966 Google 92 552 Live Search 376 449 MSN 1038 886 MySpace 932 444 Wikipedia 795 1333 Yahoo!
800 564 YouTube 821 817 average 1033 923
The second thing that concerned me was how small the baseline test page was , compared to the more complex pages .
The main question I want to answer is “ do inefficient CSS selectors slow down pages ? ”
All five test pages contain 20,000 anchor elements ( nested inside P , DIV , DIV , DIV ) .
What changes is their CSS : baseline ( no CSS ) , tag selector ( one rule for the A tag ) , 20,000 class selectors , 20,000 child selectors , and finally 20,000 descendant selectors .
The last three pages top out at over 3 megabytes in size .
But the baseline page and tag selector page , with little or no CSS , are only 1.8 megabytes .
These pages answer the question “ how much faster would my page be if I eliminated all CSS ? ”
But not many of us are going to eliminate all CSS from our pages .
I revised the test as follows :
2000 anchors and 2000 rules ( instead of 20,000 ) – this actually results in ~6000 DOM elements because of all the nesting in P , DIV , DIV , DIV
the baseline page and tag selector page have 2000 rules just like all the other pages , but these are simple class rules that do n’t match any classes in the page
I ran these tests on 12 browsers .
Page render time was measured with a script block at the top and bottom of the page .
( I loaded the page from local disk to avoid possible impact from chunked encoding . )
The results are shown in the chart below .
( I do n’t show Opera 9.63 – it was way too slow – but you can download all the data as csv .
You can also see the test pages . )
Performance varies across browsers ; strangely , two new browsers , IE 8 and Firefox 3.1 , are the slowest but comparisons should not be made from one browser to another .
Although all the tests for a given browser were conducted on a single PC , different browsers might have been tested on different PCs with different performance characteristics .
The goal of this experiment is not to compare browser performance – it ’s to see how browsers handle progressively more complex CSS selectors .
[ Revision :
On further inspection comparing Firefox 3.0 and 3.1 , I discovered that the test PC I used for testing Firefox 3.1 and IE 8 was slower than the other test PCs used in this experiment .
I subsequently re-ran those tests as well as Firefox 3.0 and IE 7 on PCs that were more consistent and updated the chart above .
Even with this re-run , because of possible differences in test hardware , do not use this data to compare one browser to another . ]
Not surprisingly , the more complex pages ( child selectors and descendant selectors ) usually perform the worst .
The biggest surprise is how small the delta is from the baseline to the most complex , worst performing test page .
The average slowdown across all browsers is 50 ms , and if we look at the big ones ( IE 6&7 , FF3 ) , the average delta is just 20 ms .
For 70 % or more of today ’s users , improving these CSS selectors would only make a 20 ms improvement .
Keep in mind – these test pages are close to worst case .
The 2000 anchors wrapped in P , DIV , DIV , DIV result in 6000 DOM elements – that ’s twice as big as the max in the top ten sites .
And the complex pages have 2000 extremely inefficient rules – a typical site has around one third of their rules that are complex child or descendant selectors .
Facebook , for example , with the maximum number of rules at 2882 only has 750 that are these extremely inefficient rules .
Why do the results from my tests suggest something different from what ’s been said lately ?
One difference comes from looking at things at such a large scale .
It ’s okay to exaggerate test cases if the results are proportional to common use cases .
But in this case , browsers behave differently when confronted with a 3 megabyte page with 60,000 elements and 20,000 rules .
I especially noticed that my results were much different for IE 6&7 .
I wondered if there was a hockey stick in how IE handled CSS selectors .
To investigate this I loaded the child selector and descendant selector pages with increasing number of anchors and rules , from 1000 to 20,000 .
The results , shown in the chart below , reveal that IE hits a cliff around 18,000 rules .
But when IE 6&7 work on a page that is closer to reality , as in my tests , they ’re actually the fastest performers .
Based on these tests I have the following hypothesis :
For most web sites , the possible performance gains from optimizing CSS selectors will be small , and are not worth the costs .
There are some types of CSS rules and interactions with JavaScript that can make a page noticeably slower .
This is where the focus should be .
So I ’m starting to collect real world examples of small CSS style - related issues ( offsetWidth , : hover ) that put the hurt on performance .
If you have some , send them my way .
I ’m speaking at SXSW this weekend .
If you ’re there , and want to discuss CSS selectors , please find me .
It ’s important that we ’re all focusing on the performance improvements that our users will really notice .
Make Your BlackBerry Double as a Modem With Barry
by Ostatic Staff - Jan. 05 , 2009

Although I suppose , technically speaking , everyone at OStatic should use the G1 smartphone with its open source platform , some of us really love our BlackBerrys .
You already know Kristin uses Funambol to sync contacts and calenders with the desktop , but tethering the BlackBerry to a laptop takes an entirely different approach .
Barry , created by open source software vendor Net Direct , lets you not only sync your contacts and calendar but also use your smartphone as a computer modem .
Sure , it 's not as fast as T1 or cable , but you can't beat it if you 're stuck somewhere with no Internet access .
Currently , there are packages available for Ubuntu , Debian , Mandriva , and Fedora ( although syncing is not supported on Fedora 9 ) .
Most older BlackBerrys work just fine with Barry , but the newest generation of devices -- the Storm and Bold -- are not yet fully supported .
According to Net Direct 's
Web site , you 'll need three things to get your phone up and running as a modem : a Barry install , a working pppd and matching kernel , and an options file and chat script for your Blackberry provider .
The apps binary packages already include chat scripts for many popular service providers including Sprint , T - Mobile , Verizon , and O2 Ireland .
In addition to tethering your BlackBerry to a laptop , you can also use Barry to make data backups , export your address book , retrieve email and memos , and perform full restores in the event of data loss .
According to a recent review of Barry , you can even use it to charge the phone 's battery via the USB port on your computer .
Reviewer Adam Williamson writes , " It should also be noted that another special piece of software , also provided by Barry , is needed for your Blackberry ’s battery to be charged when plugged in to a Linux computer .
This is because the standard default current for USB devices is 100 mA , but Blackberries require 500 mA of current to charge .
Barry provides a utility named bcharge that handles this .
When installed correctly , it will kick in automatically when the Blackberry is connected . "
Clearly , a lot of work has gone into making Barry a robust app for BlackBerry users who also rely on Linux .
The developers have a roadmap outlining where they plan to take the project in the future , so if you want to jump in and help , they 're looking for C++ and python programmers , documentation writers , and BlackBerry users who can help identify bugs .
Talking to Gamasutra as part of an in - depth interview to be published in the near future , GameStop SVP of merchandising Bob McKenzie has been discussing prospects for , suggesting that the " added material " in the game elevates it above being anotheriteration .
The title , to be released this September for Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , and Wii , is a collaboration betweencreators Harmonix and Beatles rights owners Apple Corps .
Though there are relatively few specifics , George Harrison 's son Dhani recently revealed that the game will include material " that has never been heard , never been released .
"
The title will cost $ 60 for the game - only version , even for the Wii SKU ( traditionally $ 50 ) , and up to $ 250 for a limited - edition instrument bundle .
When GameStop 's McKenzie was asked about the title and Wii price point in particular , he noted : " It 's gonna be interesting , but again seeing the demo of that product -- I 'm not a huge Beatles fan , but after I saw the demo and the Harmonix band got up there and they did that for us , I was ready to go out pre-order the $ 250 SKU .
" McKenzie , whose firm will be one of the largest retailers of the title , suggestedis beyond even some of the other band - specific music titles released recently :
" It 's just got that much value to it , and I think it 's entertaining because it 's not just another guitar product or another version of ; it 's actually got some of the cutscenes and some of the added material from the band and from that era .
" The GameStop exec concluded by noting : " That kind of adds the value when you 're looking at , say , the $ 60 or even stepping up to a $ 250 product for the complete kit .
I think they got the right combination of putting a quality product together with some added value -- additional content -- and really making that compelling for the consumer .
"
The full interview with GameStop 's McKenzie , including more on the pre-eminent specialty game retailer 's trends , will run in the near future on Gamasutra .
The government and the courts are collabarating in shaving away freedoms and pushing Britain to the brink of becoming a " database " police state , a series of sold - out conferences across the UK heard today .
In a day of speeches and discussions , academics , politicians , lawyers , writers , journalists and pop stars joined civil liberty campaigners to issue a call to arms for Britons to defend their democratic rights .
More than 1,500 people attended the Convention on Modern Liberty in Bloomsbury , central London , which was linked by video to parallel events in Glasgow , Belfast , Bristol , Manchester , Cardiff and Cambridge .
They heard from more than 80 speakers , including the author Philip Pullman , musicians Brian Eno and Feargal Sharkey , journalists Fatima Bhutto , Andrew Gilligan and Nick Cohen , and the editor - in - chief of the Guardian , Alan Rusbridger .
Other speakers included Lord Bingham , the retired senior law lord , Ken Macdonald , the former director of public prosecutions , and the human rights lawyer Helena Kennedy .
In her speech , Kennedy said she felt fear was being used as a weapon to break down civil liberties .
" There is a general feeling that in creating a climate of fear people have been writing a blank cheque to government .
People feel the fear of terrorism is being used to take away a lot of rights . "
She said voters were anxious that their communities were " being alienated " by the use of powers that were originally designed to protect national security but were now being used outside that remit .
Now was the time for the electorate to make its feelings known to government , before the next election .
She said : " People are fearful of the general business of collecting too much information about individuals " .
High on the list of concerns of many at the convention were the recent allegations against the British security services by the Guantànamo Bay torture victim Binyam Mohamed , plans for ID cards , DNA databases and surveillance powers being used by civil servants as well as the government .
The Conservative MP David Davis , who resigned from the shadow cabinet in order to fight a byelection on a civil liberties platform , gave the final keynote speech of the day .
He told the Observer that he believed the danger of a police state was a very real one and that the justice secretary , Jack Straw , was leading a " piecemeal and casual erosion " of freedom in the UK .
" There has been a tide of government actions which have bput expediency over justice time and time again .
The British people wear their liberty like an old comfy suit , they are careless about it , but the mood is changing .
Last year 80 % of people were in favour of ID cards , now 80 % are against .
" There is a point of reflection that we are reaching .
The communications database which is planned to collect every private text and phone call and petrol station receipt will create uproar . "
He said the fact that people had paid £ 35 to attend the event was a real sign that people were waking up and getting irritated by the threat .
" We are getting on the way to becoming a police state and the surest thing I do know is that by the time we are sure we are , then it will be too late . "
Britain 's judiciary came under fire from many speakers .
A panel of leading journalists accused the courts of helping quash free speech .
They agreed that libel law was being manipulated by " dodgy characters " from all over the world who sought legal redress against valid investigative journalism in UK courts .
" Most of this is hidden from public view , " said Rusbridger , who complained that British lawyers ' fees were 140 times more expensive than in the rest of Europe , creating impossible dilemmas for journalists on newspapers already suffering from dropping sales and advertising revenues .
Gilligan , of the Evening Standard , said the planned communications database would bring an end to privacy and with it " an end of journalism " .
He pointed out that the only arrest in the case of the illegal shooting to death by police of the Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes was that of a journalist who revealed that police statements were untrue .
" This is a very worrying time , " he said .
" We are already witnessing the last days of local journalism ; local papers are closing down , local reporters do n't have the time to go out on stories . "
Newspapers and indiviuduals needed to start " getting angry " , he said .
The Observer and Vanity Fair writer Henry Porter , who co-organised the conference , said was moved by the support from the speakers and attendees .
" I had been feeling like the lone lunatic wandering around Oxford Street with a placard and its tremendously moving for me to see how many people share my concerns .
" The number of tickets , I 'm told , could have been sold two or three times over .
That has to show people really are thinking about these frightening issues quite seriously . "
The Convention on Modern Liberty , sponsored by the Rowntree Trusts , openDemocracy , Liberty , NO2ID and the Guardian , was launched as an umbrella campaign last month under the statement of purpose : " A call to all concerned with attacks on our fundamental rights and freedoms under pressure from counter - terrorism , financial breakdown and the database state " .

Microsoft boss Bill Gates bans his children from using Apple products ... but his wife admits she 'd like an iPhone
Microsoft founder head Bill Gates has banned the use of products made by arch - rival Apple from his house , his wife has revealed .
But the blockade could backfire on Gates , 53 , after Melinda admitted there are times she feels envious of her friends ' iPhones .
She told Vogue magazine that the couple 's three children Jennifer , 13 , Rory , 10 and Phoebe , seven , are not allowed Apple products .
Banned : Bill Gates , above , has banned Apple products in his home - but his wife Melinda , above , has admitted she would n't mind an iPhone
' There are very few things that are on the banned list in our household , ' she said .
' But iPods and iPhones are two things we do n't get for our kids . '
Like any forbidden fruit , however , Mrs Gates , 44 , admitted that some Apple products do have the power to tempt her .
' Every now and then I look at my friends and say ' Ooh , I would n't mind having that iPhone , ' she admitted .
For many years , Microsoft had a monopoly on the technology market .
But over the last decade , the popularity of new Apple products such as the iPod and the iPhone as well as their computers , has promoted the company to chief rival .
There have been rumours of animosity between Gates and Apple founder Steve Jobs but the pair have made public efforts to appear friends .
The Gates live in a vast mansion on the shores of Lake Washington and are very protective of the privacy of their children .
Gates stepped down as chief executive of Microsoft to concentrate on charity the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation , which is the world 's biggest philanthropic organisation .
Apple 's Steve Jobs , meanwhile , has been forced to take sick leave because of health problems .
You 've probably seen Improv Everywhere 's amazing Frozen Grand Central video — it 's gotten over 15,000,000 YouTube views .
Apparently , so has Sony , because they totally ripped it off without asking permission or giving credit .
Weasels .
In this spot , a bunch of easily - entertained commuters talk about how awesome it is to see models pretending to be mannequins holding Sony products in the middle of Grand Central .
You see the models standing perfectly still , and then they show a fast - motion shot of the models in the middle of the hubbub .
It 's exactly like the Improv Everywhere video , just without any soul .

And this is n't the first time Sony has ripped off an artist for their advertisements .
They ripped off LA - based kozyndan for their Bunnies Bravia ad , denying it later despite clear evidence of sleaziness .
They apparently did n't learn their lesson , because this one is even worse .
You suck , Sony .
Come up with your own ideas .
Time for a mea culpa .
Seriously , we 're waiting .

The Dark Knight was a massive hit , and Watchmen got great buzz ( if not great reviews ) .
But when Fox floats the idea of a " dark " reboot for the Fantastic Four , it 's gone too far .
Advertisement
It 's weirdly fitting that The Dark Knight and Watchmen look like they 're going to end up serving the same purpose for movies that The Dark Knight Returns and , well , Watchmen served for comics twenty - plus years ago ; namely , misdirecting creators into thinking that superheroes have to be " dark " and " realistic " in order to be successful .
There 's every possibility , of course , that Watchmen 's theater bow will end up far lower than expected ( That 78 % drop this Friday does n't look good , let 's face it ) and shift this expectation - just as there 's the possibility that Warners and Fox execs are right in assuming that the mainstream movie audience really does just want grumpy , moody superhero movies .
But somehow , I doubt both of those possibilities .
That Hollywood wants another Dark Knight is completely understandable , even ignoring the exceptional box office take of the movie ; Chris Nolan 's second Batman flick was artistic , sincere and adult ( even if it was also twice as long as it should 've been ) , and showcased a new way to approach superhero movies without traditional sensationalism and cliche , after all .
But that does n't mean that it needs to become the template for all superhero movies from now on .
Part of what made Dark Knight work so well was that the darkness and the stabs at moral ambiguity were entirely in keeping with the world of Batman as we 've all come to accept it in recent years .
It was n't an attempt to graft something that did n't belong onto the character - as , I think could be argued , Superman Returns tried to do with the " Lois has moved on / Clark is a stalker " angst that hit such a false note - but an indulging in the greyness that Batman has become increasingly surrounded in since his day - glo '60s TV show heyday .
Advertisement
( The same with Watchmen 's grit , which was always in the source text .
In fact , there 's definitely an argument that what makes Watchmen unsuccessful to some degree - and , of course , there are all manner of arguments over just what that degree may be - are the deviations from the original , whether it be in plot of the slick glossiness that Snyder 's movies seem to have no matter what . )
The original two Fantastic Four movies were n't financial failures , per se , but they were n't Spider - Man or X - Men , either ; the reason for that , though , was n't that they were too happy .
Creatively , they were ... fun enough in a " I 'm half - watching them on an airplane because there 's nothing else to do " way , perhaps , but they were n't really the Fantastic Four , either .
The key to those characters and that series is , ultimately , still in the tone that was established in the first 100 issues of their comic - a strange mix of sentiment , soap opera and invention that , to be honest , is much closer to the Back To The Future movies ( or , more obviously , Pixar 's The Incredibles ) than Fox 's previous attempts ... and something that 's a million miles away from the " dark " reinvisioning that rumors are suggesting that Fox is considering .
( The mind boggles , in a way , at the idea of a dark Fantastic Four franchise ; the characters are so amazingly undark - they 're called the Fantastic Four and their main nemesis calls himself Doctor Doom , for the love of God ; there 's a childlike suspension of disbelief necessary to buy into the concept as something other than parody in general , surely ?
- that I can't really imagine how it would even work for an entire movie never mind the reinvention of a franchise .
If it is being seriously considered , it speaks to the assumption that it's a result of desperation to keep movie rights than anything else . )
The key to successful superhero movies , ultimately , is in faith to the spirit of the original ( Case in punny point :
The Spirit may have shared character names with Will Eisner 's comic strip , but little else , and was an artistic failure because of that .
Of course , it was a financial failure because it was a terrible movie ) , but that point - maybe the real lesson of The Dark Knight , especially if taken in tandem with last year 's also - successful , but much more playful , Iron Man - is perhaps lost behind the dollar signs that appear in movie executives ' eyes whenever Dark Knight is mentioned , particularly in light of all the publicity push of the equally gloomy Watchmen .
It 's a shame , because the superhero genre - for all its faults - is something with so much more potential than any amount of gritty deconstructionist , " realistic " takes could properly demonstrate , and various characters already headed to the big screen - whether they 're Green Lantern , Thor or even Captain America - deserve stories that are much , much bigger than real life .
“ I did nothing else with my life ” other than brewing , Mr. Orlik , who is 53 , said in a thick German accent .
He stays busy producing a light , floral Kölsch and a dark brown Maerzen year - round , as well as a rotation of five seasonal brews .
Hurricane Katrina hit just about one week after Heiner Brau ’s first bottles shipped in 2005 , but the building managed to ride out the storm with little damage .
That set Mr. Orlik on a path to becoming a kind of brewing caretaker for the area .
He currently makes beers for local restaurants , as well as for the Big Easy Brewing Company , a Marrero , La. , brewery whose plant was shuttered after Katrina .
I tasted a few of the excellent brews , then followed Mr. Orlik as he showed off the equipment and a small collection of antique brewing gear .
Before we left , Jack Shugg , who runs Heiner Brau ’s distribution , offered a rare treat — a taste of a creamy Zea Category 5 American Pale Ale — made for the Zea Rotisserie & Grill restaurant chain — straight from a tank , or as he said , just “ released from captivity . ”

One of the biggest moments in Heiner Brau ’s short life came in spring 2006 when it was asked to take on Dixie beer , the old local favorite .
Founded in the Mid-City neighborhood of New Orleans in 1907 , the Dixie Brewing Company was still sputtering along when Katrina upended the city .
Its old brick building on Tulane Avenue was left stewing in 10 feet of water , and when the flood finally receded , looters moved in to haul off anything of value , including a copper kettle 16 feet in diameter .
The brewery these days , with its imposing metal dome , is nothing but a spooky shell .
Heiner Brau brewed for Dixie for about six months , but was ultimately unable to keep up with demand .
Its beers , including the popular Blackened Voodoo Lager , are currently shipped around the country from the Minhas Craft Brewery in Monroe , Wis .
Dixie ’s owners , Joe and Kendra Bruno , are eager for it to return to production in its original home .
“ We believe that it belongs there , ” Ms. Bruno said recently by phone .
Play TV is wonderful , it really is , although it was previously missing a few vital options , such as the ability to set reminders for future programs , auto - switch channels , that sort of thing .
So imagine our excitement when a 1.02 patch was released yesterday , bringing a whole wad of new features .
Like , er , slightly faster guide response , and support for Italian guide ordering .
And something else to do with the guide , but , bizarrely , no reminders .
So , in what is still pretty much the best Freeview box on the planet , it ’s still impossible to set a reminder to switch from Casualty to Eastenders .
Yes , you can record , rewind , even twist time and space itself , but you ca n’t set a reminder .
Here ’s a reminder , Sony , that we need some reminders .
Otherwise , good job .

The Truth about Palestine and Israel
Thousands of Israeli troops , backed by tanks and helicopters , have entered the Gaza Strip as Israel escalated its offensive into the territory on the eighth day of operations .
Tanks entered the besieged territory through several points mainly in northern Gaza , crossing shortly after nightfall on Saturday , officials said , while the Israeli cabinet said it had also called up about 9,000 reservists .
The Lies :
Lie #
1
Israel is only targeting legitimate military sites and is seeking to protect innocent lives .
Israel never targets civilians .
The Gaza Strip is one of the most densely populated pieces of property in the world .
The presence of militants within a civilian population does not , under international law , deprive that population of their protected status , and hence any assault upon that population under the guise of targeting militants is , in fact , a war crime .
Moreover , the people Israel claims are legitimate targets are members of Hamas , which Israel says is a terrorist organization .
Hamas has been responsible for firing rockets into Israel .
These rockets are extremely inaccurate and thus , even if Hamas intended to hit military targets within Israel , are indiscriminate by nature .
When rockets from Gaza kill Israeli civilians , it is a war crime .
Hamas has a military wing .
However , it is not entirely a military organization , but a political one .
Members of Hamas are the democratically elected representatives of the Palestinian people .
Dozens of these elected leaders have been kidnapped and held in Israeli prisons without charge .
Others have been targeted for assassination , such as Nizar Rayan , a top Hamas official .
To kill Rayan , Israel targeted a residential apartment building .
The strike not only killed Rayan but two of his wives and four of his children , along with six others .
There is no justification for such an attack under international law .
This was a war crime .
Other of Israel ’s bombardment with protected status under international law have included a mosque , a prison , police stations , and a university , in addition to residential buildings .
Moreover , Israel has long held Gaza under siege , allowing only the most minimal amounts of humanitarian supplies to enter .
Israel is bombing and killing Palestinian civilians .
Countless more have been wounded , and cannot receive medical attention .
Hospitals running on generators have little or no fuel .
Doctors have no proper equipment or medical supplies to treat the injured .
These people , too , are the victims of Israeli policies targeted not at Hamas or legitimate military targets , but directly designed to punish the civilian population .
Lie #
2
Hamas violated the cease - fire .
The Israeli bombardment is a response to Palestinian rocket fire and is designed to end such rocket attacks .
Israel never observed the cease - fire to begin with .
From the beginning , it announced a “ special security zone ” within the Gaza Strip and announced that Palestinians who enter this zone will be fired upon .
In other words , Israel announced its intention that Israeli soldiers would shoot at farmers and other individuals attempting to reach their own land in direct violation of not only the cease - fire but international law .
Despite shooting incidents , including ones resulting in Palestinians getting injured , Hamas still held to the cease - fire from the time it went into effect on June 19 until Israel effectively ended the truce on November 4 by launching an airstrike into Gaza that killed five and injured several others .
Israel ’s violation of the cease - fire predictably resulted in retaliation from militants in Gaza who fired rockets into Israel in response .
The increased barrage of rocket fire at the end of December is being used as justification for the continued Israeli bombardment , but is a direct response by militants to the Israeli attacks .
Israel ’s actions , including its violation of the cease - fire , predictably resulted in an escalation of rocket attacks against its own population .
Lie #
3
Hamas is using human shields , a war crime .
There has been no evidence that Hamas has used human shields .
The fact is , as previously noted , Gaza is a small piece of property that is densely populated .
Israel engages in indiscriminate warfare such as the assassination of Nizar Rayan , in which members of his family were also murdered .
It is victims like his dead children that Israel defines as “ human shields ” in its propaganda .
There is no legitimacy for this interpretation under international law .
In circumstances such as these , Hamas is not using human shields , Israel is committing war crimes in violation of the Geneva Conventions and other applicable international law .
Lie #
4
Arab nations have not condemned Israel ’s actions because they understand Israel ’s justification for its assault .
The populations of those Arab countries are outraged at Israel ’s actions and at their own governments for not condemning Israel ’s assault and acting to end the violence .
Simply stated , the Arab governments do not represent their respective Arab populations .
The populations of the Arab nations have staged mass protests in opposition to not only Israel ’s actions but also the inaction of their own governments and what they view as either complacency or complicity in Israel ’s crimes .
Moreover , the refusal of Arab nations to take action to come to the aid of the Palestinians is not because they agree with Israel ’s actions , but because they are submissive to the will of the US , which fully supports Israel .
Egypt , for instance , which refused to open the border to allow Palestinians wounded in the attacks to get medical treatment in Egyptian hospitals , is heavily dependent upon US aid , and is being widely criticized within the population of the Arab countries for what is viewed as an absolute betrayal of the Gaza Palestinians .
Even Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has been regarded as a traitor to his own people for blaming Hamas for the suffering of the people of Gaza .
Palestinians are also well aware of Abbas ’ past perceived betrayals in conniving with Israel and the US to sideline the democratically elected Hamas government , culminating in a counter - coup by Hamas in which it expelled Fatah ( the military wing of Abbas ’ Palestine Authority ) from the Gaza Strip .
While his apparent goal was to weaken Hamas and strengthen his own position , the Palestinians and other Arabs in the Middle East are so outraged at Abbas that it is unlikely he will be able to govern effectively .
Lie #
5
Israel is not responsible for civilian deaths because it warned the Palestinians of Gaza to flee areas that might be targeted .
Israel claims it sent radio and telephone text messages to residents of Gaza warning them to flee from the coming bombardment .
But the people of Gaza have nowhere to flee to .
They are trapped within the Gaza Strip .
It is by Israeli design that they cannot escape across the border .
It is by Israeli design that they have no food , water , or fuel by which to survive .
It is by Israeli design that hospitals in Gaza have no electricity and few medical supplies with which to treat the injured and save lives .
And Israel has bombed vast areas of Gaza , targeting civilian infrastructure and other sites with protected status under international law .
No place is safe within the Gaza Strip .
HISTORY
Prior to the British signing the Balfour Declaration in 1917 , which called for a Jewish state , Palestinians made up over 90 % of the population of Palestine .
In fact , in 1914 , Jews only made up 7.5 % of the population .
After the signing of the Balfour Declaration , Jews began migrating in mass numbers from surrounding areas into Palestine .
This migration was haulted for three years from 1936 - 1939 , but then resumed in even greater numbers until 1948 , when Israel claimed itself a sovereign state and thus sparking an even larger mass migration of Jews into Palestine .
By 1950 , only 30 years after the signing of the Balfour Declaration , Jews made up the majority of the population .
Basically , if you were to ask all but about 5 % of the original Jewish inhabitants where they originated from , they would answer with a country other than Palestine , most likely a country from Eastern Europe and some from neighboring Arab countries .
Jews are still migrating into Palestine today in mass numbers and settling in Palestinian territory .
Much of these migrating Jews understand the Palestinian situation , but many times choose to ignore it due to overwhelming benefits .
— — — — — — — — —— — –—
CONFLICT
In 1947 , the United Nations agrees to split Palestine into two states , a Jewish state and a Palestinian state , with Jerusalem as an international city .
One issue bothered the Palestinians … the agreement included a Jewish state that made up 54 % of the land and 46 % to the Palestinians , even though prior to that point the Jews owned only 6 % of the land .
Then there is the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians out of their rightfully owned lands by Israeli militias , which sparked the bloodshed still seen today .
One such horrific act was witnessed in April of 1948 , when Zionist militia went into the town of Deir Yassin and murdered 254 innocent civilians , mostly elders , women , children .
Many of these incidents along with the inexcusable demolition of thousands of Palestinian homes in the years to come instilled fear into the minds of many Palestinians , forcing them to flee to neighboring countries , most likely Jordan .
Those who remained in Palestine to defend their land and refused to submit to the will of Israel were in for a great struggle .
Till this day , this struggle includes many war crimes committed by Israel not only in Palestine , but in Lebanon as well , which include : ethnic cleansing , genocide , illegal imprisonment , and illegal occupation .
Some of these war crimes were executed by former Prime Minister of Israel , Ariel Sharon , who was not tried for any of his war crimes .
Tyrants similar to Sharon include Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and Iraqi Dictator Saddam Hussein .
Milosevic went onto trial for his crimes and was sentenced to prison , dying 5 years later in his prison cell .
Saddam Hussein also went on trial for his tyrannical crimes and was hung to death .
The world demands justice , not only from Sharon ( who suffered a stroke late 2005 and is currently in a coma ) , but for any injustices .
As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said , “ Injustice anywhere is a threat to Justice everywhere .
”
What you do n’t know is that the United States has been aiding Israel every year since 1945 with hundreds of millions of dollars .
This money comes out of your pockets as tax payers .
The U.S. also provides Israel with Caterpillar bulldozers , which are used to demolish homes and Palestinian infrastructure .
As a democratic nation , we proudly say that we are combating terrorism , yet we turn the other cheek and fuel a war machine like Israel , but of course … they ’re not terrorists .
Palestinians have to endure such inhumane actions everyday .
Hundreds of thousands have lost their homes , tens of thousands have lost their lives , and all have been deprived of their integrity and hope for freedom .
— — — — — — — — —— — –—
THE SUICIDE BOMBER
Much of the news coverage you hear especially in America is biased news about the terrorist actions of suicide bombers in Palestine .
What they do n’t mention is what equates to such actions .
Israel has gone as far as to literally torture Palestinians by poisoning their water , poisoning livestock , destroying electrical power plants , and destroying roads .
People cannot go to prayer , let alone work , to provide their families with an income that can keep them alive .
Many in Gaza , one of the most densely populated regions in the world , are living in total darkness due to the recent destruction of their only electrical power plant .
In essence , Israel gives birth to these Suicide Bombers .
No civilian deserves to die , whether Israeli or Palestinian .
There is no legitimate excuse for the execution of innocent lives .
Both sides though , have extremists trying to support their cause .
Suicide bombers never existed before the Zionist regime took over in Israel , but that still does n’t justify the loss of civilian life .
Since Palestinian suicide bombers are terrorists ; what word would you use to describe Israeli actions ?
— — — — — — — — —— — –—
PERSONAL STATEMENT
I urge you to maintain open mindedness and not believe all that you may hear in the news .
I also urge you to do your own research and not take my word for it either .
You will be surprised at what you find .
I have not even hit the surface when it comes to facts , so dig further .
I have witnessed many of these injustices with my own eyes , so its time for you to open yours .
* Please remember , there are plenty of Jews , even Rabbi’s , that are entirely against the Zionist movement .
Also , do not confuse a person who practices Judaism with a Zionist .
Zionists are not all necessarily Jews , and not all Jews are necessarily Zionists *

1 ) Constructable Designs - Business Cards You Have to Build
In today ’s tech - oriented world of short attention spans it is more important than ever to make a compelling first impression .
A brilliant business card that speaks to your profession , serves some unusual function or that transforms into something else can be a great way to grab attention and inspire those you meet .
Organized by category here are 42 extremely creative business card designs .
Some of these are old , some new , but all are still amazing examples of out - of - the - box thinking in business card design .
A card with some assembly required forces the recipient to spend more time with it - which is a good thing if you want to avoid getting lost in the shuffle .
Some of these designs are fairly simple and create simple forms or reveal messages when distorted while others are virtual toys or art projects in their own right .
2 ) Organic Designs - Calling Cards You Can Watch Grow
What could be a more dynamic way to leave your mark than handing out something designed to actually grows and changes on its own over time ?
These can be used to advertise landscaping services or other plant products or simply to leave a lasting ( and evolving ) impression on the recipient .
3 ) Pragmatic Designs - Calling Cards You Can Actually Use
Instead of sticking people with another flimsy piece of paper to lose in their wallet why not give your business card a secondary function ?
This can be as simple as making a clothes pin , a bottle opener or a ruler or as extravagant as giving out entire USB devices with your information printed on them .
4 ) Professionally Themed - Designs that Speak to Your Occupation
The message on a card design does n’t necessarily have to be the print on the paper - it can be much bolder and embodied in the crafting of the object itself .
Examples include : dog tags for an animal adoption program , a map that folds out and leads you to a map shop , fake medicine for the ‘ brand doctor , ’ and a head - hunter ’s business card you are instructed to eat after reading in case your employer were to catch you with it .
5 ) Creative Designs - More Cards that Do n’t Fit the Mold
Of course not every business card is going to fit neatly into a category - and all the better for those trying to think outside of the box ( after all , you do n’t really want to copy everyone else right ? ) .
These designs range from simple to complex , artistic to obscure , but offer a bit more inspiration for those of us still sorting out what we want .

life := ... のところのブロック定義が上の APL のコード（life ← ... ）に相当します。もちろん APL には短さはもちろん流れの美しさの面でもとうていかなわないわけですが、標準ライブラリ・組み込みメソッドのみで似たような処理をこの程度で書ける言語もそう多くはないと思います。
| mat1 elems mat2 life | elems := ( 1 to : 9 ) collect : [ :each | ( # ( 2 3 4 5 8 ) includes : each ) if True : [ 1 ] if False : [ 0 ] ]. mat1 := Matrix rows : 3 columns : 3 contents : elems . mat2 := ( Matrix zeros : 5 ) atRows : 2 to : 4 columns : 2 to : 4 put : mat1 ; yourself .
life := [ :ω | | ωｓ sum survivers | ωｓ := OrderedCollection new .
#(- 1 0 1 ) asDigitsToPower : 2 do : [ : xy | ωｓ add : ( ω atRows : ( ( 1 to : ω rowCount ) flipRotated : xy first * 2 ) columns : ( ( 1 to : ω columnCount ) flipRotated : xy second * 2 ) ) ] .
sum := ωｓ sum .
survivers := #( 3 4 ) collect : [ : each | sum collect : [ : elem | elem = each ifTrue : [ 1 ] if False : [ 0 ] ] ]. ( survivers * { 1 . ω } ) sum ] .
mat2 . life value : mat2
使用しているメソッドの簡単な解説を以下に。
#flipRotated : は ( 引数の絶対値 + 1 ) ÷ 2 の商の数だけ配列の要素を、引数が正の時は右方向、負の時は左方向にシフトして返します。
( 1 to : 5 ) flipRotated : 2 ( 1 to : 5 ) flipRotated : 4
なお、引数が奇数のときは順序が逆になります。
( 1 to : 5 ) flipRotated : 1 ( 1 to : 5 ) flipRotated : 3
素直にローテートしてくれるメソッドがなかったので使いましたがなんとも不思議な…。
#atRows : columns : は引数として与えた配列の要素に対応する番号の列または行を並び替えたマトリックスを返します。
| mat | mat := Matrix diagonal : ( 1 to : 5 ) . mat atRows : ( 1 to : 5 ) columns : #( 1 3 5 2 4 )
Squeak Smalltalk の順序付きコレクションに対する四則演算などの振る舞いは他の
Smalltalk 処理系とはちょっと変わっていて（おそらく初期の
Smalltalk にあった APL ゆずりの機能を復活させたものかと…）、引数が数値ならレシーバの各要素に対する演算、引数が同じコレクションなら対応する要素同士の演算の結果をコレクションで返します。
#( 1 2 3 ) * 2 #( 1 2 3 ) * #( 4 5 6 )
いつもどおり 、Smalltalk からさら に Ruby へ翻訳した版も書いてみようか…とも思ったのですが、マトリックスはともかく、最後の便利な配列の演算機能がないと最後のまとめの部分とかがキツそうなので今回は断念しました。…と思い込んでいたのですが、よくよく調べてみれば
Ruby でも（配列はダメですが ）Matrix でなら似た手が使えるようなので、そのうち書いてみます。

Dear Chuck ,
Like so many others , I have a great deal of respect for what you have accomplished in your life .
You are the epitome of the American Dream ; rising from a troubled childhood to the heights of international celebrity .
While you and I may not agree on many political issues , I believe that you are sincere in your concern for the future of the American republic .
However , I think you miss the mark with your support of the Fair Tax .
Yes , the current federal income tax system is immoral , invasive , and represents a form of slavery ( resting on the premise that individuals are not entitled to the fruit of their labor ) , but eliminating one tax and replacing it with another is never a good idea .
Besides , we have bigger fish to fry .
While taxes are certainly an important issue , it is not the taxes we see that are our greatest worry at this point .
The tax we should be concerned about is the one that we do n't see .
As long as the Federal Reserve System retains the monopoly power to issue currency , it really does n't matter what the tax system is .
Theoretically , the Fed can print all the money the government needs and we will be taxed through the loss of purchasing power of the dollar .
This is going to become more and more evident as the federal government grows to unprecedented proportions .
The crisis that we are witnessing now pales when compared to the unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare .
The only way for the government to deal with them is to inflate the debt away .
The Fed is an unconstitutional institution .
According to Article 1 , Section 8 , Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution , Congress is empowered to " coin money and regulate the value thereof . "
In 1913 , Congress delegated that authority to the Fed .
This action in itself is questionable as it would seem that a constitutional amendment would be required for Congress to delegate authority with which it is specifically vested .
The issue , however , is even bigger than that .
It is no accident that these powers were included in a clause which grants Congress the authority to " fix the standard of weights and measures . "
That is because the dollar itself is not money ; it is a measure of money .
Money , according to the Framers , was gold and silver .
Congress is simply empowered to standardize the dollar as a measure of precious metal  traditionally , 1/20 of an ounce of gold .
In other words , the Constitution does not grant Congress the power to create money or to regulate the value of the dollar by manipulating the money supply .
The power which the Fed claims to posses under congressional mandate  the power to create money  never existed in the first place .
As Thomas Jefferson predicted , the Fed 's monopoly on the issuance of currency is enslaving America .
Most insidiously of all , we are being enslaved with our own productivity .
The law has been perverted into an instrument of plunder .
All these bailouts are really reverse wealth redistribution as taxpayer money is lavished on political capitalists .
In addition , the Fed is backstopping trillions of dollars of losses in the commercial banking sector .
Where are the Fed and the government getting all this money ?
What the government cannot expropriate or borrow will be created out of thin air by the Fed , expanding the money supply and ultimately causing price inflation .
Inflation is most pernicious tax of all .
It destroys savings by devaluing the monetary unit .
It distorts the price signals on which entrepreneurs rely to make decisions about how best to meet customer demand , choking the economy with waste and inefficiencies .
It punishes the poor since they receive the new money only after prices have already risen , if they receive the new money at all .
And worst of all , very few realize who is to blame for these problems .
Inflation is the politician 's best friend .
It allows him to promise his constituents all sorts of goodies seemingly for free .
When the bill comes due in the form of higher prices , the politician can blame greedy businessmen or OPEC sheiks .
In reality , the trail leads back to the government profligacy .
Some will say that the Fed is an independent agency and is therefore not subject to political caprice .
Balderdash .
The Fed works closely with the President to implement monetary policy .
In addition , the folks at the Fed are people just like you and me .
Who wants to take the blame when the economy takes a downturn as it inevitably will if the Fed contracts the money supply ?
Why not just keep the printing presses cranking and let your successor deal with the consequences ?
That is what Alan Greenspan did and he was heralded as a god ; do n't you think that that may have gone to his head ?
The problem with central banking is not whether the central bank is run by private interests or the government .
The problem is that it is controlled by people , people who answer to political pressure and not market forces .
For this reason ( as well as many others ) , central planning never works .
The Fed  America 's central bank  is simply central planning under a different name .
The only way for the American people to restore their freedom is to take back control over their money .
We must eliminate legal tender laws and break the Fed 's monopoly on currency .
If the government is going to be involved in monetary affairs at all , we must reinstate a gold standard in order to limit its ability to inflate .
Chuck , you have never backed down from a fight , and this fight will be an epic .
The people who think that they run this country are not just going to give up .
Just like Nicholas Biddle , they will do everything possible to stay in power , even threatening to destroy the economy .
The truth is that the economy is being destroyed right now and the only way to save it is to allow the free market to work .
There is a movement in America which , although it is still in its nascent stages , is causing the Establishment to tremble .
It is a movement which promises to smash the shackles of the central bank and liberate Americans from the clutches of power - mad politicians and their corporate cronies .
Chuck , forget about the Fair Tax and add your voice to our battle cry .
END THE FED !!

The Best of Glenn Jacobs
According to a former employee of Lionhead Studios , being openly gay at a Microsoft - owned development studio can be just as bad as having an openly gay Xbox Live gamertag .
Advertisement
Gay video game designer Jamie Durrant is suing Microsoft for £ 45,000 in ' hurt feelings ' and lost pay , claiming discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation .
Durrant claims that following Microsoft 's buyout of Lionhead , where he has worked for the past 11 years , the atmosphere began to grow uneasy .
Around January of last year , Jamie says he began receiving abusive emails with subjects that read " I'm Jim and I 'm Gay " and " Me and my Favourite Men " , and that he was given the nickname " Fag Boy Jim " .
Advertisement
Durrant 's complaints to the human resources department resulted in nothing more than a promise to send round a memo on how to behave in a diverse workplace once the firm updated their official policies , which never happened .
Durrant also claims he was offered counciling , to which his response was
" They 're making out that I 'm the one with the problem . "
As of right now , Jamie has been off work for depression for seven months , and now he is seeking damages .
If his claims are legitimate , I 'd say he 's aiming far too low money - wise , especially considering he 's dealing with a company once lauded by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for their treatment of gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgendered employees .
Perhaps Lionhead simply did n't get the memo .
Xbox designer sues Microsoft over ' Fag Boy ' jibes at work [ Mail Online ]
If you ’re anything like me , you often find yourself wishing for an easy way to watch your digital media from the comfort of your own couch .
I mean , we ’ve got all of these random devices that let us watch videos , but I still ca n’t simply carry a USB thumb drive into the living room and watch the latest Star Trek trailer in all of its 1080 p glory on my 46 ″ HDTV .
All right , I ’m being a tad dramatic ( and maybe embellishing the size of my TV ) .
Regardless , there are many ways to get your digital content onto your television .
For example , you could simply encode and burn a DVD , but that ’s time consuming and limits video resolution to standard definition .
Besides , burning discs for the sake of moving data from one room to another is so 1999 .
Both the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 support a variety of different media formats , including high - definition video .
But if someone ’s not interested in gaming , that ’s an awful lot of money to spend on a device that wo n’t even have half of its capabilities put to use .
And neither game console is fully compatible with some of the more obscure media formats , requiring you to transcode your content to make it compatible .
Once again , that can prove time consuming .
Assuming the trancoding is between one lossy codec and another , it can also degrade quality .
Home theater PCs are a tantalizing option , but they can prove cost - prohibitive if done right .
Building a proper HTPC is n’t simply a matter of tossing your last - generation desktop into the living room .
Acoustic , thermal , and even aesthetic considerations all come into play  but that ’s worth a separate article in and of itself .
Instead , some folks may rather have a simple device whose sole purpose is to play downloaded or ripped content in the living room .
The digital media receiver , as it ’s come to be known , serves just such a purpose .
Simply plug one into your television , and it acts as a Swiss Army knife for content playback .
The Apple TV represents the upper echelon of these products , as pretty much a full - blown computer with Wi -Fi , Internet streaming , and a large amount of internal storage though it has its share of drawbacks , as well .
Below that , you ’ll find devices like the popular Popcorn Hour A - 100 , which ditches the Apple Tax and internal storage to bring the price down a notch .
One of the most recent newcomers to this market is the not - too - originally named WD TV HD Media Player , with which Western Digital aims to shake up the market .
Like the A - 100 , the WD TV lacks any form of internal storage , but goes one step further to lower costs by removing network access .
Accordingly , the WD TV’s $ 129 suggested retail price is almost half what some competing devices cost .
No , it ’s not a hard drive
But … it ’s made by Western Digital , and it looks exactly like the firm ’s My Book external storage solutions !
I assure you : while the WD TV certainly shares some design characteristics with other Western Digital products , it ’s a completely different kind of animal .
Sporting a glossy , piano - black finish and only two subtle LED indicators on the front , the WD TV is a pretty slick contraption that would look right at home in just about any entertainment center .
The included infrared remote is about the size of an average cell phone , and it fits comfortably in your hand .
Home theater buffs will most likely replace it with a universal remote , but for the price - conscious consumers Western Digital is targeting , the stock remote works just fine .
The WD TV stashes the majority of its connectivity options at the back .
Going from left to right , you ’ll find the requisite power port , USB 2.0 , HDMI 1.2 for high - definition video , TOSLINK for digital audio , and Composite video connectors for standard - definition output .
The lack of component or S - Video analog output is somewhat disappointing for those without the latest tech .
I was an early adopter , so my high - definition TV does n’t even have HDMI only component and DVI - D. Luckily , the WD TV does n’t enforce HDCP encryption over HDMI , so I was able to use an inexpensive HDMI - to - DVI cable for video and then rely on either TOSLINK to my receiver or composite audio to my television .
Speaking of cables , it ’s worth noting that the WD TV only includes composite cables , which is pretty odd for a device that brands itself as an “ HD Media Player . ”
Customers without a spare HDMI cable will be upset to find that they ca n’t enjoy high - definition content from the WD TV right out of the box , which is borderline inexcusable .
Did n’t Sony catch a ton of flack for the exact same thing with the Playstation 3 over two years ago ?
Another curious inclusion in the box is a vertical stand for small portable hard drivesideally a My Passport device , as far as Western Digital is concerned .
It ’s an interesting addition , but if cost is an issue , I think most users would trade the stand and the composite cables for an HDMI cable .
Along the left side of the WD TV lies an additional USB 2.0 port for a second mass - storage device , as well as a pinhole - sized reset button .
Though the WD TV is n’t as large as something like a DVD player , the inclusion of a secondary USB port makes it more convenient to plug in a USB thumb drive quickly without going to the back of the unit and displacing a more permanent storage solution like an external hard drive .
Notably missing from the WD TV ’s array of ports is an Ethernet jack .
No , it does n’t have Wi -Fi either .
The WD TV completely lacks any networking interface , making it impossible to stream content from your PC or NAS .
That ’s a pretty huge concession that may downright eliminate it as an option for some users .
I was n’t kidding when I said that the WD TV has a glossy exterior .
It ’s practically a mirror finish , as my Lego Star Wars mini - fig stylishly demonstrates .
To be honest , I ’m not a huge fan of piano black on tech products due to the number of fingerprints it attracts .
However , in the case of the WD TV , it wo n’t be touched all that often , so fingerprints should n’t be a big issue .
Also , one would expect to be sitting more than six feet away and looking at the TV rather than the WD TV , making small visual blemishes the least of one ’s concerns .
Plus , the smooth exterior makes it look a lot more expensive than it really is , and in the realm of home theater equipment , that matters .
The WD TV ’s footprint is almost exactly half that of a DVD case .
At just over 1.5 ″ thick , it ’s a rather discreet addition to the home theater .
You can even prop it upright , should you need to squeeze it into a tight spot .
Just make sure there ’s at least some open air around the device , because it can get pretty toasty during playback .
The WD TV is n’t designed to be taken apart , but that did n’t stop me .
Like its My Book counterparts , the WD TV relies on a number of hidden plastic clips to stay closed .
However , after two minutes with a knife and screwdriver , I had full access to the WD TV ’s naughty bits .
( Note : that was not a dating tip . )
The hardware is n’t all that much to look at , since the Sigma 8635 chipset used for decoding is buried under a large heatsink that happens to be glued on there pretty tight believe me , I checked .
Four Nanya RAM chips making up a total of 192MB are littered around the PCB , along with a Silicon Image PHY for HDMI 1.2 output .
Near the top right of the photo , you can also spot a four - pin interface I have to believe is for debugging purposes .
Firmware updates can be done over USB , though , so users should n’t ever have to worry about that connector .
HOUSTON -- ( March 17 , 2009 ) - More than five years ago , Dr. Lawrence C.B. Chan and colleagues in his Baylor College of Medicine laboratory cured mice with type 1 diabetes by using a gene to induce liver cells to make insulin .
" Now we know how it works , " said Chan , director of the federally designed Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center at BCM and chief of the division of endocrinology in BCM 's department of medicine .
" The answer is adult stem cells . "
A gene called neurogenin3 proved critical to inducing cells in the liver to produce insulin on a continuing basis , said Chan and Dr. Vijay Yechoor , assistant professor of medicine - endocrinology and first author of the report that appears in the current issue of the journal Developmental Cell .
The research team used a disarmed virus called a vector to deliver the gene to the livers of diabetic mice by a procedure commonly known as gene therapy .
" The mice responded within a week , " said Yechoor .
The levels of sugar in their blood plummeted to normal and stayed that way for the rest of their normal lives .
The quick response generated more questions as did the length of time that the animals stayed healthy .
They found that there was a two - step response .
At first , the neurogenin3 gene goes into the mature liver cells and causes them to make small quantities of insulin - enough to drop sugar levels to normal , said Yechoor .
" This is a transient effect , " he said .
" Liver cells lose the capacity to make insulin after about six weeks . "
However , they found that other cells that made larger quantities of insulin showed up later , clustered around the portal veins ( blood vessels that carry blood from the intestines and abdominal organs to the liver ) .
" They look similar to normal pancreatic islet cells ( that make insulin normally ) , " said Yechoor .
They found that these " islet " cells came from a small population of adult stem cells usually found near the portal vein .
Only a few are needed usually because they serve as a safety net in case of liver injury .
When that occurs , they quickly activate to form mature liver cells or bile duct cells .
However , neurogenin3 changes their fates , directing them down a path to becoming insulin - producing islet cells located in the liver .
The mature liver cell cannot make this change because its fate appears to be fixed before exposure to neurogenin3 .
The islet cells in the liver look similar to those made by pancreas after an injury , said Yechoor .
" If we did n't use neurogenin3 , none of this would happen , " he said .
" Neurogenin3 is necessary and sufficient to produce these changes . "
Chan cautioned that much more work is needed before similar results could be seen in humans .
The gene therapy they undertook in the animals used a disarmed viral vector that could still have substantial toxic effects in humans .
" The concept is important because we can induce normal adult stem cells to acquire a new cell fate .
It might even be applicable to regenerating other organs or tissues using a different gene from other types of adult stem cells , " he said .
Finding a way to use the treatment in human sounds easier than it is , he said .
The environment in which cells grow appears to be an important part of the cell fate determination .
However , he and Yechoor plan to continue their work with the eventual goal of providing a workable treatment for people with diabetes .

It happened so organically that I did n't notice until it was too late , but I 've become a pathetic slave to my own technology .
The very doodads and iGizmos that I ’d thought were making my life easier and more enjoyable have in fact been lulling me into a sad co-dependency and draining me like some horrible Succubus .
Any time I misplace my phone I become a dysfunctional idiot , the experience from the roughly two decades of my life in which I did n't have a cell apparently gone from my memory .
How did I remember my friends ’ numbers back then ?
How did I find people in a mall ?
I used to enjoy leaving my parent 's house and knowing people could n’t contact me .
Now the idea almost frightens me – what if something important happens ?
What if I ’m invited to party ?!
Every aspect of my life is coddled by technology .
I can no longer spell without real - time spell check .
I ca n’t use foldout maps .
I can't exercise if I do n't have my iPod with me .
And I ca n’t seem to be anywhere near a computer without uttering the words - “ Mind if I check my email real quick ? ” I ’ve devolved into a sorry excuse for a functioning being .
Last month my modem broke .
It was truly shameful how thoroughly my life shut the fuck down .
When my toilet broke I actually went several days of just not going to the bathroom at home before I bothered to complain to my landlord .
I replaced my modem within hours of course .
My entire life seems to flow through my computer .
In many ways it has become a more essential component to my life than I am and I live in mortal terror of it breaking .
When my insurance company calls to try and get me to upgrade my lousy plan I scoff .

We ’ve received a few emails asking for more information about how to attempt to observe Comet Lulin .
And Sky and Telescope has put out a great primer for seeing this green smudgeball in North America .
Right now is the optimum time to try and see it .
Sky and Telescope editor - in - chief Robert Naeye says Lulin should be at its best from Feb. 23 through the 28th .
“ In a very dark , unpolluted , natural night sky — such as few people see any more — the comet is dimly visible to the unaided eye , ” writes Naeye .
“ Even in a more light - polluted suburban sky , however , a good pair of binoculars will do the trick .
But you have to know exactly where to look . ”
Start looking for Lulin after 9:00 pm ( your local time ) but the view will be better after 10:00 pm .
Here ’s a star chart from SkyandTelescope.com/CometLulin .
And here ’s the info from S&T :
“ It shows the starry view high in the east - southeast in mid-evening .
You should have no trouble spotting the planet Saturn and the star Regulus in the constellation Leo .
They ’re the two brightest things in the area .
“ Using those as your guide , aim at the point on the comet ’s path that ’s labeled with the current date .
The comet ’s position is indicated for the evening hours on each date for the time zones of the Americas .
The orientation of the scene with respect to the horizon is drawn for North America .
“ You ’re looking for a very dim , biggish , slightly oval cotton - puff floating among the tiny pinpoint stars .
Look carefully , and you may detect the spike of the comet ’s “ anti-tail ” pointing toward the lower left .
The comet ’s regular tail is actually dimmer , and it points in almost the opposite direction .
In binoculars the whole thing looks more gray than greenish ; to see color you need more light .
In a large amateur telescope , the color and the comet ’s structure are a lot more clearly visible .
“ I saw it out my bathroom window with 10 - by - 50 binoculars , ” says Alan MacRobert , a senior editor of Sky & Telescope .
“ It ’s pretty plain if you get aimed at exactly the right spot . ”
For more about Comet Lulin , its discovery , the reason for its two tails , check out Universe Today ’s previous articles : one by Tammy about Lulin ’s twisty tails , and one by Nancy , “ Comet Lulin is on the Way ! ” .
Check out Spaceweather .com ’s posting of pictures of Lulin from astronomers from all over the world .
After an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting federal government , you are called upon to deliberate on a new Constitution for the United States of America .

Telling someone you trust about your problem can help hold you accountable .
If someone else knows that you are trying to stop , they can ask you about it and you will have to face whether you have stopped or not .
This person can also weigh in on whether the problem is severe , or just a minor issue .
The White House is refusing to release documents about the secretive Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement , a super - maximal copyright treaty that a bunch of rich countries are negotiating behind closed doors to escape the activists who've started to report on their shenanigans at the UN's World Intellectual Property Organisation .
Incredibly , the Obama administration claims that disclosing the details of this secret copyright law would endanger " national security . "
But now , like Bush before him , Obama is playing the national security card to hide details of the controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement being negotiated across the globe .
The White House this week declared ( . pdf ) the text of the proposed treaty a " properly classified " national security secret , in rejecting a Freedom of Information Act request by Knowledge Ecology International .
" Please be advised the documents you seek are being withheld in full , " wrote Carmen Suro - Bredie , chief FOIA officer in the White House 's Office of the U.S. Trade Representative .
The national security claim is stunning , given that the treaty negotiations have included the 27 member states of the European Union , Japan , South Korea , Canada , Mexico , Australia , Switzerland and New Zealand , all of whom presumably have access to the " classified " information .

Yes , " I do n't recall " can be perjury , but it is hard to prove that someone did recall .
Naturally , if no one is going to make Rove and Miers come in for questioning , then no one is going to prosecute them for anything .
As mentioned by many who commented on the previous article , this smells like a cover up .

So , lying when you testify to Congress is a crime even without an oath ?
The what the hell happened when the oil exec .

Relative to yesterday 's comment from John Gideon about what " agreement " might have been made --- it seems questioning is only to be only about U.S. attorneys .
So no questions about Don Siegelman might have been the " agreement " ( as well as no oath ) .

So if lying to Congress is already a crime , the oath would be just a formality .
Lets make this a formal affair and administer the oath , after all , it wo n't make any difference , right ?

Given the previous refusal to testify - at all - despite congressional subpoenas , I find it impossible to believe that suddenly they 're going to spill the beans concerning anything that will be helpful to any investigation .
My guess is they 're going up there so reich - wingers can say " See !
They testified !
Now leave them alone ... "
I doubt they 'll reveal anything except by accident .
We 'll see .

If no oath is needed than why have them testify behind closed doors ?
What could possibly be gained by this ?
And , they should have already been sited for contempt for their previous non- shows .

It looks like Siegelman got a new trial on only a couple of counts and the 11th Circuit upheld the rest of his convictions .

Not putting them under oath is just another version of " nudge nudge , wink wink , say no more ... "
They did n't enforce 3 subpeanas , they stood down while elections were stolen and one of their own was locked up ( siegelman ) by a partisan justice department .
They stood down after the criminal cabal behind dur chimpfurher lied this nation into a war of conquest and systematically destroyed the bill of rights and constitution .
If anyone think the dems are going to hold either of these 2 lying liars accountable for what they say in their testimony , they are not paying attention .

Can anyone explain : 1 . WHY there will be no oath given ?
Since it must be just an " formality , " according to the above statements , what 's the problem with Rove and Miers taking the oath ?
I really want an answer to that .
And WHY do other people who testify have to take the oath ?
2. WHY is this testimony going to be taken behind closed doors , instead of in public view just as others have testified before congress ?
3 . Will there be someone available to count the phrases : I do n't recall , I can't recollect , I 'm not aware of that , I do n't remember , etc . ?
4. WHY was President Clinton 's deposition put on TV live ?
Are Rove and Miers more privileged than a President ?
They 'll testify , but only under THEIR conditions ... is that it ?
Unless this testimony is done in a regular hearing , covered by C - Span , I feel no assurance that anyone will be held accountable for wrongdoing ... and there was plenty of that .
The Congressional Judiciary is supposed to get to the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth .
This is a one - shot deal and it's already incredibly messed up , in my opinion .
When are the Democrats going to take REAL action and not just threaten to do their duty , in letters ?
I feel no one should have to comply with a subpoena now that Rove and Miers ignored theirs , not once , but several times , with absolutely no consequences !

I would really like to know just exactly what ALL of the terms that were agreed to are .
It seems to me this will be another Dog and Pony Show with NO meaningful results .
This statement " It was agreed that invocations of official privileges would be significantly limited " seems to allow plenty of wiggle room for Rove and Myers to talk and say NOTHING .

Correct me if I 'm wrong ?
does 'nt the congress judicuary represent the people of the u.s.?
and we the people want these hearings out in the open .
not behind closed doors .
thats how all this mess started in the first place .
( behind ) closed doors and away from the public .
Chairman coyners are you listening to the people you represent .

When is this " transcribed testimony " supposed to take place ?
In a week , a few weeks , a month , a few months .... WHEN ?
No one seems to know .
meanwhile , Rove walks around like the king of the hill , taking deliberate shots at President Obama , Obama 's cabinet , and the Democrats in Congress .
Looks like he already KNOWS that this " transcribed testimony " will be a cake walk , with some invocations of privilege still allowed !
WHAT privileges ?
Bush said many times that no one spoke to HIM about the U.S. Attorney firings or about Gov. Siegelman ... so where 's the " privilege " ... when this farce begins ?
Are n't those 2 things Rove has agreed to ' testify " about ?

The next con is underway and by the time you figure that one out it will be too late as well .
You 're screaming for a conviction that if it ever occurs will amount to a slap on the wrist and laughing behind closed doors .
These people are all puppets .
Presidents even dictators are all someone 's puppet .

Stop watching TV and let their ratings drop .
Start demanding paper ballots .

A new analysis of puzzling gullylike features on Mars offers further evidence that water flowed on the Red Planet 's surface , perhaps as recently as several hundred thousand years ago .
The findings bolster the case that melting snow from a departed Martian ice age carved these gullies , rather than shifting sands or other " dry " phenomena .
The paper , published today in the journal Geology , examines one of the many gullies on crater and valley walls visible in satellite images of the Martian surface .
The cause and age of these channels are the subject of debate .
To help settle the matter , the paper 's authors relied on a bit of geologic good luck to date one of the features .
Images snapped by the HiRISE ( High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ) camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed a typical gully system about 0.62 mile ( one kilometer ) long with a deltalike fan at its bottom — similar to features on Antarctic Dry Valleys and on dry mountains after rain in the U.S. Southwest .
The researchers noticed an array of craters dotting the delta's western portion [ lower left in the photograph ] and suspected that a large meteorite impact had peppered the area with ejected rocks to form these so - called secondary craters .
Sure enough , the pattern of pockmarks led like a trail of bread crumbs to a large impact crater some 62 miles ( 100 kilometers ) southwest .
Infrared imaging assisted in matching the impact events .
" We had hoped to find the source of these secondary craters , and voilà , we found a link to this big crater , " says lead study author Samuel Schon , a graduate student at Brown University 's Planetary Geosciences Group .
To estimate the age of planetary surfaces , geologists look to craters .
Earth , with its active tectonics and dynamic weather , has few impact craters on its relatively young surface ; Earth 's weatherless , geologically dead moon , however , is heavily cratered and has very old surfaces ( except where ancient lava flows formed large , flat , dark areas called maria , or " seas " ) .
Because much of the rest of the studied Martian gully system is craterless [ at right in the photograph ] , those areas are believed to be geologically younger than the cratered portions , Schon says .
By dating the primary Martian crater that sprayed the gully to 1.25 million years old — which qualifies as very young in Mars 's 4.6 - billion - year history —
Schon and his colleagues demonstrated that an estimated three subsequent outflows in the gully system must be younger than the first , which was bombarded by ejecta .
" Dating these gullies has been a big problem , " says Michael Meyer , lead scientist for NASA 's Mars Exploration Program .
" But because these guys dated the nearby crater , you have proof that the water activity is recent . "
Today , virtually all water on Mars is believed to be trapped underground or frozen near the poles , where the Phoenix lander found ice mere inches under the soil this past summer .
Unresolved research , though , has hinted at very recent water activity on Mars — within the past decade .
A tantalizing ribbon of light - colored material mimicking water flow appeared in satellite images of a crater wall sometime between 1999 and 2005 .
But materials scientists have shown that avalanching sands can also create this effect , and later studies cast doubt on water as the culprit .
For this newly studied gully system , the evidence of multiple outflows discredits drifting sands , and the classic alluvial pattern of the delta does not fit with sedimentary shifts , Schon says .
Jack Holt , a geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin , agrees " melting an ice deposit caused by an ice age seems like a more feasible scenario . "
Mars has an axial tilt ( similar to Earth 's ) that causes seasons , but the Red Planet wobbles more on its axis than Earth does because it lacks the gravitational stabilization that our relatively large moon provides .
Coupled with a more elliptical orbit than Earth , Mars likely has major swings in climate and temperature over short spans of geologic time .
Other recent discoveries , including massive Martian glaciers still present under blankets of crustal debris in the mid-latitudes , support theories of past ice ages on the Red Planet .
" This new study is yet more strong evidence for widespread deposition of ice during a different climatic regime , " says Holt , who led the glacier work .
Due to frigid surface temperatures and low atmospheric pressure , liquid water could not persist for long on Mars 's surface nowadays .
But scientists continue to hunt for signs of liquid water in the recent and distant past — not least for the clues they may provide about the possible development of extraterrestrial life when Mars 's climate was more hospitable .
" We think the heyday for water on Mars was over three billion years ago , " Schon says .
" With this gully system , we 're talking about a relative trickle compared to then , but nonetheless , this happened , and now we know when . "
China says it aims to build Shanghai into an international financial hub by 2020 to reflect the nation 's economic strength and the rising status of its currency .
The country 's largest city will develop a multi- layered financial market system and promote the opening up of the financial services sector in coming years , the Chinese Government said .
Leaders also aim to make Shanghai an international shipping centre by 2020 , the Cabinet said in a statement .
Experts say one of the biggest obstacles to Shanghai 's ambitions to be an international finance centre are the tight restrictions on moving money in and out of China .
As a small step toward making the yuan an international currency , Beijing said in December it would be used on a trial basis to settle accounts between select Chinese industrial areas and Hong Kong .
The 10 - member Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) may join the pilot project later .
State media reported in February that Shanghai - based Bank of Communications and Shanghai branches of Bank of China - the nation 's largest foreign exchange bank - would launch the trial soon .

Tonight on his show Hardball Chris Matthews clarified what he meant last night when an open mic caught him whispering oh God as Bobby Jindal came out to deliver the Republican response to President Obama ’s speech last night .
Here is the clip :
Advertisements
According to the NYT Caucus Blog , Matthews expanded on what he found so distasteful last night , “ That scene in the Louisiana governor ’s mansion — Governor Bobby Jindal walking from somewhere in the back of this narrow hall , this winding staircase looming there , the odd antebellum look of the scene — some people heard my reaction at the time .
What was the message in all this ?
Was this some mimicking of a president walking along the state floor to East Room ?
And at the same time the Republicans are so far from Washington they ca n’t be blamed for anything ? ”
It think that Jindal was trying to mimic the walk that the president usually makes from the East Room of the White House to the podium when they are about to make an important statement .
Although as you can see from the clip , this ended up looking more amateurish than presidential , the lighting was bad , and Jindal ’s walk to the podium reminded me more of how a car salesman approaches a browser on the lot than a potential president .
If there is one thing that Chris Matthews hates it is poor political presentation , and there is no doubt that is what he was trying to express here .
He was also making a mountain out of a molehill in traditional Matthews fashion .
It was n’t the antebellum scene or any of the other b.s. that he wants to throw out there .
It only took a few seconds to see that Jindal was way over matched .
What Jindal went through last night reminded me of some of the painful staging that John McCain endured during last year ’s campaign .
My question is , when did Republicans lose their flare for staging , because for well over a year now the GOP events have looked like public access television .
WEST OLIVE -- Both students and the president of Grand Valley State University on Monday demanded answers from police into last week 's shooting of GVSU student Derek Copp during a drug raid .
Students and others protested outside Ottawa County Sheriff 's Department , while President Thomas Haas said in an email to students and staff that authorities should explain why Derek Copp , 20 , was shot Wednesday night in his off - campus apartment during a drug raid by the West Michigan Enforcement Team .
Larger view of photos
" I want to know what brought the Enforcement Team to Derek 's apartment and why a firearm was discharged , " Haas said in an email to faculty and students sent Monday morning .
" The fact that this incident took place off - campus diminishes neither my interest nor my concern , " Haas said .
" I thought it best to ... put out a letter to the Michigan State Police so that they understood that I would want and expect the information ... that as the ( college 's ) president , I would want that information . "
The protesters , chanting and carrying signs , were n't as polite , but the event stayed peaceful , with a handful meeting with sheriff 's Lt. Mark Bennett .
They left without additional details , but with assurances that results of investigations by the Sheriff 's Department and state police would eventually be released .
Police also offered to meet with student representatives .
" Trust me , we want to get this thing completed , get the answers to the community as quickly as possible , " Bennett said .
Moments earlier , protesters chanted , " We want the truth , " while others shouted , " Justify the shooting , Ottawa County , " and " Why was my friend shot , Ottawa County ? "
Protest outside Ottawa County Sheriff 's office
Some held signs that said , " I 'm unarmed .
Are you going to shoot me ? "
Bennett acknowledged protesters ' frustrations and anger , but provided no specifics on the shooting , because it is subject to an internal investigation as well as the state police probe .
No timetable was set .
" I want to make sure you folks have the opportunity to have your voices heard , " he said .
Many students questioned the response of the undercover drug team .
No one , they said , should find it unusual that marijuana turns up at college .
" We really want people to be safe , " said Vanessa Crowley , a GVSU senior .
" ( Copp ) was non-violent , he was unarmed , he was no threat whatsoever . "
Greg Hatt , a former student who helped organize the protest , was among many who think that marijuana laws should be changed .
He said the shooting should serve as a " catalyst for ending the drug war .
...
This is not an isolated event . "
S. Daniel Carter , director of public policy at Security on Campus , " The whole community has a lot of interest ( and ) there clearly needs to be an investigation of what happened .
...
Did the law enforcement officer or officers have a legitimate reason to think they were in danger and did they follow procedure established ... by their department for use of lethal force ?
" That 's the main question , " Carter said .

( CNN ) --
Seven hours of surgery and four teams of surgeons were needed to stabilize a Connecticut woman attacked by a pet chimpanzee , doctors at Stamford Hospital said Wednesday .
Police say Travis , seen here as a younger chimp , was like a child to his owner , Sandra Herold .
Dr. Kevin Miller said Charla Nash , 55 , remains in critical but stable condition after her friend 's pet chimp , once featured in TV commercials for Coca - Cola and Old Navy , attacked her Monday .
Nash , 55 , had just arrived at the home of her friend , Sandra Herold , 70 , when the chimp , named Travis , jumped on her and began biting and mauling her , said Stamford Police Capt .
Rich Conklin .
Conklin said the attack was unprovoked , and he described it as " brutal and lengthy . "
Miller said Nash 's vital signs are improving but that she received extensive injuries to her face and hands .
Miller said she is making good , but small , progress after being treated by hand specialists and plastic surgeons , as well as specialists in ophthalmology , orthopedics and trauma .
Nash 's twin brother , Mike Nash , also spoke at the news conference and he thanked the community for their outpouring of support .
" It should be known , " he said , " that people who were complete strangers to us prior to this have selflessly offered their assistance to our family . "
Watch expert talk about keeping wild animals as pets »
Herold had called Nash to her house to help get 14 - year - old Travis back inside after he used a key to escape .
While her friend was being attacked , Herold unsuccessfully tried to pull the primate off her .
She then called 911 before stabbing the chimp with a butcher knife and hitting him with a shovel .
Herold said her actions did n't stop Travis ' rampage , though she said he gave her a look that said , " Why did you do it , mom ? "
Stamford police released the emotional 911 recordings from Monday 's attack where Herold can be heard screaming , " The chimp killed my friend " and " He 's ripping her apart . "
Herold pleads with the dispatcher for police to " please hurry " to save her friend from the beating .
At one point , she even yells for the police to shoot the chimp to stop the attack .
A Stamford police officer later shot the chimp multiple times in close proximity after the primate went after him while he was inside a police cruiser , Conklin said .
Travis returned to the house , where police later found him dead .
Conklin estimated that Travis weighed nearly 200 pounds .
Conklin could n't confirm media reports that the chimp had Lyme disease , though he did say investigators were taking their time with the case to determine what may have provoked Travis to attack Nash .
The police captain pointed out that Nash had recently gotten a haircut that had changed her appearance " significantly . "
Conklin said the chimp had been acting " rambunctious , " prompting Herold to put Xanax in a cup of tea for him to drink .
However , Herold told New York station WABC that the Xanax did n't dissolve in the tea , and she does n't believe Travis had any of the drug in his system .
Conklin said his department is not used to dealing with cases such as these , and they were taking their time to familiarize themselves with laws and regulations before deciding whether charges will be filed .
Travis ' body has been removed from the home and taken to two separate locations :
The head was taken to the state lab for a rabies test and the body was taken to the University of Connecticut for an animal autopsy .
Conklin said this is standard procedure .
The police captain said this is n't the first interaction his officers have had with Travis .
The chimp , which was well - known and liked in the community , escaped in 2003 and " wreaked havoc " on the streets of Stamford for a couple of hours .
Herold tearfully told reporters at her home that she slept with the chimp and that he was like a son to her .

Stan Lee recently announced that he just created the first gay superhero .
The character 's name is Thom Creed , a high school basketball player who hides his sexuality and superpowers .
Kind of like a superhuman Zac Efron in High School Musical .
Stan Lee is awesome but the guy cannot have that bad a memory .
Of course , there have been many gay superheroes over the past 30 years or so , but he 's probably saying that his is the first because the others are n't super - well known .
Well , here are just a few gay and lesbian heroes to geek out over : Northstar ( X - Men ) - Considered to be among the first gay superheroes to come out of the telephone booth , Northstar is a super - fast mutant in the X - Men universe , and has been a member of both the X - Men and Alpha Flight , a Canadian superhero team .
In the late 80's , Northstar contracted a ' mysterious illness ' -- it was going to be revealed as AIDS , but Marvel was really homophobic at the time .
So the illness was explained as the result of him being away from his homeland too long because , I 'm not making this up folks , Northstar was actually a magical fairy .
Thankfully they retconned all of that , so now he 's just a gay mutant , no Tinkerbell wings required .
Batwoman ( Batman ) - Ironically , Batwoman was created in the 50's as a love interest for Batman , specifically to disprove rumors about Batman and Robin 's special partnership .
She was killed off in the 80's , because nobody gave a shit about Batwoman , and therefore was easy to axe .
In an effort to diversify their characters , DC re-launched Batwoman in 2006 as a super - hot Jewish lesbian .
She dated Gotham Police detective Renee Montoya , who 's also hot .
Though some have complained , my dreams have not .
Apollo and Midnighter ( The Authority ) - These are two Wildstorm / DC characters from a book called The Authority , created by Warren Ellis , who mirror the far more famous Superman and Batman .
Apollo is solar powered , super strong and practically invulnerable .
Midnighter is a masked , all - black wearing badass .
However , a big difference is that Apollo and Midnighter are married and have an adopted daughter .
So now we know approximately what Batman and Superman would look like kissing , via these two characters .
Actually , the internet being what it is ...
Hulkling and Wiccan ( Young Avengers ) - Conceived in 2005 , shapeshifter Hulkling and spell - casting Wiccan are gay teen superheroes in the Marvel Universe .
They 're an outed gay couple , despite Hulkling being half - Skrull ( that would make for an interesting marriage ceremony ) .
Deadpool even joked about them in an issue , referring to Wiccan and Hulkling as " looking especially nubile . "
Or maybe he was n't joking ?
Pretty Much Everyone in Sailor Moon -
Okay , not everyone .
However , in Japan they have more relaxed attitude towards gay and lesbian couples , so while there 's fan speculation about every character being gay , there are two confirmed " canon " couplings : Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune , as well as bad guys Kunzite and Zoisite .
Also gay : dudes who watch Sailor Moon .
Some of them are REALLY unr$° %ble !
March 13 , 2009
Eric Toussaint and Damien Millet , of the Committee for the Abolition of Third World Debt ( CADTM , by its French initials ) , examine the renewed prominence of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund as the world economy sinks deeper into crisis .
THE INTERNATIONAL crisis that broke in summer 2008 demolished all the neoliberal dogmas and exposed the deception behind them .
Unable to deny their failure , the World Bank ( WB ) and International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) claim they no longer uphold the set of neoliberal policies known as the Washington consensus .
Yet discredited though they may be , these two institutions are using the international crisis to return to the limelight .
For decades , they have enforced the deregulation measures and structural adjustment programs that have led to the current impasse .
After this total fiasco , the WB and the IMF must now account for their decisions before world opinion .
In addition , their economic forecasts are less than reliable .
In November 2008 , the IMF predicted 2.2 percent global growth in 2009 , then downsized that to 0.5 percent in January , finally acknowledging it would be negative in March .
In reality , its experts are siding with major creditors against citizens whose fundamental rights are less and less respected .
IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn ( Remy Steinegger )
While the economic context is fast deteriorating , the world 's big moneylenders are trying to keep the upper hand while placing a discredited and de-legitimized IMF in the role of white knight -- helping the poor and downtrodden to face the damages wrought by this current crisis .
But the opposite is true .
The principles defended by the IMF since the 1980s , and denounced by CADTM since its inception , are still the same .
Governments that sign an agreement with the IMF in order to obtain a loan must still implement the same toxic recipes that aggravate the living conditions of their country 's people .
Responding to pressure from the IMF under the leadership of Dominique Strauss - Kahn , several countries faced with the consequences of the crisis have sliced workers ' wages and social benefits .
Latvia reduced its civil servants ' incomes by 15 percent , Hungary suppressed their 13th month pension ( after reducing retirement benefits as part of a former agreement ) , and Romania is about to move in the same direction .
The potion is so bitter that some governments are reluctant to administer it .
Ukraine recently declared the conditions imposed by the IMF to be " unacceptable , " especially the gradual raising of retirement age and increased housing costs .
IT IS high time to expose the doublespeak of the IMF and of IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss - Kahn , who on the one hand expect the international community to increase its efforts to reach the un-ambitious Millennium Development Goals , and on the other , compel governments calling upon IMF help to reduce the salaries of their civil servants .
This is the opposite of a policy genuinely aimed at facing the crisis while protecting the interests of its victims .
To respond to the crisis of the 1930s , and pressured by social mobilization , the U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt reduced working hours while maintaining salaries , social benefits and workers ' rights , such as the right to join trade unions .
With the New Deal , Roosevelt set up a tax reform that raised levies on capital .
Dominique Strauss - Kahn , a so - called " socialist , " hardly measures up to Roosevelt 's stature and persists against all odds in protecting the interests of the creditors who appointed him to this handsomely paid position .
Once more the IMF is shown to be a compliant instrument in the hands of those who are responsible for the current crisis .
In a period of severe monetary destabilization ( as evidenced by the huge variations in parity between the dollar and the euro over the past year ) , the IMF proves incapable of implementing a tax of the Tobin - Spahn kind that would reduce exchange rate variations by controlling speculation , and that would provide the funds needed to put an end to poverty and make development possible .
Since the IMF was founded in 1944 , its missions explicitly include promoting full employment , which means that the institution is in breach of its own statutes .
The global economic and financial crisis highlights the failure of the deregulated financial markets and freewheeling capital flow advocated by the IMF .
A new international architecture is called for , based on the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( 1966 ) and the UN Declaration on the Right to Development ( 1986 ) .
Yet this logic will not prevail while the balance of power remains unchanged .
Unless a sufficient number of governments respond to popular pressure and set up such an alternative , the World Bank and the IMF will be able to get over the current crisis , taking advantage of falling export commodity prices to bring weakened poor countries into a new state of loan dependency , with a central aim of saving the system , and not of meeting human and environmental criteria .
For all these reasons , the only acceptable solution is the immediate abolition of the IMF and the WB , and their replacement by radically different institutions that focus on satisfying fundamental human needs .

Update : Gamespot ’s been told work ’s been “ indefinitely suspended ” on the game .
Rumor has it that Sega ’s canceled Obsidian ’s upcoming Aliens RPG , resulting in 20 employees being laid off .
This all comes on the heels of Sega ’s announcement yesterday of a new Rebellion - developed Alien vs Predator for 2010 .
The title ’s confirmation would mean “ strategically updated ” release planning for Sega ’s other Aliens games , said the firm .
Look as though that may have meant “ off the map entirely , ” at least for the Obsidian project .
We ’ve mailed Sega and left phone messages so hopefully someone over there can confirm or deny this soon .
A man takes pictures of AIG Tower in Hong Kong , February 27 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Bobby Yip
( Reuters ) - American International Group Inc had warned of turmoil around the globe if the government allowed the insurer to fail when it appealed to U.S. regulators for its latest rescue , Bloomberg said citing an AIG presentation dated February 26 .
AIG needed immediate help from the Federal Reserve and Treasury to prevent a “ catastrophic ” collapse that would be worse for markets than the demise of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc , according to the 21 - page draft AIG presentation circulated among federal and state regulators , the agency reported .
“ What happens to AIG has the potential to trigger a cascading set of further failures which cannot be stopped except by extraordinary means , ” the agency quoted the presentation .
AIG warned its failure could cripple money - market funds , force European banks to raise capital , cause competing life insurers to fail and wipe out the taxpayers ’ stake in the firm , the agency said .
The presentation said without more U.S. help , investment losses would mean “ AIG will not be able to repay its obligations ” and that cash previously provided by the U.S. , which controls a 79.9 percent stake in the insurer , could be lost , it added .
AIG could not be immediately reached by Reuters for comment .
The Federal Reserve first rescued AIG in September with an $ 85 billion credit line after losses from toxic investments and collateral demands from banks left AIG facing bankruptcy .
Late last year , the rescue packaged was increased to $ 150 billion .
The bailout was overhauled again last week to offer the insurer an additional $ 30 billion in equity .
Biodegradable packaging designed by University of the Arts graduate student , Andrew Millar
Have you ever eaten at a fast food restaurant and noticed how much trash comes with your burger , drink and fries ?
University of the Arts graduate student , Andrew Millar has noticed the amount of trash and has designed an alternative eco-solution to this wasteful problem .
( Pics )
Between the paper bag , the burger paper wrap , the cup with the plastic top and straw , the napkins , the condiments leftovers and the French fry cartons there is a bunch of trash to dispose of .
That is just from one meal .
Now take into account how many people eat from McDonald ’s daily and add up their trash with yours .
That is a lot of trash ending up in the landfills .
That does n’t even include the energy used to make the packaging or the carbon footprint left from processing the food and so on .
The good news is that Andrew Millar has designed a biodegradable packaging idea for McDonald’s .
The biodegradable packaging is made from pulped and grass paper , “ which has naturally grease - resistant properties ” .
The cool thing about the packaging is that it folds out into a tray of sorts .
Miller came up with the idea after observing how people use their fast food packaging .
I ’ve done that .
I rarely eat at fast food restaurants , but when I do I use my bag as a plate / tray .
Then when I ’ve finished my meal I feel guilty about everything I end up throwing away in the trash and about what I put in my body .
If McDonald ’s and Andrew Millar ever make a deal to use this packaging material it may relieve some of this guilt ( probably not ) and , if nothing else , provide another environmentally friendly alternative to a fast food restaurant already taking steps to go green , at least that ’s what they say .
According to the McDonald ’s website , McDonald ’s has been taking green steps for more than 30 year by doing such things as taking energy conservation measures using packaging made of recycled material etc .
Can you imagine the positive environmental impact that would come to light if all fast food chains took greener steps ?

Something we love about Windows 7 is that it has much better native codec support , like H.264 and AAC .
But the price might be high :
It looks like Windows 7 might block third - party video decoders .

( Before we jump in , here 's our ultimate codec primer , if all this " code " talk is confusing . )
Here 's how a directshow developer lays it out : MPEG - 4 and H.264 codecs are hard baked into Media Foundation , and you can't override them , since Microsoft 's list of preferred codecs in the registry can't be edited , even in admin mode .
Which means basically that Microsoft has " blocked the possibility to use alternate codecs in their applications , " according to the developer , so you could n't use them in Windows Media Player or Windows Media Center .

The flip side is that we are talking about a beta ( the 7057 build , in between the public beta and the upcoming release candidate ) , not a final release , so maybe this wo n't apply in the final version of Windows if developers bitch loud enough .
Also , third - party applications should be able to find a workaround , postulates DigitalWerks , so VLC should be okay .
Oh , and with so much codec support built in , it 's likely the average person wo n't need third - party codecs anyway .
Still , pretty lame and non-open on Microsoft 's part if it stays this way .

At least 16 percent of motorists tool around without insurance , and a Michigan company says it has developed technology that allows police to easily identify and cite them .
InsureNet 's database would compile names , license plate numbers and other information about motorists and provide it to some 35,000 law agencies through a nationwide network linking local , state and federal law enforcement .
Cops and traffic cameras could use the information to instantly identify uninsured motorists .
InsureNet claims the system could save the insurance industry billions of dollars in fraud and generate hundreds of millions in ticket revenue .
It says Chicago and Mississippi are among those that may adopt the technology .
" Until now states have had very little opportunity to determine what vehicles on the road are insured , " Rowland Day , the company 's executive VP , told Wired.com .
" We have developed a system that has the ability to be effective on a national level and therefore beneficial to every state . "
All states require automobile insurance of some kind , but uninsured motorists generally are n't caught unless they 're stopped for another offense .
InsureNet would make it easier to identify them and create another use for the traffic and surveillance cameras blanketing many cities .
Civil libertarians warn such a system threatens our privacy and brings us closer to a surveillance state akin to England , where there 's a camera on nearly every corner .
The Insurance Status System compiles information provided by insurance companies and makes it available to police through the National Law
Enforcement Telecommunications System .
The secure network , launched in 1961 and based in Arizona , links law enforcement agencies nationwide , allowing them to instantly share information .
The Insurance Research Council estimates one in every six drivers on the road next year wo n't have insurance .
That number is expected to climb if the recession lingers and the unemployment rate rises .
Moreover , these uninsured drivers boost the premiums of everyone else by requiring them to carry uninsured motorist coverage , says David Corum , research council vice president .
Corum would n't say whether he thinks InsureNet is a good idea , but he did tell Wired.com that it could be tough to execute .
" While theoretically the system might work , it would be difficult to make sure that all the insurance data collected by InsureNet is current , " he said .
" Logistically speaking , insurance companies must deal with a great deal of lag time when collecting information .
Relaying that information to another company might seem simple , but I would n't assume it to be . "
The American Insurance Association expressed concern about the security of InsureNet 's system .
" Despite there never being a major breach of the databases of any of the insurance companies in America , we would be very concerned about such a system 's ability to maintain the protection of an individual 's information , " said David Snyder , the association 's vice president .
Just 13 states require insurance companies to report customers ' names and license plate numbers .
Illinois is not among them , but InsureNet recently pitched its system to the Chicago City Council Transportation Committee anyway .
Company officials told the panel the National Insurance Status System could generate " well in excess of $ 100 million " in ticket revenue for the city , according to the Chicago Sun -Times .
The system would use the city 's 132 traffic cameras to identify scofflaws .
If a camera snapped a picture of an uninsured vehicle , the registered owner would get a citation in the mail .
The state 's mandatory insurance law carries a $ 500 fine .
If the city levied a $ 300 fine , it could generate more than $ 100 million annually , the Sun - Times reports .
The Illinois chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union denounced the system as a threat to privacy .
" We are are deeply troubled by this , " spokesman Ed Young told Wired.com .
" It seems there is no scheme too outlandish or wild for the city of Chicago in terms of public surveillance .
What concerns us most is that the Committee of Transportation even considered generating revenue with fines that would n't be based on illegal driving .
Such a system would begin to feel like perpetual surveillance . "
The transportation committee took no action on the proposal , but InsureNet told Wired.com that Mississippi is interested in the system and that it expects other states to follow suit .

D.L. Hughley talks to Crazy for God author Frank Schaeffer , whose father was one of the founders of the religious right .
Schaeffer discusses his articles at the Huffington Post Why Obama Must Not Work With Republicans and Why Are the Republicans Such Anti-Obama Liars ?.
From the latter :
So , what is the problem with lying to our faces , say , claiming that all American 's taxes are going up when 95 % of American 's taxes are going to go down ?
Why not claim Obama is a socialist , even if he 's not ?
Why not say anything at all to drive our country into a pit when losing is seen as winning ?
That , is all the Republicans have to offer America : more lies on a path to destruction from which the Republican " leadership " plans to resurrect themselves and " save " America from Obama .
The Republican religious nuts are rooting for Jesus to " rapture " them , not for America , and the neoconservatives are rooting for war and the Israeli hard liners , not for America .
Truth ( and sanity ) are out the window .
Do n't conservative Republicans object to the lies ?
No , because the Republicans do n't have any actual and traditional conservative followers left .
The Republican base is now made up of religious and neoconservative ideologues , and the uneducated white underclass with a token person of color or two up front on TV to obscure the all - white , all reactionary all backward -- there - is - no - global - warming -- rube reality .
Actual conservatives , let alone the educated classes , have long since fled .
Today the Republican Party is rooting for doom .
And since the Republicans are now anti-American members of an Obama - must - fail insurgency , lies become a self - fulfilling prophecy : talk doom , and keep the economy in a panic and we may get what we wish for .
Updated : Full Transcript to follow .
HUGHLEY : James Dobson , a prominent voice of the evangelical movement recently stepped down as chairman of Focus on the Family .
So who was left to lead the religious right ?
Joining me now is a former evangelist and author " Crazy for God , " Frank Schaeffer .
How are you doing , Frank ?
It seems as if President Bush was the perfect candidate for the religious right .
He was born - again , he was an evangelical , he was an End of Days believer .
So the Republican , evangelical right got what they wanted .
What went wrong ?
FRANK SCHAEFFER , AUTHOR , " CRAZY FOR GOD " :
Well , first of all , he was unqualified to be president .
HUGHLEY : All he had to do was believe in Jesus , right ?
SCHAEFFER : That 's right .
That 's why he got elected .
You saw this in the last election when Sarah Palin was introduced as the vice presidential candidate for McCain .
The only reason he picked her is because she was another born - again Christian and he thought he would throw that sop to the religious right .
So the game continued but this time it did n't work because people had it for voting for people just on the basis of their belief in kind of a fundamentalist Christianity .
HUGHLEY : But you -- you grew up that way ?
SCHAEFFER : Yeah .
HUGHLEY : Your father was instrumental in the evangelical movement .
SCHAEFFER : My father was someone who was key to the formation of the religious right .
In the 1970s and ' 80s , for people who know about that little subculture in our country , Francis and Edith Schaeffer were very big names .
And " Crazy for God , " my book , talked about what it was like to grow up in that home .
And later as we became involved , palling around with the Bush family , dad going to the Reagan White House a number of times and meeting with the president about pro-life issues and all of these other things , that 's the world I grew up in .
And then as an adult , I really began to have second thoughts about where the religion right was going .
Essentially , if I could put it this way , moved away from that background and politically changed sides .
So , for instance , recently I have been one of the bloggers on Huffington Post and other places that have been supporting the Obama candidacy from the very beginning .
And for ...
HUGHLEY : ( inaudible ) thing .
SCHAEFFER : And for me to be doing that , if you asked me 25 years ago would I be doing this , I would have thought you were crazy .
That 's how people can change .
So I changed my mind .
HUGHLEY : But your father , who was so integral in starting the evangelical movement , what would he think of the new you ?
Of the more ...
SCHAEFFER :
You know , in some ways , he would be pleased .
Because my dad was very interested in the human life issue of abortion .
But when it comes to things like gay bashing , political correctness on the right wing issues , starting the war in Iraq for bad reasons or no reasons , my father would not have been going along with that .
So where the religious right went , which was to turn into this kind of hard - assed neo fascist kind of direction in America that has given us eight years of a bad presidency , a collapsed economy , two wars , one of which we should n't have been in .
By the way , my son was a United States Marine .
So I talk with no apology about what I think about the war .
HUGHLEY : You saw what an apology can get you in trouble .
SCHAEFFER : He was out there getting shot at .
So I can say what I think about it .
And the fact of the matter is , I think we have come through a very , very bad time and unfortunately , I 'm sorry to say , my dad and I , when I was a young man and he in his career had a lot to do with it .
Because we were the people , who along with others like James Dobson , Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell and the others , we put all of this crap in place .
And now the reason I wrote " Crazy for God " is because the title is literally that if awe approach God in a certain way , it will drive you crazy .
And this has been a period of craziness .
HUGHLEY : And you have said some -- you do blog for the Huffington Post .
You have written some things and I have read you for a little while .
You have written some things that I never heard anybody say out loud .
You said the Republican base is now made up of religious and neoconservative ideologues and the uneducated white underclass was a token person of color or up two up in front of the " TV to obscure the all - white , all reactionary , all backward , and there is no global warming , rube reality .
Actual conservatives , let alone the educated class have long since fled . "
You believe everybody in the Republican Party is a neocon or an ideologue .
SCHAEFFER : I 'd put it differently .
I 'd say the Republican Party knows that 's who that their base is .
There are individuals , private citizens ...
HUGHLEY : You mean elected people .
SCHAEFFER : I 'm talking either the elected people fall into one of those two categories .
Either they are pandering to the religious right -- I do n't know what they believe , of course .
I can't get into their head .
They are pandering to the religion out right or they are pandering to the neocons to whom every war is a good war .
And there is very little room in between .
And the people , for instance like William F. Buckley , who was a friend of my dad's , or Barry Goldwater .
You could have disagreed or agreed with them .
But these were not crazy people .
These were not Fruit Loops .
HUGHLEY : They wanted a separation of church and state .
SCHAEFFER : Right .
They wanted a separation of church and state .
They were not using politics to beat people over the head with a moral crusade .
They were not looking to start wars for no reason .
We moved from a period where the Republicans represented something you could agree or disagree with , to a period where it represents a kind of fundamentalist Christianity on one side and a view of the world , which sees everyone who is other , whether that is black , white , Arab , Muslim , a different country , gay , as the enemy .
And basically that 's a very dangerous position .
And so I think when you look at a guy like Rush Limbaugh today , what you 're seeing is the lid off .
This is the raw , naked true face of where Republicanism is .
And be my guest , if people want to vote for that , fine .
We just had eight years of this that drove us over the cliff and you want to keep going over the clip , fine .
But as far as I 'm concerned , the greatest miracle , speaking of God because I 'm still a religious person what has happened happen ed in any lifetime , is the election of Barack Obama .
Who I think is in a position to genuinely turn this country around .
It 's going to take a while but I 'm tremendously optimistic about what he can do .
HUGHLEY : That 's an amazing thing .
In your letter .
You wrote an open letter to President Obama .
You asked him not to even count on Republican backing .
SCHAEFFER : Right .
HUGHLEY : You say that they hate him .
SCHAEFFER : They do hate him .
HUGHLEY : They hate him .
SCHAEFFER : They do hate him .
HUGHLEY : That 's pretty strong .
SCHAEFFER : Rush Limbaugh 's telling the truth when he says he wants him to fail .
These people are ideological enough that they would rather take our whole country down and be proven right than be patriotic Americans and stand up and do the thing that every American ought to do right now , which is support the president , whether you voted for him or not .
( APPLAUSE )
HUGHLEY : Why -- why then are men like Rush Limbaugh and a woman like Ann Coulter so tremendously popular ?
Why then ?
It makes me as an American go , this is how a large percentage of the country feels .
SCHAEFFER : No , do n't think so .
I think if people read my book , they 're going to see that the religious right started with good intentions .
And then was manipulated by very crass people who have taken it in a different direction for personal gain .
Today you have about 20 million people who buy all of Ann Coulter 's books , watch Rush Limbaugh .
Send money into the televangelists .
It 's all the same people .
The fact of the matter is , there are 300 million of us .
There 's no 20 million of us .
The truth is I failed every math class .
But somebody in the audience will tell us what the percentage of 20 million of 300 million .
It 's not a big percentage .
It 's just a loud percentage .
This is the drunk on the subway making trouble in the car for all of the people on the subway .
There are 100 decent citizens on there , there is one ass in the front that 's molesting women .
That 's the Republican Party now in terms of the loud car .
HUGHLEY : I 'm going to get in trouble again , are n't I ?
SCHAEFFER :
The difference is , I 'm not apologizing or kissing Rush Limbaugh 's butt .
Though there is quite a bit to kiss .
HUGHLEY : Thank you very much .
Frank Schaffer , thank you so much .
Thank you so much .
Obama on Israel - Palestine
Noam Chomsky
chomsky.info , January 24 , 2009
Barack Obama is recognized to be a person of acute intelligence , a legal scholar , careful with his choice of words .
He deserves to be taken seriously — both what he says , and what he omits .
Particularly significant is his first substantive statement on foreign affairs , on January 22 , at the State Department , when introducing George Mitchell to serve as his special envoy for Middle East peace .
Mitchell is to focus his attention on the Israel - Palestine problem , in the wake of the recent US - Israeli invasion of Gaza .
During the murderous assault , Obama remained silent apart from a few platitudes , because , he said , there is only one president — a fact that did not silence him on many other issues .
His campaign did , however , repeat his statement that “ if missiles were falling where my two daughters sleep , I would do everything in order to stop that . ”
He was referring to Israeli children , not the hundreds of Palestinian children being butchered by US arms , about whom he could not speak , because there was only one president .
On January 22 , however , the one president was Barack Obama , so he could speak freely about these matters — avoiding , however , the attack on Gaza , which had , conveniently , been called off just before the inauguration .
Obama ’s talk emphasized his commitment to a peaceful settlement .
He left its contours vague , apart from one specific proposal : “ the Arab peace initiative , ” Obama said , “ contains constructive elements that could help advance these efforts .
Now is the time for Arab states to act on the initiative ’s promise by supporting the Palestinian government under President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad , taking steps towards normalizing relations with Israel , and by standing up to extremism that threatens us all . ”
Obama is not directly falsifying the Arab League proposal , but the carefully framed deceit is instructive .
The Arab League peace proposal does indeed call for normalization of relations with Israel — in the context — repeat , in the context of a two - state settlement in terms of the longstanding international consensus , which the US and Israel have blocked for over 30 years , in international isolation , and still do .
The core of the Arab League proposal , as Obama and his Mideast advisers know very well , is its call for a peaceful political settlement in these terms , which are well - known , and recognized to be the only basis for the peaceful settlement to which Obama professes to be committed .
The omission of that crucial fact can hardly be accidental , and signals clearly that Obama envisions no departure from US rejectionism .
His call for the Arab states to act on a corollary to their proposal , while the US ignores even the existence of its central content , which is the precondition for the corollary , surpasses cynicism .
The most significant acts to undermine a peaceful settlement are the daily US - backed actions in the occupied territories , all recognized to be criminal : taking over valuable land and resources and constructing what the leading architect of the plan , Ariel Sharon , called “ Bantustans ” for Palestinians — an unfair comparison because the Bantustans were far more viable than the fragments left to Palestinians under Sharon ’s conception , now being realized .
But the US and Israel even continue to oppose a political settlement in words , most recently in December 2008 , when the US and Israel ( and a few Pacific islands ) voted against a UN resolution supporting “ the right of the Palestinian people to self - determination ” ( passed 173 to 5 , US - Israel opposed , with evasive pretexts ) .
Obama had not one word to say about the settlement and infrastructure developments in the West Bank , and the complex measures to control Palestinian existence , designed to undermine the prospects for a peaceful two - state settlement .
His silence is a grim refutation of his oratorical flourishes about how “ I will sustain an active commitment to seek two states living side by side in peace and security . ”
Also unmentioned is Israel ’s use of US arms in Gaza , in violation not only of international but also US law .
Or Washington ’s shipment of new arms to Israel right at the peak of the US - Israeli attack , surely not unknown to Obama ’s Middle East advisers .
Obama was firm , however , that smuggling of arms to Gaza must be stopped .
He endorses the agreement of Condoleeza Rice and Israeli foreign minister Tzipi Livni that the Egyptian - Gaza border must be closed — a remarkable exercise of imperial arrogance , as the Financial Times observed : “ as they stood in Washington congratulating each other , both officials seemed oblivious to the fact that they were making a deal about an illegal trade on someone else ’s border —
Egypt in this case .
The next day , an Egyptian official described the memorandum as `fictional ’. ”
Egypt ’s objections were ignored .
Returning to Obama ’s reference to the “ constructive ” Arab League proposal , as the wording indicates , Obama persists in restricting support to the defeated party in the January 2006 election , the only free election in the Arab world , to which the US and Israel reacted , instantly and overtly , by severely punishing Palestinians for opposing the will of the masters .
A minor technicality is that Abbas ’s term ran out on January 9 , and that Fayyad was appointed without confirmation by the Palestinian parliament ( many of them kidnapped and in Israeli prisons ) .
Ha’aretz describes Fayyad as “ a strange bird in Palestinian politics .
On the one hand , he is the Palestinian politician most esteemed by Israel and the West .
However , on the other hand , he has no electoral power whatsoever in Gaza or the West Bank . ”
The report also notes Fayyad ’s “ close relationship with the Israeli establishment , ” notably his friendship with Sharon ’s extremist adviser Dov Weiglass .
Though lacking popular support , he is regarded as competent and honest , not the norm in the US - backed political sectors .
Obama ’s insistence that only Abbas and Fayyad exist conforms to the consistent Western contempt for democracy unless it is under control .
Obama provided the usual reasons for ignoring the elected government led by Hamas .
“ To be a genuine party to peace , ” Obama declared , “ the quartet [ US , EU , Russia , UN ] has made it clear that Hamas must meet clear conditions : recognize Israel ’s right to exist ; renounce violence ; and abide by past agreements . ”
Unmentioned , also as usual , is the inconvenient fact that the US and Israel firmly reject all three conditions .
In international isolation , they bar a two - state settlement including a Palestinian state ; they of course do not renounce violence ; and they reject the quartet ’s central proposal , the “ road map . ”
Israel formally accepted it , but with 14 reservations that effectively eliminate its contents ( tacitly backed by the US ) .
It is the great merit of Jimmy Carter ’s Palestine : Peace not Apartheid , to have brought these facts to public attention for the first time — and in the mainstream , the only time .
It follows , by elementary reasoning , that neither the US nor Israel is a “ genuine party to peace . ”
But that can not be .
It is not even a phrase in the English language .
It is perhaps unfair to criticize Obama for this further exercise of cynicism , because it is close to universal , unlike his scrupulous evisceration of the core component of the Arab League proposal , which is his own novel contribution .
Also near universal are the standard references to Hamas : a terrorist organization , dedicated to the destruction of Israel ( or maybe all Jews ) .
Omitted are the inconvenient facts that the US - Israel are not only dedicated to the destruction of any viable Palestinian state , but are steadily implementing those policies .
Or that unlike the two rejectionist states , Hamas has called for a two - state settlement in terms of the international consensus : publicly , repeatedly , explicitly .
Obama began his remarks by saying : “ Let me be clear : America is committed to Israel ’s security .
And we will always support Israel ’s right to defend itself against legitimate threats . ”
There was nothing about the right of Palestinians to defend themselves against far more extreme threats , such as those occurring daily , with US support , in the occupied territories .
But that again is the norm .
Also normal is the enunciation of the principle that Israel has the right to defend itself .
That is correct , but vacuous : so does everyone .
But in the context the cliche is worse than vacuous : it is more cynical deceit .
The issue is not whether Israel has the right to defend itself , like everyone else , but whether it has the right to do so by force .
No one , including Obama , believes that states enjoy a general right to defend themselves by force : it is first necessary to demonstrate that there are no peaceful alternatives that can be tried .
In this case , there surely are .
A narrow alternative would be for Israel to abide by a cease - fire , for example , the cease - fire proposed by Hamas political leader Khaled Mishal a few days before Israel launched its attack on December 27 .
Mishal called for restoring the 2005 agreement .
That agreement called for an end to violence and uninterrupted opening of the borders , along with an Israeli guarantee that goods and people could move freely between the two parts of occupied Palestine , the West Bank and the Gaza Strip .
The agreement was rejected by the US and Israel a few months later , after the free election of January 2006 turned out “ the wrong way . ”
There are many other highly relevant cases .
The broader and more significant alternative would be for the US and Israel to abandon their extreme rejectionism , and join the rest of the world — including the Arab states and Hamas — in supporting a two - state settlement in accord with the international consensus .
It should be noted that in the past 30 years there has been one departure from US - Israeli rejectionism : the negotiations at Taba in January 2001 , which appeared to be close to a peaceful resolution when Israel prematurely called them off .
It would not , then , be outlandish for Obama to agree to join the world , even within the framework of US policy , if he were interested in doing so .
In short , Obama ’s forceful reiteration of Israel ’s right to defend itself is another exercise of cynical deceit — though , it must be admitted , not unique to him , but virtually universal .
The deceit is particularly striking in this case because the occasion was the appointment of Mitchell as special envoy .
Mitchell ’s primary achievement was his leading role in the peaceful settlement in northern Ireland .
It called for an end to IRA terror and British violence .
Implicit is the recognition that while Britain had the right to defend itself from terror , it had no right to do so by force , because there was a peaceful alternative : recognition of the legitimate grievances of the Irish Catholic community that were the roots of IRA terror .
When Britain adopted that sensible course , the terror ended .
The implications for Mitchell ’s mission with regard to Israel - Palestine are so obvious that they need not be spelled out .
And omission of them is , again , a striking indication of the commitment of the Obama administration to traditional US rejectionism and opposition to peace , except on its extremist terms .
Obama also praised Jordan for its “ constructive role in training Palestinian security forces and nurturing its relations with Israel ” — which contrasts strikingly with US - Israeli refusal to deal with the freely elected government of Palestine , while savagely punishing Palestinians for electing it with pretexts which , as noted , do not withstand a moment ’s scrutiny .
It is true that Jordan joined the US in arming and training Palestinian security forces , so that they could violently suppress any manifestation of support for the miserable victims of US - Israeli assault in Gaza , also arresting supporters of Hamas and the prominent journalist Khaled Amayreh , while organizing their own demonstrations in support of Abbas and Fatah , in which most participants “ were civil servants and school children who were instructed by the PA to attend the rally , ” according to the Jerusalem Post .
Our kind of democracy .
Obama made one further substantive comment : “ As part of a lasting cease - fire , Gaza ’s border crossings should be open to allow the flow of aid and commerce , with an appropriate monitoring regime É ” He did not , of course , mention that the US - Israel had rejected much the same agreement after the January 2006 election , and that Israel had never observed similar subsequent agreements on borders .
Also missing is any reaction to Israel ’s announcement that it rejected the cease - fire agreement , so that the prospects for it to be “ lasting ” are not auspicious .
As reported at once in the press , “ Israeli Cabinet Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer , who takes part in security deliberations , told Army Radio on Thursday that Israel would n’t let border crossings with Gaza reopen without a deal to free [ Gilad ] Schalit ” ( AP , Jan 22 ) ; ÔIsrael to keep Gaza crossings closed …
An official said the government planned to use the issue to bargain for the release of Gilad Shalit , the Israeli soldier held by the Islamist group since 2006 ( Financial Times , Jan. 23 ) ; “ Earlier this week , Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said that progress on Corporal Shalit ’s release would be a precondition to opening up the border crossings that have been mostly closed since Hamas wrested control of Gaza from the West Bank - based Palestinian Authority in 2007 ” ( Christian Science Monitor , Jan. 23 ) ; “ an Israeli official said there would be tough conditions for any lifting of the blockade , which he linked with the release of Gilad Shalit ” ( FT , Jan. 23 ) ; among many others .
Shalit ’s capture is a prominent issue in the West , another indication of Hamas ’s criminality .
Whatever one thinks about it , it is uncontroversial that capture of a soldier of an attacking army is far less of a crime than kidnapping of civilians , exactly what Israeli forces did the day before the capture of Shalit , invading Gaza city and kidnapping two brothers , then spiriting them across the border where they disappeared into Israel ’s prison complex .
Unlike the much lesser case of Shalit , that crime was virtually unreported and has been forgotten , along with Israel ’s regular practice for decades of kidnapping civilians in Lebanon and on the high seas and dispatching them to Israeli prisons , often held for many years as hostages .
But the capture of Shalit bars a cease - fire .
Obama ’s State Department talk about the Middle East continued with “ the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan and PakistanÉ the central front in our enduring struggle against terrorism and extremism . ”
A few hours later , US planes attacked a remote village in Afghanistan , intending to kill a Taliban commander .
“ Village elders , though , told provincial officials there were no Taliban in the area , which they described as a hamlet populated mainly by shepherds .
Women and children were among the 22 dead , they said , according to Hamididan Abdul Rahmzai , the head of the provincial council ” ( LA Times , Jan. 24 ) .
Afghan president Karzai ’s first message to Obama after he was elected in November was a plea to end the bombing of Afghan civilians , reiterated a few hours before Obama was sworn in .
This was considered as significant as Karzai ’s call for a timetable for departure of US and other foreign forces .
The rich and powerful have their “ responsibilities . ”
Among them , the New York Times reported , is to “ provide security ” in southern Afghanistan , where “ the insurgency is homegrown and self - sustaining . ”
All familiar .
From Pravda in the 1980s , for example .
If you were to transform this story into a movie and the line at the end of the credits read ,  This is based on a true story ,  no one would believe it .
Back in the 1950s , there was a top - secret program code - named SUNTAN being conducted at a top - secret facility called Skunk Works .
Its objective ?
To develop a liquid - hydrogen - powered spy plane .
Because liquid hydrogen is incredibly volatile , early experiments were conducted inside a bomb shelter with eight - foot - thick walls .
The engineer in charge built what he called his own hydrogen - liquefaction plant .
At first , tests began in Dixie cups , but before long the place was producing more liquid hydrogen than anywhere in America .
 We wore grounded shoes and couldnt carry keys or any metallic objects that might spark ,  he recalls .
 We installed a nonexplosive electrical system and used only nonsparking tools . 
Still , storing liquid hydrogen presents a very clear danger .
And in the spring of 1959 , a stove only 700 feet away from the tank caught fire .
Extinguishers were ineffective .
When local firefighters showed up , they didnt have top - secret security clearances , so according to the engineer , the facilitys guards wouldnt let them on site .
Fortunately , the hydrogen tank did not explode , but with the project capable of blowing up the surrounding area , it was deemed too dangerous to proceed .
The public was never the wiser , Project SUNTAN met its end , and Skunk Works returned millions in black operation money to the Air Force .
The thing is , that covert spy - plane project was but one in a long line of secret projects being worked on at the same hide - in - plain - sight location Burbank .
The facility was Lockheed Aircraft Corporation now Lockheed Martinand the engineer , later the director of Lockheeds supersecret division , was Ben Rich .
And all of this really did happen in beautiful downtown Burbank .
Colonized by a dentist in 1867 , its the sleepy L.A. suburb that , a century later , Johnny Carson would immortalize as the picture of normal and nondescript .
Who would have thought that in the 1950s , Burbank was a hotbed of international espionage ?
 It would have been hard for people to imagine the kinds of things we were doing there ,  says Edward Lovick , the 90 - year - old California physicist who worked at Lockheed in the Skunk Works facility ( also called Advanced Development Projects ) and would become known among colleagues as the grandfather of stealth .
After work on the liquid - hydrogen plane was halted , the goal for Skunk Works became developing an invisible aircraft invisible to radar , that is .
With stealth technology , the U.S. could spy on its Cold War adversaries without running the risk of getting caught .
These days , the idea of stealth bombers is business as usualheck , they even do flyovers at football games .
But back then , inventing the technology was a strictly clandestine activity .
So it was in Burbank that , beginning in 1958 , Lovick and a team of scientists and engineers indeed created the invisible airplane something all kids dream of but hardly imagine could be happening next door .
Even though the 2,000 mph aircraft , code - named OXCART , was developed back when Eisenhower was president , it was not declassified by the CIA until 2007 .
Like its predecessor the U - 2 spy plane , OXCART was a collaborative effort between the CIA , the U.S. Air Force and Lockheed .
Eisenhower had expressly put the CIA in charge because the Air Force was under tight congressional scrutiny , while the CIA could run OXCART as a black operation meaning covert and deniable .
Lovick , sporting a colorful Hawaiian shirt and khaki pants and observing the world through large , wire - rimmed glasses , now offers us his perspective on Burbank through the long lens of recollection .
He is seated in his home in the San Fernando Valley , surrounded by books , maps and small - scale models of the spy planes he worked on during his 40 - year career at Lockheed .
Quick - witted and endlessly full of ideas , Lovick and his wife , Sherre , also a former member of Skunk Works ( and the person who , on another project , made the window on the catamaran - like ship called Sea Shadow invisible to radar ) , have recently returned from a grand European tour .
 In the 1940s , Lockheed produced airplanes like the P - 38 Lightning , which helped us win the war ,  Lovick says .
 In the 1950s , Lockheed designed and built the famous U - 2 . 
In May , 1960 , Francis Gary Powers was shot down in a U - 2 over Russia , and the CIA knew it needed a better spy plane .
 Actually , the Russians had been tracking the U - 2 long before Powers was shot down .
It was only a matter of time before that happened , and the CIA knew it , which is why they had us working on a successor aircraft at the Skunk Works . 
The idea for the new spy plane , originally called the U - 3 , was to add stealth as an element from paper to plane . 
As Louis Pasteur once remarked ,  Fortune favors the prepared mind ,  and this was certainly true in Lovicks case .
He was Lockheeds radar and antennae expert at the time and had been working on microwave theory , which is an integral part of stealth , since it advanced as a new science after the war .
 Back then , few people cared much about this relatively new technology .
Most engineers were learning about wiring how power was generated and distributed .
I began lab experiments with microwave theory at Caltech , and it was there I learned how to guide wave energy through hollow pipes to a specific location .
My becoming an expert was simply a case of being the first one to know anything about it at Skunk Works . 
As Lockheeds radar man , Lovick grasped how an intimate theoretical knowledge of radar could help in designing a plane that could fool it .
So crucial was Lovicks work that he accompanied his Lockheed boss , legendary airplane designer Clarence L.  Kelly  Johnson , on trips to Washington , D.C. , for high - level meetings with the CIA .
 Right before Lockheed got the new [ spy - plane ] contract , we went to a hotel room for a meeting .
It was Kelly Johnson , a few science advisers to the president , someone from the CIA and myself .
Pillows were put over the heating vents , and the room was checked for bugs before any of us spoke ,  Lovick says .
 The CIA , who we called  the customer ,  was like that .
It seemed a little silly to me at the time . 
Before you snicker at the cloak and dagger , its important to remember that it was a tenuous time the height of the Cold War .
Both America and the Soviet Union were preoccupied with spying on each other .
The CIA required Lockheed employees to report if anyone foreign born tried to befriend them .
Word was that pay phones just outside the Burbank headquarters were routinely used by Russian spies hoping to eavesdrop on workers  private calls .
At the same time , each superpower was busy testing nuclear bombs .
When considering various forms of espionage available to the CIAhumans , spy planes and satellites ( which were then brand new ) aircraft provided a versatile means to secure the most accurate information in determining another countrys weapons capability .
Eisenhowers goal with the Lockheed spy -plane programs was to get more information on the Soviet Union than it had on us , all to prevent nuclear war .
The OXCART was able to take photographs showing clear lines in parking lots from 90,000 feet .
Lovick says he never felt pressure from Johnson , even though making the aircraft undetectable fell squarely on his desk .
 Kelly gave me access to all areas .
I was a little bit like a professor .
I would roam the Skunk Works buildings and talk to various people .
Everyone had knowledge .
Most of our advances on the low observables [ as in , stealth ] came from putting together these different ideas . 
If it is hard to imagine the birth of aerial espionage taking place in Burbank , its even harder to conceive the materials that helped deliver stealth technology to the world .
 There were no computers at our disposal ,  Lovick says .
 This meant we made all of our calculations on slide rules .
We mixed chemicals in vats .
We stomped on things like grape stompers .
The results of those hand calculations and old - school chemical trials were astonishing .
Not only did Skunk Works create the magic formula that is now known as stealth , but the OXCART flew three times faster than the speed of sound ( Mach 3.2 ) , at an altitude 16 miles above the earth .
Its state - of - the - art camera could capture 100,000 square miles of terrain per hour .
The design was so sophisticated that one of the companies involved remains classified to this day .
It was also Lovick who designed the first anechoic chamber , a shielded , echoless room that allows scientists to test how airplanes will react to radar in the atmosphere .
Now standard at all aircraft manufacturers , the one built by Lovick in Burbank was the first of its kind .
 It was so quiet in that chamber ,  he says ,  I could hear my blood flowing through my body . 
As  Cold War-era as these spy - plane projects may now seem , its another key element of aerial espionage born in Burbank that has since become the single most valuable means of surveillance the pilotless aircraft , or drone , code - named TAGBOARD .
Lockheeds D - 21 drone project , classified above top secret ,  was officially kept quiet until 2007 .
Lovick designed the planes antenna , which when it received the necessary signal , would cue the craft to launch off the back of the OXCART .
Because it flew without a pilot , the D - 21 was designed to fly over territory where the U.S. was denied access and to take photographs of weapons facilities from altitudes as low as 1,500 feet .
But the project was canceled on July 30 , 1966 , after a fatal accident at sea during the drones first official launch .
CIA test pilot Bill Park and flight engineer Ray Torick were flying the OXCART 150 miles off the Malibu coast .
A follow airplane and rescue boat were nearby .
The drone was designed to launch up and off the spy plane at Mach 3 , but on this night something went terribly wrong .
During separation , the drone pitched down and split the aircraft in half .
Park and Torick were trapped inside as it fell more than 20,000 feet .
Both managed to eject and fall though the air tethered to their parachutes remarkably escaping the falling debrisand both made successful water landings .
The rescue boat located Park , who was fine , but Torick apparently opened his visor upon landing , which caused his suit to fill with water , and he drowned .
Scientists and engineers at Skunk Works were devastated .
Lockheed canceled the program , and the CIA / Air Force continued to hone the technology in other programs .
But where would Lockheed flight - test its covert aircraft ?
Designing and building spy planes and drones in beautiful downtown Burbank may have been one of the centurys best - kept secrets , but there was no way to fly an oddly shaped , Mach - 3 aircraft over the San Fernando Valley without causing public alarm .
For that reason , the CIA had arranged for flight testing to begin at a secret military facility in the Nevada desert the place the world has come to know as Area 51 .

It ’s a well - know fact that children learn from their elders .
In some cases ( like racism and the harmonica ) this is a bad thing .
But most of the time ( for example , crapping in a toilet , or not saying racist things ... out loud ) these lessons are important and good .
Thanks to our parents , teachers and bosses , we kids have learned that it is n’t appropriate to walk around poking strangers .
That you should n’t rank your friends in terms of hotness , or show your coworkers pictures of yourself doing a kegstand .
While it ’s nice to buy a friend a drink , giving her a beer , friendship tea , chocolate cake , a snow globe , cuddly hugs , spring tulips , sushi , cowbell , and good karma , in the span of an hour it is a bit overkill .
These are lessons they impart to help us to be healthy , contributing members of society who do not get beat up on street corners or fired .
In the alternate social network of the internet , however , our elders are all sorts of clueless .
Like Brendan Fraser unleashed in New York , or Eddie Murphy unleashed in New York , or Will Ferrell unleashed in New York , or Adam Sandler unleashed in New York , they ’ve enthusiastically stumbled into the world wide web , licking every shiny object that falls in their path .
Behold the era of the wisdom of youth .

How about the 6 hours that YouTube went down in ’06 !?

We have a whole generation of people who do n’t remember when myspace was cool , or when lonelygirl15 was n’t ( known to be ) scripted .
A generation of people who have no idea that facebook.com was once thefacebook.com .

Researchers from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology have developed a method to eliminate the phenomenon of diffraction , which causes images imprinted on light rays and propagating in free space to lose their sharpness after a short distance .
Their research , which has recently been published in the scientific journal “ Physical Review Letters , ” unveils a special atomic medium in which optical diffraction is shown to be completely eliminated .
This method can improve optical microscopes and image recognition .

“ We are at the height of an information revolution and an enormous effort is being invested in improving technology for processing , transmitting , and storing information , ” the researchers explain .
“ One of the most fascinating research areas is all - optical data processing , in which researchers explore systems that process optical data without having to convert it to electronic or digital data .
These systems are expected to dramatically speed up data processing .
In particular , there is a lot of interest in transmission and processing of images .
One of the difficulties in implementing all - optical systems for image processing is the distortion that occurs to the images during their movement through open space due to diffraction .
The more data the image stores and the higher its resolution , the faster the distortion is .
In imaging systems , such as a camera or the eye , lenses are used in order to recover the original image , but such recovery depends on the quality and size of the lens and cannot be used in many cases . ”
The discovered atomic diffraction - free medium is called “ electromagnetically induced transparency medium . ”
Containing a diluted vapor of atoms at room temperature , it allows images to travel at a speed that is 100,000 times slower than the speed of light and utilize the thermal movement of the atoms in order to “ drag ” or “ push ” the light moving through them .
According to the researchers , by “ fine - tuning ” the nature of interaction between atoms and light , they have succeeded to cause the atoms to push the diffracted light rays back onto their original path .
This way , any image moving through such “ thermal medium ” will remain intact , unaffected by otherwise unavoidable distortions .
An explanation of the process

The scientists say their new technology can pave its way into many future applications , including optical correlation techniques , which aim to enable automatic identification of patterns , such as objects or people , in images .
“ For this purpose , it is necessary to slow down the image movement and prevent distortion caused by diffraction ” – explain the scientists .
“ In addition , by this means , it is possible to trap light rays in a small area inside the atomic vapor .
For optical microscopes , diffraction is one of the main limitations and preventing it will enable the improvement of the microscopes under certain conditions . ”
This research has been conducted by a team of scientists from the Technion , which includes doctoral student Ofer Firstenberg , Dr. Moshe Shuker , and Professor Amiram Ron , in collaboration with Professor Nir Davidson of the Weizmann Institute .
TFOT has previously covered a number of innovative research studies being conducted in the field of physics – including newly discovered single atom quantum dots that are able to control individual electrons and a research conducted at National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , which aims to model the center of a planet or star using laser - driven inertia confinement fusion techniques .
Source Citing : Making Examples
Work
Example is n’t another way to teach , it is the only way to teach .
( Albert Einstein )
If the example is correct , that is .
In every release .
So do n’t take chances .
Cite your examples from automated tests .
We ’ve all used products where the examples in the documentation simply did n’t work .
On quickly evolving products , this is almost a given .
At best , we ’re annoyed , but continue to use the product ; at worst , we stop using it .
People learn best from examples .
They ’ll scan documentation for example code , read it , and only resort to reading the surrounding text when the code is n’t clear to them by itself .
They ’ll often copy / paste this example code directly into their own projects and expect it to compile .
Examples are a crucial part of a user ’s early experience with your product .
When working on a hot , fast moving project , how can we developers ensure our documentation will help build trust and acceptance instead of putting people off ?
Why Examples Go Bad
Let ’s take a look at why examples in documentation go bad :
Some examples never were good ; this is the example code we type directly into the document – right out of our heads .
Such code – no matter how short – is rarely correct because we have come to rely on sophisticated IDEs to catch typos and other minor errors immediately .
While these IDEs free us to look at the bigger picture , we are no longer trained to automatically spot minor errors ourselves .
We have to actively look for them .
That is not what we do when we are – rightly – focused on writing good documentation .
Assuming the example code was both syntactically and semantically correct at some point , it can go out of date for a number of reasons :
The underlying API has changed so that the example code wo n’t even compile anymore .
Given the ease with which modern IDEs let us refactor , this happens much more quickly than you ’d think – especially on fast moving projects .
The “ release early , release often ” mantra implies that we also must document early , but that means that code in early stages of development is documented .
This kind of code goes through API changes often ( “ refactor constantly ” ) .
Even in later stages APIs can still change , though less drastically .
For example , if you deprecate elements within the API , you ’d like your examples to use the non-deprecated API , would n’t you ?
The semantics have changed so that the example code still compiles , but produces incorrect results at runtime .
These changes in semantics were intentional .
All the tests have been updated to reflect this .
It is just the example code that got out of date .
In both of the cases above it may even be the API or semantics of a third party library , which changed when you updated to a newer version .
Quality Assurance
Of course , in a project with ideal quality assurance , these problems are detected and corrected .
Right .
Maybe in some well funded and well managed projects .
In fact , the ideal API needs no documentation at all .
You should continue reading only if your project is not perfect .
In smaller , developer - driven projects , documentation often flounders .
There may have been a laudable initial attempt at good documentation , but keeping it current is just not a top priority – despite its critical effect on our potential users ’ first impression .
This is particularly true for many open source projects .
Why do we let errors in our documentation slip through ?
Because checking it quickly becomes very time consuming and tedious .
This is not the kind of task programmers typically excel at .
Often it ’s downright impossible to maintain .
Why is that ?
Snippets of example code from the documentation must be put into a larger , compilable and testable context for verification .
To test semantic correctness , the surrounding text must be read to see precisely what the snippet under test was supposed to do .
The documentation may have grown to the point where even just proofreading everything becomes prohibitive .
Our ever shorter development iterations , while otherwise beneficial , exacerbate the above problems even further .
A Note On Sample Applications
An approach often taken with example code is to provide complete sample applications for users to study .
These , however , suffer from a number of problems :
They often bury the salient points in lots of surrounding code .
They are not well suited to the inclusion of accompanying explanatory text .
Depending on the programming language , it is difficult to structure the example code for didactic effect .
A bunch of sample apps looks much less finished than well structured , nicely formatted documentation with embedded sample code .
Though complete sample apps are a worthy addition , they are only an addition .
And though they ostensibly compile on their own and can be included in release builds , they are still prone to failure if semantics change without accompanying syntactical changes .
It should be obvious by now .
What automated testing ( and unit testing in particular ) did for code quality , it will also have to do for documentation quality .
Only in this way can we keep the blessings of short iterations , constant refactoring and frequent releases whithout sacrificing the quality of our documentation .
So , how do we automatically test documentation ?
For a start , we can test the examples .
And that is likely the most important test we should have in our entire product anyway .
It does n’t matter if a test suite of thousands of tests runs “ all green ” if our users ca n’t use the product because the examples do n’t work .
For the moment , let ’s confine this discussion to API documentation and code examples – we ’ll expand it later .
Consider the following piece of documentation :
The separation of the Engine and Computation interfaces allows the concurrent use of an engine across multiple threads .
Each thread simply creates its own computations on the central engine .
Engines are thus fully thread - safe and non-blocking .
Engine engine = getEngine ( ) ; Inputs inputs = new Inputs ( 4 , 40 ) ; Outputs outputs = ( Outputs ) engine.newComputation ( inputs ) ; double result = outputs.getResult ( ) ;
How do we write an automated test for this fragment of code ?
By not writing it as a fragment at all .
Instead , we write a full test , like any other test we write , using our testing framework of choice .
Then we cite the relevant lines from this test in the documentation .
Since we write the test in our IDE , we enjoy all of its benefits when writing the code .
Here ’s the full test method :
public void testSample1 ( ) throws EngineError { // ---- sample1 Engine engine = getEngine ( ) ; Inputs inputs = new Inputs ( 4 , 40 ) ; Outputs outputs = ( Outputs ) engine.newComputation ( inputs ) ; double result = outputs.getResult ( ) ; // ---- sample1 assertEquals ( 160 , result ) ; }
JCite
In this example , I use JCite , an open source Java source code citation tool .
It relies on markers , // ---- sample1 in the example above , to extract code fragments .
The corresponding documentation source is :
The separation of the `Engine` and `Computation` interfaces allows the concurrent use of an engine across multiple threads .
Each thread simply creates its own computations on the central engine .
Engines are thus fully thread - safe and non-blocking .
[ jc:ch.arrenbrecht.myproject.tests.SampleTests :---- sample1 ]
During release builds , JCite automatically replaces the last line by the source snippet cited from the actual test source code , properly formatted using Java2Html .
Let ’s look at what we have achieved so far :
No more silly errors in example code which was written right in the documentation .
Instead , much better comfort when writing the code inside the IDE .
No more non-compiling code after refactorings or other API changes .
No more non-working code after semantic changes .
Elevation of usage examples to same status as actual product code , meaning it gets tested automatically before every release .
Examples As Tripwire
What remains is that the text of the documentation may still get out of sync .
Imagine , in the code example shown above , that we renamed Engine to Computer .
In modern IDEs , this refactoring would automatically change our sample test method as well .
But the references to the word Engine in the documentation text would not be affected .
It ’s unlikely that we will ever be able to reliably automate such changes in text .
But the example code can act as a tripwire , alerting us when changes might affect surrounding text .
If we use examples liberally , sprinkling our documentation with fragments from actual code , chances are high that we will catch all outdated text without having to reread the whole documentation before every release .
And since people learn well from examples , this is a good thing anyway .
For this scheme to work , the citation tool must archive a copy of the cited source after every run .
Then , when it is run again , it compares the new source to the archived version .
If the source has changed , it alerts us .
Only when we have confirmed that all changes are OK , meaning that we have checked the text surrounding every change , do we tell the tool to go ahead and overwrite the archived versions with the new ones .
( As of release 1.9 , JCite supports this . )
Testing Non-Code Examples
Not all products are driven by source code accessing APIs .
How do we ensure the correctness of examples given in the documentation for
a command - line tool ,
a web application , or
a GUI application ?
Simply put , in order for automated testing , and especially unit testing , to work , we had to learn to make our products easily testable .
This led to less monolithic design and better internal APIs .
Citability
Now we shall have to learn to make our products citable .
While not identical , citability is closely related to testability because both rely on the system under inspection being able to supply snapshots of defined states , and to be brought from state to state using code or scripts , that is , automation .
For a command - line tool , this will be fairly easy .
A web application , with its clear demarcation of requests and responses , should also be relatively straightforward to handle .
GUI applications will likely offer more resistance .
GUI test tools will have to support automated generation of partial screenshots during test runs .
Screenshot annotations ( like lines , arrows , labels , and flyouts ) will likely have to be maintained as a separate layer on top of the generated screenshot .
Nevertheless , we should strive to achieve this goal .
While a programmer may often be able to infer a correction for broken examples of API usage , users of GUI products may be less forgiving .
JDemo is one project I know that is working towards making Swing GUI applications citable .
And since I am working on a project that involves Excel sheets as user input , I am considering writing a sibling to JCite for Excel sheets .
Conclusion
The approach I describe here ( let ’s call it source citing ) is certainly not new , nor is it especially complex or sophisticated .
Like most of the disciplines of agile methodologies , it is fairly straightforward .
And , like these other methodologies , it must be part of a concerted approach .
It ’s a natural extension of the automated testing discipline , extended to product documentation .
A crucial advantage of source citing is that it leverages the best of our existing tools – IDEs for code , editors for text and diagrams – while being as non-intrusive as possible .
Given broader acceptance , integration into IDEs – as happened for unit testing – might even further improve the usability and efficiency of citing source .
In particular , visiting triggered tripwires in the documentation could certainly benefit from integration .
More and more developers regard with suspicion projects and job offerings where automated testing of code is not part of the daily routine and release builds .
It ’s time we started to have equal misgivings about projects where documentation is denied this automated support .
