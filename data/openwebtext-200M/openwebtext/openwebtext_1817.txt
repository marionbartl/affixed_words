Truckers Watching the Highways
Highway Watch is yet another civilian distributed counterterrorism program .
Basically , truckers are trained to look out for suspicious activities on the highways .
Despite its similarities to such ill - conceived still - born programs like TIPS , I think this one has some merit .
Why ?
Two things : training , and a broader focus than terrorism .
This is from their overview :
Highway Watch ® training provides Highway Watch® participants with the observational tools and the opportunity to exercise their expert understand of the transportation environment to report safety and security concerns rapidly and accurately to the authorities .
In addition to matters of homeland security – stranded vehicles or accidents , unsafe road conditions , and other safety related situations are reported eliciting the appropriate emergence responders .
Highway Watch® reports are combined with other information sources and shared both with federal agencies and the roadway transportation sector by the Highway ISAC .
Sure , the “ matters of homeland security ” is the sexy application that gets the press and the funding , but “ stranded vehicles or accidents , unsafe road conditions , and other safety related situations ” are likely to be the bread and butter of this kind of program .
And interstate truckers are likely to be in a good position to report these things , assuming there ’s a good mechanism for it .
About the training :
Highway Watch® participants attend a comprehensive training session before they become certified Highway Watch® members .
This training incorporates both safety and security issues .
Participants are instructed on what to look for when witnessing traffic accidents and other safety - related situations and how to make a proper emergency report .
Highway Watch® curriculum also provides anti-terrorism information , such as : a brief account of modern terrorist attacks from around the world , an outline explaining how terrorist acts are usually carried out , and tips on preventing terrorism .
From this solid baseline curriculum , different segments of the highway sector have or are developing unique modules attuned to their specific security related situation .
Okay , okay , it does sound a bit hokey .
“ … tips on preventing terrorism ” indeed .
( Tip # 7 : When transporting nuclear wastes , always be sure to padlock your truck .
Tip # 12 :
If someone asks you to deliver a trailer to the parking lot underneath a large office building and run away very fast , always check with your supervisor first . )
But again , I like the inclusion of the mundane “ what to look for when witnessing traffic accidents and other safety - related situations and how to make a proper emergency report . ”
This program has a lot of features I like in security systems : it ’s dynamic , it ’s distributed , it relies on trained people paying attention , and it ’s not focused on a specific threat .
Usually we see terrorism as the justification for something that is ineffective and wasteful .
Done right , this could be an example of terrorism being used as the justification for something that is smart and effective .

" The US economy is in danger of a recession that will prove unusually long and severe .
By any measure it is in far worse shape than in 2001 - 02 and the unraveling of the housing bubble is clearly at hand .
It seems that the continuous buoyancy of the financial markets is again deluding many people about the gravity of the economic situation . "
Dr. Kurt Richebacher
" The history of all hitherto society is the history of class struggles . "
Karl Marx
This week 's data on the sagging real estate market leaves no doubt that the housing bubble is quickly crashing to earth and that hard times are on the way .
" The slump in home prices from the end of 2005 to the end of 2006 was the biggest year over year drop since the National Association of Realtors started keeping track in 1982 . "
( New York Times ) The Commerce Dept announced that the construction of new homes fell in January by a whopping 14.3 % .
Prices fell in half of the nation 's major markets and " existing home sales declined in 40 states " .
Arizona , Florida , California , and Virginia have seen precipitous drops in sales .
The Commerce Department also reported that " the number of vacant homes increased by 34 % in 2006 to 2.1 million at the end of the year , nearly double the long - term vacancy rate . "
( Marketwatch )
The bottom line is that inventories are up , sales are down , profits are eroding , and the building industry is facing a steady downturn well into the foreseeable future .
The ripple effects of the housing crash will be felt throughout the overall economy ; shrinking GDP , slowing consumer spending and putting more workers in the growing unemployment lines .
Congress is now looking into the shabby lending practices that shoehorned millions of people into homes that they clearly cannot afford .
But their efforts will have no affect on the loans that are already in place .
$ 1 trillion in ARMs ( Adjustable Rate Mortgages ) are due to reset in 2007 which guarantees that millions of over - leveraged homeowners will default on their mortgages putting pressure on the banks and sending the economy into a tailspin .
We are at the beginning of a major shake - up and there 's going to be a lot more blood on the tracks before things settle down .
The banks and mortgage lenders are scrambling for creative ways to keep people in their homes but the subprime market is already teetering and foreclosures are on the rise .
There 's no doubt now , that Fed chairman Alan Greenspan 's plan to pump zillions of dollars into the system via " low interest rates " has created the biggest monster - bubble of all time and set the stage for a deep economic retrenchment .
Greenspan 's inflationary policies were designed to expand the " wealth gap " and create greater economic polarization between the classes .
By the time the housing bubble deflates , millions of working class Americans will be left to pay off loans that are considerably higher than the current value of their home .
This will inevitably create deeper societal divisions and , very likely , a permanent underclass of mortgage - slaves .
A shrewd economist and student of history like Greenspan knew exactly what the consequences of his low interest rates would be .
The trap was set to lure in unsuspecting borrowers who felt they could augment their stagnant wages by joining the housing gold rush .
It was a great way to mask a deteriorating economy by expanding personal debt .
The meltdown in housing will soon be felt in the stock market which appears to be lagging the real estate market by about 6 months .
Soon , reality will set in on Wall Street just as it has in the housing sector and the " loose money " that Greenspan generated with his mighty printing press will flee to foreign shores .
It looks as though this may already be happening even though the stock market is still flying high .
On Friday , the government reported that net capital inflows reversed from the requisite $ 70 billion to AN OUTFLOW OF $ 11 BILLION !
The current account deficit ( which includes the trade deficit ) is running at roughly $ 800 billion per year , which means that the US must attract about $ 70 billion per month of foreign investment ( US Treasuries or securities ) to compensate for America 's extravagant spending .
When foreign investment falters , as it did in December , it puts downward pressure on the greenback to make up for the imbalance .
Everbank 's Chuck Butler put it like this :
" Not only did the buying stop in December by foreigners in December , but the outflows were huge !
Domestic investors increased their buying of long - term overseas securities from $ 37 billion to a record $ 46 billion .
This is a classic illustration of ' lack of funding ' .
So , the question I asked the desk was ' Why is n't the euro skyrocketing ? ' "
Why , indeed ?
Why would central banks hold onto their flaccid greenbacks when the foundation which keeps it propped up has been removed ?
The answer is complex but , in essence , the rest of the world has loaned the US a pair of crutches to bolster the wobbly dollar while they prepare for the eventual meltdown .
China and Japan are currently hold over $ 1.7 trillion in US currency and US - based assets and can hardly afford to have the ground cut out from below the dollar .
There are , however , limits to the " generosity of strangers " and foreign banks will undoubtedly be pressed to take more extreme measures as it becomes apparent that Team Bush plans to produce as much red ink as humanly possible .
December 's figures indicate that foreign investment is drying up and the world is no longer eager to purchase America 's lavish debt .
The only thing the Federal Reserve can do is raise interest rates to attract foreign capital or let the dollar fall in value .
The problem , of course , is that if the Fed raises rates , the real estate market will collapse even faster which will strangle consumer spending and shrivel GDP .
In other words , we are at the brink of two separate but related crises ; an economic crisis and a currency crisis .
That means that the unsuspecting American people are likely to be ground between the two mill - wheels of hyperinflation and shrinking growth .
In real terms , the economy is already in recession .
The growth numbers are regularly massaged by the Commerce Department to put a smiley face on an underperforming economy .
Industrial output continues to flag ( In January it was down by another .5 % ) while millions good paying factory jobs are being air - mailed to China where labor is a mere fraction of the cost in the USA .
Also , automobile inventories are up while factory production is in freefall .
In addition , new jobless claims soared to 357,000 in the week ending February 10 .
44,000 more desperate workers have been given their pink slips so they can join the huddled masses in Bush 's Weimar Dystopia .
December 's net capital inflows are a grim snapshot of the looming disaster ahead .
As the housing bubble loses steam , maxxed - out American consumers will face increasing job losses and mounting debt .
At the same time , foreign investment will move to more promising markets in Asia and Europe causing a steep rise in interest rates .
This is bound to be a stunning blow to the banks which are low on reserves ( $ 44 billion ) but have generated $ 4.5 trillion in shaky mortgage debt in the last 6 years .
It 's all bad news .
The global liquidity bubble is limping towards the reef and when it hits it 'll send shock - waves through the global economic system .
Is it any wonder why the foreign central banks are so skittish about dumping the dollar ?
No one really relishes the idea of a quick slide into a global recession followed by years of agonizing recovery .
Maybe that 's why Secretary of Treasury Hank Paulson has reassembled the Plunge Protection Team and installed a hotline to his Chinese counterpart so he can quickly respond to sudden gyrations in the stock market or a freefalling greenback ; two of the calamities he could be facing in the very near future .
Greenspan successfully piloted the nation into virtual insolvency .
In fact , the parallels between our present situation and the period preceding the Great Depression are striking .
Just as massive debt was accumulating in the market from the purchase of stocks " on margin " , so too , mortgage debt between 2000 and 2006 soared from $ 4.8 trillion to $ 9.5 trillion .
In both cases the " wealth effect " spawned a spending spree which looked like growth but was really the steady , insidious expansion of debt which generated economic activity .
In both periods wages were either flat or declining and the gap between rich and working class was growing more extreme by the year .
As Paul Alexander Gusmorino said in his article , " Main Causes of the Great Depression " : " Many factors played a role in bringing about the depression ; however , the main cause for the Great Depression was the combination of the greatly unequal distribution of wealth throughout the 1920's , and the extensive stock market speculation that took place during the latter part that same decade " .
The same factors are at work today except that the speculation is in real estate rather than stocks .
Just as in the 1920's the equity bubble was not created by wages keeping pace with productivity ( the healthy formula for growth ) but by the expansion of personal debt .
Also , one could buy stocks without the money to purchase them , just as one can buy a $ 600,000 or $ 700,000 house today with zero - down and no monthly payment on the principle for years to come .
The current account deficit ( $ 800 billion ) could also weigh heavily in any economic shake - up that may be forthcoming .
Bob Chapman of The International Forecaster made this shocking calculation about America 's out - of - control trade deficit : " US debt was up 10.1 % to $ 4.085 trillion and accounts for 58.8 % of all the credit issued globally last year .
That means the US expanded credit at a much faster rate than the economy grew .
This was borrowing to maintain a higher standard of living and attempt to pay for it tomorrow . "
Think about that ; the US sucked up nearly 60 % of ALL GLOBAL CREDIT in one year alone .
That is truly astonishing .
There are many similarities between the pre-Depression era and our own .
Paul Alexander Gusmorino says : " The Great Depression was the worst economic slump ever in U.S. history , and one which spread to virtually all of the industrialized world .
The depression began in late 1929 and lasted for about a decade ....
The excessive speculation in the late 1920's kept the stock market artificially high , but eventually lead to large market crashes .
These market crashes , combined with the misdistribution of wealth , caused the American economy to capsize .
" ( The income disparity ) between the rich and the middle class grew throughout the 1920's .
While the disposable income per capita rose 9 % from 1920 to 1929 , those with income within the top 1 % enjoyed a stupendous 75 % increase in per capita disposable incomeA major reason for this large and growing gap between the rich and the working - class people was the increased manufacturing output throughout this period .
From 1923 - 1929 the average output per worker increased 32 % in manufacturing8 .
During that same period of time average wages for manufacturing jobs increased only 8 % ( This ultimately causes a decrease in demand and leads to growth in credit spending )
The federal government also contributed to the growing gap between the rich and middle - class .
Calvin Coolidge's ( pro business ) administration passed the Revenue Act of 1926 , which reduced federal income and inheritance taxes dramatically ( At the same time ) the Supreme Court ruled minimum - wage legislation unconstitutional .
The bottom three quarters of the population had an aggregate income of less than 45 % of the combined national income ; while the top 25 % of the population took in more than 55 % of the national income ... Between 1925 and 1929 the total credit more than doubled from $ 1.38 billion to around $ 3 billion " .
( Just like now , the growing wage gap has spawned massive speculative bubbles as well as a steady up - tick in credit spending .
Wage stagnation forces workers to seek other opportunities for getting ahead .
When wages fail to keep pace with productivity then demand naturally decreases and business begins to flag .
The only way to spur more buying is by easing interest rates or expanding personal credit , and that is when equity bubbles begin to appear .
That 's what happened to the stock market before 1929 as well as to the real estate market in 2007 .
The availability of credit has kept the housing market afloat but , ultimately , the result will be the same .
On Monday October 21 , 1929 , the over - valued stock market began its downward plunge .
It managed a brief mid-week comeback , but 7 days later on Black Tuesday it plummeted again ; 16 million shares were dumped and there were no buyers .
The game was over .
Confidence evaporated overnight .
People stopped buying on credit , the bubble - economy collapsed , and the mighty locomotive for growth , the American consumer , hobbled into the Great Depression .
Tariffs were thrown up , foreigners stopped buying American goods ; banks closed , business went bust , and unemployment skyrocketed .
Tens years later the country was still reeling from the implosion .
Now , 77 years later , Greenspan has led us sheep - like to the same precipice .
The economic dilemma we 're facing could have been avoided if the expansion of personal credit had been curtailed by prudent monetary policy at the Federal Reserve and if wealth was more evenly distributed as it was in the '60s and ' 70s .
But that 's not the case ; so we 're headed for hard times .

Professor Michael Bisson , archaeologist at Montreal 's McGill University , sits with an actor playing the part of a Neanderthal on the set of the BBC documentary " Walking with Prehistoric Beasts , " shot in 2001 .
Depending on which journals you 've picked up in recent months , early humans were either peace - loving softies or war - mongering buffoons .
Which theory is to be believed ?
A little bit of both , says one archaeologist , who warns against making generalizations when it comes to our long and varied prehistory .
The newest claim concerns Australopithecus afarensis , who lived approximately five million years ago and is one of the first hominids that can be linked directly to our lineage with some certainty .
Hardly an expert at tearing other animals limb from limb , scientists say the small and furry creature likely spent most of its time avoiding becoming the lunch of those saber - toothed mammals you see in natural history museums today .
That 's a far cry from the spear - wielding image most of the public has of our earliest ancestors , Robert Sussman of Washington University told an audience at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science last month .
Other research appearing in current scientific journals , however , paints a different picture of early man .
Groups of humans likely engaged in occasional violent encounters in order to increase their territory , argues Raymond C. Kelly of the University of Michigan in a recent edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
According to Kelly , this may have continued up until about a million years ago , when distance weapons like the spear were invented and increased the risks of attacking other groups .
How can scientists see things so differently ?
Generalizing
Human evolution just is n't that simple , says Michael Bisson , professor of anthropology at McGill University in Montreal , Canada .
People tend to make generalizations about our early ancestors , even though they lived for a period of several million years and include many entirely different species of hominids .
As for the peaceful nature of Australopithecus afarensis , Bisson wholeheartedly agrees with Sussman .
" Afarensis was small and completely non-technological .
No one has ever argued that they were predatory .
They are bipedal , ground - eating apes , " Bisson said in an interview .
Interpretations get trickier , however , as time moves forward and hominids become more prevalent and diverse .
When humans began to eat meat and use weapons , around two million years ago , some inter - group killings were almost certainly going on in the cases where individuals encroached on each other 's territory .
Still , at this point hominids are mostly timid scavengers , according to Bisson , not mammoth - hunters .
" The interesting thing about early hominids and meat - eating is that all of the evidence we have for it is little animals that might have been caught and dismembered by hand and big animals that were scavenged , " he said .
" It fades in very slowly .
After two million [ years ago ] , there 's about a half - million - year transition before you get to hunting of some kind . "
Spear or tooth ?
It 's around this time where mistakes can be made in the fossil record , experts say .
With humans beginning to hunt animals , weapons in hand , it 's easier to assume they are also killing each other .
Puncture wounds in a skull from an animal bite can be mistaken as injuries from a spear attack , for example .
The fossil record is not always an easy thing to read , Bisson explained .
" Cause of death is almost impossible to determine on all of these ( fossils ) , " he said .
" They have almost all been subject to scavenging .
Since there 's no deliberate burial at that time , the bodies end up part of the food chain , so we simply can't say what happened . "
A lot can depend on how archaeological remains are interpreted .
Sussman calls this the " 5 o'clock news " version of history and science , one that applies to today 's humans as easily as those of several million years ago .
" Human groups are much more likely to live in peace than in war , " he explained .
" What we usually find is that what is reported or emphasized is any violent encounter that takes place .
Thus , instead of using the actual statistics , we emphasize the rare events . "
Context of war
Bisson agrees that the archaeological remains must be put in context depending on who makes the find , even .
He pointed to the discovery of some Australopithecus remains in the 1920s , in what is now Botswana .
Along with a skull , the material found included tools made from the bones of gazelles , antelopes and wild boar .
The archaeologist working there mistakenly interpreted them as a cache of weapons , while later testing would show the points were used simply for digging in termite holes .
" A lot of this stuff was written between the First and Second World War , " he reasoned .
" It was very easy to see warfare and violence as inherent in the human condition during a period when humanity was literally trying to exterminate itself . "
Mainstream media can also have a lot to do with what the public believes as fact .
" No archaeologist in the last 40 years has bought the ‘ Killer Ape ' interpretation , but it did get ingrained in popular culture in the intro sequence to the famous Stanley Kubrick film [ " 2001 : A Space Odyssey " ] , " Bisson said .
In the movie , ape - like humans are shown having the eureka moment that bones can be used as weapons , thus evolving to become hunters and killers .
" It 's a fairly literal dramatization of the hypothesis , complete with leg bones used as clubs . "
Even if early humans were mostly cooperative with each other during the Paleolithic era—a period lasting about two million years — there is plenty of evidence to suggest that ( like today ) , some people were just plain nasty .
Cannibalism was clearly practiced in some areas , according to Bisson .
" We know that there is at least one case of Homo erectus with extensive cuts on the cranium indicating that the person was essentially scalped and the eyes gouged out , " he said .
I ’ve been blissfully neglecting this site for months with the assumption that a large part of our goal was completed .
After watching good people like Martin LaMonica and Jon Udell balance out the mainstream tech press with coverage of lessish tools and languages , and having seen forward looking companies like RedMonk inject themselves into the traditional analyst racket with smart , honest , and unignorable critique , and having seen herds of Java luminaries migrate to simpler , more agile tools and languages , and after hearing Bill Gates say that less code was the only metric , and having watched David , Bill , Ian , Adrian , Phillip , Aristotle , Harry , Mark , Mark , Chad , Curt , James and many other extremely talented programmers dismantle all the common hollow arguments for superfluous complexity and replace them with simple methodologies and working code , after all that I just figured there was n’t much to do around here .
But I completely forgot about James Gosling :
“ There have been a number of language [s ] coming up lately , ” noted James Gosling today at Sun ’s World Wide Education & Research Conference in New York City when asked if Java was in any kind of danger from the newcomers .
“ PHP and Ruby are perfectly fine systems , ” he continued , “ but they are scripting languages and get their power through specialization : they just generate web pages .
But none of them attempt any serious breadth in the application domain and they both have really serious scaling and performance problems . ”
We ’ll get back to that in a second .
I believe that a majority of people in IT now consider dynamic languages like Perl , Ruby , Python , and PHP to be very much capable of sitting at the table with Java and .NET for a wide range of common technical problems .
Similarly , straight - forward systems like REST , Microformats , and Atom are generally considered legitimate alternatives to the vendor / analyst / press peddled technologies like WS -* for a wide range of integration issues .
In other words , I could walk into most shops during a technology evaluation and put these technologies on the table as legitimate considerations without being too worried about being laughed out of the room .
This is not to claim superiority for a given task , just that the competitive playing field is beginning to level off .
This was not the case last year at this time , so what happened ?
Something must have changed .
None of these technologies underwent huge feature or stability increases in the past year .
I ’m unaware of any breakthrough in scaling these systems past what they ’re already capable of .
There have been some improvements in running dynamic languages on the mainstream VMs , which many predicted would lead to quick acceptance , but that ’s not it either .
So what changed ?
Minds changed .
Respectful debate , honesty , passion , and working systems created an environment that not even the most die - hard enterprise architect could ignore , no matter how buried in Java design patterns .
Those who placed technical excellence and pragmaticism above religious attachment and vendor cronyism were easily convinced of the benefits that broadening their definition of acceptable technologies could bring .
The people who are still unconvinced are those that just do n’t care or are too lazy to spend a small amount of time researching and validating the arguments , which brings us back nicely to James Gosling ’s recent statements .
On The Current Quantity of Language
“ There have been a number of language [s ]
This part is notable because it ’s actually true .
There have , in fact , been some number of languages .
While I stand steadfastly by James ’ analysis of the current quantity of language , we will quickly diverge in opinion from here .
A quick note to aspiring Java pundits : play close attention to the next few statements .
While none of them have any basis in reality , they have proven sufficient in creating fear and uncertainty in the minds of those who are evaluating these technologies .
On “ Scripting Languages ”
“ PHP and Ruby are perfectly fine systems , ” he continued , “ but they are scripting languages
James pulled this directly out of “ Effective Java Advocacy Beans ” , section 6.8.3 “ Dealing with questions on dynamic languages ” :
First , call anything not statically compiled a “ scripting language ” .
Attempt to insinuate that all languages without an explicit compilation step are not to be taken seriously and that they are all equivalently shitty .
Best results are achieved when you provide no further explanation of the pros and cons of static and dynamic compilation and / or typing and instead allow the reader to simply assume that there are a wealth of benefits and very few , if any , disadvantages to static compilation .
While the benefits of dynamic languages –first realized millions of years ago in LISP and Smalltalk–are well understood in academia , IT managers and Sun certified developers are perfectly accepting of our static = professional / dynamic = amateurish labeling scheme .
This technique is also known to result in dynamic language advocates going absolute bat - shit crazy and making complete fools of themselves .
There have been no fewer than three head explosions recorded as a result of this technique .
Also , avoid the term “ dynamic language ” at all cost .
It ’s important that the reader not be exposed to the concepts separating scripting languages like bash , MS - DOS batch , and perl - in - the - eighties from general purpose dynamic languages like Ruby , Python , Smalltalk , and Perl present day .
We ’ve tried our best to clear up any ambiguity related to the term “ scripting language ” in the past :
On “ They Just Generate Web Pages ”
and get their power through specialization : they just generate web pages .
Gosling shows his ignorance regarding the current feature set provided by dynamic languages and what people are using them for .
A cursory glance over rubyforge.org ’s project tree reveals that the number of projects that “ just generate web pages ” are really quite small : 151 of 1,342 total projects are registered under Internet : : WWW / HTTP :: Dynamic Content and many of those projects are related to using the web ( HTTP / URIs ) as a platform for integration more than they are for “ generating web pages ” .
I expect Perl and Python break down even wider .
Update : Seo Sanghyeon provides a list of popular Python related applications that have nothing to do with generating web content .
I ’d also like to note that exposing resource representations via HTTP / URLs has been moving into areas other than “ generating web pages ” .
This was the plan when HTTP was originally designed but has only recently begun to really catch on .
Specialization and enhanced capabilities related to generating and serving hyper-media over HTTP are and will continue to increase in value .
The web server is becoming a key piece of integration infrastructure .
What James refers to as “ generating web pages ” is now a general purpose technique for exposing resources to anything outside of the application process .
On “ breadth of application domain ”
But none of them attempt any serious breadth in the application domain
It ’s hard to determine what kind of breadth is missing when you consider the capabilities provided by modern dynamic language environments , the platforms they run on , and the extensions and bridges that allow them to use damn near any other program or library available .
James uses the example of “ interplanetary navigation ” , which is a really good example except that it is n’t ; most of us are n’t working at NASA and those of us who are working at NASA are doing things like trying to get the payroll and accounting systems working together or building simple productivity applications .
Gosling seems bent on meeting the needs of the 20 % while leaving the 80 % with a platform that ’s losing bids to dynamic / agile shops .
“ That ’s the kind of power I do not envy ” .
Lastly , Peter Yared ( former Sun hacker ) and the rest of the folks over at ActiveGrid should also be interested to learn that no one is attempting to widen the viability of dynamic languages in the “ application domain ” .
On Scaling and Performance
and they both have really serious scaling and performance problems .
It is simply not possible for me to add anything to the massive set of material addressing this topic .
Scalability :
Performance :
Why people are upset
There have been multiple responses to Gosling ’s statements ranging in sentiment from outrage to amusement :
All we ’re asking is that you stop spreading misinformation about the current state of dynamic languages to the press , analysts , and your customers .
This does not require you to champion or otherwise support these technologies – just stop lying about them .
One year ago , this type of behavior could be attributed to a lack of documentation and discussion on these issues , today it ’s impossible to attribute to anything but malice .
Analysis It 's Autumn in St. Louis , my favorite time of year in Missouri .
Coats are getting progressively thicker as the temperature drops , trees are changing their leaves in a final show of brilliant color before their skeletons show , and darkness is starting to scare away the sun a bit earlier every day .
Every Thursday night this Autumn you 'll find me teaching the latest iteration of a wonderful course at Washington University in St. Louis titled " Technology in Our Changing Society " .
Once a week my students and I examine a different issue about the point at which technology and social change intersect , and our discussions are as fulfilling as they are knotty .
I can't tell you how many times this semester I 've heard someone say , " This is a really complicated issue , and I 'm not sure yet what I think .
I respect and understand completely what they 're saying .
After all , when you 're wrestling with issues around free speech , biotechnology , identity online , or virtual property , discussions tend to operate in shades of grey instead of black and white .
Sometimes issues are a bit more cut and dried , and a student will utter a bon mot that perfectly encapsulates an issue .
A long time ago , a high school kid who was n't that great of a student told the class , after a long discussion about governments and politics , " Well , here 's what I 've learned : socialism is fair but does n't really work , while capitalism is n't fair but does work mostly . "
Not too bad for a 9th grader .
More recently , I had the adults in " Technology in Our Changing Society " read both the Windows XP EULA and the GNU General Public License .
When I asked them what they thought , one woman said , " The EULA sounds like it was written by a team of lawyers who want to tell me what I can't do , and the GPL sounds like it was written by a human being who wants me to know what I can do . "
Nice
The next version of Windows is just around the corner , so the next time we discuss software licensing in my course , the EULA for Vista will be front and center .
You can read the Microsoft Vista EULA yourself by going to the official Find License Terms for Software Licensed from Microsoft page and searching for Vista .
I know many of you have never bothered to read the EULA - who really wants to , after all ? - but take a few minutes and get yourself a copy and read it .
I 'll wait .
Back ?
It 's bad , ai n't it ?
Real bad .
I mean , previous EULAs were n't anything great - either as reading material or in terms of rights granted to end users - but the Vista EULA is horrendous .
Benchmark censorship
Ed Foster has written - with his usual righteous eloquence - a piece on his Gripelog titled " A Vista of Licensed Censorship " that covers several new restrictions in the upcoming Vista EULA .
Vista
Home now contains this gem :
9. MICROSOFT .NET BENCHMARK TESTING .
The software includes one or more components of the .NET Framework 3.0 ( " . NET Components " ) .
You may conduct internal benchmark testing of those components .
You may disclose the results of any benchmark test of those components , provided that you comply with the conditions set forth at http://go.microsoft/fwlink/?LinkID=66406.
Foster brings up good points about the inevitable problems that this clause will bring .
Microsoft can - and undoubtedly will - change the terms on that web page at any time , thus complicating life for anyone wanting to disclose test results .
Worse , another requirement dictates that any benchmarks must " be performed using all performance tuning and best practice guidance set forth in the product documentation and / or on Microsoft 's support Web sites , " thus forcing testers to use settings that are n't found in the workaday world , potentially distorting results .
Foster gives this example , one that should resonate among the readers of this column :
Just by way of example , what about a security researcher who a year or so from now wants to compare the buffer overflow vulnerabilities of the original version of Vista with the inevitable SP1 ?
Under Microsoft 's rules , the researcher could not make public the results of the older version of the software .
And if you think it highly unlikely Microsoft would actually object to the benchmarks in such circumstances , think again .
In 2001 Microsoft came down on an independent lab that was about to go public with performance benchmarks comparing Windows NT and Windows 2000 .
Beyond the fact that censorship is almost always a bad thing ( I 'll agree that it 's permissible in a very few cases involving national security , but that 's about it ) , software is of such critical importance to people 's lives that I can see virtually no reason why any limitations on benchmarking and testing results should ever be allowed to stand .
No virtualization for you !
Right now , consumers and businesses can buy two versions of Windows XP for their desktops : Home and Professional .
Let 's review the choices they 're going to face , including pricing , when Vista rears its head :
Starter ( OEM pricing only )
Home Basic ( $ 199 , or $ 99 upgrade )
Home Premium ( $ 239 , or $ 159 upgrade )
Business ( $ 299 , or $ 199 upgrade )
Enterprise ( OEM pricing only )
Ultimate ( $ 399 , or $ 259 upgrade )
I understand that product differentiation among market segments is common and makes good sense .
But this is ridiculous .
Six different versions ?
Quick , which one is right for you : Home Premium or Business ?
Uhhhh ...
WHEN President Bush sent his new budget to Congress yesterday , he trumpeted a continuing decline in the deficit and projected a swing back into the black by 2012 .
But the accounting in the thick volumes issued by his Office of Management and Budget bears about as much similarity to the practices of private sector companies as Sanskrit does to Chinese .
For sometimes obscure and sometimes political reasons , the federal government reports its finances in a way that portrays them far more favorably than they deserve .
The “ official ” deficit figure for the 2006 fiscal year is just under $ 250 billion .
But a more accurate calculation would indicate a deficit nearly three times higher , and that is even without including some vast obligations the government owes .
And while a strong economy is pushing down that headline deficit , the government ’s financial commitments actually grew more rapidly last year than in 2005 .
In fact , the federal government itself obliquely acknowledges this chimera in a flotilla of other reports , including the obscure Financial Statement of the United States , prepared by the Government Accountability Office using methods closer to what a shareholder would find in an annual report .
In cases of major discrepancy
it is always reality that 's got it wrong .
From RFC1118
A : I consider Open Source to be an important part of the international programming fraternity , an institution organized as a virtual scientific academy that discovered many talented developers from various countries , especially Europe and Spanish speaking countries .
It 's great how active this fraternity is !
This " pro bono " ( Latin " for the common good " ) development is not unique to software .
Most professional codes of ethics encourage participants to donate some of their time " pro bono " .
I think that the healthy part of Open Source movement is in reality a " pro bono " movement that already produced a long lasting impact on software and is especially important to education , developing countries , cash - strapped startups , etc .
I consider it to be an important part of the Unix Renaissance , the most important democratic movement in software development in the XX century started by Berkeley University Free / Net BSD project ( TCP / IP , Bind , sendmail , vim to name a few things ) and MIT 's GNU project ( gcc , gdb , emacs , etc. ) .
One very important benefit that Linux provides is that along with Free / Open BSD it 's a free and open alternative to any proprietary operating system and due to the GNU license it most probably will stay that way .
At the same time the movement is still in its early stages ( and not last days , as some predict ) and it suffers from some " childish diseases " .
One of them is bad advocacy .
The term " bad Linux advocacy " or Raymondism was introduced in my First Monday paper to differentiate a credible OSS advocacy from the popular brand of naive on the border of blind fold Linux chauvinism ( " Linux uber alles " ) .
The main problem with Raymondism is that with the loss of credibility comes a betrayal of trust to the intelligent readership .
Like any other type of groupthink Raymondism incorrectly assumes :
Systematically overestimate the group capabilities .
Believe in the inherent morality of the group , regardless of how immoral parts of the group behave .
Develop their own rationalization for failures .
Rely on stereotypes of adversaries ( Microsoft ) rather then accurate perceptions .
Suppress rather then express their doubts and reservations about the group and particular decisions .
Have an illusionary belief that the group is unanimous in its decisions when many in fact have their doubts and reservations .
Overly call upon those who do express criticism to suppress this criticism out of loyalty to the group or the " fearless leader " .
What ESR and Co failed to realize is that people who are developing and using Solaris , Novell and Microsoft products are also professionals and many of them are of a caliber far superior to the author of low to middle - range open source products like EMACS editor macros , a mail utility , and like ;-) .
For any intelligent professional an open demonstration of arrogance naturally creates a strong negative reaction , a backlash that is damaging to the movement credibility and future .
Before I get flamed for this , please understand that a holy war , " Linux uber alles " of sorts , is a self - defeating strategy .
I hope that there is a healthy " silent majority " of the open source community ( that why I actually am writing this FAQ ) who are just writing code as best they can , and / or submitting patches bug reports .
But that does not mean that we can just ignore the ranting and raving of the zealots : the public tend to define the open source community in terms of its most outspoken members ( ESR and Co ) which in this particular case means zealots ...
The main problem with Raymondism is that with the loss of credibility
comes a betrayal of trust to the intelligent readership .
As Jono Bacon put it in the UK Linux Group article The Good , the Bad and the Proprietary :
I mean , let 's take a reality check at this early point in this discussion ; Linux is software - a man made tool that serves a purpose , and we need to remember that Linux is only software , and not some godly means in life where we must cast down all those who oppose .
The particular Linux users that I direct this comment to are what I would call " those users who like to express their opinion in forceful manner " ; in other words , those people who get very hostile to anything that is n't Linux .
Microsoft is usually a direct target when it comes to shoving some negative energy in the right direction .
While I think that Microsoft does have it 's flaws , everything has two sides , and Microsoft has consistently developed well designed easy to use software that lets novices get some work done .
The same problems exist with primitive anti Microsoft rhetoric like ERS's ( see Slashdot ESR responds to Ed Muth for more detailed discussion :
After months of silence out of Redmond , the themes of Microsoft 's coming FUD campaign against Linux are beginning to emerge like a zombie army from the fetid mists of Redmond .
And who should that black - armored , axe - wielding figure riding point be but our old friend Ed " Sheriff of Nottingham " Muth , apparently recovered from leading with his chin last time around and ready for another go at Linus and his Merry Men of Sherwood .
Even Linus
Torvalds proved to be not immune to this disease .
Some of his technical judgments are very suspect .
It 's enough to read attentively several of his interviews to understand that he started making predictions and evaluate things about which he actually has very little real knowledge due to the specifics of his career and the best he can do is to make an educated guess .
As Charles Hannan , a developer of an alternative operating system was quoted in Ottawa Citizen artilce " All in all that IPO money did to some Linux developers was make them incredibly arrogant . "
Overhyping open source does n't actually help to create a larger user base and / or sustained development of the community .
We should suspect any OSS advocacy that includes the following features :
Gross oversimplifications like " open source software is good , closed source is bad " , " Linux has better quality than closed source UNIXes or Free / Open BSD " , that " contributors to open source projects is plentiful and contributions always has high quality " , etc. Bob Young 's example of a car in which you are not allowed to " look under the hood " ( as if most customers know or want to know how to fine tune fuel injection or able to diagnose various malfunctions and / or install additional equipment like , say , turbo compressor ) is a more subtle example of the same category .
Claming that open source software is the most economically efficient paradigm of producing software and is much better than any alternative method .
This is called economism or Vulgar Marxism .
See Is " Vulgar Marxism " a legitimate scientific term .
Bad Linux advocacy considers commercial software developers inferior to free / open source developers .
It also has fundamentalist attitude about the necessity of redistributing software code .
I agree that it 's nice feature and it really make the difference in many cases ( especially in education , poor countries , cash - strapped startups , etc ) but still the absence of the source code should not be the cause of moral indignation as Bertrand Meyer hinted in his essay .
Emphasizing volunteer development and concealment of the facts about the true economic origin of many popular open source software products including Linux .
In reality a considerable part of it is not " donated " , but " taxpayer - funded " ( university - funded ) or " commercially funded " ( current versions of Linux ) .
Even Linus
Torvalds cannot be called volunteer after probably just first two years of kernel development : after that his " hobby " was financed by the University of Helsinki ( which allowed Linus to do development on his university job ) , then Transmeta picked the bills .
Later IPO stock gold rush remunerated him quite nicely , probably on the level very few leading commercial developers enjoy .
I would say that Linus Torvalds probably belongs to the first dozen of the most highly paid developers in the Unix word .
Without commercial developers and support of development by commercial distributors Linux in its present form would be impossible .
Most significant open source products are now developed by paid developers ( staff of Linux companies , IBM , Sun , etc ) and in this respect are not that different from commercial products that involve cooperation of several companies .
It 's just a new commercial software development paradigm that can be called complexity - level based commercialization .
There is nothing bad about it , we just need to understand the real picture .
Actually FSF from the beginning used paid developers to develop software .
That means that CatB 's claim that Linus Torvalds is a volunteer developer contradicts Linus Torvalds biography .
From the other hand commercial companies contributed a lot more to the Linux than Raymondism would like to accept .
For example , the role of DEC in the development of Linux and Intel and IBM in funding Linux startups is ignored in CatB and similar essays .
A holier than thou attitude , disrespect of other developers .
The attacks against commercial software developers , especially Microsoft .
These two communities actually are interdependent .
First of all one needs to understand that development of all major open source products is currently organized on the commercial basis .
Instigation of hatred of the members of the commercial community is unproductive and unethical .
Often open source products are re-implementation of commercial products ( Linux is a very good example here , but Ghostscript , GIMP and Samba probably can be mentioned too ) .
Borrowing from the design of the commercial product requires respect and acknowledgement of the original product .
This attitude is definitely lacking in phases like " I invented Linux " ( the most generous claim possible would be " re-implemented a Unix kernel using Minix and FSF tools " ) and so on .
This is as close to the infamous Microsoft phrase " We invented Windows " as one can get .
See also Linus Torvalds cult of personality issue in Linus Torvalds biography .
We will also touch this important problem below .
Another example " a holier than thou " attitude is ESR 's anti-Microsoft rhetoric like his discussion of Microsoft in Halloween documents ( see for example Halloween V )
After months of silence out of Redmond , the themes of Microsoft 's coming FUD campaign against Linux are beginning to emerge like a zombie army from the fetid mists of Redmond .
And who should that black - armored , axe - wielding figure riding point be but our old friend Ed " Sheriff of Nottingham " Muth , apparently recovered from leading with his chin last time around and ready for another go at Linus and his Merry Men of Sherwood .
Yes , of course , Microsoft is far from being a saint , but this is simply ridiculous .
Even the usual marketing suspects rarely sink so low .
Jeff Lewis in his interesting paper
The Cathedral and the Bizarre discussed other trick that ERS often uses ( " Windows 2000 63 K bugs trick " ) : Raymond points out that Windows 2000 , which reportedly shipped with 63,000 bugs , shows that OpenSource works because under Brook 's " Law " , the number of bugs is roughly proportional to the square of the number of programmers .
Since Linux has 40,000 developers working on it - there should be 2 billion bugs in Linux .
The flaw is that he perceives Linux as a collection of small projects , but sees Win2 K as a single monolithic application - much as he seems to see MacOS .
In reality , Win2 K and MacOS are n't monolithic .
They are composed of many smaller parts which are handled by smaller teams .
Much like Linux .
As for comparing bug counts - at least Microsoft has a bug count .
If Raymond had bothered to check the number , he'd have found that a rather large proportion of the 63,000 bugs are cosmetic - and none were considered ' showstoppers ' .
We do n't even have a way to determine the real bug count for Linux since there 's no central repository for this sort of information .
Raymondism seems to be assuming that all OSes are targeted to the same market segment .
This is a questionable assumption .
Developer resources are not infinite and explicit or implicit priorities lead to particular strong and weak points of a particular OS .
Unix in general was designed as a developer OS and naturally most developers and power users really like this OS and prefer it to others .
It also a very good server OS .
That does not exclude the possibility of using it by other market segments but the level of success achievable in each of them is questionable .
For example Mac is popular among graphic artists , musicians and users without special computer training .
One can say that it is a specialized OS for those market segments and that 's why the question of consistency of user interface is so well addressed in the OS .
It 's a top priority for those segments .
See Slashdot discussion of the The Cathedral and Bizarre for more information .
Its just reinforcing the idea that there are different markets and different kinds of software and different kinds of users .
No surprise that OSS fits some niches and does n't fit others .
Explicit and / or implicit personal attacks on RMS .
You can disagree with political views of RMS ( software anarchism ) or reject GPL as a license for your software ( I am far from that , LGPL seems more reasonable for me ) but please do not forget that RMS was a great programmer who initiated the development and put a lot of personal efforts in GCC , GBD and Emacs .
And that means that we definitely should respect him as one of the greatest contributors to open source .
As Bertrand Meyer have shown RMS has its own problems in the advocacy area , but please remember that GCC complier is the cornerstone of the movement .
In any case ESR and his closed Open Source Initiative is a pigmy in comparison with RMS / FSF past and present role and achievements .
Paradoxically in many important aspects Raymondism is more radical than RMS ' views .
For example RMS never claimed that free software development is a superior model for the software development than commercial development .
Nor they ever claim that everybody should use open source software only -- for him it's a personal preference that you can take or reject .
In no way RMS contributed to those crazy Linux IPOs that lead to " enthusiasm led investments " from the most active people in the community -- the investments that are now at risk due to the unclear commercial perspectives of the Linux - based companies .
Actually the RMS and the FSF supporters ( " Free Software " or GPL community ) in general have no problem with commercial software developers and selling software .
In fact , the FSF generates revenue through the sale of software .
Since Jan. 1998 Eric Raymond successfully promoted " open source " as a distinct and slightly anti-Stallman movement .
See for example his interview with Smart Reseller Straight From The Source where Eric was called a Godfather of Linux ;-)
Note how skillfully an anti-RMS stance was injected -- GPL essentially permit commercial use and might be one of the core reason of Linux popularity ( FreeBSD was technically superior in many important areas until probably 2.4 kernel ) .
Open source license is a Johnny - come - lately and as of this writing has no important products to claim : SR : Some of our readers may be confused by the " open source " movement you represent , which is significantly different from Richard Stallman 's ( a.k.a. RMS , founder of the Free Software Foundation and the GNU Project ) " free software " statements .
Open source is not the same thing as Stallman 's " free software , " right ?
Raymond :
The distinction between the open - source movement and what RMS is doing is that we push utility arguments while he publishes moralistic ones .
RMS 's basic stance is that intellectual property is evil and , therefore , sources must be open .
Ours is that we want what gives the best engineering results , and that 's open source .
Later ESR seems to get a pop star syndrome at some point and decided that he can safely make personal attack on RMS in order to promote his own Open Source Initiative .
This " pop star syndrome " can probably explain the fact that he also have felt the need to go public about his new wealth .
This was very bad move from PR perspective and just shows how arrogant ESR became ; he not only managed to discredit himself both as a person and as an evangelist by attacking FSF , but also alienated those Linux developers who fail to get into this short - lived get - money - fast - and - run Linux Gold Rush ( I suspect the latter category encompass most developers outside USA ) .
There 's nothing wrong with making money , even big money , but Linux does n't benefit from crazy IPOs based on hype and manipulations by investment brokers .
I suspect that " Open source rich " became rich at the expense of naive believers in the OSS phenomena , not from the day traders .
Attempts to contribute to Linus Torvalds ' " cult of personality " .
Often this is done via blatant exaggerations in the best style of North Korea press , but sometimes more subtle ways are used too .
For example calling him a " true pragmatist " and contrasting his with an " idealist " RMS ( who , by the way is the principal author of GPL license -- the license that proved to be instrumental to the success of Linux and along with BSD license was widely adopted in project all over the globe .
The GNU Project was around long before Linux .
But it 's not a stretch to suggest that GNU was a relatively obscure phenomenon before Linux brought its benefits front and center to the computing mainstream .
Stallman 's belief that it is better to have poor - quality free software than high - quality proprietary stuff might have forever kept the GNU world view as a niche had Torvalds ' pragmatism not brought it out .
From this point of view GPL proved to be a very " pragmatic " license .
Moreover FSF was well known / respected well before Linux .
For example , here is a stance by Evan Leibovitch in his essay
In the middle lies sanity See cult of personality for additional quotes .
Claiming that open source software has intrinsic higher quality than closed source commercially developed software .
This statement is an article of faith among some open source advocates , but until I see an objective , empirical study that substantiates it , it should n't be stated as fact .
Actually there are badly designed , insecure and quite popular open source products ( Sendmail might be one example ) .
Some open source products might use algorithms that are no longer on the cutting edge of technology , development might be slow , but they still play the role of the standard de-facto in the open source world ( compare , for example , speed of development and the level of interface refinement of gzip and rar ) .
The issue of the quality of algorithms is often ignored , but IMHO algorithms used are often far more important that other issues and make the difference between bad and good software .
Blah - blah - blah about word domination .
Linux domination would be a bad thing .
We need to respect BeOS , Inferno , VMWare .
VM / Linux ( derivative of older VM / CMS -- IBM 's two layer approach to the OS design in which simper OS ( Linux ) run on the top of complex ( and proprietary ) virtual machine monitor that hides a lot of complexity from the upper level and that provide virtual cluster or network and as such is different from plain - vanilla Linux on a single machine ) and other free Unixes ( Free / OpenBSD / Net BSD ) .
Pluralism in OSes is as important as in other spheres of life and one of the greatest achievement of Linux is that it helps to overcome Microsoft dominance in the PC world .
The Microsoft dominance already badly influenced people and there should be no new " Mongol oppression " .
It 's really important that people chose a right tool for the job ( best tool for the job , if you have enough money ) .
That will never always be Linux or Unix .
No single OS can do everything well .
Actually Linux on a desktop is far from being a paradise and probably will never be due to its server - centric architecture .
It 's pretty attractive to power users mainly because they actually need and can productively use a server as a desktop .
But you need to want to be your own sysadmin ;-) .
The other side of this " word domination " drive is the attempts to represent Linux kernel as the best available Unix kernel implementation strengthen an impression about Linux movement as a high - tech cult .
The kernel is pretty good and I like and use it but in many respects its not the best and never will be .
Overrating open source security .
The problem is not finding people , but finding quality people to audit software and that 's much more difficult than ESR assumes .
On April 14th 2000 reports began to appear of a apparently deliberate back - door in Microsoft FrontPage services .
The reports specified that the back - door password was " Netscape engineers are weenies ! " .
ESR fell over himself .
After his Halloween success this was the news item he was waiting for !
But here the result was quite opposite .
A real fiasco occurred .
In his note Designed for Uncertainty Matt Michie wrote : Eric Raymond wrote an article where he stated , " It 's pretty clear .
Anybody who trusts their security to closed - source software is begging to have a back door slipped on to their system -- with or without the knowledge of the people who shipped the code and theoretically stand behind it .
...
Apache has never had an exploit like this , and never will .
Nor will Linux ... " .
Of course the next day , after some background and fact checking , it was revealed that the Microsoft back - door was n't as bad as was originally reported .
Further , ten days later a security firm found a what could be considered a back door in Red Hat Linux .
Ironically , the bug was in a piece of web software .
The security advisory states , " The GUI portion of Piranha may allow any remote attacker to execute commands on the server .
This may lead to remote compromise of the server , as well as exposure or defacement of the website . "
Wait a minute .
Does n't Red Hat " theoretically " stand behind the code they ship ?
How could this back door have been inserted into Open Source code ?
Did n't Mr. Raymond say that this could n't happen to Linux ?
What do all the pundits who were railing against Microsoft 's security holes have to say about this ?
Is there a double standard when it comes to reporting Microsoft ?
In this situation , the Linux press , such as Slashdot , are looking more like a sick imitation of what ZDNet used to be .
Why is it " evil " when Microsoft FUDs Linux , but " advocacy " when Linux sites FUD Microsoft ?
Is it too much to expect unbiased reporting in the media ?
But the problem is deeper .
Here is an opinion of John Viega , a Senior Research Associate in the Software Security Group at Reliable Software Technologies , an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute , the author of Mailman , the open source GNU Mailing List Manager , and ITS4 , a tool for finding security vulnerabilities in C and C++ code .
He has authored over 30 technical publications in the areas of software security and testing , and is responsible for finding several well - publicized security vulnerabilities in major network and e-commerce products , including a recent break in Netscape 's security .
In his recent paper open source resources at open source it The Myth of Open Source Security he wrote : ... Even if you get the right kind of people doing the right kinds of things , you may have problems that you never hear about .
Security problems are often incredibly subtle , and may span large parts of a source tree .
It is not uncommon to have two or three features spread throughout a program , none of which constitutes a security problem alone , but which can be used together to perform a security breach .
For example , two buffer overflows recently found in Kerberos version 5 could only be exploited when used in conjunction with each other .
As a result , doing security reviews of source code tends to be complex and boring , since you generally have to look at a lot of code , and understand it pretty well .
Even many experts do n't like to do these kinds of reviews .
And even the experts can miss things .
Consider the case of the popular open source FTP server wu-ftpd .
In the past two years , several very subtle buffer overflow problems have been found in the code .
Almost all of these problems had been in the code for years , despite the fact that the program had been examined many times by both hackers and security auditors .
If any of them had discovered the problems , they did n't announce it publicly .
In fact , the wu- ftpd has been used as a case study for vulnerability detection techniques that never identified these problems as definite flaws .
One tool was able to identify one of the problems as potentially exploitable , but researchers examined the code thoroughly for a couple of days , and came to the conclusion that there was no way that the problem identified by their tool could actually be exploited .
Over a year later , they learned that they were wrong , when an expert audit finally did turn up the problem .
In code with any reasonable complexity , it can be very difficult to find bugs .
The wu - ftpd is less than 8000 lines of code long , but it was easy for several bugs to remain hidden in that small space over long periods of time .
To compound the problem , even when people know about security holes , they may not get fixed , at least not right away .
Even when identified , the security problems in Mailman took many months to fix , because security was not the core development team 's most immediate concern .
In fact , the team believes one problem still persists in the code , but only in a configuration that we suspect does n't get used .
An army in my belly
The single most pernicious problem in computer security today is the buffer overflow .
While the availability of source code has clearly reduced the number of buffer overflow problems in open source programs , according to several sources , including CERT , buffer overflows still account for at least a quarter of all security advisories , year after year .
Open source proponents sometimes claim that the " many eyeballs " phenomenon prevents Trojan horses from being introduced in open source software .
The speed with which the TCP wrappers Trojan was discovered in early 1999 is sometimes cited as supporting evidence .
This too can lull the open source movement into a false sense of security , however , since the TCP wrappers Trojan is not a good example of a truly stealthy Trojan horse : the code was glaringly out of place and obviously put there for malicious purposes only .
It was as if the original Trojan horse had been wheeled into Troy with a sign attached that said , " I 've got an army in my belly ! " ... Currently , however , the benefits open source provides in terms of security are vastly overrated , because there is n't as much high - quality auditing as people believe , and because many security problems are much more difficult to find than people realize .
Open source programs which appeal to a limited audience are particularly at risk , because of the smaller number of eyeballs looking at the code .
But all open source software is vulnerable , and the open source movement can only benefit by paying more attention to security .
That 's why in my first paper I raised a heretical question : " Is the global free software / open source movement suffering from a special type of bad advocacy ? " .
For those who read the paper it 's clear that my answer is yes .
Bad Linux advocacy for me is the name of an Linux - based open source fundamentalism -- the dominant type of bad advocacy that adopts the simplistic and badly thought out arguments in a spirit of an obscure cult ( see also Lysenkoism ) .
I ’ve often wondered why it ’s so difficult to avoid hyperbole when discussing Linux .
After all it 's just one of several free Unix kernels and technically even not the best one .
Actually dramatic overstatement is not confined only to those who are most closely associated with Linux evangelism ( sometimes called slashdot crowd ) , it also spread to those who are developing and implementing Linux .
In his DaveNet The Sixth Sense Dave Winer aptly stated ( bold italics are mine ) :
What does open source have in common with Java ?
Both are former panaceas .
Like object oriented programming in the late 80s , if adopted , they would supposedly lead to magic synergies known only to the promoters , and breathlessly replayed by reporters looking for an easy story to repeat over and over and over .
Java was ( and is ) Pascal reincarnated .
A virtual machine that ran on real machines .
Good idea .
Been done before .
Open source is a tradition that dates back at least thirty years , if not longer .
If you learned how to program in the 70s your teacher was quite possibly the source code for Unix ( that 's how I learned ) .
Fodder for the hype machine , these " trends " make some people rich , and take the focus off what 's really happening , which is still the Web .
Then they fade out , to be replaced by the next vaccuous trend , and in the meantime , most developers work hard , outside the spotlight , to make their users happy .
( That includes open source developers , btw . )
The thing that 's truly offensive about these panaceas is that they are so exclusive and disrespectful of other developers .
Until Sun embraced SOAP , the only Sun-endorsed way to communicate with Java apps was to convert your whole program to Java .
The Java evangelists would cheerfully and seriously tell you to do this .
Same with open source .
Unless you shipped all your source on their terms the wall was insurmountable .
These are outages of the first order .
When will we learn the lesson , that predates even the Internet , that all outages in software are eventually routed around .
Try to control and you lose your place .
The time - of - control is shortening all the time .
IBM had a 20 year run .
DEC was the leader for 10 years .
Microsoft , for four , at most .
Java had an even more brief run and it was over before Java could actually do anything that anyone wanted to do .
If you 're a student of technology history , the long - shot bet of being dominant looks worse and worse .
Even if you manage to attain dominance , briefly , who wants to be the trend of last year ?
Thankfully the open source rage is on its last legs .
If you 're honest and made a bet on open source , and want to get help from the press and investors , here 's some open source ( free ) advice .
Play it down .
Actually open source software can be better than closed source it can be worse , it 's just different class of software with its own strengths and weaknesses and to claim that its superior by definition is kind of naive .
I think that RMS is right that the main advantage here is freedom , not quality or other real or perceived attributes per se .
Actual benefits depend on the personality of developer .
Only talented people can produce top quality software be it open or proprietary .
And quality documentation about algorithms used is often as important ( or more important ) as the availability of the source code .
I often will prefer more simple and probably not that well written open source program to the closed source one , but I would prefer a closed source program with carefully documented algorithms and clean interface to a large undocumented open source program .
For non-trivial programs algorithms are of crucial importance .
I would not go that far as to claim that extremist open source advocacy is a new type of religious fundamentalism although raymondism does share some features with a high demand cult .
Religious fundamentalism is extraordinarily dangerous .
Open source fundamentalism , at best , is annoying .
It 's just an example of what 's happening when a movement based on particular principles is repackaged and sold to companies as a new and effective means , i.e. a better way to turn a profit .
It 's interesting that RMS is now typically criticized by ESR for being past his time , etc .
There 's a predictable pattern to many social movements of this sort : they begin with prophetic characters with a radical moral - ethical agenda ( RMS ) , and then gradually become co-opted and assimilated to serve corporations and the market by opportunists like ESR .
But in reality FSF approach " free as a principle " approach is close to the idea of " pro bono " and might be the most democratic approach .
Yes , there are problems with GPL , and I would prefer BDS - style license in most ( but not all ) cases , but that 's a completely different story .

— Harry Frankfurt , author of On Bullshit “ Though German philosopher Leo Strauss ( 1899 - 1973 ) is referred to as the father of neo-conservatism , Yale political science professor Smith argues that relationship is a ' mountain of nonsense ' and that Strauss was ' a friend of liberal democracy — one of the best friends democracy ever had . …'
Smith quietly builds a persuasive case that Strauss 's work ' makes clear that the danger to the West comes not from liberalism but from our loss of confidence in it . '” — Publishers Weekly
An excerpt from Reading Leo Strauss Politics , Philosophy , Judaism Steven B. Smith Why Strauss , Why Now ?
Strauss was a towering presence … who neither sought nor had any
discernible influence on what passes for the politics of the group .
— Joseph Cropsey , “ Leo Strauss at the University of Chicago ” Who was Leo Strauss ?
Strauss was a German - Jewish émigré , the product of the pre–World War I Gymnasium who studied at several universities , finally taking his doctorate at Hamburg in 1921 .
He was a research assistant at an institute for Jewish research in Berlin before leaving Germany in 1932 to settle first in England and later in the United States , where he taught principally at the New School for Social Research in New York and later the University of Chicago .
It was during his period in Chicago that Strauss had his greatest influence .
He was , by most accounts , a compelling teacher , and like all good teachers everywhere he attracted students , many of whom came to regard themselves as part of a distinctive school .
By the time of his death in 1973 Strauss had written ( depending on how one counts them ) more than a dozen books and around one hundred articles and reviews .
Strauss ’s works were highly controversial during his own lifetime .
When he joined the faculty at the University of Chicago he was the author of two books published in Germany that were long out of print : a slim monograph on the political philosophy of Hobbes , and an even briefer commentary on a minor dialogue by Xenophon .
The future trajectory of his life ’s work would by no means have been obvious .
In the autumn of 1949 he gave a series of lectures under the auspices of the Walgreen Foundation , titled Natural Right and History , that was to set his work on a new and distinctive path .
It was , literally , his way of introducing himself to the world of American social science from the seat of a major university .
The book of the same title was published four years later , in 1953 .
What exactly did Strauss set out to do ?
Strauss offered a deliberately provocative account of what might be called the “ modernity problem ” that had been widely debated in prewar European circles , but which was still relatively unknown to Americans of that era .
Prior to Strauss , the most important current of twentieth - century American political thought was John Dewey ’s “ progressivism . ”
Against the view that the advance of science , especially the modern social sciences , was bringing about the progressive triumph of freedom and democracy , Strauss rang an alarm bell .
Strauss argued by contrast that the dynamics of modern philosophy and Vertfrei , or value - free social science , were moving not toward freedom and well - being but to a condition he diagnosed as nihilism .
In Strauss ’s counternarrative of decline , the foundations of constitutional government as understood by the American framers were gradually being sapped and eroded by the emergence of German - style historicism according to which all standards of justice and right are relative to their time and place .
All of this was presented as the outcome of a densely detailed history of political thought in which all the trappings of German scholarship were on full display .
His analysis was bold , audacious , and learned .
The ensuing controversy pitted those advocates of American progressivism against Strauss , who regarded modernity as a mixed blessing that required certain premodern classical and biblical teachings to rescue modernity from its own self - destructive tendencies .
People on the outside often think of Straussianism as some kind of sinister cult replete with secret rites of initiation and bits of insider information — much like a Yale secret society .
Straussians are often believed only to associate with other Straussians and only to read books written by one another .
Some actually believe that Straussianism requires the subordination of one ’s critical intellect to the authority of a charismatic cult leader .
Others regard it as a political movement , often allied with “ neo- conservatism , ” with a range of prescribed positions and ties to conservative think tanks and policy centers .
The liberal historian Arthur Schlesinger deplores the influence of what he calls Strauss ’s “ German windbaggery ” and compares it to the deleterious influence of Hegel on earlier generations .
“ Strauss , ” Schlesinger continues , “ taught his disciples a belief in absolutes , contempt for relativism , and joy in abstract propositions .
He approved of Plato ’s ‘ noble lies , ’ disliked much of modern life , and believed that a Straussian elite in government would in time overcome feelings of persecution . ”
None of these beliefs could be further from my own experience .
There is no doubt that the influence of Strauss — or at least his purported influence — is greater now than at any time since his death more than thirty years ago .
Of course , Strauss is widely regarded today as a founding father , perhaps the Godfather , of neo-conservatism , with direct or indirect ties to the Bush administration in Washington .
The last few years have witnessed a virtual hostile takeover of Strauss by the political Right .
“ The Bush administration is rife with Straussians , ” James Atlas has written in the New York Times .
Never mind that the Bush administration , like all administrations , is rife with people of all sorts .
The association of Strauss with neo-conservatism has been repeated so many times that it leaves the mistaken impression that there is a line of influence leading directly from Strauss ’s readings of Plato and Maimonides to the most recent directives of the Defense Department .
Nothing could be more inimical to Strauss ’s teaching .
Early readers of Natural Right and History like Walter Lippmann saw in the book a support for the belief that the growing debility of modern democracy was due to its loss of faith in the natural law tradition .
Straussians have always advocated a strong national government against the crabbed conservatism of “ states rights ” fundamentalists or the reactionary defenders of a purely federal reading of the Constitution .
A textbook on American political thought compiled by two students of Strauss was dedicated to the memory of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Felix Frankfurter and “ to the noble employment of the power they once wielded . ”
The editors of the collection commend FDR for expanding the powers of government beyond securing the bare rights of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness to a “ higher and grander ” conception of the modern welfare state .
What distinguished the Straussian approach to politics was the focus on the “ philosophic dimension ” of statecraft , often at the expense of mass behavior or interest - group politics that attracted the attention of mainstream of political science .
Straussians typically studied not only the deeds , but the words of singular political leaders and statesmen , but without any particular ideological pique or animus .
Straussians might be either liberal or conservative , although there was a bias toward those who sought to anchor their policies in a reading of the principles of the American founding .
Even recently a distinguished student of Strauss served as a prominent member of the first Clinton administration , advising on matters of domestic policy .
The fact is that Strauss bequeathed not a single legacy , but a number of competing legacies .
It is a gross distortion to retrofit Strauss ’s teachings to conform to the agenda of the political Right .
His writings on a wide range of subjects continue to spark lively debate among students in a host of fields .
New scholarly editions of his work including previously unpublished essays and lectures as well as a voluminous correspondence have all recently appeared , and more are slated for the future .
The influence of his ideas on politics and policy - making are continually discussed and debated , and are frequently condemned in leading opinion magazines , journals , and newspapers .
To the question “ why Strauss , why now ? ” I would say , ” if not now , when ” ?
What Is a Straussian ?
Once when I was in graduate school , at a party where there was probably way too much to drink , a friend of mine — now by coincidence a prominent attorney in New Haven — was asked if he was a Straussian .
“ If you mean by that do I regard everything that Leo Strauss ever wrote as true , ” he replied , “ then , yes , I am a Straussian . ”
We all laughed because my friend ’s answer so perfectly captured and parodied the common view of Straussianism .
The question , am I a Straussian , is something I have been asked on more than one occasion over the years .
Sometimes the question seems prompted by nothing more than the idle desire to know what Straussianism means .
At other times it has the vague character of an “ are you now or have you ever been . . . ” kind of accusation .
In any case the question has caused me to think about what it is to be a Straussian .
The first point I would make about Straussianism is that it is not all of a single piece .
There is rather a set of common problems or questions that characterize Strauss ’s work : for example , the difference between ancients and moderns , the quarrel between philosophy and poetry , and of course the tension between reason and revelation .
None of these problems can be said to have a priority over the others nor do they cohere in anything as crude as a system .
Whatever may be alleged , there is hardly a single thread that runs throughout these different interests .
Strauss did not bequeath a system , doctrine , or an “ ism , ” despite what may be attributed to him .
Rather , he presented a distinctive way of asking questions or posing problems that may have been loosely related but that scarcely derived from a single Archimedean point of view .
It is questions that motivate all of Strauss ’s writings — questions like “ Is reason or revelation the ultimate guide to life ? ”
“ Has the quarrel between the ancients and the moderns been decided in favor of modernity ? ” and “ Are the philosophers or the poets better educators of civic life ? ”
The point of Strauss ’s questions is less to provide answers than to make us aware of certain alternatives .
In the age - old debate , he was probably more a fox than a hedgehog .
There are many different kinds of Straussians with many and varied interests and perspectives .
Some Straussians have devoted themselves entirely to ancient philosophers , while others work on postmodernism ; some are deeply religious , while others are proudly secular ; some think about politics and policy - making , while others delve into the deepest problems of Being .
This diversity reflects , to some degree , the variety of Strauss ’s own interests .
Strauss ’s writings range from studies of the ancient political philosophy of Thucydides , Plato , Xenophon , and Aristotle , to the Judeo - Arabic writers of the Middle Ages , to such early modern political thinkers as Machiavelli , Hobbes , Spinoza , and Locke , to late nineteenth - and early twentieth - century figures like Nietzsche , Weber , and Heidegger , to issues regarding the philosophy of history , hermeneutics , and the nature of the social sciences .
In each of these areas Strauss made notable and lasting contributions that are still widely discussed today .
Few people — one might have to go back to Hegel — have written with as much authority on so wide a range of philosophical , literary , and historical topics .
Precisely because Strauss ’s work covers such a broad landscape , there is not one way of being a Straussian .
In fact there are considerable differences among his heirs over precisely what is most valuable in his legacy .
Strauss regarded himself as taking the first tentative steps toward the reawakening of substantive interest in the permanent or fundamental problems of political philosophy at a time when it was widely argued that political philosophy was dead .
More than this , he expanded the repertoire of political philosophy to include a large number of previously neglected thinkers and topics .
The major textbooks of his era made no reference to any of the medieval Judeo - Arabic writers or even to the works of the American founders .
Strauss ’s work treated the American founding as an important philosophical moment in the development of modernity and even encouraged a reconsideration of the ideas of philosophically minded statesmen like Jefferson , Lincoln , and Wilson .
His work also inspired a serious engagement with the work of African - American political thinkers from Fredrick Douglass to W.E.B. DuBois to Martin Luther King , Jr. at a time when their writings received little formal recognition in the academy .
None of this , however , gets us any closer to an understanding of what a Straussian is .
Careful Readers and Careful Writers Straussianism is characterized above all by what its practitioners often call the art of “ careful reading . ”
When asked what he taught , it is said , Strauss often replied “ old books . ”
Strauss paid special attention to reading mainly primary sources , typically in their original languages .
This does not sound terribly controversial today except that at the time the idea of actually reading the great works of political theory had fallen out of favor .
It was widely believed in many circles that the development of the modern behavioral sciences had put political philosophy on the path to ultimate extinction .
It was believed by many that the meaning of writers like Plato , Hobbes , or Rousseau had been more or less established and all that was necessary was to situate them in their place along the historical time line so that the proper burial rites could be given .
Political philosophy had become a kind of undertaker ’s art with little relevance or importance for the living issues of either politics or philosophy .
Strauss helped to change this perception .
In the language of the old Westerns , he came to realize that “ there ’s gold in them thar hills . ”
In contrast to the prevailing historicism that regarded the great works of the tradition as a product of their times , Strauss treated these texts not as museum pieces to be labeled and catalogued , but as living and vital contemporaries from which there was still much to learn .
The history of political thought was not an end in itself , but a necessary propadeutic to the recommencement of serious political philosophy .
Strauss taught that the interpretations that had been ascribed to the great writers of the past were far from settled or obvious , that to understand them it was necessary to bracket our contemporary preconceptions about the path of progress or history and to consider their writings afresh as part of an ongoing conversation in which we , the readers , were invited to take part .
It is possible for us to participate in such a conversation precisely because the great thinkers disagree with one another .
Is Being one or many ?
Does it exhibit permanence or change ?
It thus becomes necessary for us to try to understand and to judge between rival teachings , to determine which among them is closer to the truth .
The reader is thus invited to participate in a conversation in which the outcome is far from predetermined , but which remains , in Strauss ’s term , an open question .
Strauss was , above all , a reader .
He taught his students how to read and how careful writers , like himself , wished to be read .
Strauss expanded the scope of our reading to include forgotten figures and others who had been overlooked by the canon of political philosophy .
Not only did he breathe new life into familiar figures and texts ; he introduced new and unfamiliar writers like Al - Farabi , Judah Halevi , Maimonides , and Spinoza to the attention of political philosophers .
He pioneered the study of politics and literature by focusing on the literary character of texts and highlighting the “ old quarrel ” between philosophy and poetry in his reading of thinkers like Plato and Nietzsche .
He inquired into the rhetoric in which philosophical arguments are cast long before it became fashionable to talk about “ speech acts ” and the performative function of language .
He paid special attention to ironies , jokes , and puns even in the most serious works and devoted one of his last books to a study of the comedies of Aristophanes .
Strauss ’s most important legacy was teaching his readers how to read .
No one can be a Straussian who does not fundamentally love to read .
It is , of course , slightly disingenuous to suggest that Strauss taught the simple art of reading .
No reading , we have been taught to believe , is ever innocent , and Strauss was scarcely a naive reader .
He was in fact one of the great “ masters of suspicion . ”
Strauss ’s manner of reading unfolded from a single premise that he happened upon slowly and that he developed in a variety of contexts over many years — namely , that great writers often hide or conceal their most profound thoughts from all but the most careful and persistent readers .
This seems a simple enough , even a commonsense premise .
Do any of us ever say ( or intend to say ) all that we mean ?
Do we not speak in different ways to different people depending on the context of the conversation and the extent of our desire to communicate ?
Strauss ’s discovery — actually , he called it a “ rediscovery ” — of esoteric writing can be attributed to a number of causes , from the simple desire to avoid persecution for unpopular or heterodox opinions , to a sense of “ social responsibility ” to uphold the dominant values of one ’s society , to the wish to tantalize potential readers with the promise of buried treasure .
Strauss ’s recovery of the esoteric tradition has been deeply controversial , to say the least .
In the first place , there is the question of how we know when an author is writing in a way to deliberately conceal or obscure his teaching .
There is , for example , genuine disagreement over whether Descartes ’s incorporation of God into his system was a strategic ploy or a genuine expression of his religious convictions .
One could ask similar questions of a host of thinkers .
Did Maimonides write to confirm or undermine a belief in the primacy of revelation ?
Did Machiavelli write to advise or usurp the prince ?
Did Locke ’s theory of natural rights , the virtual cornerstone of the American Declaration of Independence , secretly contain a crypto- atheist and materialist tendency ?
The answers to these questions are obviously not self - evident .
It is clear from what Descartes says about himself that he was writing with the example of Galileo ’s fate before the Inquisition strongly impressed on his mind , and we know from recent biographies of Locke that he wrote under constant surveillance — so much so that the Master of his Oxford college once referred to him as “ the master of taciturnity . ”
Critics of Strauss ’s practice of “ reading between the lines ” have latched onto two potential pitfalls or abuses of the method .
There is a genuine problem of how to distinguish careful writers who may disguise their teachings from those who are simply muddled .
When is a contradiction simply a contradiction and when is it a clue to a paradox ?
How do we know whether an author is trying to reveal something through a system of elaborately “ contrived deceptions ” or is simply confused ?
Strauss himself expressed caution when applying this method .
“ Reading between the lines , ” he wrote , “ is strictly prohibited in all cases where it would be less exact than not doing so . ”
Strauss is clearly being deliberately coy here , but his point is a serious one .
There is no a priori way of answering this question , any more than there is an a priori way of knowing when a wink is a wink and not a blink .
In other words , look and see for yourself .
The proof is in the eating .
There are other critics who believe that Strauss ’s manner of reading leads to the perverse conclusion that whenever a writer says X , we should assume that he really means not - X .
Thus a learned classicist — who should know better — has written of Strauss ’s reading of Plato ’s Republic that he makes the text mean exactly “ the opposite of what it says . ”
This is , of course , absurd .
The idea that an esoteric communication could be decoded simply by inverting the literal meaning of a text stands in direct violation of the very principles of esotericism .
It would be to turn interpretation into a kind of cryptography .
What Strauss did show is that the Republic is a book written for several different types of audiences represented by the different characters in the dialogue and that this helps to explain the very different rhetorical stratagems employed throughout the work .
Strauss stressed that every text will inhabit a different set of historical circumstances that delimit what can and cannot be said and that every author will express a very different temperament and sensibility regarding his audience .
In contrast to any kind of flat - footed literalism , he sought to avoid the reductionism inherent in the view that every book can be read as if it were a journal article written last week .
Perhaps the most revealing ( although less often commented upon ) aspect of Strauss ’s manner of reading is his claim that “ the real opinion of an author is not necessarily identical with that which he expresses in the largest number of passages . ”
In other words , careful reading must be attuned to the singular , the unexpected , and the anomalous .
The true intention of an author may be revealed more clearly in what is left half - said or only subtly alluded to than in what is constantly and relentlessly reaffirmed .
The result of this manner of reading is to create what a recent French reader of Strauss has referred to as “ two regimes of proof . ”
The one follows the scientific method that regards the true as what is subject to repetition and control , while the other , Strauss ’s hermeneutic method , sees the truth in what is singular and nonrepeatable .
Truth is to a certain degree “ identical with rarity . ”
Strauss ’s recovery of esoteric writing could not but leave the impression that his own writings were presented in some kind of code to which only the initiate held the key .
Of course , if there ever was such a secret teaching , those who know it are n’t saying and those who are saying do n’t know .
Strauss did write cautiously and reticently , especially with regard to the American regime , but certainly not to conceal some sinister intent .
He did not write for the sake of undermining democracy , restoring ancient hierarchies , or advocating policies of imperial expansion — all accusations that have been leveled against him — but for the purpose of protecting the regime from the corrosive blasts of skepticism that philosophy necessarily effects on any body of received opinion .
He did not sanction the selective use of lies in public life , as has been asserted , and he certainly nowhere claimed that his own works , much less those of others , were written to convey the opposite of what they said .
Strauss wrote as he read , that is , with an awareness that there are multiple kinds of readers with different interests and different needs and that like any good teacher it is necessary to address them in different ways .
There is considerable controversy over the sources of Strauss ’s recovery of the esoteric tradition .
Was its source in Plato ’s artful use of the Socratic dialogue to convey various meanings to different readers without actually speaking in his own name ?
Was it in Maimonides ’s allegorical reading of certain scriptural passages and imagery ?
Or was it in Nietzsche ’s claim that all that is profound loves masks ?
Strauss himself loved masks and even admitted in a letter to his fellow émigré Karl Löwith that “ Nietzsche so charmed me between my 22nd and 30th years that I literally believed everything I understood of him . ”
Strauss was not a Nietzschean .
As he says , Nietzsche ’s spell on him was broken after he reached the age of thirty .
But he did carry with him something of Nietzsche ’s love of unmasking others and his desire to hide behind masks of his own making .
No one can claim to have read Strauss seriously without attaining an appreciation for the immense sense of playfulness , of hide and seek , that attends his manner of reading and writing .
The Theologico - Political Problem
The great theme of Strauss ’s life work — what he himself referred to as “ the theme of my investigations ” — is the theologico - political problem , a term he drew from his early studies of Spinoza .
At the center of the theologico - political problem is a choice or conflict between two comprehensive and apparently irreconcilable alternatives : revelation and reason , or as he refers to them metaphorically , Jerusalem and Athens .
The difference between Jerusalem and Athens is not simply a philosophical or theological problem ; it is at heart a political one .
It is a matter of authority and who holds ultimate authority .
Does final authority rest with the claims of revelation and all that it implies or with one ’s autonomous human reason as the most fundamental guide to life ?
Yet while Strauss sometimes presents Jerusalem and Athens as two incompatible alternatives between which one must choose , he elsewhere presents them as two limbs of the tree of knowledge that have mutually nourished and sustained one another .
It is the dialectical tension between these two that has provided the “ core ” or “ nerve ” of the Western political tradition .
Indeed , Strauss shows that the theologico - political problem is more than just a function of civilizations touched by the great monotheistic religions of Judaism , Christianity , and Islam .
It extends as far back as Socrates , the first political philosopher , who was sentenced to death by the city of Athens for corrupting the young and disbelieving the gods of the city .
From the outset , the claims of philosophy have been at odds with the ancestral laws of the city and its interpreters .
The conflict between Jerusalem and Athens was already something that took place , figuratively speaking , within the heart of historical Athens .
It is a problem conceivably coeval with humanity itself .
The conflict between Jerusalem and Athens is , however , more than an extended metaphor for the conflicting claims of revelation and reason .
Jerusalem meant for Strauss the spiritual and historical homeland of Judaism and the Jewish people .
Strauss was a German Jew who grew up during the final years of Wilhelmine Germany and who came to adulthood during the Weimar Republic , before leaving Germany for good at the onset of the Hitler period .
His earliest writings dealt almost exclusively with Jewish themes and Zionist theory .
He described himself as having been “ converted ” to political Zionism at the age of seventeen , and he was later able to write that the establishment of the state of Israel procured “ a blessing for all Jews everywhere ” whether they realized it or not .
The Zionism advocated by Strauss was not of the messianic or redemptivist kind .
He strongly opposed the view that the establishment of the Jewish state could provide a solution to the Jewish Question .
He once enigmatically referred to the Jewish people and their fate as “ the living witness for the absence of redemption . ”
The establishment of the Jewish state was rather a political necessity forced on the Jews not only for the sake of their collective survival , but for the sake of Jewish self - respect .
The question for any student of Strauss ’s work is where he stood on the theologico - political problem .
Was he a citizen of Jerusalem or Athens ?
As the studies in this work indicate , there is no simple answer to this question .
Strauss taught sacred texts as though they were philosophical works and philosophical works as if they were sacred texts .
His careful readings have often been called “ Talmudic , ” generally by people who know little of Talmud , and sometimes “ kabalistic ” by those who know even less of Kabala .
What is true is that he often saw things that more conventional readers ignored .
In an essay on Thucydides he emphasized the role of piety and “ the gods , ” concluding with the question quid sit deus ( what does God mean ? ) .
In an article on Genesis he could treat the opening chapters of the Bible as if they were a companion to Aristotle ’s Physics .
Strauss taught his readers to listen carefully and to take seriously the claims of Jerusalem , especially at a time when the modern social sciences were treating religion as if it were some atavistic holdover from a dark antedeluvian past .
The Enlightenment ’s “ Napoleonic ” attack upon revelation , best expressed in Spinoza ’s Theologico - Political Treatise , was beaten back by successive waves of counter - Enlightenment theology and the call for a return to orthodoxy .
The rationalist ’s attempt to overthrow faith is self - refuting , as it rests on a faith in reason that reason itself cannot justify .
Nietzsche ’s announcement of the “ death of God ” must be considered at best premature .
But neither did Strauss ’s critique of the Enlightenment lead to an endorsement of Jerusalem .
“ The victory of orthodoxy through the destruction of rational philosophy was not an unmitigated blessing , ” he wrote .
The challenge was not to declare a winner in the struggle , but to remain open to the claims of each and the challenge of each .
The Politics of Philosophy What were Strauss ’s politics ?
This seems to be the question at the heart of the recent debate over Straussianism .
To be sure , an extraordinary range of positions have been attributed to him or have been said to be inspired by his writings , from a politics of “ national greatness ” to expanding an American empire .
He has been declared an enemy of democracy and a partisan of the radical Right .
But where did Strauss even remotely imply this ?
His opposition to communism , his rehabilitation of the tradition of natural right , and his skepticism of the general direction of democracy has as much in common with liberalism as with conservatism .
On the basis of my own reading , Strauss had no politics in the sense in which that term is generally meant .
His works do not endorse any political program or party , whether of the Left or of the Right , Democratic or Republican .
He was a philosopher .
If there is a distinctive politics in Strauss ’s writings , it concerns almost exclusively what could be called the politics of philosophy .
Political philosophy meant for him not merely the philosophical treatment of politics , but the political treatment of philosophy .
Strauss once declared his writings to be a contribution to the study of the “ sociology of philosophy , ” by which he meant the study of philosophers as a class .
What distinguishes all philosophers as a class from all non-philosophers is an intransigent desire to know , to know things from their roots or by their first principles .
It is precisely because philosophy is radical that politics must be moderate .
Accordingly , Strauss saw a permanent and virtually intractable conflict between the needs of society and the requirements of philosophy .
Philosophy understood as the search for knowledge is based on the desire to replace opinion about all things with knowledge of all things .
This desire to replace opinion with knowledge would always put philosophy at odds with the inherited customs , beliefs , and dogmas that shape and sustain social life .
The politics of philosophy consists of the philosopher ’s twin needs to show a respect — a decent respect — for the opinions and beliefs that sustain the collective life of society and at the same time to address and recruit new members into the ranks of the potential philosophers .
The question that naturally arises is the relation between the philosopher and the city or the political regime , or ( to put the matter a slightly different way ) the relation between theory and practice .
Strauss often presents these as two virtually incompatible ways of life , that of the philosopher and that of the citizen - statesman or what he sometimes , following Aristotle , calls the gentleman .
Is philosophy ministerial to the statesman ’s life or is politics of value only because it provides the context for the pursuit of philosophy ?
Which holds the higher rank ?
Strauss ’s writings exhibit the same degree of discretion and tact in discussing this problem as in addressing the related theme of Jerusalem and Athens .
It is this problem of the relation of philosophy to the regime that has divided the Straussian legacy between rival East Coast and West Coast camps .
Of course this distinction refers not merely to geography , but to a state of mind .
At issue is the meaning of the word “ political ” in the expression “ political philosophy . ”
East Coasters are said to believe that “ political ” refers only to philosophy ’s mode of expression , the deference philosophy pays to what it is compelled to obey and what it perforce pretends to esteem .
West Coasters , by contrast , regard political philosophy as offering substantive moral guidance to political life on issues like religion , patriotism , and the status of America among the nations of the world .
Does philosophy ultimately stand above or apart from the world of politics ?
or are politics and patriotism goods that philosophy , too , must respect ?
The result , as the founder of the West Coast school has put it , has been a “ crisis of the Strauss divided . ”
The essays collected in this volume all take a stand on the East Coast — the far East Coast — world of Straussian geography .
Strauss was , on my reading , a philosopher for whom philosophy meant reflection upon the fundamental or permanent problems of political life .
Strauss believed all alleged solutions to such problems , the theologico - political problem for example , to be inherently contestable .
He was , as he once described himself , a skeptic in the original Socratic sense of the term .
It was , as Strauss saw it , the peculiar heroism of philosophy to live with that sense of uncertainty and to resist the attractions of absolutist positions in both politics and philosophy .
Strauss taught the necessity of detachment , of a certain ironic distance from the world of politics and the partisanships that it engenders .
Those who put politics before philosophy or who regard philosophy as an instrument of political action threaten to demean philosophy , to reduce it to the status of an ideology , no different from Marxism .
Strauss was fundamentally a skeptic for whom the ends of politics and philosophy were inherently irreconcilable .
Strauss taught , if he taught anything , that “ there is a fundamental disproportion between philosophy and the city , ” that is , the ends of philosophy and the ends of politics are irreducible to one another .
He was far more impressed with the irreconcilability of basic values than with their harmony .
The closest he ever came to giving a clear and unequivocal answer to the problem of philosophy ’s relation to politics occurs in a public exchange late in life with his friend Jacob Klein .
Strauss regarded Klein , along with Alexandre Kojêve and Hans - Georg Gadamer , as his oldest philosophical friends , a group who , despite their philosophical differences , remained committed to the idea of philosophy as a way of life .
In a revealing sentence Strauss noted that on the basis of his reading of Maimonides he came to attach a much greater significance to the tension between philosophy and morality than had Klein .
“ Mr. Klein and I differ regarding the status of morality , ” Strauss said .
He then goes on to clarify his meaning as follows :
Now let me explain this .
That the philosophic life , especially as Plato and Aristotle understood it , is not possible without self - control and a few other virtues almost goes without saying .
If a man is habitually drunk , and so on , how can he think ?
But the question is , if these virtues are understood only as subservient to philosophy and for its sake , then that is no longer a moral understanding of the virtues .
. . .
If one may compare low to high things , one may say similarly of the philosopher , what counts is thinking and investigating and not morality .
It has sometimes been argued that Strauss ’s defense of philosophy as a way of life has led to the creation of an inward - looking elite that exempts itself from the moral principles applicable to the rest of humanity .
This assertion of the priority of the philosophic over the political life did not lead Strauss to neglect , much less to despise morality or virtue .
To the contrary , Strauss was deeply concerned with the steady erosion of democracy into a form of mass culture .
“ Democracy , ” he wrote , “ is meant to be an aristocracy which has broadened into a universal aristocracy . ”
By this he meant a regime in which education — liberal education — had become the prerogative of every citizen .
Democracy as originally understood was , in a word , liberal democracy .
But this classical conception of democracy as an aristocracy of everybody has slowly degraded into a form of “ really existing ” democracy .
Modern democracy is today a form of mass rule , but mass rule does not mean rule directly by the masses so much as rule by mass culture , a culture manipulated by marketing techniques and other commercial forms of propaganda .
“ Are we not crushed , nauseated , degraded , ” Strauss asks rhetorically , “ by the mass of printed material , the graveyards of so many beautiful and majestic forests ? ”
It remains today the task of liberal education to act as a “ counterpoison ” to the effects of mass culture and to recall citizens to the meaning of democracy as it originally was meant .
Strauss once described himself as a “ friend of liberal democracy . ”
This was clearly intended to be ambiguous .
A friend of liberal democracy is not the same thing as a liberal democrat .
So what kind of friend was he ?
Strauss was not a liberal in any orthodox sense of the term , but there is such a thing as Straussian liberalism .
He was certainly not a partisan of the hardcore Right , although some of his students have been .
Strauss ’s politics , such as they were , had more in common with cold - war liberals of his generation — Isaiah Berlin , Lionel Trilling , Walter Lippman , Raymond Aron — than with any of the major conservative figures of the same period .
What Strauss brought to liberalism was a kind of “ Tocquevillian ” sensibility that regarded the freedom of an educated mind as the best antidote to the pathologies of modern mass politics .
Contrary to the views attributed to him by many of his friends and virtually all of his enemies , Strauss regarded himself as a teacher of moderation .
“ Moderation , ” he wrote , “ will protect us from the twin dangers of visionary expectations from politics and unmanly contempt for politics . ”
When buying a laptop , you need to think about factors beyond performance and weight .
There are numerous additional things like screen measurements , battery life , and keyboard and connection options which you have to consider .
Let ’s look at a few of the aspects one must think about when buying a laptop .
1. Processor
One of the first things you require to consider in a laptop is the CPU .
The current laptop CPUs include Intel ’s Core Duo and Core 2 Duo processors which exceed older single - core Intel processors ( e.g. Pentium M ) .
Other laptop computers utilize the AMD Athlon Turion 64 X2 dual - core processor – which is also a great performer .
In general , nevertheless , if you ’re trying to find a laptop , I ‘d recommend you to try to find one with an Intel Core Duo processor .
You can likewise read this guide to learn more .
2. System memory
The quantity of RAM in the laptop is extremely important .
If you ’re not short of cash , my advice is to get at least 1GB of RAM – that is the minimum you need to get newer PC applications to run quickly .
Likewise keep in mind that you can always include more memory to your existing laptop .
You might be interested in this short guide on how to set up new memory modules into a laptop .
3. Graphics memory
Laptop graphics are another function you will wish to consider .
Normally , I ‘d say you must choose 128MB of dedicated video RAM .
Also , ensure that the graphics memory is utilized solely for graphics use and not shared with the main memory .
If you mean to play video games on the laptop , then look for innovative 3D graphics chips with about 256MB to 512MB of dedicated graphics memory .
Be prepared to hand over a lot more cash though .
4. Screen
You will likewise want to take a look at the laptop screen .
Laptop screens have actually just recently ended up being bigger .
The majority of them have gone widescreen so you can watch films or edit spreadsheets more easily .
If you plan to utilize the laptop from home a lot , then I ‘d choose a 17 - inch large screen .
If you are more concerned about portability or if you take a trip a lot , then laptops with screen sizes of 12.1 or 13.3 inches might suit you much better .
There are likewise 14.1 - or 15 - inch screens for laptop computers , but I believe manufacturers are moving away from these models .
5. Battery
Here ’s another vital factor – laptop battery life .
I personally find it extremely discouraging to have my notebook power go out after 15 minutes at Starbucks .
What you need to do is to purchase a laptop that has about 3.5 hours of battery life , operating on a Core Duo or Core 2 Duo processor .
Make sure you question the retailer on the length of time the battery can last – a brief battery life is generally a deal breaker for me .
6. Keyboard and Pointing Device
Some individuals believe that the keyboard and pointing gadget on a laptop is necessary .
If you have huge fingers , you might be more comfortable typing on a bigger note pad keyboard than a little one .
Ensure you attempt the laptop out – get the feel of typing and navigation before you buy the laptop .
7. Optical drives
I ‘d normally recommend getting a laptop with a rewritable DVD drive as a minimum .
One thing you require to understand is that some laptops sacrifice a DVD drive in exchange for a lighter weight and mobility .
If you do n’t believe you require a DVD drive all the time , then you might wish to get a model that does not have one .
8. Hard disk
In the laptop hard disk department , what can I state ?
More is better .
These days , you can get a notebook hard disks being available in sizes of 160 GB or more .
You can likewise get SATA hard drives if you have more money .
9 . Weight
Another thing to note is the weight of the laptop .
Now , when you buy a laptop , always remember that the total weight consists of the notebook AND the Air Conditioning adapter , any external modules , and their cable televisions .
These can add up to quite a bit of weight .
10 . Communications
Nowadays , you will find that many laptops include a minimum of two USB 2.0 ports – I ‘d advise that as a minimum .
If you do a lot of video modifying , then a FireWire ( IEEE 1394 ) port also becomes important .
You should also check for great network capabilities .
Make sure your new laptop has integrated ethernet ability , a built - in wireless connection and likewise built - in Bluetooth ( if you require to transfer information in between your cellphone and the laptop ) .
A few of the laptops likewise consist of card slots for removable media such as CompactFlash , Secure Digital and MultiMediaCard .
If you take a lot of digital photos , then this feature might matter to you .
11 . Laptop Shopping Tips
Whew !
That sure is a long list of features to think about when looking for Laptops for Sale South Africa .
In addition to comprehending the features , there are 3 essential laptop shopping tips you need to bear in mind .
Suggestion # 1 : How will you utilize the laptop ?
Among the issues when you purchase a laptop is that you pay for features you do not actually require .
Among the very best methods to prevent paying excessive is to consider how you will utilize the laptop .
If it is primarily for word processing , then settle for a less expensive machine .
If it is for video gaming , then you need a more effective one .
Pointer # 2 : Think of features you will not jeopardize
You should likewise know that there are some fundamental functions in a laptop you should NOT compromise .
For example , for me , if I were buying a laptop , I ‘d select ( as a minimum ) – an Intel Core Duo or Core 2 Duo processor , 2GB of RAM , 160 GB of disk drive , a very small screen size and a very long - term battery .
Your list of vital function might vary .
Pointer # 3 : Remember you can decide on Most suppliers will let you custom - build your own laptop .
This is a good idea , because you can simply choose those functions you require and not pay any extra .
You can easily buy a faster notebook by accepting a smaller disk drive or DVD drive , for instance .
Conclusion
I hope this post has revealed you that ins and outs of buying a laptop .
Keep in mind , a laptop is a pricey device .
It will likewise be something you bring along anywhere you go .
For this reason , it is critical that you do correct research study and find the proper laptop to suit your needs .
Remember the above suggestions the next time you ’re in the market for a laptop , and pleased shopping !

Linux Snobs : Real Barriers to Entry OP / ED L inux Snobs : Real Barriers to Entry
by Walter V. Koenning for the OPINION / EDITORIAL section on reallylinux.com .
O ne particularly distraught new Linux user came to me and shared how his meeting with a number of Linux " pros " turned to a bash Windows , bash him and bash everything he said gathering .
Instead of answering his question regarding which GUI they prefer to use on their systems , the response was a clear : " you ignoramous !
Go back to your Windows . "
Today , Linux offers so much for the beginning user and those moving from the Windows world .
There are major successes with file sharing ( thanks to work of projects like SAMBA and their excellent documentation ) , effective ways to run applications across platforms ( thanks to the blood and sweat of many including those from the Wine project ) .
And there are so many more great examples and helpful beginner guides .
In other words , there is very positive work going on in the Linux community to help new comers get up to speed and productive .
However , there are a few remaining issues that prevent people from experiencing the depth , breath and quality of Linux and Open Source in general .
Some are minor , but others present very real barriers to entry into the world of Open Source and Linux .
When I started work on this article I assumed I would be writing about something else , like user interfaces , or perhaps issues with applications compatibility between the Windows world and Linux .
Or perhaps the continued FUD that exists and the barriers to communication .
But instead , I found myself encountering more and more new users who referred to another issue , a very real barrier to their entry into the Linux world .
Many new users were telling me they were encountering something that effectively turned them off Linux .
Linux snobs .
First , let me declare my point with all this .
As I state in the conclusion below , often personality can influence decisions such as business expenditures .
Second , I want to make sure you know my conviction that most of the people I encounter in the Open Source world , and among Linux engineers and project members specifically , are some of the smartest and nicest people I 've met .
Notice the coupling : smart AND nice .
Being smart does n't make you automatically nice and vice versa .
In my case I had met many who were both .
Yet , there is a resounding , unwavering reaction among many newcomers I 've talked to about people who make the Linux community look bad ( read some of the Slashdot replies or Digg replies for examples ) .
I 'm writing about Linux , not the whole realm of software support .
I 'm also referring to people who ask reasonable and sensical questions .
And most importantly , I 'm not the only one stating this .
For other good examples of Linux snobbery please read this great article as well as this insightful one .
As I spoke to newbies , one Windows user who wanted to learn about Linux shared the encouraging and constructive note ( not ) he received from one of the project members .
The responding note read :
" Hi jackass , RTFM and stop wasting our time trying to help you children learn . "
Lovely little encouragement .
This particular Windows user was a newbie to Linux but had been in the I.T. industry for years .
His question , regarding " how do I start process daemons like a web server " was reasonable , not childish .
His reaction to the Linux " guru " was also reasonable .
He basically said that he does n't have time to deal with people so fanatic and terse they reject questions on message boards created to answer questions .
But was this simply a situation of a particularly rude Linux junkie , who perhaps had missed sleep or woken on the wrong side of the bed ?
Or is there something more serious going on ?
I will not point to any particular group , distro , or person in this article but do hope that my examples clarify an issue that is real .
Two days later I learned of another new comer to the Linux community who had been in a meeting with a Linux engineer .
Jason had met what he considered one of the outstanding experts in Linux , who had been on one of the Linux teams for a particular distro .
The meeting began with the usual warm greetings , but shortly moved into a tirade by the Linux " guru " that resembled a three year old 's tantrums .
As described by Jason , the engineer began to mock Windows users , declared that Jason was " obviously ignorant and inexperienced " and continued by giving his personal opinions on various topics from religion to political philosophy .
Jason , speechless , walked out of the meeting telling another friend , " my question had to do with his thoughts on the different distros .
I had no idea it would get such a response ! "
Calling an interested new Linux user " obviously ignorant and inexperienced " as a component of the answer to his question seems a bit off .
As I inquired about this rather peculiar meeting , it became obvious that this engineer had some basic problems with any people unlike himself .
In other words , he respects only those who mirror him .
Sadly he was not the only example .
Mind you , there are MANY good examples of helpful Linux people .
But this article is trying to convey that issues in communication do exist .
Most important of all , I propose that one such person , with xenophobic and hyper - conformist tendencies , can ruin a batch of good work .
One such person can turn off a slew of interested people and even organizations from Linux use .
In this case he did , and Jason returned to his office the next day with very little positive to say about the help they can expect from the Linux community ... at least his own local community .
Later , I decided to start meeting some of these unique folks myself .
I figured , there has got to be some misunderstanding .
Highly cognitive people , people of intellect , have more sense than what I was hearing from these newbies .
Besides , I had some very pleasant experiences getting help myself .
So I decided to check on it first hand .
I ended up meeting with someone who I considered highly versed in the Linux realm and who was also well respected for his experience with Open Source development .
The meeting began on a positive foot as we shared about personal travel experiences .
The conversation was mild and reasonable .
But as I continued to ask questions such as " which database you find more effective for scaling " it apparently hit the delusion of godhood nerve . " it apparently hit the delusion of godhood nerve " Suddenly , this person was standing up waving his arms and yelling about database theory and " how f- ing stupid I was " and how " little I understood about databases " and their " f- ing inner workings . "
How little I knew about " keys and locking " that he had experience with .
He went on to tell me how he was one of the " most well versed database " people and that " you can learn a lot from me . "
I had to wonder what he included in his morning coffee ?
I was contemplating calling 911 to get this guy a respirator and some valium .
Or maybe I should have interrupted to remind him that it was unlikely he had reached the apex of human evolution ahead of the rest of us .
One of the Linux pros I talk to regularly , Richard , who is far more stable and intellectual about this issue , shared some sage advice : " People are people -- and in every community you have some really nice and some not so nice ones .
But we work together because of the greater good and the common goal . "
I wholeheartedly agree .
But I want to add that it does matter HOW we respond to a question , even an inappropriate or poorly stated question .
So , what about the sincere new Linux users asking questions and getting these kinds of responses ?
He candidly said , " Most people who fly off the handle like that are not deliberately mean , they probably are under a lot of work pressure , or maybe their marriage is breaking apart or something even more painful is happening personally , and unfortunately the newbie gets dumped on . "
Richard 's wise advice is to deal with each other in some reasonable semblance of grace and mercy .
Are newbie 's now required to show greater grace , more patience and richer respect than those already in the community ?
I 'm not sure that 's a better way .
Instead , I propose that one person who gets an opportunity to vent on new comers leaves an indelible impression on others regarding the Linux community .
Of course , this does n't mean the end of the community .
The Linux community will grow just fine regardless and there remain many helpful people involved today , but it 's a point I find few people like to admit .
So the point of all this is to say , although most people do n't choose technology based on personality , often personality can influence important decisions such as business expenditures .
" often personality can influence decisions such as business expenditures " Today , Linux growth includes a vast number of new comers , sometimes well versed in technology but at other times not so well versed .
These new users are coming to us and asking us to help them cross the great divide .
I hope that more people will extend a hand to someone who sincerely appreciates Linux and wishes to be part of the Linux community , and help offset those who see new comers as bad .
After all , we do share a common goal , and the growing and continued success of Linux invariably depends on each of us individuals .
My hope is that many new comers to Linux will see what a great community and what a great promise Linux holds not only for themselves but also their organizations .

After a weekend to reflect , I ’ve come up with the Top 10 Things I Learned at the Web 2.0 Summit that was put on by O’Reilly and hosted by John Battelle .
1. Google likes it fast .
While the results and point of her talk was n’t surprising , Marissa Mayer did an efficient 10 minute talk with great examples proving that the speed of a web application is one of the most important things to users , and it often has a very direct correlation to traffic and revenue .
2. Everybody is chasing Google .
Essentially every interview and session I attended featured a question along the lines of “ How can you / we beat / compete with Google ? ” .
Again , not really groundbreaking , but when you see numerous CEOs and powerful people at all the major web companies trying to answer that question without really having a great answer , it makes it all too clear that nobody knows yet how to deal with the 800 - lb gorilla .
3. Jeff Bezos is on to something .
Amazon ’s recent move into web services has befuddled analysts on Wall St. , but after listening to the energetic Bezos talk about their new initiatives on this area you can see that it is a good opportunity for Amazon , and one they intend on dominating at .
I like the move .
4 . Advertising is being thrown on it ’s head .
The Advertising 2.0 session , as well as other sessions and talks helped show that advertising online is far from being set in stone .
Ideas are still coming from everywhere , and many large players are still not yet embracing some of the new and better ideas .
Video advertising is a big opportunity that ’s being attacked from many different angles , and nobody knows what the right one is yet .
5 . There are n’t as many innovative startups as I thought , at least not there .
After hearing that there were over 250 companies that applied to be part of the Launchpad 13 where startups got to launch themselves with a 5 - minute presentation , and after seeing who the panel of judges were , I thought we were in for an exciting set of companies .
I was underwhelmed , and a bit bored by the presentations .
One - quarter of them seemed useless , one - quarter of them did n’t seem very innovative , one - quarter were actually interesting and promising , and I ’d read / used about one - quarter of them long ago ( how is that a launch ? ) .
6 . It feels like a bubble .
It was a really nice venue , very crowded , the parties were pretty lavish , and it seemed like a lot of people were walking around hoping to get bought by the big few in the industry .
Just had a bubble vibe .
7 . You can hack a conference .
Recently - launched Mashery hacked the conference by booking a conference room for a party right in the middle of the action .
It was cheaper than sponsoring the event , and may have gotten them more attention .
8. Basic problems still need fixing .
About 40 % of talks and sessions seemed to have problems with the wireless connection , computers screwing up or crashing , or power not working .
And the conference wireless connections were hit and miss all week .
It ’s ironic we ’re all trying to build these new revolutionary web applications , when we still suffer from such basic infrastructure problems .
9 . Talking to random people you do n’t know is still socially awkward .
I ’ve been to many business conferences , I feel confident about myself and my employer , and I feel I ’m a social person .
Yet , there ’s still something very socially awkward having conversations with people at these events .
They ’re either trying to sell me something , I ’m trying to sell them something , or you ’re both generally not interested but still are in a situation where a conversation needs to exist .
Sure , every once in a while a common ground is formed and a real conversation ensues , but it ’s still pretty strange .
10 . Eric Schmidt talks through an API .
Read the link for more details , but it was fascinating listening to Schmidt talk intelligently , dance around tough questions , and jab his competitors without explicitly doing so .
Very well done .
I attended a presentation yesterday at the Telus Sphere of Science Word of Telus World , or whatever they 're calling it these days , by D - Wave systems , The Quantum Computing Company ™ .
These are the folks who surprised a lot people , myself included , by announcing their plans to have a commercial quantum computer ready to complete real work by 2008 .
The crowd lined up outside the sphere was overwhelmingly male , but other than that a good cross-section of the lower - mainland population .
We picked up our pre-registration nametags and were herded into a smallish theater on the second floor .
There was a lot of congratulatory talk and thank - yous for investors and employees , and then the CTO of the company , Geordie Rose took the floor to explain a little bit about the proof - of - concept that they 've developed .
The computer is a 5 - millimeter - square chunk of niobium cooled to a temperature of four millikelvins ( hence the title of this post ) .
The 16 - qubit proof - of - concept is roughly a hundred times slower than a thousand - dollar PC , but apparently it works , and the company is confident that they can scale it up rapidly to the 1000 - qubit mark , where the device will become notably faster for certain classes of problems than existing digital computers .
While most people that know a little bit about computing technologies have predicted that quantum computers are about fifty years away from commercialization , something that is technically a five - qubit computer is available for sale right now .
The fifty - year number is basically a wild - ass guess of the people trying to develop so - called " gate model " quantum computers , which mimic the functionality of a conventional microprocessor using quantum devices rather than transistors .
D- Wave is using an entirely different approach : an analog computer .
Not analog in the sense of " continuously varying , " but analog in the sense that the manifestation on their four - by - four grid of qubits is analogous to a graph that represents the problem they are trying to solve .
What sorts of problems might those be ?
They are currently targeting applications in the life sciences ( drug database searches and protein folding ) , molecular simulations , and more general database searches .
In mathematical terms , they hope to dramatically speed up the classes of problems known by mathematicians as NP - complete and NP - hard .
As an example he used a graph of the shortest path that visits every city in Sweden ( no bork jokes , please ) .
With current technology it would take a state - of - the - art PC about 85 years to solve , but it could potentially be solved in minutes by a quantum computer .
One of the things any crypto - geek who 's seen Sneakers would ask is can it be used to quickly factor large numbers * .
The answer is " yes , it can , " although this fact was strongly downplayed by Mr. Rose when someone brought it up in the post - presentation question period .
Apparently saying that accelerating NP - complete problem solving was a good way of getting funding for QC research back in the ' 90's , since that sort of acceleration could have a significant impact on the field of public - key cryptology .
The way that the system is configured is that each of the sixteen qubits is connected by a variable link to each of it's eight nearest neighbors ( or five in edge - cases and three in corner cases ) .
Each qubit and each connection is biased in a certain direction , and over time they assume the lowest ( or second - lowest ) energy state , which represents the best ( or second - best ) solution to the problem , which is then read and transmitted back to the user .
If the qubits represent wedding guests ( one of the demonstrations ) , and Joanne really wants to sit near a window , but not at the same table that John is sitting , that fact is represented in a the set of initial biases , and the lowest - energy state that results is the optimal arrangement of guests at the wedding .
Future work , aside from ramping up the number of qubits also involves connecting each qubit in the array to every other qubit .
The other piece of the puzzle , and the reason for the public demo , is to generate interest and get people thinking of interesting optimization problems that a future commercial implementation of this type of computer could support .
The problems that were demonstrated were a molecule search ( which can be represented as a max independent set problem ) , the aforementioned seating plan , and a round of SudoQ .
However , the fact that the solutions were obtained about one hundred times slower than a modern PC coupled with the fact that the machine , residing a few kilometers away in Burnaby , was accessed through a somewhat hollywood - OS like interface means that I could not swear in a court of law that they actually had a working quantum computer .
But my gut feeling is that they have something working at the level that most early - stage demos do , with a bit of sleight of hand and selective choice of subject matter making the thing appear about as functional as it is , though much , much friendlier .
After the question period was closed , I grabbed a fancy poster of their device in its sample holder on the way out and made my way to the SkyTrain .
* I was a bit chagrined that the question that was actually asked was whether a QC could accelerate the factoring of large prime numbers .
I will go on record as saying that I can factor any large prime number in only very slightly more time than it takes you to tell me what the number is .
Web domain Hell.com hath no takers
Organizers hoped the online address would get bids of more than $ 1 million .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Internet domain name Hell.com failed to be bought via a live auction Friday , which organizers had hoped would bring bids of more than $ 1 million .
Another live auction will not take place until a year from now .
However , interested buyers will have the opportunity to grab hell .com before then in ongoing silent auction , according to Moniker .

Moniker is a unit of the brand and marketing company Seevast Corp .
Hell.com was founded by Kenneth Aronson , who described the domain as a private network " global think - tank " that he wanted to sell because of all the traffic receives and all the rumors the name generates .
" Branding experts said the name is recognized more than Coca - Cola , " said Aronson .
" It 's so enigmatic and the person who buys it has the potential to make it a very big portal . "
The domain , which Aronson said he would n't sell for less than a million , has become home to a secretive online community that receives nearly 5,000 new visitors daily .
" Hell.com is a variable asset and it's the opposite of what we need , " said Aronson .
" I may even consider withdrawing it because of all the publicity it has received . "
Most of the domain names auctioned were represented by Moniker .
The Internet domain company conducted the auction of nearly 325 names including Hiyieldcd.com , HMO.com , Stockexchanges.com , Digitalcameras.com , and Rentalcarrates.com .
Attendees were allowed to place bids at the live auction or via the Internet in a silent domain auction .
It ended at 5:30 p.m. ET .
" This is a cutting edge company and a cutting edge event that has generated industry excitement , " Lance Podell , CEO of Seevast , said .
" It 's a very large crowd , with well over 500 people including corporate buyers and domain - name buyers . "
The online address is the latest to be put up for sale in a growing market for domain names amid the booming growth of Internet advertising with online giants such as Google ( Charts ) , Yahoo ( Charts ) , Amazon.com ( Charts ) and eBay ( Charts ) .
Gary Kremen , owner and founder of Match.com , sold Web domain Sex.com for about $ 12 million earlier this year , while another domain , Diamond.com , was sold for $ 7.5 million .

Napster wants to be a sellout
Security has already been stepped up on the New York subway
The city has awarded a $ 212 m ( £ 118 m ) contract to defence firm Lockheed to run the security programme for the bus and the underground train network .
The upgrade will also include enabling mobile phone signals on the subway .
The authorities said concerns that this could help the detonation of bombs were outweighed by potential advantages .
These include the ability of passengers to make emergency phone calls from 277 of the 468 underground stations .
Pivoting cameras
More than 1,000 cameras and 3,000 sensors will be installed at platforms , stations and terminals , on bridges and in tunnels , but not in train carriages or buses themselves .
The cameras are said to be able to capture images from 100 m ( 300 ft ) and to zoom , pivot and rotate .
Sensors will be able to detect non-moving objects left on a platform .
It is not clear how long the installation will take , but according to reports the first cameras are already being installed .
The announcement of the programme comes more than six weeks after four suicide bombers killed 52 people in attacks on London 's transport network .
Deterrent
New York authorities have been criticised for being slow to protect their own network - the country 's biggest - despite having cash at their disposal .
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA ) approved a $ 591 m ( £ 330 m ) security plan in 2002 , but until now has only spent a fraction of that .
" We hope ( this ) will detect the terrorists before an incident happens , not just be able to report for forensic purposes after an incident happens and identify who the terrorist is , " MTA Executive Director Katherine Lapp said .
" If a person were to put an unattended package ... this system hopefully would identify it and we would be able to respond , to deploy our bomb sniffing dogs or emergency personnel in order to take that possible explosive device out of the system . "
Correction Appended
WASHINGTON , July 18 —
In a new approach to making the electric car a mass - market product , a California company will unveil on Wednesday a model that is very specialized , very expensive and very , very fast .
Tesla Motors , a four - year - old Silicon Valley start - up , has raised $ 60 million and spent about $ 25 million developing a two - seat Roadster that will sell for $ 85,000 to $ 100,000 .
It goes from zero to 60 miles an hour in four seconds , “ wicked fast , ” said the company ’s chairman , Martin Eberhard .
Because it is an electric , the driver does not have to shift into second gear until the car hits 65 , he said .
The Roadster comes 10 years after the introduction of another two - seat electric car that was hailed as a breakthrough in technology , the EV - 1 made by General Motors .
While many environmentalists had hoped that would be the vanguard of a new trend , G.M. withdrew that car as the three - year leases expired , saying that its limited range — less than 100 miles — made it unmarketable .
I am currently working through the mathematics required to understand the Poincaré Conjecture and the possible solution recently proposed .
I want to blog my journey and I started out summarising the basic foundations of pure mathematics necessary to get to the conjecture - specific parts .
Now that I 've got to explaining the conjecture , posts are about the background in differential geometry to understand the proofs .
A new bill introduced in the US Senate this week would force satellite , digital , and Internet radio providers ( but not over - the - air radio ) to implement measures designed to restrict the ability of listeners to record audio from the services .
Called the " Platform Equality and Remedies for Rights Holders in Music Act " ( PERFORM ) , the bill is sponsored by Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - TN ) , Joseph Biden ( D - DE ) , Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) , and Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) .
If the name of the bill sounds familiar , it should .
The bill was originally introduced in April 2006 with the support of the RIAA .
It died in committee , but the senators are hopeful that the bill will pass this time around .
Like its predecessor , the new legislation would require content protection on all satellite radio broadcasts along with cable and Internet broadcasts .
Broadcasters would be required to " use reasonably available and economically reasonable technology to prevent music theft . "
But that 's not bad for consumers , says Sen.
Feinstein , who tells us that " consumers ' current recording habits " will not be inhibited as they will still be allowed to record by time period or station .
However , they would be prevented from automatically cherry - picking all the Shakira songs from the services .
The bill would also get the government into the business of price controls , with content providers required to pay a predetermined " fair market value " for the use of the music libraries .
If another company decides to enter the unprofitable satellite radio market in the future , it too , would be forced to pay the same rates as XM Radio and Sirius .
The music industry 's overexaggerated fears of piracy are driving the legislation , just as they did last year .
" New radio services are allowing users to do more than simply listen to music .
What was once a passive listening experience has turned into a forum where users can record , manipulate , collect and create personalized music libraries , " said Sen. Feinstein .
" As the modes of distribution change and the technologies change , so must our laws change . "
Yesterday , Sen. John Sununu ( R - NH ) announced legislation that would prevent the FCC from creating exactly the same kind of technology mandates that the PERFORM
Act would require .
At the time , Sen .
Sununu said that " misguided requirements distort the marketplace by forcing industry to adopt agency - blessed solutions rather than allow innovative and competitive approaches to develop . "
The Consumer Electronics Association was quick to voice opposition to the PERFORM Act .
" We are disappointed that this legislation , which faced vocal bipartisan opposition last year , has been reintroduced just as consumers are about to enjoy incredible innovation from new content devices launched at the 2007 International CES this week , " Michael Pettricone , the CEA 's senior vice president of government affairs , told Ars in a statement .
" This bill has absolutely nothing to do with piracy , the Internet , or peer to peer redistribution .
Instead , it would assault the freedom of consumers to use content they have lawfully acquired for private and noncommercial purposes in the privacy of their homes and vehicles .
We will continue our effort to inform lawmakers of the dangers of this legislation to our digital economy and to long established principles of fair use . "
Under the Audio Home Recording
Act of 1992 , consumers have the right to make noncommercial analog and digital copies of broadcasts .
That would change if the PERFORM
Act passes this time around , as the ability to record music for one 's own personal use would be restricted , marking another erosion of consumers ' fair use rights .
Be sure to let your senators know how you feel about this legislation .
EWD316 : A Short Introduction to the Art of Programming by prof.dr .
Edsger W.Dijkstra August 1971
Contents
1. Preface
The market is already so heavily overloaded with introductory texts on computers and computer programming that one must have rather specific reasons to justify the investment of one 's time and energy in the writing of yet another " Short Introduction to the Art of Programming " .
The sole fact that one likes to write is , in itself , an insufficient justification .
Before undertaking such a task I should therefore ask myself " Why am I going to do it ? " and also " What do I expect to be the distinguishing features of this little monograph ? " .
There is a simple , practical reason .
At my University I give , mainly for future Mathematical Engineers , an introduction to the art of programming and my students would welcome some supporting material .
Besides that , without some form of lecture notes , my colleagues have very little idea of what I am really trying to teach !
The contents of this course show signs of settling down — I have now given it three times — and therefore this seems the appropriate moment to produce a document that can serve as lecture notes .
These are purely local circumstances and as far as they are concerned , a normal set of lecture notes — in Dutch , say — would do .
The fact that I have not chosen this form means that I am aiming at a larger audience .
Such an act is always somewhat presumptuous and the usual author 's trick to save the image of his modesty is to say that from various sides he has been urged to produce his manuscript — a trick that I could apply in this case without lying .
But I do n't think that I shall resort to that trick because I really believe that a larger audience than just my students can benefit from it , or even enjoy it .
The fact is that over the last years I have addressed myself to the question of whether it was conceivable to increase our programming ability by an order of magnitude and what techniques ( mental , organizational or mechanical ) should then be applied in the process of program composition .
Personally , I felt these investigations very rewarding : I gained a much deeper understanding of the nature of the difficulty of the programming task , I became much more conscious about my " programming style " , which improved considerably , and found myself , when programming , in much better control of what I was doing than I had ever been before .
Needless to say , my teaching was heavily influenced by these experiences .
The purpose of this little monograph is to assist the programming reader in cleaning up his own thinking , to transmit to him some mental disciplines by sticking to which he can avoid making his job unnecessarily difficult .
It is born out of dissatisfaction with the usual kind of programming course , which now strikes me as like the type of driving lessons in which one is taught how to handle a car instead of how to use a car to reach one 's destination .
This monograph is intended as a complement to such courses ; I shall try to present programming — to quote Niklaus Wirth — " as a discipline on its own merits , as a methodology of constructive reasoning applicable to any problem capable of algorithmic solution " .
I expect the distinguishing feature of this little monograph to be its incompleteness , incompleteness in many , many respects .
It will not be self - contained in the sense that I assume my readers somewhat familiar with a decent higher level programming language .
( This assumption is a direct consequence of the local circumstance that my students have had a modest prior exposure to the cleaner aspects of ALGOL 60 . )
For those readers who identify the programmer 's competence with a thorough knowledge of the idiosyncrasies of one or more of the baroque tools into which modern programming languages and systems have degenerated , the book will also be very incomplete , because I wo n't describe any programming language — not even the one I use — to any degree of detail .
I shall use some sort of programming language , as " a communication language " say , not for the communication of algorithms , but for the communication of ways of thinking , as a vehicle for programming style .
In yet another respect , this little monograph will be very incomplete .
As said above , I shall try to present programming " as a discipline on its own merits , as a methodology of constructive reasoning applicable to any problem capable of algorithmic solution " .
At present , such a methodology does not yet exist in the full sense of the word , only elements of it have become apparent , others are just lurking behind our mental horizon .
This of course , is not very satisfactory , but it is a true reflection of the current , still rather poor state of the art .
It is a consolation that no piece of scholarship ever reaches the state of perfection and I tell myself that the conviction that there is more to come is no justification for witholding what we have got .
It will also be incomplete as a result of the choice of the examples and the choice of the considerations .
By necessity , the examples will be " small " programs , while the need for a discipline becomes really vital in the case of " large " programs .
Dealing with small examples in an ad - hoc fashion gives the student not the slightest clue as to how to keep the construction of a large program under his intellectual control .
Illustrating how we can avoid unmastered complexity , I hope to deal with small examples in such a fashion , that methodological extrapolation to larger tasks is feasible .
The selection of considerations is also kept to a strict minimum : we restrict ourselves to programming for purely sequential machines and when we consider a trade - off question , we shall usually present this in the form of a trade - off between computation time versus store requirements .
In this respect the document may strike the reader as very strongly dated , perhaps even out - dated by the time it appears in print .
If so , I hope that I can justify my defense , which is that such a reader has failed to read between the lines : it is not so much the particular trade - off question chosen that matters , as the fact that problem has been approached in such a fashion that we have made a conceptual framework in which such specific trade - off questions can be postponed until the appropriate moment .
The only thing I can do at this stage is to urge my readers to read between the lines as much as possible .
( If one tries to transmit ideas or methods , one can talk about them but that alone is insufficient : one must show examples illustrating them .
When lecturing , it is my sad experience that after having dealt with a specific example , I find the attention of half my audience completely usurped by this example : they have forgotten that the example was only brought to their attention to illustrate something more general .
This is a sad experience and no amount of prior warning that this misunderstanding is bound to happen if they are not careful , has ever enabled me to avoid it ! )
To put it in another way : it is my purpose to transmit the importance of good taste and style in programming , the specific elements of style presented serve only to illustrate what benefits can be derived from " style " in general .
In this respect I feel akin to the teacher of composition at a conservatory : he does not teach his pupils how to compose a particular symphony , he must help his pupils to find their own style and must explain to them what is implied by this .
( It has been this analogy that made me talk about " The Art of Programming " . )
There is a further class of potential readers that will find this subject matter very incompletely dealt with , viz .
those who identify the programmer 's task with writing programs in , say , FORTRAN or PL / 1 .
One of my implicit morals will be that such programming languages , each in their own way , are vehicles inadequate to guide our thoughts .
If FORTRAN has been called an infantile disorder , PL / 1 must be classified as a fatal disease .
Although I would love to do it , it is impossible to give a true acknowledgement , listing all persons whose relevant influence on my thinking I gratefully remember or should remember .
With my apologies to all persons unmentioned I would like to make a few exceptions and list in alphabetical order : my mother mrs.B.C.Dijkstra-Kluyver , R.W. Floyd , C.A.R.Hoare , P.Naur , B. Randell , D.T.Ross , N. Wirth and M.Woodger .
None of the persons listed , however , should in any way be held responsible for the views expressed ( with the possible exception of my mother who is in some sense responsible for my existence ) .
I am deeply indebted to my sister - in - law , mrs.E.L.Dijkstra-Tucker for her willingness to correct my use of English in yet another manuscript and to W.H.J.
Feijen for the great care with which he has screened the text for typing errors .

Next chapter : 2 . Some Fundamental Notions
Many overseas Chinese students choose to stay abroad
About two - thirds of Chinese who have studied abroad since the 1980s have chosen not to go back home , the China Daily said .
This ratio , in a new report compiled by the Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing , is reportedly the highest in the world .
China is now " in dire need of people of expertise " , Li Xiaoli , the co-author of the report , told the newspaper .
" It has been a great loss for China ... to see well - educated professionals leave after the country has invested a lot in them , " Li Xiaoli said .
Since 2002 , more than 100,000 students have gone abroad to study each year , but the number of returnees has been only 20,000 to 30,000 , the report estimates .
The newspaper noted that , to a certain extent , the trend was unavoidable as it reflected China 's growing integration with the rest of the world .
But in an editorial , the paper said the government should do more to encourage these migrants to come home .
" Many talented Chinese emigrated overseas because they could not find opportunity at home , " the China Daily said in an editorial .
" It 's time to nurture that reverse migration . "
About 35 m people of Chinese origin are living in more than 150 countries around the world , according to the report .

In the league table of the world 's biggest economies , four of the fastest climbers in the past 20 years have been in East Asia .
Israel has also leapt up the rankings , matching South Korea and Hong Kong by rising a dozen places .
China has risen only four notches — but even in the early 1980s it was already the world 's tenth - biggest economy in current dollars .
India , perhaps surprisingly , has barely budged .
Several oil producers have fallen down the rankings , despite the increase in oil prices towards the end of the period covered .

Keith :
We would be greeted as liberators , with flowers .
As they stood up -- we would stand down , we would stay the course , we were never ' stay the course ' , The enemy was al Qaeda , was foreigners , terrorists , Baathists .
The war would pay for itself , it would cost 1 - point - 7 billion dollars , 100 billion , 400 billion , half a trillion dollars .
And after all of that , today it is his credibility versus that of generals , diplomats , allies , Republicans , Democrats , the Iraq Study Group , past presidents , voters last November , and the majority of the American people .
Transcripts below the fold
Olbermann : President Bush makes no secret of his distaste for looking backward , for assessing past results .
But in our third story on the Countdown tonight ... too bad .
Any meaningful assessment of the president 's next step in Iraq must consider his steps and missteps so far .
So , let 's look at the record :
Before Mr. Bush was elected , he said he was no nation - builder ; nation - building was wrong for America .
Now , he says it is vital for America .
He said he would never put U.S. troops under foreign control .
Today , U.S. troops observe Iraqi restrictions .
He told us about WMDs .
Mobile labs .
Secret sources .
Aluminum tubing .
Yellow - cake .
He has told us the war is necessary ... Because Saddam was a threat ; Because of 9/11 ; Osama bin Laden ; al Qaeda ; Because of terrorism in general ;
To liberate Iraq ;
To spread freedom ;
To spread democracy ;
To keep the oil out of the hands of terrorist - controlled states ;
Because this was a guy who tried to kill his dad .
In pushing for and prosecuting this war , he passed on chances to get Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , Muqtada al - Sadr , Osama bin Laden .
He sent in fewer troops than recommended .
He disbanded the Iraqi Army , and " de - Baathified " the government .
He short - changed Iraqi training .
He did not plan for widespread looting , nor the explosion of sectarian violence .
He sent in troops without life - saving equipment .
Gave jobs to foreign contractors , not the Iraqis .
Staffed U - S positions there , based on partisanship , not professionalism .
We learned that " America had prevailed " , " Mission Accomplished " , the resistance was in its " last throes " .
He has said more troops were not necessary , and more troops are necessary , and that it 's up to the generals , and removed some of the generals who said more troops would be necessary .
He told us of turning points :
The fall of Baghdad , the death of Uday and Qusay , the capture of Saddam , a provisional government , the trial of Saddam , a charter , a constitution , an Iraqi government , ¤elections , purple fingers , a new government , the death of Saddam .
We would be greeted as liberators , with flowers .
As they stood up -- we would stand down , we would stay the course , we were never ' stay the course ' ,
The enemy was al Qaeda , was foreigners , terrorists , Baathists .
The war would pay for itself , it would cost 1 - point - 7 billion dollars , 100 billion , 400 billion , half a trillion dollars .
And after all of that , today it is his credibility versus that of generals , diplomats , allies , Republicans , Democrats , the Iraq Study Group , past presidents , voters last November , and the majority of the American people .

One winner studied why woodpeckers do not get headaches
Welshman Howard Stapleton 's device makes a high - pitched noise inaudible to adults but annoying to teenagers .
Other winners included a US - Israeli study into how a finger up the rectum cures hiccups and a report into why woodpeckers do not get headaches .
All the research is real and published in often prestigious journals .
Unlike the recipients of the more illustrious awards , Ig Nobel winners get no cash reward .
Nevertheless eight of the 10 winners this year paid their own way to receive their prizes in Cambridge , Massachusetts .

by Gregory Ericksen , Ernst & Young LLP
On a rainy October afternoon , a suburban housewife in River Forest , Illinois , was driving her Plymouth Volare loaded down with kitchenware to a friend 's home in nearby Elmhurst .
She was alone , there being no room for anyone else in a car crammed with six crates of products she planned to demonstrate and - hope against hope - sell at a friend 's home .
A troubled expression on Doris Christopher 's face reflected the What am I doing ?
conversation she was having with herself .
She had selling jitters .
" I was filled with uncertainty .
I remember thinking as I was driving along that this was the most unlikely situation I 'd ever gotten myself into .
All the way out to my friend Ruth 's house , I still remember what I was thinking .
' How could I ever have thought this would work .
What a harebrained scheme this is .
I will never do this again . '
But I had to go ahead because Ruth had people coming to her house and she 'd invited them at my request .
I could n't go back home .
I had to show up . "
Doris did n't feel any better when she reached her friend 's home and started to unload her wares in the rain .
As was typical then ( 1980 ) , the family room where she was going to present her demonstration was in the basement , and it turned out that the stairs were too narrow for her crates .
So , she had to maneuver down the steps sideways and then proceeded to unload the crates , too tense to even look at the assembled women .
She concentrated on arranging the items in as attractive a way as possible before turning to face the group .
" There were about 15 people sitting there and Ruth introduced me .
I thought to myself , ' Well , the sooner I get started , the sooner it will be over and I wo n't have to do this again . '
So I started talking .
What happened was exciting to me as a former home economics teacher .
The group was listening with rapt attention .
One of the things I enjoyed about teaching was getting people 's attention and here they were n't whispering to each other and I did n't have to say , ' Sit up in the back row . '
They were listening , really listening .
The next thing was they asked to pass things around .
I thought , ' My gosh !
They 're even helping !'
" I was telling them about the products I brought along and demonstrating them .
In those days , frozen pizza had become a standard item so I used a pizza to demonstrate baking stones , which truthfully were one of the most amazing things I 've ever used in the kitchen .
You put any food on these stones and you get superior results .
I did a frozen pizza on a baking stone and added some fresh veggies - which was unusual in those days .
I used some of the tools I brought to cut them up .
Then I prepared a vegetable tray with some fancy little garnishes and a dip in the center .
As I looked around the room , I realized that I had their full attention .
Then people asked me to pass around the kitchen tools so they could get a close look at them .
By the end of the evening , they had purchased nearly $ 175 worth of kitchenware .
I never expected to sell that much -- I was thrilled .
But the most important thing that happened is that four of the women asked me to present demonstrations in their homes . "
Three hours later - back in the Volare - Doris Christopher was talking to herself again , this time in a totally different mood .
Though she might not have said so at the time , an entrepreneur was born .
" The drive back home was very different from the drive out there .
I was on Cloud Nine .
Two of the four people who offered to arrange demonstrations were complete strangers .
They had never laid eyes on me .
They happened to be neighbors of Ruth .
What a vote of confidence !
I can honestly say business just grew from that point forward
The women at the demonstration had wonderful kitchens , but they did n't have a place to go for advice about the stuff in their kitchen drawers and they did n't have any sense about where to get the right working tools for their kitchens .
They were hungry for tools that would make it easy to do what they were doing every day . "
The reluctant outing and its mini success have mushroomed into more that 15,000 in - home demonstrations every week by Doris Christopher 's sales force of 42,000 kitchen consultants ( as they are called ) in all 50 states .
They present and produce kitchen shows , which are generating kitchenware sales that are approaching $ 500 million for what is now nationally know as The Pampered Chef , Ltd .
The company 's motto speaks for itself : " The Kitchen Store That Comes to Your Door . "
The kitchen consultants offer 130 products , 90 of them exclusive to The Pampered Chef , all of them selected for high quality with an eye on multipurpose .
One customer favorite : a barbecue tool that flips burgers , pierces sausages , slices meat , opens bottles , and checks meats to see if they 're cooked .
" One of the key elements in success is having a passion for what you do .
My love of my work fuels the resilience to overcome obstacles , supports my dedication to remain true to my original vision and maintains my determination to succeed . "
A classic example of a made - in - the - U.S. entrepreneurial triumph with all the trimmings , The Pampered Chef is rooted not in technology , but in tradition .
It started out when one mother ( Doris Christopher ) confronted the familiar women 's dilemma of career versus family , with a determination to give family top priority .
Determined to remain a stay - at - home mother , she was sending her two little daughters off to school , which freed her to look for some way to use her professional training - in her case as a home economist .
She was not sure how .
She went through a process shared by all entrepreneurs in one way or another in searching for a business enterprise , with the added requirement of wanting to stick close to home , husband , and children .
The possibility of opening a store did n't appeal to her as she considered what it took " finding the right location , furnishing it , stocking it , hiring staff and , after all that investment of time and effort , you " have to sit there and wait for customers to come to you . "
Not for her .
" The business I chose really did start as a very , very small fledgling concept , which I intended to pursue part - time .
My goal was a business that would not interfere with my family priorities , something that would require about 20 hours a week .
I remember thinking about it in the months before my second daughter , Kelley , would go into kindergarten .
Julie , our older daughter , was already in the third grade .
" I did n't want to do something that I could n't do well .
I thought about catering because I love to cook .
Given that caterers provide their services on weekends and holidays , that would not fit in with my priority of being at home with my family .
I tried to think about other things that would combine my particular abilities and knowledge with the family lifestyle I wanted and came up with the idea of cooking demonstrations with an inherently interesting message to deliver .
" I remembered how often I was amazed when I volunteered to help friends at their get - togethers only to find that they lacked appropriate kitchen tools .
My idea was to demonstrate tools with food so that people could try them out to see if they would work for them before they did any buying .
Basically , it was a show - and - tell idea .
When I started thinking over the idea of in - house parties , my husband , Jay , was very helpful in dialoguing with me on how to make our kitchen shows unique and exciting .
He helped me realize that I could do things in whatever way I thought was best in terms of my goal - to satisfy the hunger for information .
" At a Pampered Chef kitchen show , our consultants pair real food with the tools that prepare it , giving the customer an on - site demonstration of how a product works .
Our customers also benefit from a " try - before - you - buy " experience .
The recipes are prepared by the kitchen consultant at the show .
Guests also learn meal preparation / cooking ideas , tips and techniques during the demonstration , regardless of whether or not they make a purchase .
Each of our products comes with specific use and care information , along with recipes developed by our test kitchen .
This helps ensure the customer 's satisfaction with the product .
" The other thing about our kitchen shows is that they do n't involve a major commitment , as it would be the case if people sign up for a cooking class .
All they have to do is say yes to an evening of refreshments and conversation with friends .
One evening , not a series of lessons .
And they come away feeling very satisfied with what they saw and learned .
From the very beginning , a line we used on the kitchen show invitation says , " If you love to cook or hate to cook , we have something for you . "
It intrigued people whether they love or hate to cook .
The reality is that they do cook .
" I was taking simple ideas .
That 's always been our focus .
We have never aimed at haute cuisine .
We like things very basic .
They have to be simple and fast and produce dramatic results .
When people see that they can produce the same results and accomplish it with the tools we offer , that becomes a winning combination .
" The interesting thing about the business was that it was so exciting from the very beginning that I had to struggle to keep it in its place .
The investment of my time in the business paid off in emotional rewards immediately .
But we were not a financial success overnight because the business had no cash .
I started off with $ 3,000 borrowed on a life insurance policy and the business has never had another cash infusion .
In the beginning , I identified 25 to 30 products that I could not live without in my kitchen and looked for the exact same product or comparable ( or better quality ) product that I could demonstrate and sell .
Naturally , as I looked around I found other products that were intriguing and useful .
They became incorporated into the line . "
When Doris went shopping for an inventory , she headed for Chicago 's Merchandise Mart , which at the time was a major hub of wholesale showrooms for all types of products .
For her , it was a " needle - in - a - haystack " experience over the course of six trips from her suburban home as she went through myriad showrooms in search of the right kitchen tools , always mindful that her total budget was only $ 3,000 , including what it cost to print calling cards and stationery .
Whenever she found what she wanted , she was concerned that the wholesaler would not take her seriously and dismiss her as a suburban housewife trying to buy wholesale for her own kitchen .
But she persevered , helped by briefings from a friend who worked in the Mart and introduced her to the basics of wholesale buying : minimum quantity , lowest opening order ( usually $ 100 at that time ) .
She had to order by the dozen and pay cash , because she had no line of credit .
" I was surprised every time they took an order because I thought they'd think I was just someone wanting the stuff at half price .
But the one thing that was clear in every transaction was that as long as I paid cash up front they were ready to sell .
I was so eager and naïve that if they asked about what I was doing , I laid it all out .
I was happy to have them listen .
These wholesalers and distributors who were accustomed to dealing with large orders with much bigger numbers found what I wanted to do quite amusing .
Very quickly , though , after about three orders , they were willing to extend a very small amount of credit .
One salesman for a supplier I was using once called on me at home .
Years later , he recalled to me his initial reaction : ' I kept asking myself , ' Why am I wasting my time her ? '
' What really catapulted me into action was that as I started building inventory , I had to go out and sell some of it in order to have any money to buy more .
What I did was re-order as I made sales .
Jay and I would spend Sunday nights in the basement , checking the inventory and often we'd re-order on a weekly basis .
In the first months , I demonstrated , sold and delivered .
We had to bag all the orders and the entire family would make all the deliveries on Saturday .
Jay would take off in one direction with his car and I would take off in the other with my car .
I was happy doing it , but it became a bit much .
Jay said to me .
' We really have to ship UPS . '
I remember thinking that we could no longer use the wonderful little bags we were using to pack things .
They were charming and everyone loved them .
But we had to make the decision to ship UPS .
Obviously our little delivery system was both taxing and inefficient .
That decision was a major turning point and put us on the road where we are now - shipping millions of kitchen products . "
In the spring after her October debut , Doris really went into business , though still on a very modest basis .
She always knew that a one - woman enterprise can only go so far , that she needed the multiplier effect of other people demonstrating and selling , but was just as happy the way things were going .
It took a May 1981 encounter with an enthusiastic listener to move awareness toward action .
The woman asked a simple but challenging question , ' Would you like somebody else to do this with you ?
I think I might be interested .'
" I told her that I 'd have to think about it .
I knew that eventually it would be wonderful to have other people join me in the business and that was what I needed .
But I did n't know whether I had enough margin in the business to pay her and I did n't know how the inventory was going to work .
When I was the only one doing the Kitchen Shows , I 'd check the inventory on my shelf and only take along items for demonstration that I could supply .
I knew I would have to work on how I handled inventory when other people were involved in the demonstrations and sales .
When I got home , after I thought it through there was no doubt in my mind .
The next day I phoned her and said , ' Let 's talk and figure things out . '
She was the first kitchen consultant to join me in the business .
By the end of 1981 , I had 12 , all of them recruited at demonstrations . "
Doris was on her way .
She established a commission arrangement that was based on two things : what she learned about other companies ' practices and what she thought was fair for the work done .
It was a process of trial and error .
In the first year , she fine - tuned the commission rate two or three times .
About five years into the business , she established the commission arrangement that remains the same today .
It varies according to sales and , subsequently , according to the number of consultants someone recruits .
When people start with the company , they earn a 20 percent commission on sales .
The rate goes to 22 percent after passing $ 15,000 in career sales and goes higher as an individual rises in management ranks .
At first , Doris held monthly sales meetings in her home where she provided training in how to make effective presentations , demonstrated recipes , talked about the products the company was selling , and introduced new ones .
Everyone joined in by exchanging experiences , asking questions , and sharing information .
She even launched the company 's first sales contest for the top performer .
A microwave oven was the prize .
She was operating out of common sense and instinct and , then , like many another entrepreneur who expanded , she turned to a trade association to find out how the pros did things .
" I could see that the group was motivated by recognition of their achievements .
I was operating out of sheer instinct .
I did n't know much about direct selling and , in fact , would n't even have called it direct selling .
We called what we did kitchen shows , although technically they are home parties .
At that time , I really was n't following closely what other companies did .
Later , in 1986 , I joined the Direct Selling Association ( DSA ) , which is the nation 's premier direct selling trade association .
At that point , I started getting lessons at the hands of the masters .
It gave me ideas on which to reflect so I could determine how we could tailor programs that would work for us and our particular company culture .
I certainly have learned a lot from DSA and have used what I 've learned as standards for what we do . "
Meanwhile , back in the basement of the Christopher home , wife and husband were staying on top of what - in retrospect - was a just - in - time inventory with a homemade system .
A handwritten list itemized such kitchen tools as cake tester ( 144 in stock ) ; 10 - inch whisk , French scraper , oil slick , and spreader ( 72 of each ) : spatter shield ( 48 ) ; thermometer , tea infuser , gravy strainer ( 12 of each ) .
The company 's inventory , which once piled up in the Christopher 's basement , now fills over 660,000 square feet of warehouse space .
Outgoing products require 9 UPS trucks on an average day ( 18 on peak days ) as more than 3,000 orders a day ( 8,000 o peak days ) are sent to customers .
More than 100 " pickers " fill boxes with individual orders taken by the company 's kitchen consultants .
As the company developed , a number of factors powered its success , starting with Doris Christopher 's expertise and experience .
After earning a home economics degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana / Champaign , she taught high school home economics and then worked for the University of Illinois Cooperative Extension Service .
As a home economist , she knows what a kitchen needs .
As a good cook herself , she knows what it takes to make a good meal .
When back - to - career time came , Doris identified her imperatives as a combination of ambition and responsibilities - both family and social .
Down the road , this shaped company 's culture and also served the company 's business goals .
As an entrepreneur , she needed to offer quality products that appeal to women like her and her friends .
Someone in it just for the money would be tempted to cut corners , but that would violate Doris 's self - image and her professional commitment .
Without ambition , she would n't have worked so hard , once the business got rolling .
" Since I wanted to help provide what we wanted for our family , the ambition part was very clear , but I did n't want to do something just to bring in some income .
I wanted to use my talents to do something with a purpose .
I was not interested in biding my time in a job .
So both ambition and a sense of responsibility were there .
One of the key elements in success is having a passion for what you do .
My love of my work fuels the resilience to overcome obstacles , supports my dedication to remain true to my original vision and maintains my determination to succeed .
" I began the Pampered Chef as a flexible job opportunity that balanced my love of cooking with a strong will to keep my family as a top priority .
In the beginning , I was able to set my own hours and remain completely in control of how much time I spent on the business each day .
As the business began to grow beyond my expectations , I struggled with the multitude of demands placed on my time .
I believe this is true of everyone who juggles a variety of priorities .
" I work with a lot of women and the thing I see in women is a real sense of nurturing .
I know that 's what I 've done with this business .
I 've nurtured it .
I 'm very emotionally attached to this business in a way I do n't think many men would be attached to a business .
In the beginning , I was a pretty unsophisticated business person .
I did n't use business jargon .
I did n't know the latest management terms on how to run a business .
But at the same time , I realized that it would be very bad for the company if I did n't pay attention to the business indicators . "
Doris cities the role of her husband , Jay Christopher , as a significant factor in the company 's early growth .
Together , husband and wife complemented each other in mentality and in know - how .
Jay provided much - needed marketing and management expertise .
When the company 's growth became explosive , he came on board as vice president of operations in 1987 to supervise product ordering , warehouse , and distribution while Doris focused on working with the growing number of kitchen consultants , which by the end of 1989 had reached 700 .
Doris recalls how they tried to " do it all " in the company 's early years .
In hindsight , she is convinced that they should have ' brought additional management and expertise to the company earlier . '
" My husband and I have an interesting partnership .
We are very very different .
In the first years of the business , I deferred to his advice .
Jay is much more of an entrepreneur than I am .
I 'm a nurturer .
All along the way , he has been a major part of this business with his energy , drive and encouragement .
Many times , he has pushed me when I needed a nudge .
He has always been very involved in providing financial advice and has been particularly important in long - range planning .
He brings to The Pampered Chef extensive business experience that has been gathered from 30 years in marketing and operation positions .
He currently serves as the executive vice president of corporate development and in this role acts as a mentor and consultant for the company .
Meanwhile , he operates his own business consulting firm . "
The Pampered Chef personifies Doris 's commitment to the family and her view of dining together as a pillar of family life , with the kitchen as its foundation .
While her two daughters were in grammar school , she managed to blend career and family at a time when she was heavily involved in building the business .
She worked in her office ( at home ) , doing paperwork , picking out new products and talking to her kitchen consultants .
When the girls came home from school , Doris stopped working and switched over to " our time " when her daughters changed their clothes , ate a snack , and joined her in the kitchen to talk about their day and help as Doris started preparing dinner .
She remembers it as a " chance to share some time in a relaxed way as we put the evening meal together . "
Even though Doris spent many evenings presenting kitchen shows , the family had at lease one all - hands - on - deck dinner during the week and always on the weekend in keeping with her bedrock belief .
" When families share a meal , the bonds that hold the family together grow stronger . "
She always regarded food as a source of extra nourishment : " Food provides a basis for excellent family communication and interaction .
If the activity in the kitchen does n't draw the family in , the food certainly will .
Our mission encourages family values . "
As the company grew , Doris was transformed from a shopper whom wholesalers indulged to a force in the kitchenware industry all the way back to the design stage .
She and her design team keep looking for ways to improve what 's out there and to develop products that are exclusive to the company .
Innovation is part of her entrepreneuring and key to staying competitive .
She came out with the Super Scraper series , whose ingenious design is widely imitated : a spatula head that wo n't fall off during mixing : silicone construction , rather than rubber , to avoid disintegration and staining : heat - safe to 450 degrees .
The result is a scraper that can be used both for mixing batter and cooking in pans over the stove .
Her Easy Accent Decorator , which is used for frosting cakes , filling donuts , and creating hors d'oeuvres , has a larger barrel than other decorators on the market , Its one - piece inner construction stands up to stiff frosting , and its soft , comfortable grip allows for one - handed use .
She cites these as examples of " making things better rather than cheaper " and of still offering her products at competitive prices .
" Product ideas come to us in a number of ways .
A major source of ideas is our customers and kitchen consultants .
They 'll say that they need something or want something or ask us why we do n't have a particular product .
We are constantly checking with our sales people , our hostesses and our customers about what they want .
We 're always looking for the best product we can offer .
Manufacturers will come to us with an idea for a product and ask what we think of it .
Based on our research with our customers and our hostesses , we 'll say that we will take it or we might ask them to change it to fit our requirements .
We 're keyed to the functional , durable , easier to use , to have more features .
There certainly are times when we 've been less successful than expected with products we offer , but usually our gut instinct is pretty good in identifying a winner . "
The Pampered Chef experienced continuous growth by sticking close to Doris 's undiluted mission of " providing absolutely excellent products that create meals that bring the family together around the table . "
By her own recollection , there was n't time to reflect on what was happening : " We just had time to do what had to be done . "
Revenues kept increasing : $ 10,00 in her first three months , $ 50,000 in the first full year , $ 200,000 in the third year , than revenues in the millions with sales increasing 400 percent between 1989 and 1993 .
The growth was fueled by the soaring numbers of kitchen consultants from hundreds to thousands thanks in part to nationwide publicity .
In 1990 , The Pampered Chef was featured in an article published by Woman 's Day that provided nationwide exposure .
The publicity enhanced the company 's image , won attention , and attracted both consultants and customers to the products and the business opportunities offered by the company .

Ok , so we 're not exactly certain how Apple will incorporate this feat into their next batch of " I'm a Mac , and I 'm a PC " ads , but running an internet connected iMac off a steam engine is impressive , for lack of better words .
Two Brits struggling for an artistic concept to connect the " industrial revolution to the digital revolution " somehow settled on this contraption , and have garnered a good bit of attention .
The demand for the spectacle has become so large that the creators , Jeremy Deller and Alan Kane , are touring through Kent and Margate over the next month to show off their machine ; it can also be seen at the Turner Contemporary .
Be sure to stop by if you can , because who knows when you 'll next get to see a steam engine facilitate Engadget access .

Designing for the Web
In : Columns > Design in Theory and Practice
By Joshua David McClurg - Genevese
In the last two articles , we looked at the basic tenets of the design practice , the principles and elements of design .
We stepped back a bit from any one medium to investigate the more universal concepts of design in general , and how these axioms are often derivative of other art forms .
We tried to establish a solid foundation of design terms and techniques that were independent of any one implementation .
Now it is time to turn our attention to the Web .
Within any given medium there are unique constraints that can affect the way designers make use of the principles and elements of design .
These constraints can be based on a variety of different things including materials , technology , processes and standards in the industry .
The Web is no different .
Designing for a Web - based environment enacts a set of unique issues that need to be considered before implementation can be successful .
In my opinion , the vast majority of constraints in a Web - based environment are brought about because of the limits of human interaction with technology .
The Web , by its very nature , is a virtual medium accessible only via peripheral devices ( computers , monitors , mice , etc. ) .
We are constrained by what technology allows us to do , and are confined by the rules of these systems .
One of the most interesting ( and frustrating ) aspects of the Web is that it is such a new environment that the rules are constantly changing .
Designers need to adapt as necessary .
This article is dedicated to some of the wonderful characteristics that make the Web , well , the Web .
Specifically , we will be looking at the topics of :
Resolution
Designing for browsers
Web - safe color
Graphics compression
Text
Resolution
“ Resolution ” is used in a variety of ways to mean a variety of different things .
For clarification purposes , I thought we would start by establishing some definitions that we can make use of from here on out .
First , when talking about resolution we are usually referring to either screen resolution or image resolution .
Screen Resolution
Screen resolution is a bit of a misnomer , in my opinion .
Almost all computer screens display at the equivalent of 72 - 96 ppi ( pixels per inch ) .
But what most people are talking about ( at least in my experience ) when they refer to screen resolution is actually screen size , or the number of pixels that are displayed on the screen at any one time .
Screen size accurately reflects the amount of space that users have on their screens , and consequently how much information they can have displayed at one time .
Screen Resolution 2005 2004 Larger 11 % 10 % 1024 × 768 56 % 50 % 800 × 600 28 % 35 % Smaller / Unknown 5 % 5 %
According to the most recent statistics I can find , the dominant screen sizes on the Web today are 800 × 600 and 1024 × 768 .
The below statistics seem to reflect the general trend we are seeing on the Web , though I think the 800 × 600 percentages are a bit low .
Either way , these are the two sizes that most people on the Web are using , and are the dimensions that affect designers the most .
There are a number of things to consider when choosing a target screen size for a site design .
But as we will see a little later , these are not the only numbers that need to be considered when designing for the Web .
Image Resolution
The image resolution is the overall size and integrity of an image , both on - screen and off .
It is usually defined in pixel dimensions and spatial resolution , which work together to create the overall resolution of an image .
Pixel dimensions
The pixel dimensions of an image are the number of pixels that make up the image .
Dimensions can be related in width and height or megapixels .
A megapixel is one million pixels and can be understood as ( width × height / 1,000,000 ) .
Spatial resolution Spatial resolution is image resolution as defined by a number of pixels per inch .
Common spatial resolutions include 72 ppi ( screen resolution ) to 300 ppi ( print resolution ) .
With some simple math , we can see how pixel dimensions and spatial resolution affect each other .
The numbers below represent the approximate correlation between the numbers .
Width × Height Megapixels 72 ppi 230 ppi 300 ppi 1735 × 1157 2MP 24 ” × 16 ” 7.5 ” × 5 ” 5.8 ” × 3.9 ” 2450 × 1633 4MP 34 ” × 22.7 ” 10.6 ” × 7.1 ” 8.2 ” × 5.4 ” 3000 × 2000 6 MP 41.5 ” × 27.8 ” 13 ” × 8.7 ” 10 ” × 6.7 ”
Designing for Browsers
The browser is the interface people use to interact with information on the Web .
It provides a framework to display information and navigational tools for interaction at various levels .
When we design for the Web , we do so for display within a browser .
Because there are many different browsers available , knowing which ones to support is often a difficult choice .
There are subtle ( and sometimes not - so - subtle ) differences in the way a design displays based on how the browser interprets the code written to lay out the design .
Adjusting the code , or using standards such as Cascading Style Sheets ( CSS ) to lay out the design , often fixes many of the discrepancies .
The dominant browser on the Web today is Internet Explorer , with Firefox , Opera , Mozilla and others far behind .
In general , it is considered the good practice to test any design with as many different browsers ( versions and platforms ) as possible .
This will give a more accurate picture of how well the design looks and functions , and will help to support the largest variety of users .
Current Browser Trends
Browser 2005 ( July ) 2004 ( December ) IE 6 67.90 % 65.50 % IE 5 5.90 % 9.90 % Firefox 19.80 % n/a Opera 1.20 % 1.80 % Mozilla 2.60 % 17 % Netscape 0.50 % 1.60 %
Browser Real Estate
As we saw above , a user ’s screen size determines how much information can be displayed at one time .
However , when designing for the Web we cannot use those “ raw ” numbers to determine how large a design should be .
We have to consider the space taken up by the browser itself , and subtract that from the overall screen size to get a more accurate picture .
So , how much space does a browser take up ?
It depends on the browser and its default settings .
The best way to approximate this is to set a monitor at the appropriate screen size , expand the browser , and take a screen grab .
You can then get an idea of how much space is actually available for displaying information .
However , because of the differences in the user ’s browsing habits , it is difficult to come up with definitive numbers concerning the best size to work at .
People may not have their browsers fully expanded , and they may have many or few toolbars open at any time .
This technique provides an approximation of the size to be working at for a fixed - width design .
The below numbers show the approximate “ real estate ” available for the two dominant screen sizes and the current versions of the most popular browsers .
These numbers assume a default installation ( at least the file menu , standard buttons , address bar , favorites bar , status bar , and scroll bar ) .
Approximate browser real estate
Screen size IE 6 Firefox Opera Mozilla Netscape 800 × 600 779 × 400 781 × 434 777 × 427 779 × 420 781 × 389 1024 × 768 1003 × 568 1005 × 602 1001 × 595 1003 × 588 1005 × 557
Percentage - Based Design
Another way to handle the many browser variations is to make the design stretch by basing the overall layout on a percentage of screen real estate .
This allows a design to conform to the available space , regardless of browser or screen size .
Because of the variable nature of the layout , it is important to plan out where and how certain sections are going to stretch .
It ’s easy for content to wrap in unexpected ways .
This Web site , www.digital-web.com, demonstrates percentage - based design .
Simply change the size of the browser to see how the content stretches to conform to it .
Notice how the left and top navigation remain fixed while the content area stretches .
I often get asked what size I design at and whether or not I use fixed - width or percentage - based designs , and why .
The best answer I can give is that it depends on the situation .
I use both fixed - width and percentage - based designs , and determine which to use based on user research , intended audience and client expectations .
If I use a fixed - width design I tend towards an 800 × 600 screen size , usually around a 762 × 400 design size .
If I use a percentage - based design I will design in stretch points so that the information looks good at both of the dominant screen sizes .
Web - Safe Color
As we learned in the last article , electronic color is represented by an additive color space .
It is a space in which color is defined by differing amounts of light added together .
One aspect of additive color that directly constrains the designer is the notion of Web - safe color .
Web - safe color , basically , is the set of colors that will render consistently in browsers on the two major computer operating systems ( Windows and OS X ) .
A true cross-platform Web - safe color palette is 216 colors .
Web - Safe Color Palette
Web - safe color hearkens back to the early days of the operating system , when video memory was in short supply and the total number of colors that could be rendered at any one time was 256 .
Of these , only 216 were standardized and the rest were defined by the system palettes of the individual operating systems .
Death of the Websafe Color Palette ? is an interesting ( if slightly dated ) article on the origins of the Web - safe palette ( and its relevance today ) .
The basic idea is that various distortions in color can occur — both in the browser itself and within compressed images — when you go outside the Web - safe color palette ( Also see the Web - Safe Color Palette Discussion ) .
A good reference for Web - safe color is VisiBone ’s Color Lab .
Graphics Compression
The graphics compression is used to optimize images for the Web , to make sure they are of the appropriate colors , size , and format to be rendered by the browser .
Compressing graphics for the Web can be complicated , and it is often difficult to know which compression to use when .
There are three options :
GIF ( Graphics Interchange Format )
The GIF is best used for bitmap images , line art , or images with large areas of solid colors .
Color depth from 1 - bit ( 2 colors ) to 8 - bit ( 256 colors )
Supports transparency
Supports limited animation
File sizes are typically 20% - 90 % of the original size
Sample 8 - bit GIF file ( 2.5KB )
JPEG ( Joint Photographic Experts Group )
The JPEG format is best used with more complex photo - realistic images and color patterns .
Color depth of either 8 - bit ( 256 colors ) or 24 - bit ( 16,777,216 colors )
Allows for quality control set in percentage
Typically file sizes are 5 % - 20 % of the original size
Sample JPEG file compressed at 50 % ( 12.4KB )
PNG ( Portable Network Graphics )
The PNG format was developed as a successor to the GIF and was intended to replace it .
However , its adoption has been slow and all its features are not supported by all browsers .
Color depth of either 8 - bit ( 256 colors ) or 24 - bit ( 16,777,216 colors )
Support for alpha channels with variable transparency
Support for cross-platform gamma correction
Support for interlacing
Typically compresses images 5 % – 25 % better than GIF
Sample 8 - bit PNG file ( 2.1KB )
Text
Just as there are Web - safe colors , there are Web - safe fonts .
For a specified font to appear correctly in a browser , it must be available on the user ’s computer .
To help with this , there are predefined families ( combinations ) of fonts that relate to the system fonts found on all computers .
The use of these pre-defined families ensures that information will be displayed in a consistent and predictable fashion .
The browser will use the first available font in the specified combination , and will display the browser ’s default font if none of the specified fonts are available ( usually Times , Times New Roman , or Courier ) .
The following is a list of the most common font combinations .
Arial , Helvetica , sans- serif
Times New Roman , Times , serif
Courier New , Courier , mono
Georgia , Times New Roman , Times , serif
Verdana , Arial , Helvetica , sans - serif
Geneva , Arial , Helvetica , sans - serif

Accessibility
Accessibility refers to support for technologies and devices that are used to improve the experience of those with impairments ( physical , visual , auditory ) or other difficulties in accessing information on the Web .
It supports the general belief that information online should be available to everyone .
It is a topic of great importance and one that needs to be considered in every design project .
The W3C has a program called the Web Accessibility Initiative ( WAI ) that sets the international standards for Web accessibility .
The WAI has set priorities and checkpoints to ensure that a site meets the necessary standards , including :
Providing text equivalents for non-text elements in the form of an alt or longdesc tag
or tag Ensuring that information conveyed with color can also be read without color , or is available without color
Clearly identifying row and column headers within a table structure for easier navigation
Usability
Usability is the study of the effectiveness of a particular Web site in satisfying the goals of users and ensuring that the site works well and facilitates interactions desired by the intended audience .
It is a cross - disciplinary area of research that includes the fields of human - computer interaction , human factors , engineering , design and many others .
In recent years , usability has become a benchmark concept , relating directly to the overall success of many sites .
It is a topic that is far too complex to cover in one sitting , but there are many resources available online for those wishing to pursue the subject in more detail .
Audience
As Web designers , everything we do is for the user .
From aesthetic and interaction design to architecture development to quality assurance , we want to provide the intended audience with a means to be more informed , efficient and effective .
At the same time , knowing who your intended audience is can have many ( and sometimes drastic ) implications on design .
A few last things to think about :
Perform user research .
Find out who the intended audience really is — do not just assume you know .
This can take the form of surveys , interviews , focus groups , field studies , usability testing , etc .
The important thing is to do it , and not let it get so complicated that you hesitate .
Use an iterative design approach .
Test early in the design phase ( I often test with nothing more than hand - drawn sketches on paper ) , and test often with users of the intended audience .
Harmonize interactions .
Be sure the intentions of the users match the options available to them while interacting with the site .
Interaction design and visual design go hand - in - hand , and both can provide insight into how successful the site is in meeting the user ’s expectations .
Modify as necessary .
Everything discussed above should be understood as a general approach to some of the concepts unique to the Web , and contextual situations may change how you make use of them .
Conclusion
In this article , we looked at some of the constraints unique to the medium of the Web .
These constraints affect how we are able to make use of more fundamental concepts , such as the principles and elements of design , but also guide us in ensuring a more successful user experience .
In the next article , we are going to tie it all together , reviewing the concepts of the previous articles and seeing how these many ideas are put into practice on the Web .
We will use Web sites submitted by the readers of this column to offer some real - world examples of everything covered this far .

Disclosure of the bomb plot coincided with the one - year anniversary of a terrorist bomb attack on London subways and a bus that killed 52 and injured about 700 .
Authorities said they had n't intended to release details about the plot this early and that whoever leaked the information had compromised the FBI 's relationship with some foreign intelligence services .
The person who leaked the details is clearly someone who does n't understand the fragility of international relations , '' Mershon said .
" We 've had a number of uncomfortable questions and some upsetment ( sic ) with these foreign intelligence services that had been working with us on a daily basis . ''
UPDATE
John Amato astutely asks an excellent question : why are all of the Bush supporters celebrating the unauthorized leak to the Daily News of the FBI 's arrests of alleged terrorists who were talking in Internet chat rooms about blowing up the Holland Tunnel ( later news reports indicated that the plot was really aimed at the PATH commuter train ) ?
follower after the next who has been furiously protesting the publication of leaks by the NYT and other newspapers -- almost all of whom has accused the NYT of treason , of providing aid and comfort to their Al Qaeda friends , etc. for reporting leaked classified information -- have about this leaked story .
But all of them are ecstatic over this story , celebrating it as a great and heroic blow for the Bush administration and as proof that The Terrorists really are the Epic Threat they 've been claiming .
And almost none of them are protesting the unauthorized leak , let alone calling for the reporters and editors at the Daily News to be sent to gas chambers or put in federal prison for the rest of their lives .
Their celebratory reaction to this leak is particularly noteworthy given that the Daily News article itself acknowledged that its source told it that the leaked law enforcement investigation " is an ongoing operation . "
And the FBI claims that this leak has jeopardized foreign intelligence sources :
It is not , of course , merely the leaker who " compromised the FBI 's relationship with some foreign intelligence services , " but also the Daily News for publishing the story .
And yet those who claim to be so offended by leaks from the NYT , along with USA Today and The Washington Post , are n't decrying this leak at all .
Instead , they are celebrating it .
The only discernible difference between the leaks of the NYT and this leak is that the NYT leaks ( as well as those of USA Today and The Washington Post ) resulted in political embarrassment for the President .
Those leaks resulted in reports that the President was breaking the law when eavesdropping on American citizens , or creating secret , lawless gulags in Eastern Europe , or compiling massive data bases of all domestic calls placed and received by Americans with no oversight or Congressional authorization .
None of those leaked stories depicted the President as a Hero or glorified the administration .
They were thus attacked as treasonous by the President 's followers .
But this leak to the Daily News glorifies the administration and depicts them as caped crusaders protecting us from evil terrorism .
And thus , the President 's followers love this leak and their rage towards journalists who publish classified information -- along with their demands that they be imprisoned , or worse -- sure do seem to have evaporated into thin air .
This is not the first time this has happened .
There have been plenty of leaks of classified information in the past which reflect well on the administration -- which depict them as our heroic protectors -- and which therefore provoke no protest at all from Bush followers .
It is only the leaks which result in political embarrassment for the President that provoke their ire .
Their accusations of treason against American journalists and their demands that they be prosecuted and imprisoned have nothing to do with concerns over national security and everything to do with punishing anyone and anything which harms the administration 's political interests .
What other proof is required to demonstrate what is really motivating these extremely selective attacks on leaks ?
Unlike the other leaks ( the bad ones which ended up in the treasonous NYT and Washington Post ) which resulted in no demonstrable security damage of any kind , this leak to the Daily News at least preliminarily seems to have harmed national security .
Yet it also results in potential political benefits for Republicans ( and any doubt about tjat will be quickly dispelled by reading the posts linked to above , where this leaked story is immediately exploited to claim that Republicans are right and Democrats wrong about all national security and terrorism matters ) .
Given the political benefits which Bush supporters believe come from this leak , the leak is celebrated -- and exploited -- rather than condemnend by those who relentlessly claim to detest leaks not for any partisan reason but only out of solemn devotion to the security of the United States .
One last point :
Anyone arguing that this story is somehow proof that the President was right to engage in illegal eavesdropping or oversight - less monitoring of domestic calls and banking transactions -- and virtually all Bush followers are making that very point -- is indulging rank illogic .
The President is fully empowered to eavesdrop on the conversations of terrorists or monitor their banking transactions while complying with the law and with oversight , and nobody argues that he should not be allowed to do that .
Thus , anyone arguing that this story illustrates the need for surveillance is fighting a strawman , since nobody is against surveillance .
Nobody is complaining that the President is eavesdropping or monitoring terrorists , only that he refusing to abide by the law and submit to oversight when doing so .
Is n't that point well - established enough by now that people ought to be embarrassed to pretend not to know it , and instead to act on the blatantly false premise that Bush critics are opposed to surveillance itself ? :
The blogger Catnip chronicles more reaction by Bush supporters to this leak , reactions which are conspicuously free of venom towards the Daily News , but which take the opportunity to claim that this constitutes further proof that the ultimate evil lies in the New York Times .
I 'm sure most of you are familiar with this famous Microsoft group photo from December 1978 :
Groovy .
In case you were wondering , the photo is authentic .
It 's even featured on the official Microsoft Bill Gates biography page .
Of course we recognize Bill Gates in that famous photo , but I was curious about the other people in the photo .
What happened to them ?
When did they leave Microsoft , and why ?
What are they doing now ?
Update : Nearly 30 years later , Microsoft reshot this classic photo .
A coworker provided a link to this 2000 Time article that did most of the research for us ; there 's also a page on the Museum of Hoaxes that adds a bit more information on the people in the photo .

As networks continue to market video on its Web sites to high - bandwith users , computer screens are becoming a home away from home for TV viewers .
Enter CNN , who announced Sunday that it will offer paid subscribers access to its premium streaming video service .
Called CNN
Pipeline , the service provides users with on - demand video streams from the network 's major news outlets as well as in - depth features , CNN.com and wire stories , and a search feature .
" We thought we needed to take something to the next level , " said CNN Networks chairman Jim Walton , who gave an onscreen tour of CNN Pipeline during the Television Critics Assn .'s summer press tour at the Beverly Hilton .
" What I 'm about to show you right now is PlayStation or Nintendo or GameCube , " Walton said .
The four live streams of video content will be available 24/7 ; what ones to show will be chosen by CNN . com 's editors .
He said that it will be live but it wo n't be raw .
There will still be an editorial process , and CNN.com will turn away from anything that does n't fit standards .
The network , a pioneer in the news industry , recently lifted the for - pay video restriction on its
Web site , which is one of the top sites visited on the Web .
The move to broadband likely marks a shift in target demographics , as the coveted 18 - to - 24 age group has shown an increasing reliance on the Web rather than television for news and information .
Walton noted that " the growing broadband buzz " was the major reason for the network 's move to launch the video service , and with advertisers eager to market to a younger demographic , it would be within CNN 's best interest to attract viewers outside of its cable market .
Currently , advertisements from GM , Chase , Xerox , UPS , and Verizonall companies aggressively marketing themselves to Generation Yprecede the free video clips available on the CNN Web site .
Although rival CBS
News announced last week that it would be retooling its
Web site as a 24 - hour news service , CNN says that it did not take any cues from the CBS project , noting that " the projects were on parallel and separate tracks . "
Another competitor , ABC News , also offers subscription access to its nightly news and magazine shows .
CNN Pipeline will be available this fall for an as - yet - unannounced monthly charge .
Windows users will be able to install the CNN - developed player , but Macintosh users will have to content themselves in the meantime with a Web - based client .
Holographic Universe - Simulation Theory
Reality as a simulation or hologram is no longer a fringe theory - with Nobel Prize winners and other thought leaders believing in it .
All scientific discoveries start out as theories ; some ultimately proven , some not .
There is still the question of whether our universe actually exists ?
We may be simply living in something 's virtual reality simulation ; very hard to prove one way or the other but we are getting closer .
The theory that reality , as we consciously experience it , is not real , goes back to the indigenous people who believed that we exist in a dream or illusion .
In our current timeline , we refer to the our virtual reality experience as a matrix , grids , simulation and hologram .
There are those trying to prove the simulation exists and others who are trying to break us out of it .
Time is an illusion , therefore so is everything else .
The universe is a consciousness hologram or simulation .
Reality is projected illusion within .
It is a virtual experiment created in linear time to study emotions .
Our simulation is composed of grids created by a source consciousness brought into awareness by electromagnetic energy at the physical level .
The hologram is created and linked through a web , or grid matrixes .
The hologram had a beginning ergo it has an end , as consciousness evolves in the alchemy of time .
As the grids collapse , everything within the hologram will end as it Fades to Black .
In media we find films , television shows , books , and games , based on the concept of reality as a hologram / simulation Among the more easily recognized are The Matrix , The Thirteenth Floor , Inception ( Dream ) , the Holodeck ( Grids ) in the TV series Star Trek , among others .
An increased understanding of artificial intelligence will bring clarity to the concept of reality is a simulation as they are virtually connected .

The simulation hypothesis contends that reality is in fact a simulation ( most likely a computer simulation ) , of which we , the simulants , are totally unaware .
Some versions rely on the development of simulated reality , a fictional technology .
The hypothesis has been a central plot device of many science fiction stories and films .
There is a long philosophical and scientific history to the underlying thesis that reality is an illusion .
This skeptical hypothesis can be dated as far back as Indian philosophy of Maya illusion .

Simulated reality is the hypothesis that reality could be simulated - for example by computer simulation - to a degree indistinguishable from " true " reality .
It could contain conscious minds which may or may not be fully aware that they are living inside a simulation .
This is quite different from the current , technologically achievable concept of virtual reality .
Virtual reality is easily distinguished from the experience of actuality ; participants are never in doubt about the nature of what they experience .
Simulated reality , by contrast , would be hard or impossible to separate from " true " reality .
There has been much debate over this topic , ranging from philosophical discourse to practical applications in computing .

Stephen Hawking :
What happens inside black holes is like a Hologram Science Vibe - November 29 , 2015
Stephen Hawking presented a new idea at a press conference in Stockholm on August 25th , to try to explain what happens to everything that falls inside black holes .
The information that falls into a black hole has to be stored somewhere , or it would violate a law of quantum mechanics .
Hawking said information about what 's inside a black hole is projected on the edge of the black hole , also called the horizon , in a hologram .
He says his new solution applies to every black hole in the universe , and has resolved the longstanding paradox the physicists face .
Other top physicists have been reserved , saying that his idea is compelling but needs more evidence .
If you fell into a black hole , you 'd die .
In black holes , gravity is so extremely strong , not even light can escape them .
But scientists wondered if there would be any kind of remains , like ashes : could evidence that you had once existed come out of the black hole ?
In the 1970 's Hawking showed that black holes eventually run out of energy and die .
And when that happens , we assume that all the information stored inside must be lost .
But this would go against the laws of quantum mechanics : information can't be lost .

Black holes are not ruthless killers , but instead benign hologram generators
Science Daily - June 17 , 2015
New research in theoretical physics shows that black holes are n't the ruthless killers we 've made them out to be , but instead benign - if imperfect - hologram generators .
The world could have been captured by a black hole , and we would n't even notice , according to a new theoretical perspective .
Mathur and his team have been expanding on their fuzzball theory , too , and they 've come to a completely different conclusion .
They see black holes not as killers , but rather as benign copy machines of a sort .
They believe that when material touches the surface of a black hole , it becomes a hologram , a near - perfect copy of itself that continues to exist just as before .
Is the universe a hologram ?
Science Daily - April 27 , 2015
The ' holographic principle , ' the idea that a universe with gravity can be described by a quantum field theory in fewer dimensions , has been used for years as a mathematical tool in strange curved spaces .
New results suggest that the holographic principle also holds in flat spaces .
Our own universe could in fact be two dimensional and only appear three dimensional -- just like a hologram .
At first glance , there is not the slightest doubt : to us , the universe looks three dimensional .
But one of the most fruitful theories of theoretical physics in the last two decades is challenging this assumption .
The " holographic principle " asserts that a mathematical description of the universe actually requires one fewer dimension than it seems .
What we perceive as three dimensional may just be the image of two dimensional processes on a huge cosmic horizon .
Until now , this principle has only been studied in exotic spaces with negative curvature .
This is interesting from a theoretical point of view , but such spaces are quite different from the space in our own universe .
Results obtained by scientists at TU Wien ( Vienna ) now suggest that the holographic principle even holds in a flat spacetime .
We May Be Living in the Matrix , Says Engineer Epoch Times - October 31 , 2014
Our world is n't necessarily a computer program designed by parasitic futuristic robots like in the movie " The Matrix . "

Elvidge has worked with cutting - edge digital technology for decades .
He holds a masters degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University as well as multiple patents in digital signal processing , and he has published papers about remote sensing and other related topics in peer - reviewed journals .
Combining his knowledge of digital systems with quantum mechanics , Elvidge has found that we may be living in something like a computer program .
The matter , the " stuff " we seem to touch and feel , is actually mostly empty space .

Physicists Aim to Find Out NBC - August 27 , 2014
Physicists at Fermilab in Illinois have turned on a laser - based experiment that could reveal whether the three - dimensional world we perceive is merely a " Matrix " - style illusion generated by a cosmic two - dimensional hologram .
The Holometer experiment is the result of years of work by particle astrophysicist Craig Hogan and his colleagues at the federally funded Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory , and it could provide the first clear evidence for the existence of the holographic universe .
The concept has been debated for decades , but it 's devilishly difficult to show whether it can ever be anything more than a concept .
Hogan aims to find out whether the universe is a hologram by looking for telltale quantum jitters in the fabric of space - time itself .
" If we see something , it will completely change ideas about space we 've used for thousands of years .
If the world is a computer , life is an algorithm Science News - June 26 , 2014
Today a fair number of scientists regard nature as a computer .

Laws governing how the universe works are expressed in mathematical formulas .
You use those formulas to compute what nature will do , such as when the moon will position itself for the next solar eclipse .
Just as you do a digital computation to figure out where the moon will be , nature simply conducts a real - time analog computation of its own that puts the moon where it is supposed to be .
Simulations back up theory that Universe is a hologram
Nature - December 12 , 2013
A team of physicists has provided some of the clearest evidence yet that our Universe could be just one big projection .
In 1997 , theoretical physicist Juan Maldacena proposed1 that an audacious model of the Universe in which gravity arises from infinitesimally thin , vibrating strings could be reinterpreted in terms of well - established physics .
The mathematically intricate world of strings , which exist in nine dimensions of space plus one of time , would be merely a hologram : the real action would play out in a simpler , flatter cosmos where there is no gravity .
Maldacena 's idea thrilled physicists because it offered a way to put the popular but still unproven theory of strings on solid footing Ñ and because it solved apparent inconsistencies between quantum physics and Einstein 's theory of gravity .
It provided physicists with a mathematical Rosetta stone , a ' duality ' , that allowed them to translate back and forth between the two languages , and solve problems in one model that seemed intractable in the other and vice versa .
But although the validity of Maldacena 's ideas has pretty much been taken for granted ever since , a rigorous proof has been elusive .
New mathematical model links space - time theories PhysOrg - June 1 , 2013
Researchers at the University of Southampton have taken a significant step in a project to unravel the secrets of the structure of our Universe .
One of the main recent advances in theoretical physics is the holographic principle .
According to this idea , our Universe may be thought of as a hologram and we would like to understand how to formulate the laws of physics for such a holographic Universe .
Space - time is usually understood to describe space existing in three dimensions , with time playing the role of a fourth dimension and all four coming together to form a continuum , or a state in which the four elements can't be distinguished from each other .
Flat space - time and negative space - time describe an environment in which the Universe is non-compact , with space extending infinitely , forever in time , in any direction .
The gravitational forces , such as the ones produced by a star , are best described by flat - space time .
Negatively curved space - time describes a Universe filled with negative vacuum energy .
The mathematics of holography is best understood for negatively curved space - times .
According to holography , at a fundamental level the universe has one less dimension than we perceive in everyday life and is governed by laws similar to electromagnetism .
The idea is similar to that of ordinary holograms where a three - dimensional image is encoded in a two - dimensional surface , such as in the hologram on a credit card , but now it is the entire Universe that is encoded in such a fashion .
What if Reality Was Really Just Sim Universe ?
Live Science - December 14 , 2012
What if everything -- all of us , the world , the universe -- was not real ?
What if everything we are , know and do was really just someone 's computer simulation ?
The notion that our reality was some kid on a couch in the far future playing with a computer game like a gigantic Sim City , or Civilization , and we are his characters , is n't new .
But a group of physicists now think they know of a way to test the concept .
Three of them propose to test reality by simulating the simulators .
Do we live in a computer simulation ?
Researchers say idea can be tested PhysOrg - December 10 , 2012
The conical ( red ) surface shows the relationship between energy and momentum in special relativity , a fundamental theory concerning space and time developed by Albert Einstein , and is the expected result if our universe is not a simulation .
The flat ( blue ) surface illustrates the relationship between energy and momentum that would be expected if the universe is a simulation with an underlying cubic lattice .
A decade ago , a British philosopher put forth the notion that the universe we live in might in fact be a computer simulation run by our descendants .
While that seems far - fetched , perhaps even incomprehensible , a team of physicists at the University of Washington has come up with a potential test to see if the idea holds water .
Is it real ?
Physicists propose method to determine if the universe is a simulation PhysOrg - October 12 , 2012
A common theme of science fiction movies and books is the idea that we 're all living in a simulated universe - that nothing is actually real .
The team 's idea is based on work being done by other scientists who are actively engaged in trying to create simulations of our universe , at least as we understand it .
Thus far , such work has shown that to create a simulation of reality , there has to be a three dimensional framework to represent real world objects and processes .
With computerized simulations , it 's necessary to create a lattice to account for the distances between virtual objects and to simulate the progression of time .
The German team suggests such a lattice could be created based on quantum chromodynamics - theories that describe the nuclear forces that bind subatomic particles .
Physicists say there may be a way to prove that we live in a computer simulation io9.com - October 12 , 2012
Back in 2003 , Oxford professor Nick Bostrom suggested that we may be living in a computer simulation .
In his paper , Bostrom offered very little science to support his hypothesis - though he did calculate the computational requirements needed to pull of such a feat .
And indeed , a philosophical claim is one thing , actually proving it is quite another .
But now , a team of physicists say proof might be possible , and that it 's a matter of finding a cosmological signature that would serve as the proverbial Red Pill from the Matrix .
And they think they know what it is .
According to Silas Beane and his team at the University of Bonn in Germany , a simulation of the universe should still have constraints , no matter how powerful .
These limitations , they argue , would be observed by the people within the simulation as a kind of constraint on physical processes .
How Many Dimensions
In The Holographic Universe ?
Science Daily - February 9 , 2009
Viennese scientists are trying to understand the mysteries of the holographic principle :
How many dimensions are there in our universe ?
Some of the world 's brightest minds are carrying out research in this area -- and still have not succeeded so far in creating a unified theory of quantum gravitation is often considered to be the " Holy Grail of modern science .
Michael Talbot ( 1953 - 1992 ) , was the author of several books on holograms and quantum mechanics , and their relationship to ancient mysticism and the theoretical models of reality .
Talbot explored the works of physicist David Bohm and neurophysiologist Karl Pribram , who independently reached the conclusion that the universe operates on a holographic model .
In Talbot 's book , The Holographic Universe , Talbot also arrives at this conclusion and maintains that the holographic model might also explain numerous paranormal and unusual phenomena as well as offer a basis for mystical experiences .
In 1982 , at the University of Paris a research team led by physicist Alain Aspect performed what may turn out to be one of the most important experiments of the 20th century .
Aspect 's experiment was related to the EPR Experiment , a consciousness experiment which had been devised by Albert Einstein and his colleagues , Poldlsky and Rosen , in order to disprove Quantum Mechanics on the basis of the Pauli Exclusion Principle contradicting Special Relativity .
Aspect and his team discovered that under certain circumstances subatomic particles such as electrons are able to instantaneously communicate with each other regardless of the distance separating them .
It does n't matter whether they are 10 feet or 10 billion miles apart .
Somehow each particle always seemed to know what the other was doing .
This feat violates Einstein 's long - held tenet that no communication can travel faster than the speed of light which is tantamount to breaking the time barrier .
This daunting prospect has caused some physicists to try to come up with elaborate ways to explain away Aspect 's findings .
But it has inspired others to offer even more radical explanations .
University of London physicist David Bohm , for example , believes Aspect 's findings imply that objective reality does not exist , that despite its apparent solidity the universe is at heart a phantasm , a gigantic and splendidly detailed hologram .
To understand why Bohm makes this startling assertion , one must first understand a little about holograms .
A hologram is a three - dimensional photograph made with the aid of a laser .
To make a hologram , the object to be photographed is first bathed in the light of a laser beam .
Then a second laser beam is bounced off the reflected light of the first and the resulting interference pattern ( the area where the two laser beams commingle ) is captured on film .
When the film is developed , it looks like a meaningless swirl of light and dark lines .
But as soon as the developed film is illuminated by another laser beam , a three - dimensional image of the original object appears .
The three - dimensionality of such images is not the only remarkable characteristic of holograms .
If a hologram of a rose is cut in half and then illuminated by a laser , each half will still be found to contain the entire image of the rose .
Even if the halves are divided again , each snippet of film will always be found to contain a smaller but intact version of the original image .
Unlike normal photographs , every part of a hologram contains all the information possessed by the whole .
The " whole in every part " nature of a hologram provides us with an entirely new way of understanding organization and order .
For most of its history , Western science has labored under the bias that the best way to understand a physical phenomenon , whether a frog or an atom , is to dissect it and study its respective parts .
A hologram teaches us that some things in the universe may not lend themselves to this approach .
If we try to take apart something constructed holographically , we will not get the pieces of which it is made , we will only get smaller wholes .
This insight suggested to Bohm another way of understanding Aspect 's discovery .
Bohm believes the reason subatomic particles are able to remain in contact with one another regardless of the distance separating them is not because they are sending some sort of mysterious signal back and forth , but because their separateness is an illusion .
He argues that at some deeper level of reality such particles are not individual entities , but are actually extensions of the same fundamental something .
This fundamental connectedness would correlate with The Fifth Element , and its mathematical proof of all aspects of the universe being energetically connected - Hal Puthoff 's assertion in his work on Zero - Point Energy of all charges in the universe being connected and that further mass is in all likelihood an illusion as well -- and both of these modern day theories of physics being in accordance with ancient traditions and philosophies , which claim the same connectedness of the diverse parts of the universe .
To enable people to better visualize what he means , Bohm offers the following illustration .
Imagine an aquarium containing a fish .
Imagine also that you are unable to see the aquarium directly and your knowledge about it and what it contains comes from two television cameras , one directed at the aquarium 's front and the other directed at its side .
As you stare at the two television monitors , you might assume that the fish on each of the screens are separate entities .
After all , because the cameras are set at different angles , each of the images will be slightly different .
But as you continue to watch the two fish , you will eventually become aware that there is a certain relationship between them .
When one turns , the other also makes a slightly different but corresponding turn ; when one faces the front , the other always faces toward the side .
If you remain unaware of the full scope of the situation , you might even conclude that the fish must be instantaneously communicating with one another , but this is clearly not the case .
This , says Bohm , is precisely what is going on between the subatomic particles in Aspect 's experiment .
According to Bohm , the apparent faster - than - light connection between subatomic particles is really telling us that there is a deeper level of reality we are not privy to , a more complex dimension beyond our own that is analogous to the aquarium .
And , he adds , we view objects such as subatomic particles as separate from one another because we are seeing only a portion of their reality .
Such particles are not separate " parts " , but facets of a deeper and more underlying unity that is ultimately as holographic and indivisible as the previously mentioned rose .
And since everything in physical reality is comprised of these " eidolons " , the universe is itself a projection , a hologram .
In addition to its phantom - like nature , such a universe would possess other rather startling features .
If the apparent separateness of subatomic particles is illusory , it means that at a deeper level of reality all things in the universe are infinitely interconnected .
The electrons in a carbon atom in the human brain are connected to the subatomic particles that comprise every salmon that swims , every heart that beats , and every star that shimmers in the sky .
Everything interpenetrates everything , and although human nature may seek to categorize and pigeonhole and subdivide , the various phenomena of the universe , all apportionments are of necessity artificial and all of nature is ultimately a seamless web .
Superhologram
In a holographic universe , even time and space could no longer be viewed as fundamentals .
Because concepts such as location break down in a universe in which nothing is truly separate from anything else , time and three - dimensional space , like the images of the fish on the TV monitors , would also have to be viewed as projections of this deeper order .
At its deeper level reality is a sort of superhologram in which the past , present , and future all exist simultaneously .
This suggests that given the proper tools it might even be possible to someday reach into the superholographic level of reality and pluck out scenes from the long - forgotten past .
What else the superhologram contains is an open - ended question .
Allowing , for the sake of argument , that the superhologram is the matrix that has given birth to everything in our universe , at the very least it contains every subatomic particle that has been or will be -- every configuration of matter and energy that is possible , from snowflakes to quasars , from bluu whales to gamma rays .
It must be seen as a sort of cosmic storehouse of " All That Is . "
Although Bohm concedes that we have no way of knowing what else might lie hidden in the superhologram , he does venture to say that we have no reason to assume it does not contain more .
Or as he puts it , perhaps the superholographic level of reality is a " mere stage " beyond which lies " an infinity of further development " .
Karl Pribram
Bohm is not the only researcher who has found evidence that the universe is a hologram .
Working independently in the field of brain research , Standford neurophysiologist Karl Pribram has also become persuaded of the holographic nature of reality .
Pribram was drawn to the holographic model by the puzzle of how and where memories are stored in the brain .
For decades numerous studies have shown that rather than being confined to a specific location , memories are dispersed throughout the brain .
In the 1960s Pribram encountered the concept of holography and realized he had found the explanation brain scientists had been looking for .
Pribram believes memories are encoded not in neurons , or small groupings of neurons , but in patterns of nerve impulses that crisscross the entire brain in the same way that patterns of laser light interference crisscross the entire area of a piece of film containing a holographic image .
In other words , Pribram believes the brain is itself a hologram .
Pribram 's theory also explains how the human brain can store so many memories in so little space .
It has been estimated that the human brain has the capacity to memorize something on the order of 10 billion bits of information during the average human lifetime .
The brain is an electrochemical machine that stores information - binary code
One of the most amazing things about the human thinking process is that every piece of information seems instantly cross-correlated with every other piece of information - another feature intrinsic to the hologram .
Because every portion of a hologram is infinitely interconnected with ever other portion , it is perhaps nature 's supreme example of a cross-correlated system .
The storage of memory is not the only neurophysiological puzzle that becomes more tractable in light of Pribram 's holographic model of the brain .
Another is how the brain is able to translate the avalanche of frequencies it receives via the senses ( light frequencies , sound frequencies , and so on ) into the concrete world of our perceptions .
Encoding and decoding frequencies is precisely what a hologram does best .
Just as a hologram functions as a sort of lens , a translating device able to convert an apparently meaningless blur of frequencies into a coherent image , Pribram believes the brain also comprises a lens and uses holographic principles to mathematically convert the frequencies it receives through he senses into the inner world of our perceptions .
An impressive body of evidence suggests that the brain uses holographic principles to perform its operations .
Pribram 's theory , in fact , has gained increasing support among neurophysiologists .
Holophonics
Argentinian - Italian researcher Hugo Zucarelli recently extended the holographic model into the world of acoustic phenomena .
Puzzled by the fact that humans can locate the source of sounds without moving their heads , even if they only possess hearing in one ear , Zucarelli discovered that holographic principles can explain this ability .
Zucarelli has also developed the technology of holophonic sound , a recording technique able to reproduce acoustic situations with an almost uncanny realism .
Pribram 's belief that our brains mathematically construct " hard " reality by relying on input from a frequency domain has also received a good deal of experimental support .
It has been found that each of our senses is sensitive to a much broader range of frequencies than was previously suspected .
Researchers have discovered , for instance , that our visual systems are sensitive to sound frequencies , that our sense of smell is in part dependent on what are now called " cosmic frequencies " , and that even the cells in our bodies are sensitive to a broad range of frequencies .
Such findings suggest that it is only in the holographic domain of consciousness that such frequencies are sorted out and divided up into conventional perceptions .
But the most mind - boggling aspect of Pribram 's holographic model of the brain is what happens when it is put together with Bohm 's theory .
For if the concreteness of the world is but a secondary reality and what is " there " is actually a holographic blur of frequencies , and if the brain is also a hologram and only selects some of the frequencies out of this blur and mathematically transforms them into sensory perceptions , what becomes of objective reality ?
Put quite simply , it ceases to exist .
As the religions of the East have long upheld , the material world is Maya , an illusion , and although we may think we are physical beings moving through a physical world , this too is an illusion .
We are really " receivers " floating through a kaleidoscopic sea of frequency , and what we extract from this sea and transmogrify into physical reality is but one channel from many extracted out of the superhologram .
This striking new picture of reality , the synthesis of Bohm and Pribram 's views , has come to be called the Holographic Paradigm , and although many scientists have greeted it with skepticism , it has galvanized others .
A small but growing group of researchers believe it may be the most accurate model of reality science has arrived at thus far .
More than that , some believe it may solve some mysteries that have never before been explainable by science and even establish the paranormal as a part of nature .
Numerous researchers , including Bohm and Pribram , have noted that many para- psychological phenomena become much more understandable in terms of the holographic paradigm .
In a universe in which individual brains are actually indivisible portions of the greater hologram and everything is infinitely interconnected , telepathy may merely be the accessing of the holographic level .
It is obviously much easier to understand how information can travel from the mind of individual ' A ' to that of individual ' B ' at a far distance point and helps to understand a number of unsolved puzzles in psychology .
Stansilov Grof
In particular , Stansilov Grof feels the holographic paradigm offers a model for understanding many of the baffling phenomena experienced by individuals during altered states of consciousness .
In the 1950s , while conducting research into the beliefs of LSD as a psychotherapeutic tool , Grof had one female patient who suddenly became convinced she had assumed the identity of a female of a species of prehistoric reptile .
During the course of her hallucination , she not only gave a richly detailed description of what it felt like to be encapsulated in such a form , but noted that the portion of the male of the species anatomy was a patch of colored scales on the side of its head .
What was startling to Grof was that although the woman had no prior knowledge about such things , a conversation with a zoologist later confirmed that in certain species of reptiles colored areas on the head do indeed play an important role as triggers of sexual arousal .
The woman 's experience was not unique .
During the course of his research , Grof encountered examples of patients regressing and identifying with virtually every species on the evolutionary tree ( research findings which helped influence the man - into - ape scene in the movie , Altered States ) .
Moreover , he found that such experiences frequently contained obscure zoological details which turned out to be accurate .
Regressions into the animal kingdom were not the only puzzling psychological phenomena Grof encountered .
He also had patients who appeared to tap into some sort of collective or racial unconscious .
Individuals with little or no education suddenly gave detailed descriptions of Zoroastrian funerary practices and scenes from Hindu mythology .
In other categories of experience , individuals gave persuasive accounts of out - of - body journeys , of precognitive glimpses of the future , of regressions into apparent past - life incarnations .
In later research , Grof found the same range of phenomena manifested in therapy sessions which did not involve the use of drugs .
Because the common element in such experiences appeared to be the transcending of an individual 's consciousness beyond the usual boundaries of ego and / or limitations of space and time , Grof called such manifestations transpersonal experiences , and in the late '60s he helped found a branch of psychology called transpersonal psychology devoted entirely to their study .
Although Grof 's newly founded Association of Transpersonal Psychology garnered a rapidly growing group of like - minded professionals and has become a respected branch of psychology , for years neither Grof or any of his colleagues were able to offer a mechanism for explaining the bizarre psychological phenomena they were witnessing .
But that has changed with the advent of the holographic paradigm .
As Grof noted , if the mind is actually part of a continuum , a labyrinth that is connected not only to every other mind that exists or has existed , but to every atom , organism , and region in the vastness of space and time itself , the fact that it is able to occasionally make forays into the labyrinth and have transpersonal experiences no longer seems so strange .
Perhaps , in Creating Reality , we have already become - as in Star Trek , The Next Generation - a Q of the Continuum or we are part of a consciousness virtual reality experiment .

In his book Gifts of Unknown Things , biologist Lyall Watson describes his encounter with an Indonesian shaman woman who , by performing a ritual dance , was able to make an entire grove of trees instantly vanish into thin air .
Watson relates that as he and another astonished onlooker continued to watch the woman , she caused the trees to reappear , then click off again and on again several times in succession .
Although current scientific understanding is incapable of explaining such events , experiences like this become more tenable if hard reality is only a holographic projection .
Perhaps we agree on what is ' there ' or ' not there ' because what we call consensus reality is formulated and ratified at the level of the human unconscious at which all minds are infinitely interconnected .
If this is true , it is the most profound implication of the holographic paradigm of all , for it means that experiences such as Watson 's are not commonplace only because we have not programmed our minds with the beliefs that would make them so .

In a holographic universe there are no limits to the extent to which we can alter the fabric of reality .
What we perceive as reality is only a canvas waiting for us to draw upon it any picture we want .
Anything is possible , from bending spoons with the power of the mind to events experienced by Carlos Castaneda during his encounters with the Yaqui brujo don Juan , for Magic is our birthright , no more or less miraculous than our ability to compute the reality we want when we are in our dreams .
Indeed , even our most fundamental notions about reality become suspect , for in a holographic universe , as Pribram has pointed out , even random events would have to be seen as based on holographic principles and therefore determined .
Synchronicity Principal suddenly makes sense , and everything in reality would have to be seen as a metaphor .
Even the most haphazard events would express some underlying symmetry .
Whether Bohm and Pribram 's holographic paradigm becomes accepted in science or dies an ignoble death remains to be seen , but it is safe to say that it has already had an influence on the thinking of many scientists .
And even if it is found that the holographic model does not provide the best explanation for the instantaneous communications that seem to be passing back and forth between subatomic particles , at the very least , as noted by Basil Hiley , a physicist at Birbeck College in London , Aspect 's findings indicate that we must be prepared to consider radically new views of reality .
Information in the Holographic Universe
Scientific American August 14 , 2003
Theoretical results about black holes suggest that the universe could be like a gigantic hologram .
An astonishing theory called the holographic principle holds that the universe is like a hologram : just as a trick of light allows a fully three - dimensional image to be recorded on a flat piece of film , our seemingly three - dimensional universe could be completely equivalent to alternative quantum fields and physical laws " painted " on a distant , vast surface .
The physics of black holes -- immensely dense concentrations of mass -- provides a hint that the principle might be true .
Studies of black holes show that , although it defies common sense , the maximum entropy or information content of any region of space is defined not by its volume but by its surface area .
Physicists hope that this surprising finding is a clue to the ultimate theory of reality .
Ask anybody what the physical world is made of , and you are likely to be told " matter and energy . "
Yet if we have learned anything from engineering , biology and physics , information is just as crucial an ingredient .
The robot at the automobile factory is supplied with metal and plastic but can make nothing useful without copious instructions telling it which part to weld to what and so on .
A ribosome in a cell in your body is supplied with amino acid building blocks and is powered by energy released by the conversion of ATP to ADP , but it can synthesize no proteins without the information brought to it from the DNA in the cell 's nucleus .
Likewise , a century of developments in physics has taught us that information is a crucial player in physical systems and processes .
Indeed , a current trend , initiated by John A. Wheeler of Princeton University , is to regard the physical world as made of information , with energy and matter as incidentals .
This viewpoint invites a new look at venerable questions .
The information storage capacity of devices such as hard disk drives has been increasing by leaps and bounds .
When will such progress halt ?
What is the ultimate information capacity of a device that weighs , say , less than a gram and can fit inside a cubic centimeter ( roughly the size of a computer chip ) ?
How much information does it take to describe a whole universe ?
Could that description fit in a computer 's memory ?
Could we , as William Blake memorably penned , " see the world in a grain of sand , " or is that idea no more than poetic license ?
Remarkably , recent developments in theoretical physics answer some of these questions , and the answers might be important clues to the ultimate theory of reality .
By studying the mysterious properties of black holes , physicists have deduced absolute limits on how much information a region of space or a quantity of matter and energy can hold .
Related results suggest that our universe , which we perceive to have three spatial dimensions , might instead be " written " on a two - dimensional surface , like a hologram .
Our everyday perceptions of the world as three - dimensional would then be either a profound illusion or merely one of two alternative ways of viewing reality .
A grain of sand may not encompass our world , but a flat screen might .
The Entropy of a Black Hole
The Entropy of a Black Hole is proportional to the area of its event horizon , the surface within which even light cannot escape the gravity of the hole .
Specifically , a hole with a horizon spanning A Planck areas has A /4 units of entropy .
( The Planck area , approximately 10 - 66 square centimeter , is the fundamental quantum unit of area determined by the strength of gravity , the speed of light and the size of quanta . )
Considered as information , it is as if the entropy were written on the event horizon , with each bit ( each digital 1 or 0 ) corresponding to four Planck areas .
A Tale of Two Entropies
Formal information theory originated in seminal 1948 papers by American applied mathematician Claude E. Shannon , who introduced today 's most widely used measure of information content : entropy .
Entropy had long been a central concept of thermodynamics , the branch of physics dealing with heat .
Thermodynamic entropy is popularly described as the disorder in a physical system .
In 1877 Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann characterized it more precisely in terms of the number of distinct microscopic states that the particles composing a chunk of matter could be in while still looking like the same macroscopic chunk of matter .
For example , for the air in the room around you , one would count all the ways that the individual gas molecules could be distributed in the room and all the ways they could be moving .
When Shannon cast about for a way to quantify the information contained in , say , a message , he was led by logic to a formula with the same form as Boltzmann's .
The Shannon entropy of a message is the number of binary digits , or bits , needed to encode it .
Shannon 's entropy does not enlighten us about the value of information , which is highly dependent on context .
Yet as an objective measure of quantity of information , it has been enormously useful in science and technology .
For instance , the design of every modern communications device -- from cellular phones to modems to compact - disc players -- relies on Shannon entropy .
Thermodynamic entropy and Shannon entropy are conceptually equivalent : the number of arrangements that are counted by Boltzmann entropy reflects the amount of Shannon information one would need to implement any particular arrangement .
The two entropies have two salient differences , though .
First , the thermodynamic entropy used by a chemist or a refrigeration engineer is expressed in units of energy divided by temperature , whereas the Shannon entropy used by a communications engineer is in bits , essentially dimensionless .
That difference is merely a matter of convention .
Limits of Functional Density
The thermodynamics of black holes allows one to deduce limits on the density of entropy or information in various circumstances .
The holographic bound defines how much information can be contained in a specified region of space .
It can be derived by considering a roughly spherical distribution of matter that is contained within a surface of area A .
The matter is induced to collapse to form a black hole ( a ) .
The black hole 's area must be smaller than A , so its entropy must be less than A /4 [ see illustration ] .
Because entropy cannot decrease , one infers that the original distribution of matter also must carry less than A /4 units of entropy or information .
This result -- that the maximum information content of a region of space is fixed by its area -- defies the commonsense expectation that the capacity of a region should depend on its volume .
The universal entropy bound defines how much information can be carried by a mass m of diameter d.
It is derived by imagining that a capsule of matter is engulfed by a black hole not much wider than it ( b ) .
The increase in the black hole 's size places a limit on how much entropy the capsule could have contained .
This limit is tighter than the holographic bound , except when the capsule is almost as dense as a black hole ( in which case the two bounds are equivalent ) .
The holographic and universal information bounds are far beyond the data storage capacities of any current technology , and they greatly exceed the density of information on chromosomes and the thermodynamic entropy of water ( c ) .
Even when reduced to common units , however , typical values of the two entropies differ vastly in magnitude .
A silicon microchip carrying a gigabyte of data , for instance , has a Shannon entropy of about 1010 bits ( one byte is eight bits ) , tremendously smaller than the chip 's thermodynamic entropy , which is about 1023 bits at room temperature .
This discrepancy occurs because the entropies are computed for different degrees of freedom .
A degree of freedom is any quantity that can vary , such as a coordinate specifying a particle 's location or one component of its velocity .
The Shannon entropy of the chip cares only about the overall state of each tiny transistor etched in the silicon crystal -- the transistor is on or off ; it is a 0 or a 1 - - a single binary degree of freedom .
Thermodynamic entropy , in contrast , depends on the states of all the billions of atoms ( and their roaming electrons ) that make up each transistor .
As miniaturization brings closer the day when each atom will store one bit of information for us , the useful Shannon entropy of the state - of - the - art microchip will edge closer in magnitude to its material 's thermodynamic entropy .
When the two entropies are calculated for the same degrees of freedom , they are equal .
What are the ultimate degrees of freedom ?
Atoms , after all , are made of electrons and nuclei , nuclei are agglomerations of protons and neutrons , and those in turn are composed of quarks .
Many physicists today consider electrons and quarks to be excitations of superstrings , which they hypothesize to be the most fundamental entities .
But the vicissitudes of a century of revelations in physics warn us not to be dogmatic .
There could be more levels of structure in our universe than are dreamt of in today 's physics .
One cannot calculate the ultimate information capacity of a chunk of matter or , equivalently , its true thermodynamic entropy , without knowing the nature of the ultimate constituents of matter or of the deepest level of structure , which I shall refer to as level X .
( This ambiguity causes no problems in analyzing practical thermodynamics , such as that of car engines , for example , because the quarks within the atoms can be ignored -- they do not change their states under the relatively benign conditions in the engine . )
Given the dizzying progress in miniaturization , one can playfully contemplate a day when quarks will serve to store information , one bit apiece perhaps .
How much information would then fit into our one - centimeter cube ?
And how much if we harness superstrings or even deeper , yet undreamt of levels ?
Surprisingly , developments in gravitation physics in the past three decades have supplied some clear answers to what seem to be elusive questions .
The information content of a pile of computer chips increases in proportion with the number of chips or , equivalently , the volume they occupy .
That simple rule must break down for a large enough pile of chips because eventually the information would exceed the holographic bound , which depends on the surface area , not the volume .
The " breakdown " occurs when the immense pile of chips collapses to form a black hole .
Black Hole Thermodynamics
A central player in these developments is the black hole .
Black holes are a consequence of general relativity , Albert Einstein 's 1915 geometric theory of gravitation .
In this theory , gravitation arises from the curvature of spacetime , which makes objects move as if they were pulled by a force .
Conversely , the curvature is caused by the presence of matter and energy .
According to Einstein 's equations , a sufficiently dense concentration of matter or energy will curve spacetime so extremely that it rends , forming a black hole .
The laws of relativity forbid anything that went into a black hole from coming out again , at least within the classical ( nonquantum ) description of the physics .
The point of no return , called the event horizon of the black hole , is of crucial importance .
In the simplest case , the horizon is a sphere , whose surface area is larger for more massive black holes .
It is impossible to determine what is inside a black hole .
No detailed information can emerge across the horizon and escape into the outside world .
In disappearing forever into a black hole , however , a piece of matter does leave some traces .
Its energy ( we count any mass as energy in accordance with Einstein's E = mc2 ) is permanently reflected in an increment in the black hole 's mass .
If the matter is captured while circling the hole , its associated angular momentum is added to the black hole 's angular momentum .
Both the mass and angular momentum of a black hole are measurable from their effects on spacetime around the hole .
In this way , the laws of conservation of energy and angular momentum are upheld by black holes .
Another fundamental law , the second law of thermodynamics , appears to be violated .
Holographic Space - Time
Two universes of different dimension and obeying disparate physical laws are rendered completely equivalent by the holographic principle .
Theorists have demonstrated this principle mathematically for a specific type of five - dimensional spacetime ( " anti-de Sitter " ) and its four - dimensional boundary .
In effect , the 5 - D universe is recorded like a hologram on the 4 - D surface at its periphery .
Superstring theory rules in the 5 - D spacetime , but a so - called conformal field theory of point particles operates on the 4 - D hologram .
A black hole in the 5 - D spacetime is equivalent to hot radiation on the hologram - - for example , the hole and the radiation have the same entropy even though the physical origin of the entropy is completely different for each case .
Although these two descriptions of the universe seem utterly unalike , no experiment could distinguish between them , even in principle .
The second law of thermodynamics summarizes the familiar observation that most processes in nature are irreversible : a teacup falls from the table and shatters , but no one has ever seen shards jump up of their own accord and assemble into a teacup .
The second law of thermodynamics forbids such inverse processes .
It states that the entropy of an isolated physical system can never decrease ; at best , entropy remains constant , and usually it increases .
This law is central to physical chemistry and engineering ; it is arguably the physical law with the greatest impact outside physics .
As first emphasized by Wheeler , when matter disappears into a black hole , its entropy is gone for good , and the second law seems to be transcended , made irrelevant .
A clue to resolving this puzzle came in 1970 , when Demetrious Christodoulou , then a graduate student of Wheeler 's at Princeton , and Stephen W. Hawking of the University of Cambridge independently proved that in various processes , such as black hole mergers , the total area of the event horizons never decreases .
The analogy with the tendency of entropy to increase led me to propose in 1972 that a black hole has entropy proportional to the area of its horizon .
I conjectured that when matter falls into a black hole , the increase in black hole entropy always compensates or overcompensates for the " lost " entropy of the matter .
More generally , the sum of black hole entropies and the ordinary entropy outside the black holes cannot decrease .
This is the generalized second law - - GSL for short .
Our innate perception that the world is three - dimensional could be an extraordinary illusion .
Hawking 's radiation process allowed him to determine the proportionality constant between black hole entropy and horizon area : black hole entropy is precisely one quarter of the event horizon 's area measured in Planck areas .
( The Planck length , about 10 - 33 centimeter , is the fundamental length scale related to gravity and quantum mechanics .
The Planck area is its square . )
Even in thermodynamic terms , this is a vast quantity of entropy .
The entropy of a black hole one centimeter in diameter would be about 1066 bits , roughly equal to the thermodynamic entropy of a cube of water 10 billion kilometers on a side .
The World as a Hologram
The GSL allows us to set bounds on the information capacity of any isolated physical system , limits that refer to the information at all levels of structure down to level X .
In 1980 I began studying the first such bound , called the universal entropy bound , which limits how much entropy can be carried by a specified mass of a specified size [ see box on opposite page ] .
A related idea , the holographic bound , was devised in 1995 by Leonard Susskind of Stanford University .
It limits how much entropy can be contained in matter and energy occupying a specified volume of space .
In his work on the holographic bound , Susskind considered any approximately spherical isolated mass that is not itself a black hole and that fits inside a closed surface of area A .
If the mass can collapse to a black hole , that hole will end up with a horizon area smaller than A .
The black hole entropy is therefore smaller than A /4 .
According to the GSL , the entropy of the system cannot decrease , so the mass 's original entropy cannot have been bigger than A / 4 .
It follows that the entropy of an isolated physical system with boundary area A is necessarily less than A /4 .
What if the mass does not spontaneously collapse ?
In 2000 I showed that a tiny black hole can be used to convert the system to a black hole not much different from the one in Susskind 's argument .
The bound is therefore independent of the constitution of the system or of the nature of level X . It just depends on the GSL .
We can now answer some of those elusive questions about the ultimate limits of information storage .
A device measuring a centimeter across could in principle hold up to 1066 bits -- a mind - boggling amount .
The visible universe contains at least 10100 bits of entropy , which could in principle be packed inside a sphere a tenth of a light - year across .
Estimating the entropy of the universe is a difficult problem , however , and much larger numbers , requiring a sphere almost as big as the universe itself , are entirely plausible .
But it is another aspect of the holographic bound that is truly astonishing .
Namely , that the maximum possible entropy depends on the boundary area instead of the volume .
Imagine that we are piling up computer memory chips in a big heap .
The number of transistors -- the total data storage capacity -- increases with the volume of the heap .
So , too , does the total thermodynamic entropy of all the chips .
Remarkably , though , the theoretical ultimate information capacity of the space occupied by the heap increases only with the surface area .
Because volume increases more rapidly than surface area , at some point the entropy of all the chips would exceed the holographic bound .
It would seem that either the GSL or our commonsense ideas of entropy and information capacity must fail .
In fact , what fails is the pile itself : it would collapse under its own gravity and form a black hole before that impasse was reached .
Thereafter each additional memory chip would increase the mass and surface area of the black hole in a way that would continue to preserve the GSL .
This surprising result -- that information capacity depends on surface area -- has a natural explanation if the holographic principle ( proposed in 1993 by Nobelist Gerard 't Hooft of the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands and elaborated by Susskind ) is true .
In the everyday world , a hologram is a special kind of photograph that generates a full three - dimensional image when it is illuminated in the right manner .
All the information describing the 3 - D scene is encoded into the pattern of light and dark areas on the two - dimensional piece of film , ready to be regenerated .
The holographic principle contends that an analogue of this visual magic applies to the full physical description of any system occupying a 3 - D region : it proposes that another physical theory defined only on the 2 - D boundary of the region completely describes the 3 - D physics .
If a 3 - D system can be fully described by a physical theory operating solely on its 2 - D boundary , one would expect the information content of the system not to exceed that of the description on the boundary .
A Universe Painted on Its Boundary
Can we apply the holographic principle to the universe at large ?
The real universe is a 4 - D system : it has volume and extends in time .
If the physics of our universe is holographic , there would be an alternative set of physical laws , operating on a 3 - D boundary of spacetime somewhere , that would be equivalent to our known 4 - D physics .
We do not yet know of any such 3 - D theory that works in that way .
Indeed , what surface should we use as the boundary of the universe ?
One step toward realizing these ideas is to study models that are simpler than our real universe .
A class of concrete examples of the holographic principle at work involves so - called anti-de Sitter spacetimes .
The original de Sitter spacetime is a model universe first obtained by Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter in 1917 as a solution of Einstein 's equations , including the repulsive force known as the cosmological constant .
De Sitter 's spacetime is empty , expands at an accelerating rate and is very highly symmetrical .
In 1997 astronomers studying distant supernova explosions concluded that our universe now expands in an accelerated fashion and will probably become increasingly like a de Sitter spacetime in the future .
Now , if the repulsion in Einstein 's equations is changed to attraction , de Sitter 's solution turns into the anti-de Sitter spacetime , which has equally as much symmetry .
More important for the holographic concept , it possesses a boundary , which is located " at infinity " and is a lot like our everyday spacetime .
Using anti-de Sitter spacetime , theorists have devised a concrete example of the holographic principle at work : a universe described by superstring theory functioning in an anti-de Sitter spacetime is completely equivalent to a quantum field theory operating on the boundary of that spacetime [ see box above ] .
Thus , the full majesty of superstring theory in an anti-de Sitter universe is painted on the boundary of the universe .
Juan Maldacena , then at Harvard University , first conjectured such a relation in 1997 for the 5 - D anti-de Sitter case , and it was later confirmed for many situations by Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , N.J. , and Steven S. Gubser , Igor R. Klebanov and Alexander M. Polyakov of Princeton University .
Examples of this holographic correspondence are now known for spacetimes with a variety of dimensions .
This result means that two ostensibly very different theories -- not even acting in spaces of the same dimension -- are equivalent .
Creatures living in one of these universes would be incapable of determining if they inhabited a 5 - D universe described by string theory or a 4 - D one described by a quantum field theory of point particles .
( Of course , the structures of their brains might give them an overwhelming " commonsense " prejudice in favor of one description or another , in just the way that our brains construct an innate perception that our universe has three spatial dimensions ; see the illustration on the opposite page . )
The holographic equivalence can allow a difficult calculation in the 4 - D boundary spacetime , such as the behavior of quarks and gluons , to be traded for another , easier calculation in the highly symmetric , 5 - D anti-de Sitter spacetime .
The correspondence works the other way , too .
Witten has shown that a black hole in anti-de Sitter spacetime corresponds to hot radiation in the alternative physics operating on the bounding spacetime .
The entropy of the hole - - a deeply mysterious concept -- equals the radiation 's entropy , which is quite mundane .
The Expanding Universe
Highly symmetric and empty , the 5 - D anti-de Sitter universe is hardly like our universe existing in 4 - D , filled with matter and radiation , and riddled with violent events .
Even if we approximate our real universe with one that has matter and radiation spread uniformly throughout , we get not an anti-de Sitter universe but rather a " Friedmann - Robertson - Walker " universe .
Most cosmologists today concur that our universe resembles an FRW universe , one that is infinite , has no boundary and will go on expanding ad infinitum .
Does such a universe conform to the holographic principle or the holographic bound ?
Susskind 's argument based on collapse to a black hole is of no help here .
Indeed , the holographic bound deduced from black holes must break down in a uniform expanding universe .
The entropy of a region uniformly filled with matter and radiation is truly proportional to its volume .
A sufficiently large region will therefore violate the holographic bound .
In 1999 Raphael Bousso , then at Stanford , proposed a modified holographic bound , which has since been found to work even in situations where the bounds we discussed earlier cannot be applied .
Bousso's formulation starts with any suitable 2 - D surface ; it may be closed like a sphere or open like a sheet of paper .
One then imagines a brief burst of light issuing simultaneously and perpendicularly from all over one side of the surface .
The only demand is that the imaginary light rays are converging to start with .
Light emitted from the inner surface of a spherical shell , for instance , satisfies that requirement .
One then considers the entropy of the matter and radiation that these imaginary rays traverse , up to the points where they start crossing .
Bousso conjectured that this entropy cannot exceed the entropy represented by the initial surface -- one quarter of its area , measured in Planck areas .
This is a different way of tallying up the entropy than that used in the original holographic bound .
Bousso's bound refers not to the entropy of a region at one time but rather to the sum of entropies of locales at a variety of times : those that are " illuminated " by the light burst from the surface .
Bousso's bound subsumes other entropy bounds while avoiding their limitations .
Both the universal entropy bound and the 't Hooft - Susskind form of the holographic bound can be deduced from Bousso's for any isolated system that is not evolving rapidly and whose gravitational field is not strong .
When these conditions are overstepped -- as for a collapsing sphere of matter already inside a black hole -- these bounds eventually fail , whereas Bousso 's bound continues to hold .
Bousso has also shown that his strategy can be used to locate the 2 - D surfaces on which holograms of the world can be set up .
Researchers have proposed many other entropy bounds .
The proliferation of variations on the holographic motif makes it clear that the subject has not yet reached the status of physical law .
But although the holographic way of thinking is not yet fully understood , it seems to be here to stay .
And with it comes a realization that the fundamental belief , prevalent for 50 years , that field theory is the ultimate language of physics must give way .
Fields , such as the electromagnetic field , vary continuously from point to point , and they thereby describe an infinity of degrees of freedom .
Superstring theory also embraces an infinite number of degrees of freedom .
Holography restricts the number of degrees of freedom that can be present inside a bounding surface to a finite number ; field theory with its infinity cannot be the final story .
Furthermore , even if the infinity is tamed , the mysterious dependence of information on surface area must be somehow accommodated .
Holography may be a guide to a better theory .
What is the fundamental theory like ?
The chain of reasoning involving holography suggests to some , notably Lee Smolin of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo , that such a final theory must be concerned not with fields , not even with spacetime , but rather with information exchange among physical processes .
If so , the vision of information as the stuff the world is made of will have found a worthy embodiment .
Jacob D. Bekenstein has contributed to the foundation of black hole thermodynamics and to other aspects of the connections between information and gravitation .
He is Polak Professor of Theoretical Physics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities , and a recipient of the Rothschild Prize .
Bekenstein dedicates this article to John Archibald Wheeler ( his Ph.D. supervisor 30 years ago ) .
Wheeler belongs to the third generation of Ludwig Boltzmann 's students : Wheeler 's Ph.D. adviser , Karl Herzfeld , was a student of Boltzmann 's student Friedrich Hasenšhrl .
In the 1950s , while conducting research into the beliefs of LSD as a psychotherapeutic tool , Grof had one female patient who suddenly became convinced she had assumed the identity of a female of a species of prehistoric reptile .
During the course of her hallucination , she not only gave a richly detailed description of what it felt like to be encapsulated in such a form , but noted that the portion of the male of the species 's anatomy was a patch of colored scales on the side of its head .
What was startling to Grof was that although the woman had no prior knowledge about such things , a conversation with a zoologist later confirmed that in certain species of reptiles colored areas on the head do indeed play an important role as triggers of sexual arousal .
The woman 's experience was not unique .
During the course of his research , Grof encountered examples of patients regressing and identifying with virtually every species on the evolutionary tree ( research findings which helped influence the man - into - ape scene in the movie Altered States ) .
Moreover , he found that such experiences frequently contained obscure zoological details which turned out to be accurate .
Regressions into the animal kingdom were not the only puzzling psychological phenomena Grof encountered .
He also had patients who appeared to tap into some sort of collective or racial unconscious .
Individuals with little or no education suddenly gave detailed descriptions of Zoroastrian funerary practices and scenes from Hindu mythology .
In other categories of experience , individuals gave persuasive accounts of out - of - body journeys , of precognitive glimpses of the future , of regressions into apparent past - life incarnations .
In later research , Grof found the same range of phenomena manifested in therapy sessions which did not involve the use of drugs .
Because the common element in such experiences appeared to be the transcending of an individual 's consciousness beyond the usual boundaries of ego and / or limitations of space and time , Grof called such manifestations " transpersonal experiences " , and in the late ' 60s he helped found a branch of psychology called " transpersonal psychology " devoted entirely to their study .
Although Grof 's newly founded Association of Transpersonal Psychology garnered a rapidly growing group of like - minded professionals and has become a respected branch of psychology , for years neither Grof or any of his colleagues were able to offer a mechanism for explaining the bizarre psychological phenomena they were witnessing .
But that has changed with the advent of the holographic paradigm .
As Grof recently noted , if the mind is actually part of a continuum , a labyrinth that is connected not only to every other mind that exists or has existed , but to every atom , organism , and region in the vastness of space and time itself , the fact that it is able to occasionally make forays into the labyrinth and have transpersonal experiences no longer seems so strange .
The holographic prardigm also has implications for so - called hard sciences like biology .
Keith Floyd , a psychologist at Virginia Intermont College , has pointed out that if the concreteness of reality is but a holographic illusion , it would no longer be true to say the brain produces consciousness .
Rather , it is consciousness that creates the appearance of the brain -- as well as the body and everything else around us we interpret as physical .
Such a turnabout in the way we view biological structures has caused researchers to point out that medicine and our understanding of the healing process could also be transformed by the holographic paradigm .
If the apparent physical structure of the body is but a holographic projection of consciousness , it becomes clear that each of us is much more responsible for our health than current medical wisdom allows .
What we now view as miraculous remissions of disease may actually be due to changes in consciousness which in turn effect changes in the hologram of the body .
Similarly , controversial new healing techniques such as visualization may work so well because in the holographic domain of thought images are ultimately as real as " reality " .
Even visions and experiences involving " non-ordinary " reality become explainable under the holographic paradigm .
In his book " Gifts of Unknown Things , " biologist Lyall Watson discribes his encounter with an Indonesian shaman woman who , by performing a ritual dance , was able to make an entire grove of trees instantly vanish into thin air .
Watson relates that as he and another astonished onlooker continued to watch the woman , she caused the trees to reappear , then " click " off again and on again several times in succession .
Although current scientific understanding is incapable of explaining such events , experiences like this become more tenable if " hard " reality is only a holographic projection .
Perhaps we agree on what is " there " or " not there " because what we call consensus reality is formulated and ratified at the level of the human unconscious at which all minds are infinitely interconnected .
If this is true , it is the most profound implication of the holographic paradigm of all , for it means that experiences such as Watson 's are not commonplace only because we have not programmed our minds with the beliefs that would make them so .
In a holographic universe there are no limits to the extent to which we can alter the fabric of reality .
What we perceive as reality is only a canvas waiting for us to draw upon it any picture we want .
Anything is possible , from bending spoons with the power of the mind to the phantasmagoric events experienced by Castaneda during his encounters with the Yaqui brujo don Juan , for magic is our birthright , no more or less miraculous than our ability to compute the reality we want when we are in our dreams .
Indeed , even our most fundamental notions about reality become suspect , for in a holographic universe , as Pribram has pointed out , even random events would have to be seen as based on holographic principles and therefore determined .
Synchronicities or meaningful coincidences suddenly makes sense , and everything in reality would have to be seen as a metaphor , for even the most haphazard events would express some underlying symmetry .
Whether Bohm and Pribram 's holographic paradigm becomes accepted in science or dies an ignoble death remains to be seen , but it is safe to say that it has already had an influence on the thinking of many scientists .
And even if it is found that the holographic model does not provide the best explanation for the instantaneous communications that seem to be passing back and forth between subatomic particles , at the very least , as noted by Basil Hiley , a physicist at Birbeck College in London , Aspect 's findings " indicate that we must be prepared to consider radically new views of reality " .
I ‘m not much of an auto guy , but I ’m a real sucker for gadgets and the new Lexus has me excited .
Toyota released their latest Lexus in Japan at the start of this week and it is amazingly different from any car that has come before .
Japanese autos are becoming more and more high - tech and closer and closer to being a computer on wheels .
The flagship vehicle for the new Lexus is the LS460 .
This car is said to have over 7 million lines of code programmed inside ( and that is not including the car - navi software ! )
That is about as much as you ’d find inside an aeroplane and controls everything from breaking and steering to temperature and “ inflight ” comfort .
To put that into context , the average Toyota car has about 4 million lines of code .
You can check out some photos of the LS460 on its website but let me give you a run down to some of the cooler functions .
When you want to park your car , the Lexus uses sonar to detect the vehicles already parked on the side of the road .
By pressing the “ parallel parking ” button , the car will automatically maneuver your car into the parking space .
While I would n’t experiment with this when you ’re parked next to a Merc , it does sound like pretty practical functionability .
While there has been a lot of Japanese press recently about Toyota designing a car which detects your blood alchohol levels and shuts the car down if the driver is drunk , this one focuses on slightly more “ techy ” safety features .
The inbuilt camera on the steering wheel detects when the driver is n’t looking at the road .
The car is constantly monitoring the road in front of you with millimeter wave radar and if it looks like you might potentially crash , it not only flashes a light and sounds a siren , it slows your speed and increases the sensitivity of the steering circle to ease your escape from danger .
At the same time , it also adjusts the head rest so that it is positioned directly behind the driver ’s head to reduce any potential backlash in the collision .
Besides this doing wonders for lowering the mortality rate on the roads , this will be great for Japanese tech companies .
These days all of the focus seems to be on the impact that the digitalization of television / broadcasting will have on Japanese tech makers but it is starting to feel like the increasing digitalization of autos could be even more exciting .
The arrival of the hybrid could be just as important as the LCD has been for Japan ’s component manufacturers .
Yet another reason to stay bullish about the Japanese economy in the long - term .
Hazzard a guess as to the total number of motors in the new Lexus .
( Hint : the answer is a lot more than that big one that you are thinking about ) .
If you want a new Lexus , you better be fast .
Apparently Toyota had received orders for over 9,000 cars even before the Lexus was released .
( Not bad given that the company had only expected to manufacture 10,000 of them this year . )

CohesiveFT , a US provider of virtual appliances for financial industry data standards , has teamed with London consultancy LShift to develop RabbitMQ , an open source messaging application based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol ( AMQP ) , championed by JPMorgan Chase .
AMQP is an emerging open standard for enterprise messaging and is designed to free institutions from the costs and constraints imposed by proprietary middleware and interoperate with many of the current messaging and Web services specifications .
LShift and CohesiveFT say the RabbitMQ standard enables developers of messaging systems to benefit not only from AMQP , but also from the Open Telecommunication Platform ( OTP ) .
OTP is used exclusively by telecommunications companies to manage switching exchanges for voice calls , VoIP , and now video .
Rather than creating a new messaging infrastructure , the RabbitMQ team built an AMQP layer on top of OTP using Erlang .
Java tooling and clients are provided for developers and administrators to run RabbitMQ and connect to it over the AMQP wire protocol .
Other language adaptors to come , say the companies .
Commenting on the development of RabbitMQ , John O'Hara , executive director at JPMorgan and chair of the AMQP working group , says : " The vision of the AMQP Working Group is that through standardisation AMQP enables businesses to reduce their integration costs and paves the way to simple , robust transaction processing between firms globally .
" RabbitMQ , implemented in technologies pioneered in the demanding telecommunications industry , demonstrates the innovation which can occur on the back of an open standard like AMQP . "

ANOTHER FABULOUS FAILURE
Back in February , 2003 , “ psychics ” Sylvia Browne and James Van Praagh were consulted by the parents of missing 11 - year - old Shawn Hornbeck – Pam and Craig Akers .
That young man just recently turned up – very much alive and well , in rather sharp disagreement with the prognostications of the humbug artists .
The Hornbecks had talked February 11th with Sylvia Browne on the Montel Williams television show , where she informed them that Shawn was " no longer with us , " which means “ dead . ”
She said his body was in a wooded area “ about 20 miles southwest of Richwoods , Missouri . ”
She said it would be near two large , jagged boulders that “ seem out of place in that area , ” and she added that the bicycle he was riding when he disappeared , is in a dump " in another state . "
As a result of Browne ’s fruitless guess , intensive searches by hundreds of volunteers were conducted in the general area described by her , but naturally , with no success .
Not even “ jagged boulders ” showed up , let alone the kid – until he was found and returned home on Friday , January 12th .
He ’d been gone for 1,559 days !
But there was more specific drivel from Browne , She said that Shawn had been taken by a " dark - skinned man , he was n't black – more like Hispanic . "
She said the kidnaper had long , black hair worn in dreadlocks and was " really tall . "
He was driving an older model blue sedan , she said , a car with fins like in the late 1950's and early 1960 's Chevrolets .
All of this drivel was wrong , from the description of the man – he is not Hispanic nor dark - skinned , he ’s Caucasian , he ’s heavy and not tall – and his car was quite the opposite of Browne ’s invented notions : it was a white pickup truck .
The Akers also appeared in television segments on “ Beyond ” with James Van Praagh , another equally accurate “ psychic . ”
He led the search in an entirely different direction , suggesting that a person who worked in a railroad car plant was involved , and that the body “ might ” be concealed in a railway car .
Again , totally wrong , in all respects .
This fatuous guess - fest also led to numerous detailed searches , including a railroad yard – all a waste of time and money , at the expense of the frantic parents .
This is yet another glaring example of how these leeches eagerly fasten onto grieving and vulnerable persons , exploit them , and profit from their situation .
And it wo n’t stop .
Larry King and Montel Williams will continue to give the scam - artists time and publicity – BECAUSE THEY JUST DON ’T CARE !
GELLER REDUX
A recent fuss caused by an Uri Geller TV series in Israel has also stirred up the legitimate magicians there .
He claims that he ’s seeking a successor (?! ) and he shows off a parade of young magicians who carefully avoid saying specifically whether they are displaying genuine miracles , but manage to drop in references to Kabbalah , Indian mysticism , and various popular modes of sorcery .
Many of the Israeli magicians are of the opinion that they should not support belief in paranormal powers , and they are dismayed that the president of their own association is instructing them on what their opinions and public statements about Geller ’s claims should be .
They wrote and telephoned to ask me to prepare a statement giving my views on the matter .
Here it is :
Within the last two weeks , several Israeli magicians have urged me to provide a statement on conjurors ’ ethics that can be used to explain our concern over the endorsement and support of Uri Geller ’s claims by Dahlia Pelled , the president of the Israeli Society of Magicians .
Ms. Pelled has instructed members of the Society that they should support the mythology that Geller does not perform tricks , but is genuinely psychic .
Unless Ms. Pelled ’s knowledge of the conjuring art is only rudimentary , I cannot believe that she really looks upon the spoon - bending , compass - moving , and sealed - drawing demos that Mr. Geller does , as genuine examples of supernatural powers .
If she does so , it means she is not familiar with simple routines that have appeared in children ’s magic trick books , for generations .
But , if she is aware of the methods used by Geller , I look upon her acceptance and support of his claims as , first , unethical , and second , damaging to our profession .
Other magicians around the world , in great number , agree with me .
Mr. Geller is fond of citing the names of befuddled scientists who have – at least temporarily – supported his claims of genuine supernatural powers , even though most of them are now deceased .
It is well known among conjurers that scientists are relatively easy to deceive simply because they think logically and rationally , and are the perfect dupes for basic magic tricks .
They are very poor judges of whether or not they have been fooled ; such endorsements are of no value whatsoever .
However , the president of a national conjurers association surely has appropriate knowledge of whether or not a performer is doing tricks – one would think .
Dishonesty has no place in the conjuring profession .
We are not swindlers taking money under false pretences .
We do not lie to our audiences to change their perception of the real world .
Yes , we use hyperbole and misdirection , but in the same way that all actors do – to create admitted illusions , not to mislead the public into dangerous acceptance of pseudoscience and irrationality .
As conjurors , we have the obligation to be honest with the public – because we have the potential to exert strong influence on their thinking processes and even mislead them in their decision - making .
That ’s what scam artists – not conjurors – do .
This is not a frivolous matter .
Belief in the supernatural has led to grief , financial and academic ruin , disillusionment , and even illness and death , for the public .
A brief study of my web page at www.randi.org will provide examples of this damage .
Is Ms. Pelled willing to continue to be a part of this process of deception ?
If so , in my opinion , she abandons her responsibility and her duties as a human being , and should not be representing the Israeli Society of Magicians .
Had Uri Geller undertaken to be an entertainer and to level with his audiences , I and other legitimate conjurors would have had no problem with him .
Instead , he has firmly stated , on many occasions , that he uses no trickery , and that he has genuine supernatural abilities .
This is untrue ; he is a conjuror – of very limited repertoire – and he now manipulates people in his homeland – with the support and endorsement of the Israeli Society of Magicians !
Incidentally , I belong to the Israeli Society of Magicians , myself , so I have more than a passing interest in this situation .
I was granted membership back in September of 1986 during a visit to that country .
Back then , the organization was known as The Israeli Society for Promoting the Art of Magic .
That ’s more than 20 years ago .
Has Mrs. Pelled been a member for that long …?
One letter from a young Israeli magician gives an opinion :
My name is [ deleted ] .
I 'm 19 + years old – from Israel .
If you know Israeli people , you probably know about Uri Geller 's TV Show where he looks for his [ successor ] – " The Next Uri Geller " kind of thing .
This whole show is a joke , plus Uri himself .
He just made his character in Israel go down .
On the latest show ( if you have n't heard yet ) he made a compass move , like he did before in many shows across the globe .
BUT THIS TIME it was obvious that he put a magnet on his thumb .
You can definitely see it .
He did wrong by doing that LIVE on TV .
The video of this was on YouTube the minute it happened but , the problem is that he ( Uri ) had it removed from YouTube so the only place you can see it is on Keshet Site ( the TV company who made the show ) and the whole site is in Hebrew , so I 'll hope you get something .
It 's at www.keshet-tv.com/geller/lobbyvideo.aspx and in the video list right now it is the second from the top .
You can see the compass in the picture .
Uri is a good performer , but NOT a super - power .
You know that , of course .
Randi comments :
The video shows an obvious move by Mr. Geller which appears to be the placing of a sort of thimble on his left thumb .
This could easily conceal a tiny neodymium magnet more than sufficient to deflect the compass as shown .
You ’ll notice that Geller – at first – very purposefully waves his hands over the compass several times , showing that it does n’t budge .
Then he makes the “ thimble ” move , and immediately after that , the compass reacts to his left hand .
Mind you , he can have such a tiny – 4 mm diameter – magnet , concealed anywhere – in his mouth , behind his ear , taped to his hand with flesh - colored adhesive tape , or on his knee underneath a table at which he sits !
Folks , we used to do this trick at summer camp to fool the newcomers .
It ’s a very tired old trick , but one of the half - dozen that constitute the Geller routine .
The day following a Geller appearance on American TV , on “ The View ” in January of 2000 , I was a guest .
I duplicated this simple trick for the hosts .
See www.randi.org/jr/01-26-2000.html.
Another correspondent wrote :
This is just to let you know that Keshet , the company airing Geller 's current show , asked ( and got ) YouTube to remove the magnet - compass clip .
Here 's the story ( though in Hebrew ) saying Geller feels he got caught and is embarrassed by the whole thing .
It ’s at www.nrg.co.il/online/4/ART1/529/517.html.
I must mention that Ms. Pelled has demanded that I reveal the identities of those magicians who have contacted me , particularly those within her country .
I refuse to do so ; we already know how litigious Mr. Geller is .
This lady insists that I have the story all wrong , but gives no details .
Methinks she has created a monster , and cannot control it …
Her latest declaration seems to indicate that she ’s abandoned support of Geller , though .
She now says that ( a ) the contestants on the TV show are regular magicians without any “ special ” powers , and that Geller himself is a magician !
Just what is her opinion , please ?
Through a close friend with connections in Israel , I obtained a translation of the newspaper story :
Some kind of ban
All around the world a ban might be declared on Israeli magicians .
The reason : an attack by the well - known magician James Randi on Uri Geller and the president of the magician 's committee in Israel .
" He 's doing manipulations , I find it hard to believe the president of the committee believes all the spoon bending "
Sunday , January 14 , 2007 .
Magicians around the world are starting to lose their patience .
The spoon bending mind tricks done by Uri Geller in his show , especially the cooperation he 's getting from the magicians committee , made one of the most senior magicians in the world take action against the Israeli magicians .
Well known magician James Randi , now an accounted world known trickery revealer within the “ paranormal " field , has aggressively attacked Israeli magic committee president Dahlia Pelled .
This , following the cooperation between Geller and the committee which provided most of the contestants in his show " Uri Geller looking for an heir . "
" I find it hard to believe a magicians committee 's president believes all the spoon bending and compass moving Geller does .
If she believes that , she should be directed to children 's magic books .
But if she understands this is trickery , I find that her behavior is unethical and harmful to the profession of magic , ” stated Randi .
Lately there were a few investigations revealing Geller 's contestants and Geller himself using optical tricks and simple magician tricks , to create an illusion of super powers .
Although this is known , committee members competing in the show continue to deny the claim they are magicians and state that all things done by them are done by " Kabala powers , " " Chinese medicine , " and " special abilities . "
" Uri Geller insists on saying he has super powers , " says Randi , " and now he is manipulating the Israeli public , with support from the Israeli magicians committee .
Pelled 's support of Geller and the mythology around him , worries us a lot .
This is n't just something over nothing .
Belief in paranormal powers created a world of ignorance , poverty and sometimes even sickness and death .
“ Is the Israeli magicians committee 's president willing to take part in such deceit ? " rages Randi .
Dahlia Pelled says she got an angry letter from Randi , but she claims he only heard one side of the story .
" He really over - reacted .
All the details he claimed are untrue .
He got a very one - sided , distorted picture , " she said .
Another well - known American magician said , " coming from Randi , this could be a deadly blow for the relations between the Israeli magicians committee and the rest of the magicians .
No respected magician would dare to associate his name with this committee . "
He added that " the names of the people participating in the show have already been marked by magicians committees as names to be banned and outcast from the international magic industry . "
Israel 's magic committee said " the committee hopes and believes this is an entertainment show , and things shown on that show are not being done by paranormal powers . "
That is a strange statement indeed , since Geller says he ’s the real thing …
I must comment : I cannot imagine any possible “ ban ” on Israeli magicians resulting from this fuss , nor am I “ against the Israeli magicians ” in any way .
I just believe that they are being poorly represented .

On James Randi , By Eran Swissa
The acclaimed magician that took Uri Geller down .
James Randi is one of the most important magicians of the last century .
Randi's name is known all over the world not only as an influential magician , but also as the first man to uncover Uri Geller 's tricks .
Randi is the one who killed Geller 's career in the USA , when he set him up on Johnny Carson 's famous show .
Following that show Geller had to shift his career to England , where he resides until today .
Randi also wrote many books , one of which is the best seller " The Truth about Uri Geller , " where he revealed his secrets .
James Randi is today identified with authenticity and integrity all over the world , both for the world of magic , and the world of science and academia .
He nurtured many of the world 's most famous magicians , for instance " Penn and Teller " , who are considered his followers .
And finally , from Ma’ariv newspaper :
Uri Geller bends YouTube – again
A clip showing Uri Geller wearing a magnet on his finger in order to move a marine compass was removed from YouTube at Keshet 's request .
January 11 , 2007
A clip from Uri Geller 's show was removed from YouTube 's site after Keshet contacted them .
In the clip Geller is spotted putting on his finger an object known in the magic world as a “ magnetic fingertip ” in order to move a marine compass , while claiming it is done by the power of thought and with the help of the crowd .
The clip still appears in Keshet 's website " The Bath . "
Web surfers from Israel and around the world who wanted to watch the clip in the last few days discovered that the site 's administration told them the clip was removed at Keshet 's request , since they owned the rights to the clip .
The clip caused a massive media racket .
In Raffi Reshef 's show the clip was shown and Reshef called it " the most embarrassing moment of his career . "
According to different publications , this is n't the first time embarrassing Geller clips have been removed from YouTube .
A candid camera clip showing Geller bending a spoon with simple arm action was also removed from that site on Geller 's request .
One of the surfers told NRG - Ma'ariv : " I wonder why Keshet asked to have that clip removed from such an international site .
They could have a lot of publicity from around the world on viewing of its programs , maybe they are n't interested because this successful format would seem like a bunch of tricks .
We are talking about a site with many different clips from all around the world .
Asking to remove a clip from such a site is very unique .
Anyhow there 's nothing to worry about , as a simple Google query with the words ‘ Uri Geller caught ’ will find the famous clip under many sites . "
A source close to the production told NRG - Ma'ariv : " the magnet - on - thumb revelation was traumatic for him .
Geller is currently trying to do business as usual , but even he knows there 's a true problem with public confidence in him . "
Keshet responded : " Any content taken from ' Keshet ' programming can be found in ' Keshet 's ' site . "
Uri Geller 's response was unavailable .
Meanwhile , in the email Ms. Pelled sends to friends , she says " What Randi has done is great for our society 's PR . "
She exults to members , " I am now being invited to TV shows and interviews everywhere .
I am very happy about this article ! "
Happiness is fleeting …

Our good friend Michael Feldman sent us this interesting quotation from a letter Thomas Jefferson sent to John Adams in 1816 :

THOSE CHALLENGE CHANGES
Regarding the announced changes to the JREF Challenge rules , I should mention that any would - be applicants who cannot – yet – meet the “ media ” and “ academic validation ” criteria are eligible to take the preliminary stage of the JREF test procedure by contacting their nearest skeptics group .
Just put the group in touch with the JREF so that a protocol for a test can be negotiated and agreed upon .
There are also skeptical organizations around the world who offer their own – rather lesser !
– prizes .
The JREF will be happy to provide a local group contact for any such potential applicant .
We ’ve had much strong and favorable input regarding the proposed changes , and the general opinion is that the new arrangement will better promote our stated goals , as well as those of education about critical thinking , and will provide a more visible and active public profile for skepticism .
ALL IN THE MIND
Reader John MacDonald in Dubai , UAE , writes :
I think this article ( see below ) from the on-line Glasgow Herald will interest you – and Swift readers .
It illustrates quite clearly why believers in homeopathy , magnets , crystals and allied quackery sincerely claim benefits from the “ treatment . ”
It 's all in the mind , even if the “ remedy ” per se is totally ineffectual .
I have had some personal experience of this .
A few years ago I was involved in the marketing of new medication for erectile dysfunction .
At the clinical trials stage , as many as 25 % of the control group receiving dummy pills reported " excellent results " !
Astonishing .
I can therefore understand why homeopathy has so many praise - singers .
They believe it works , and therefore it does .
The Herald article illustrates how the reverse is also true : believe that something will do you damage , and it will .
Even if it is innocuous and harmless .
Randi comments : John , it would be more correct to say , “ They believe it works , and therefore they experience relief from symptoms . ”
It ’s the old question : “ Do you want to only feel better , or do you want to actually be better ? ”
John continues :
You and Swift do an excellent job in promoting reason , but how can we counter the frailties of a brain where logic does not function ?
What angers me is how this human fallibility is cynically exploited by quacks for financial gain .
Here is an excerpt from the Glasgow Herald article :
Is your pain a trick of the mind ?
… a group of Australians took part in a medical trial to see what effects steroids have on the body .
As expected , many volunteers found they experienced the familiar side - effects of steroids – acne and bouts of ill - temper , known as “ ' roid ” rage .
But when the study organizers looked more closely , they made a surprising discovery .
Many members of the control group – who , unwittingly , had been taking a dummy pill instead of steroids – experienced the same unpleasant side - effects of anger and skin complaints .
What the mind expects , it often gets .
This phenomenon is known as the " nocebo effect . "
Nocebo is placebo's evil twin .
With the placebo effect , the expectation that something will make us [ feel ] better means that it does .
With the nocebo effect , the belief that something will make us ill actually does make us poorly .
For example , in a study in Naples , patients were given a dummy pill and asked to report whether it made them feel ill .
Amazingly , 27 % said they experienced side - effects such as itching , malaise and headaches .
This was not a freak result .
On average , 25 % of patients who receive any medical treatment will experience unwarranted psychologically induced symptoms of pain or illness .
As a result of the nocebo effect , millions of pounds are spent on changing drug prescriptions every year .
It also undermines the healing process : patients recover from surgery more slowly if they go into an operation expecting there will be adverse side - effects .
The rise in allergies and food intolerances is another example : an astonishing one in five of us now believes that eating wheat or dairy products makes us feel bloated .
This may all sound like hypochondria , but psychological illnesses are not to be underestimated .
The symptoms that sufferers experience are real and often extremely unpleasant .
Treating illness like this has always been impossible , because the biology behind it has been elusive .
But now Italian researchers believe they have discovered the source of the nocebo effect .
Fabrizio Benedetti of the University of Turin has discovered a chemical in the brain that turns anxiety into pain …
The Glasgow Herald web site has the entire story …
SENSITIVE SNAKES REVISITED
Reader Michael K. Watters of Valparaiso University remarks on the item at www.randi.org/jr/2007-01/010507phil.html#i6, saying :
My wife lived in Seattle when St. Helens [ volcano ] blew its top .
She had guinea pigs at the time and tells me that the little fellas went totally berserk in their cage shortly before they heard the blast .
From her description , they must have lost it after the mountain blew , but before the sound of the explosion reached Seattle .
That ’s certainly consistent with the “ low - frequency vibrations in the Earth ” notion you mention since those waves travel much faster than sound .
I also seem to recall that following the recent tsunami there were stories of many of animals moving away from the ocean before the waves hit .
I suppose while I think the premise with the snakes is plausible , I would strongly suspect that the amount of warning time would be pretty minor at best .
Maybe enough time to run out of the house , but not soon enough to evacuate an office building .
Well , I ’m told that guinea pigs and snakes get on very well , for a short time , at least – but I ’m not about to set up a zoo to test this matter .
I ’ve enough trouble with the bees , possums , woodpeckers , raccoons , mice , termites , and other wild critters that eat up my home …
IN CONCLUSION …
As you read this , I ’ll be in Las Vegas in the company of the Shallenbergers , Hal Bidlack , Jeff Wagg , Scott Romanowski , the Hursts , the Feldmans , the JREF Volunteer Team , and so many others who make it all possible .
We ’ll of course have a full report for readers .
Some 779 registrants will be there , along with Todd Robbins , Jamy Ian Swiss , Banachek , Penn & Teller , one or more MythBusters – Adam Savage for sure , that mystical pair from South Park – Matt and Trey , Eugenie Scott , NPR ’s Peter Sagal , Neil Gershenfeld , Lori Lipman Brown , Margaret Downey , Robert Todd Carroll , Diane Swanson , Ray Hall herding his paper - presenters , Scott Dikkers from The Onion , John Rennie from Scientific American , Christopher Hitchens , the irrepressible Julia Sweeney and Jill Sobule , Phil Plait & Richard Wiseman , Nick Gillespie of Reason , the unique Jerry Andrus , and – of course !
– Michael Shermer .
How I got to have so many good friends to gather in one place to celebrate the JREF , I just cannot figure .
It only remains to see if we have the same happy proportion of male / female , young / old , and student / teacher that we ’ve come to expect .
This is a mix that makes the TAM projects so unique and valuable , in my opinion .
Next week …?
Somebody finally did a serious Bush impeachment poll .
Here ’s a summary - more details at original site http://www.afterdowningstreet.org/?q=node/3528:
Poll : Americans Favor Bush ’s Impeachment If He Lied about Iraq Submitted by davidswanson on Tue , 2005 - 10 - 11 12:46 .
Media
NOTE WELL : The After Downing Street Coalition hired Ipsos Public Affairs to do this poll .
Ipsos did not sponsor the poll , but was very helpful , cooperative , and professional .
Please do NOT complain to them that they did not do the poll for free .
If you feel you must communicate with them , please thank them for being helpful .
For Immediate Release : October 11 , 2005
Poll : Americans Favor Bush ’s Impeachment If He Lied about Iraq
By a margin of 50 % to 44 % , Americans want Congress to consider impeaching President Bush if he lied about the war in Iraq , according to a new poll commissioned by AfterDowningStreet.org , a grassroots coalition that supports a Congressional investigation of President Bush ’s decision to invade Iraq in 2003 .
The poll was conducted by Ipsos Public Affairs , the highly - regarded non-partisan polling company .
The poll interviewed 1,001 U.S. adults on October 6 - 9 .
The poll found that 50 % agreed with the statement :
“ If President Bush did not tell the truth about his reasons for going to war with Iraq , Congress should consider holding him accountable by impeaching him . ” 44 % disagreed , and 6 % said they did n’t know or declined to answer .
The poll has a +/- 3.1 % margin of error .
Among those who felt strongly either way , 39 % strongly agreed , while 30 % strongly disagreed .
“ The results of this poll are truly astonishing , ” said AfterDowningStreet.org co-founder Bob Fertik .
“ Bush ’s record - low approval ratings tell just half of the story , which is how much Americans oppose Bush ’s policies on Iraq and other issues .
But this poll tells the other half of the story - that a solid plurality of Americans want Congress to consider removing Bush from the White House . ”
Impeachment Supported by Majorities of Many Groups
Responses varied by political party affiliation : 72 % of Democrats favored impeachment , compared to 56 % of Independents and 20 % of Republicans .
Responses also varied by age and income .
Solid majorities of those under age 55 ( 54 % ) , as well as those with household incomes below $ 50,000 ( 57 % ) , support impeachment .
Majorities favored impeachment in the Northeast ( 53 % ) , West ( 51 % ) , and even the South ( 50 % ) .
Support for Impeachment Surged Since June
The Ipsos poll shows a dramatic transformation in support for Bush ’s impeachment since late June .
( This is only the second poll that has asked Americans about their support for impeaching Bush in 2005 , despite his record - low approval ratings . )
The Zogby poll conducted June 27 - 29 of 905 likely voters found that 42 % agreed and 50 % disagreed with a statement virtually identical to the one used by Ipsos Public Affairs .

After the June poll , pollster John Zogby told the Washington Post that support for impeachment “ was much higher than I expected . ”
At the time , impeachment supporters trailed opponents by 8 % .
Now supporters outnumber opponents by 6 % , a remarkable shift of 14 % .
Support for Clinton Impeachment Was Much Lower
In August and September of 1998 , 16 major polls asked about impeaching President Clinton ( http://democrats.com/clinton-impeachment-polls).
Only 36 % supported hearings to consider impeachment , and only 26 % supported actual impeachment and removal .
Even so , the impeachment debate dominated the news for months , and the Republican Congress impeached Clinton despite overwhelming public opposition .
Impeachment Support is Closely Related to Belief that Bush Lied about Iraq Both the Ipsos and Zogby polls asked about support for impeachment if Bush lied about the reasons for war , rather than asking simply about support for impeachment .
Pollsters predict that asking simply about impeachment without any context would produce a large number of “ I do n’t know ” responses .
However , this may understate the percentage of Americans who favor Bush ’s impeachment for other reasons , such as his slow response to Hurricane Katrina , his policy on torture , soaring gasoline prices , or other concerns .

The cell phone ’s alarm fills the dark hotel room with a plastic rendition of Edvard Grieg ’s “ In the Hall of the Mountain King ” – a tune befitting the obscenely early hour that we ’ve chosen to rise .
“ No wonder they rule the world , they go to work at four in the morning , ” says my groggy friend Jenny , with whom I ’m sharing an 18th floor room at the Tropicana ’s Island tower overlooking the Las Vegas airport .
Jenny is in town working on a project about Vegas ’ booming real estate market .
I ’m attending a conference for retired CIA reconnaissance pilots and crews .
In the mornings and evenings , we ’re using high - powered optics to observe and photograph the movements of one of Las Vegas ’ more obscure institutions : a small fleet of aircraft that call a cordoned - off terminal on the west side of the airport home .
This terminal has a code name : “ Gold Coast . ”
The aircraft we ’re watching change their military call sign every month , but in civilian airspace they call themselves “ Janets . ”
Their raison d’être is to shuttle workers living in Las Vegas to and from a collection of secret military bases in the expansive Nellis Range to the north .
These bases are part of a hidden military geography that is known in military and defense industry circles as the “ black world . ”
This morning , we ’ve risen at an unholy hour in an attempt to glimpse the first flights of the day .
When military or defense - industry workers , managers , and trade journalists speak about the “ black world ” ( and they really do use that phrase ) , they ’re referring to all of the programs , projects , people , and places involved with highly secret military programs paid for out of the “ black budget ” – the portion of the defense budget classified from the public .
Some of these “ black ” programs are so highly classified their very existence is a state secret .
For public purposes , they “ do not exist . ”
And the totality of these “ black ” programs is what defense - insiders are talking about when they refer to the “ black world . ”
The postwar Southwest cannot be meaningfully separated from the “ Military Industrial Complex ” dollars that have sculpted its landscape .
And just as the defense budget had a subset of “ black ” line - items , the military landscapes of the Southwest have their own “ black ” spaces .
Vast desert military ranges are home to a number of Air Force bases and other installations exclusively dedicated to these sorts of “ black ” or “ nonexistent ” projects .
For example , there ’s the Tonopah Test Range near the central Nevada town of Tonopah , which was built in the late 1970s and early 1980s to house a squadron of stolen Soviet MiGs , and to serve as a home base for the ultra - secret “ stealth fighter . ”
There ’s the enigmatic installation at Groom Lake , Nevada known as “ Area 51 , ” which was originally built to house the CIA ’s U - 2 spy plane in the 1950s , and which has been expanding ever since .
There are other obscure bases like the Tolicha Peak Electronic Combat Range , about which there is extremely little publicly available information .
A landing strip called “ Base Camp ” near Warm Springs , where both Janet planes and CIA aircraft have been spotted .
When one begins to count the number of obscure military installations lurking in the recesses of the Nevada desert , an entire “ black world ” does indeed seem to appear , albeit fleetingly .
From their daily departures out of Las Vegas and other cities to the hidden recesses of the Military Industrial Complex , the Janet fleet ’s flight plans trace the outlines of this “ black world . ”
The Janet planes are a solution to a weird question : how does the “ black world , ” filled with places that “ you ca n’t get to from here ” interact with the “ white world ” on an everyday basis ?
Indeed , how does one get there from here ?
The Janets inhabit the strange and contradictory space built into the structure of such questions .
They are a perpetually provisional attempt to smooth over the contradictions in terms .
As a bridge between the “ black ” and “ white ” worlds of military activities , the Janets inhabit an in - between space that does not belong to either .
Their flights trace the borders of their “ black world ” destinations , making invisible connections , relationships , and networks obvious even as the nature or purpose of those connections remains obscure .
Thus , the Janets embody a contradiction at the heart of the Pentagon ’s “ black world ” : even though the programs and installations which constitute this world are designed to be completely hidden or to “ not exist , ” the “ black world ” like the rest of the world , is composed of matter .
One of the physical properties of matter is that it is visible .
The “ black world , ” in other words , must exist somewhere .
The Janets tell us , in real time , how the spatial logics of the “ black world ” are produced and reproduced every day .
Beginning very , very early each morning .
When Dr. James Baker returned from the first Gulf War in 1991 , his University of Michigan colleagues must have assumed the medical researcher 's head had sustained a direct Scud missile hit .
The good doctor came home with some pretty wacky ideas .
Here was one of them : Instead of using live viruses to destroy diseased cells , why not send in man-made , nanoscale molecules with tiny tendrils that scientists could engineer to battle specific types of cancers ?
Remember , this was the early '90s .
Few had even heard of the internet , much less " nanotechnology , " which was then firmly the domain of futurists , and certainly not on the radar of respectable beaker slingers .
" In fact , there was a lot of derision at NIH ( National Institutes of Health ) that this was not real science , " Baker recalls .
" But as it became clear that gene therapy was not going anywhere without different approaches , I think the reality of , the necessity of , bioengineering in this process became clear . "
Today , the National Cancer Institute is on its way to becoming a Nano Cancer Institute as it prepares to spend $ 144.3 million over five years on the engineered nanoparticles " approach " that Baker and just a few others had championed more than a decade ago .
As for Baker , he 's doing rather well in his corner office at the Center for Biologic Nanotechnology with a panoramic view of downtown Ann Arbor , Michigan .
Baker had been involved in the Army 's first attempts at DNA delivery of the adeno vaccine to combat acute respiratory illness among the troops .
He found that not only was the body 's immune system fighting off the viral - based vaccine , but the entire works were coming to " hard stops " at 150 nanometers .
Things just did not get into cells very effectively beyond that .
It seemed clear to Baker that engineered nanoparticles would have to become part of the solution if they wanted to really chase after the bad guys in the body .
" If we now want to fix the dysfunction of cells that lead to most of the diseases that we 're currently fighting , we have to engineer at the same scale as the cells , " Baker says .
That 's the problem that was swirling around in Baker 's head after the Gulf War .
He was n't the only scientist working on it , but he did have one advantage .
He 's located just 100 miles south of a nanotech pioneer : former Dow chemist Donald Tomalia , who had invented a type of particle called dendrimers .
Tomalia realized – unfortunately about two decades before the rest of the world – that his man-made , tendriled molecule could be used in targeted drug delivery .
Tomalia saw that Baker was one of the few scientists at the time who also saw the possibilities within these sticky little nanothings .
" He was a medical guy who could understand this , " Tomalia says .
" I think he very quickly began to realize the important implications that dendrimers would have . "
All through the mid- and late '90s , Baker and Tomalia quietly experimented with these particles .
A synthetic chemist and a medical researcher made for an odd couple at the time .
Lack of cooperation and understanding between the scientific disciplines is one of the toughest challenges facing nanotech researchers .
Cooperation may sound simple to those outside the academic world , but cross - disciplinary collaboration is not the way universities have traditionally been organized .
U.S. National Nanotechnology
Initiative officials often talk about " converging technologies , " that is , connecting all the sciences – physics , chemistry , biology , information technology – and making connections as all these disciplines converge at the nanoscale .
That 's the thinking behind the University of Michigan 's new Nanotechnology Institute for Medicine and the Biological Sciences , which Baker will head .
" I think any university that does n't develop collaborative centers like this is going to be frozen out , " he says .
The convergence of the sciences at Michigan has led to dramatic success of late .
Baker 's lab recently received a $ 6.3 million Gates Foundation grant to develop hepatitis B vaccines that can be delivered through the nose , rather than by needle .
They will be able to survive outside a refrigerator , making them easier to use in developing nations .
And a breakthrough announced in late June heralded a new kind of cancer therapy that acts as a kind of " Trojan horse , " infiltrating cancer - cell receptors then turning the cancer against itself .
" I think one of the things that 's really important is we actually can , for the first time , show that something injected not only gets into the cancer tumor , but actually gets into the cancer cells themselves , " Baker says .
" This is very important for both diagnosis and therapy . "
The next challenge is getting any of this through the FDA , which is at once under pressure to speed up new drug approvals for an aging population , and to slow down the process in light of recent scandals involving bad side effects .
" Celebrex , Vioxx , all of these drugs that popped up here recently with problems , are whole - body administered – they go everywhere , " Tomalia says .
" They think they know where they have gone in all minute detail , and they think they know every enzyme and every receptor site , but you never really quite know . "
The best - case scenario , Baker says , is nanotech - enabled cancer therapy in your doctors ' office within five years .
But that 's assuming an accelerated approval process , being pushed by nanotech advocates , which is by no means a foregone conclusion .
Left to the normal FDA process , it could be a decade or more .
The ultimate goal :
The extinction of cancer through early detection .
Baker is optimistic .
" We 've all got relatives or friends who have died from this , " he says .
" The therapy is almost worse than the disease . "
If nothing else , perhaps the end of painful chemotherapy is in sight .
" If we can make the therapy nontoxic ... then that 's much more practical . "

Transplanted neural stem cells hold promise for reducing the destruction of dopaminergic cells that occurs in Parkinson 's disease and for replacing cells lost to the disease , scientists say .
Research published in the current issue of The Journal of Neuroscience shows a human neural stem cell transplant essentially enables an animal model for Parkinson ’s to continue functioning normally rather than displaying the progressive loss of movement control that characterizes the disease .
" We are very cautious but to us , it ’s an indication that stem cells have promise for Parkinson ’s disease , " says Dr. Cesario V. Borlongan , neuroscientist at the Medical College of Georgia and corresponding author of the study .
Transplants were done shortly after a neurotoxin was used to destroy neurons that make dopamine , a neurotransmitter key to movement control , Dr. Borlongan notes .
This would be equivalent to a patient getting treatment very early in the disease process , which rarely happens since there is no screening test to catch it early .
" Right now we are saying if you are able to identify Parkinson ’s in the early stage , we think this therapy will work .
An important question that remains is , ‘ Can we rescue neurons that are dying from Parkinson ’s " ’
This would more accurately mimic what patients need . "
The researchers already have begun studies that delay the transplants until weeks after injury .
For this study , researchers compared animals that received placebo treatment with those that received only protective neurotrophic factors secreted by stem cells and those that had a transplant .
Animals that received transplants essentially regained control of their movement , placebo - treated animals did not recover and those that received neurotrophic factors , called stem cell factors , recovered partially .
When researchers examined the brains one month after transplant – a long time in the two - year life of a rat - researchers found endogenous dopaminergic cells and transplanted neural stem cells had both survived .
Also , transplanted neural cells had formed synapses to communicate with each other and ultimately the striatum , the portion of the brain dopaminergic cells act on to control movement .
" When we looked at the transplanted stem cells , they had survived , had differentiated into neurons and showed some connection with the host tissue , " says Dr. Borlongan .
They did additional studies in test tubes , taking commercially available rat and human dopaminergic cells , exposing them to neurotoxins and then to stem cell factors .
Stem cell factor protected cells in a dose - dependent fashion .
" The more stem cell factor , the better the protection , " Dr. Borlongan says .
When the cells were co-cultured with stem cells , protection was further increased .
When they used an antibody to block the stem cell factor , neuro - protection was significantly reduced .
" This again shows a combination of factors at work , " says Dr. Borlongan .
" It ’s a synergistic effect . "
He ’s now following rats with transplants for six months to see if the early protection / recovery holds up ; he ’s already past the three - month mark and to date , recovery is stable .
While the rats needed immunosuppression because they received human cells , Dr. Borlongan says humans would not .
About a half - million Americans have Parkinson ’s disease .
Typically the disease does a lot of damage to dopaminergic cells before it becomes symptomatic .
Although Parkinson ’s is associated with abnormal movement , such as tremors , loss of these cells actually makes it difficult for people to move and , once they move , they ca n’t control the movement , Dr. Borlongan says .
The standard treatment is L - dopa , a synthetic dopamine that tends to minimize symptoms for three to five years .
As the disease progresses and the drug becomes less effective , doses are increased and can produce more dyskinesia , loss of controlled movement .
Centers such as MCG are exploring new ways to slow disease progression , diagnose it earlier and more accurately monitor its progression .

The ability of scientists to improve health and disease management of cattle and enhance the nutritional value of beef and dairy products has received a major boost with the release this week of the most complete sequence of the cow genome ever assembled .
Developed by an international consortium of research organisations , including CSIRO and AgResearch New Zealand , the new bovine sequence contains 2.9 billion DNA base pairs and incorporates one - third more data than earlier versions .
Differences in just one of these base pairs ( known as single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs ) can affect the functioning of a gene and mean the difference between a highly productive and a poorly performing animal .
Over two million of these SNPs , which are genetic signposts or markers , were identified as part of the project .
Australia 's representative on the US $ 53 million Bovine Genome Sequencing Project , CSIRO 's Dr Ross Tellam , says the new map marks the end of the sequencing phase of the project , with the focus now on analysing the available data .
" This is very valuable information , " Dr Tellam says .
" We could potentially achieve as much improvement in cattle breeding and production in 50 years as we have over the last 8000 years of traditional farming . "
Cattle geneticists will use the bovine genome as a template to highlight genetic variation within and between cattle breeds , and between cattle and other mammal species .
The head of bioinformatics research at CSIRO Livestock Industries , Dr Brian Dalrymple , says the new data is very valuable because it provides researchers with a more complete picture of the genes in a cow and how variations in the DNA code influence desirable production traits .
" We can use this data to identify those genes that are involved in important functions like lactation , reproduction , muscling , growth rate and disease resistance , " Dr Dalrymple says .
The Hereford breed was selected for the bulk of the sequencing project , which began in December 2003 .
Holstein , Angus , Jersey , Limousin , Norwegian Red and Brahman animals were also sequenced to detect specific genetic differences between breeds .
" This is just the beginning of a revolution in the way we produce our animals and food , " Dr Dalrymple says .
" Once we have a complete set of genes that influence tenderness , for example , we will be able to predict that animals of a certain type , fed a particular type of pasture or grain , will consistently produce meat of a particular standard of tenderness and marbling . "
He says , despite the centuries of inbreeding involved in developing different cattle breeds , most maintain a " surprisingly large " degree of genetic diversity .

[ Debian - haskell ] Linspire / Freespire Core OS Team and Haskell
The OS team at Linspire , Inc. would like to announce that we are standardizing on Haskell as our preferred language for core OS development .
We are redoing a bunch of our infrastructure using Haskell as our common standard language .
Our first task is redoing our Debian package builder ( aka autobuilder ) in Haskell .
Other tools such as ISO builders , package dependency checkers are in progress .
The goal is to make a really tight simple set of tools that will let developers contribute to Freespire , based on Debian tools whenever possible .
Our hardware detector , currently in OCaml , is on the block to be rewritten as well .
There are four of us using Haskell , all CCed on this message .
All of us have been using functional languages for quite some time .
At Linspire , our choices have been OCaml and Haskell .
David
Fox wrote the hardware detector in OCaml and is now porting it to Haskell .
Jeremy
Shaw has been doing various utilities in Haskell for several years .
Sean Meiners recently wrote an application for managing his recipe collection and is now hooked .
I am porting our CD build procedure from OCaml to Haskell .
We are interested in many other uses of Haskell .
The recent discussion about Haskell as a shell interests greatly , for example , as we have all suffered through years of bash code .
We 'd also like to make some Haskell bindings for Qt and KDE , though at the moment we do n't have a good plan to tackle that problem efficiently .
To date , Linspire ( formerly Lindows ) has focused on polishing Linux for the consumer market .
I mentioned Freespire , above .
We announced Freespire recently ( www.freespire.org).
Essentially it is a more open , developer friendly version of Linspire .
http://freespire.org/about/vision and http://freespire.org/support/faqs have good overviews .
Access through apt , open - source CNR client and many other good things .
I mention Freespire because some of our colleagues were concerned that using Haskell would isolate us from the larger community of developers and make it hard to find new employees skilled in Haskell , should we need to .
From our perspective , functional programming makes us more effective and we think that getting even a few people who know Haskell hacking with us is a better combination than lots of Perl and bash .
I 'm not sure I expect anyone on this list to disagree , but still I 'd love to hear your thoughts on the subject .
Also , Linspire is based on Debian .
We 've talked a little with John Goerzen who announced his missingH library here a while back .
We 've imported it and expect to pass updates back to him as well as any other libraries and tools that he would be interested in includng in the Debian archive .
Also , it seems there are quite a few other libraries out there which are either not debianized or stale , but perhaps that is because I have n't fully caught up with what people on this list have done .
If there is n't a cron job running somewhere that updates an archive with Cabalized libraries and apps , we would like to help set one up .
I will be at Debconf from Sunday , May 14 through Tuesday evening .
If anyone on this list is there , I would love to chat and see how we can help each other .

About three - quarters of the world ’s corals could be in grave danger ( Image : Denis Goulet / MEPS )
Three - quarters of the world ’s coral reefs may lack the ability to cope with climate change , despite previous optimistic predictions , according to a new review of coral research .
Earlier studies had demonstrated that some corals are able adapt to warmer water temperatures by forming new , additional symbiotic relationships with algae .
But a new analysis of more than 400 coral species suggests that only one - quarter of them would be able to adapt in this way .
These latest findings add to already bleak predictions for the world ’s coral reefs , which are also threatened by coastal pollution and acidifying oceans .
Stressors such as these cause coral to lose the algae that keep it alive by supplying it with nutrients .
Even a 1 degree rise in temperature can cause the death of this fragile animal .
Some experts have predicted that Australia ’s Great Barrier Reef will lose 95 % of its living coral by 2050 .

However , two studies published in 2004 offered hope that some corals had coped with changing water temperatures by hosting new types of algae .
For example , the corals along the Panama coast that were able to switch from one type of Symbiodinium algae , known as clade C , to another one called clade D .
These corals survived the particularly devastating 1997 - 1998 El Niño event – a recurring climate occurrence that causes elevated sea temperatures of up to 5 °C on the longitude line that crosses Peru and Ecuador ( see Corals adapt to cope with global warming ) .
One at a time
Tamar Goulet at the University of Mississippi in the US carried out a review of these two research papers and 41 others to try to understand what proportion of all coral species might possess an ability to switch algae .
She found the only corals documented to be able make this swap are those that can host multiple algae .
And those that can host only one clade , or type , of algae at a time have no such switching ability .
Only 23 % of the 442 coral species included in Goulet ’s research review were able to host more than one clade of algae .
As a result , she suggests that less than one - quarter of coral species may have the ability to adapt to climate change by swapping symbiotic algae .
Without adaptation , coral becomes bleached and dies .
However , Goulet says she does not know the division of species among the world ’s coral reefs : it is possible that adaptable species of coral are more prevalent .
The studies included in Goulet ’s review only covered a small fraction of the 93,000 coral species known to exist .

Lisp is a family of computer programming languages based on formal functional calculus .
Lisp ( for " List Processing Language " ) stores and manipulates programs in the same manner as any other data , making it well suited for " meta - programming " applications .
One of the oldest " high level " programming languages ( second only to Fortran ) , Lisp continues to be popular in the field of artificial intelligence down to the present day .

LISP is now the second oldest programming language in present widespread use ( after FORTRAN ) ...
Its core occupies some kind of local optimum in the space of programming languages given that static friction discourages purely notational changes .
Recursive use of conditional expressions , representation of symbolic information externally by lists and internally by list structure , and representation of program in the same way will probably have a very long life .

One can even conjecture that Lisp owes its survival specifically to the fact that its programs are lists , which everyone , including me , has regarded as a disadvantage .

The conception of list processing as an abstraction created a new world in which designation and dynamic symbolic structure were the defining characteristics .
The embedding of the early list processing systems in languages ( the IPLs , LISP ) is often decried as having been a barrier to the diffusion of list processing techniques throughout programming practice ; but it was the vehicle that held the abstraction together .

Comparing Lisp to other languages [ edit ]
Java was , as Gosling says in the first Java white paper , designed for average programmers .
It 's a perfectly legitimate goal to design a language for average programmers .
( Or for that matter for small children , like Logo . )
But it is also a legitimate , and very different , goal to design a language for good programmers .

Greenspun 's Tenth Rule :
Any sufficiently complicated C or Fortran program contains an ad hoc informally - specified bug - ridden slow implementation of half of Common Lisp .
Philip Greenspun , as quoted in Paul Graham , Hackers & Painters : Big Ideas from the Computer Age ( O' Reilly : 2004 ) , ISBN 0596006624 , p. 198 Greenspun indicates on his website that he does not recall where he originally wrote this , and laments in correspondence ( 2003 ) that this quip may be all that posterity remembers of him .

C is coupled with Unix in the worse - is - better scenario , and can anyone seriously propose Lisp as the right - thing alternative ?
Lisp , face it , is used for advanced research and development in AI and other esoteric areas .
It has weird syntax , and almost all other computer languages share a non-Lispy syntax .

Lisp macros [ edit ]
DOLIST is similar to Perl 's foreach or Python 's for .
Java added a similar kind of loop construct with the " enhanced " for loop in Java 1.5 , as part of JSR - 201 .
Notice what a difference macros make .
A Lisp programmer who notices a common pattern in their code can write a macro to give themselves a source - level abstraction of that pattern .
A Java programmer who notices the same pattern has to convince Sun that this particular abstraction is worth adding to the language .
Then Sun has to publish a JSR and convene an industry - wide " expert group " to hash everything out .
That process -- according to Sun -- takes an average of 18 months .
After that , the compiler writers all have to go upgrade their compilers to support the new feature .
And even once the Java programmer 's favorite compiler supports the new version of Java , they probably still can't use the new feature until they 're allowed to break source compatibility with older versions of Java .
So an annoyance that Common Lisp programmers can resolve for themselves within five minutes plagues Java programmers for years .

Attitude of Lisp programmers [ edit ]
Common Lisp people seem to behave in a way that is akin to the Borg : they study the various new things that people do with interest and then find that it was eminently doable in Common Lisp all along and that they can use these new techniques if they think they need them .

Parentheses [ edit ]
Although my own previous enthusiasm has been for syntactically rich languages like the Algol family , I now see clearly and concretely the force of Minsky 's 1970 Turing lecture , in which he argued that Lisp 's uniformity of structure and power of self reference gave the programmer capabilities whose content was well worth the sacrifice of visual form .

Text Processing using LaTeX
TeX is a powerful text processing language and is the required format for some periodicals now .
TeX has many macros to which you can eventually add your own .
LaTeX is a macro package which sits on top of TeX and provides all the structuring facilities to help with writing large documents .
Automated chapter and section macros are provided , together with cross referencing and bibliography macros .
LaTeX tends to take over the style decisions , but all the benefits of plain TeX are still present when it comes to doing maths .
The Why LaTeX ? page discusses LaTeX 's strengths / weaknesses .
On CUED 's central system you can run latex from the command line using latex or pdflatex .
We also have Kile and Lyx
There are numerous " add- ons " for LaTeX .
Some ( enumerate and fancyhdr ) slightly enhance existing features , others provide extensive new functionality .
The TeX and LaTeX Catalogue describes packages available elsewhere .
See the Configuring LaTeX document if you intend to install many packages .
CUED users can access the current university identifiers ( crests ) using \includegraphics {BWUni3.eps} or \includegraphics {CUni3.eps} on our linux servers .
These should only be used in their original sizes .
General
Note that the " front- end " ( the program with an editor , buttons and menus ) and the LaTeX files may well be separately distributed .
If you install texmaker , for example , it will assume that you 've already downloaded the latex system .
wvLaTeX is installed ( Word to LaTeX ) .
OpenOffice has an option to export Word files as LaTeX
There 's a list of RTF / Word / WP - LaTeX - converters online .
With Kile ( installed on our local system - type kile in the Terminal window to start it ) you still need to type LaTeX code , but Kile has many facilities ( templates , wizards , etc ) to make it easier .
You should be able to find what you want in the menus ( for example , the File -> Statistic option gives a word - count , etc ) .
You can print the LaTeX file directly from Kile .
To print the output file you need to use another program .
For example , if you want to create a PDF file you can produce the DVI file , use the Build - > Convert ->DVItoPDF option , then the Build -> View - > ViewPDF option to view the file .
The viewer has a Print option .
lyx is a WYSIWYG front - end for LaTeX that 's getting better all the time .
It 's installed on our teaching system .
Warning : it may not always be easy to convert between LaTeX and lyx formats - use at your own risk !

23/10/06 - Harish Bhanderi's CUED PhD / MPhil Thesis Style
One way to get started with LaTeX is to look at a simple example .
A short document is reproduced below .
Engineering Department users can find a file with a similar structure in / export / Examples / LaTeX/demo0.tex .
Further examples ( a letter , a CV , etc ) are in the same directory .
\documentclass{article} \begin{document} \section {Simple Text} % THIS COMMAND MAKES A SECTION TITLE .
Words are separated by one or more spaces .
Paragraphs are separated by one or more blank lines .
The output is not affected by adding extra spaces or extra blank lines to the input file .
Double quotes are typed like this : ``quoted text '' .
Single quotes are typed like this : `single - quoted text ' .
Long dashes are typed as three dash characters --- like this .
Italic text is typed like this : \textit {this is italic text} .
Bold text is typed like this : \textbf {this is bold text} .
\ subsection {A Warning or Two} % THIS COMMAND MAKES A SUBSECTION TITLE .
If you get too much space after a mid-sentence period --- abbreviations like etc. \ are the common culprits ) --- then type a backslash followed by a space after the period , as in this sentence .
Remember , do n't type the 10 special characters ( such as dollar sign and backslash ) except as directed !
The following seven are printed by typing a backslash in front of them : \$ \& \# \ % \_ \{ and \} .
The manual tells how to make other symbols .
\end {document} % THE INPUT FILE ENDS WITH THIS COMMAND .
Once you have created a LaTeX source file it must be processed by LaTeX before it can be printed out .
On systems that offer a command line you can try the command
pdflatex myfile.tex
while in the same folder as the saved LaTeX file .
It will produce a number of files including myfile.log , myfile.aux and myfile.pdf .
If you are using various sorts of cross referencing then you may have to run LaTeX more than once .
If you want an automated bibliography you will also have to run bibtex .
Security pros question teacher 's conviction
Security experts have voiced concerns this week over a Norwich , Conn . substitute teacher 's conviction on charges that she endangered her pupils when the students saw pornographic pop-ups that appeared on her schoolroom computer .
While prosecutors maintained that the teacher visited pornographic
Web sites while at work and wondered why she did n't just turn off the computer , a forensics expert testified that an innocent hairstyling Web site that the teacher had visited installed spyware on her computer and led to the pop -up pornographic ads , according to an article in the Norwich Bulletin .
Moreover , police investigators apparently did little forensics investigation on the computer and the school did not maintain the security software on the systems that could have prevented the spyware from installing , according to reports on the case .
The possibility that spyware on a PC could lead to jail time had several security experts calling for more investigation .
Moreover , judges , prosecutors and the defendant 's attorney need a better understanding of the technology involved , other experts stated .
" A bad spyware infestation can splatter a machine full of porn pop-ups and its a bit unnerving to think that a teacher could get hard prison time for something that was likely to have been completely innocent , " Alexander Eckelberry , president of antispyware maker Sunbelt Software , stated on the company 's blog .
The firm pledged to aid the defense , if requested .
The " spyware did it " defense is nothing new .
In 2003 , a U.K. resident was cleared of child pornography charges after the court found that his PC had numerous Trojan horse programs installed on it .
Browser hijacking programs have also been blamed for making it seem as if the user had surfed to pornographic Web sites .
In at least once case , a person used open wireless network to surf for child pornography in hopes of escaping detection .
With authorities focusing on cracking down on online offenders of child pornography , more such cases will likely come before the courts .
The Norwich , Conn. teacher is scheduled to be sentenced in early March .

Passionate Users Talk Different
Listen in on a conversation between three airplane pilots , and -- assuming you are n't a pilot - - you might understand 50 % at best .
Listen in on a conversation between three software architects , and even a new programmer might not have a clue .
Snowboarders have their own terms .
So do plumbers , photographers , librarians , ministers , dancers , realtors , musicians , graphic designers , and filmmakers ( best boy ? gaffer ? ) .
But there 's a world of difference between a specialized lexicon of domain - specific terms and buzzwords .
Domain - specific terms compress information , while buzzwords often masquerade as information .
Buzzwords are often ( not always ) semantically empty while specialized domain lexicons are semantically dense .
Domain - specific terms are usually associated with passion , or at least expertise , while buzzwords are often associated with those who might be faking expertise , or who are using them simply to impress others .
ZYZephyr wrote a great post taking me to task for my buzzwords post ranting ( half tongue - in - cheek ) about the 2.0 buzzwords .
He makes all the right points , and I agree with just about everything he said .
Which tells me I did n't make my point , or that he did n't read my previous post about this topic ; )
My problem is not with the use of specialized language .
On the contrary , in my earlier post on this I said ( paraphrasing myself ) :
" When people are passionate ( or even just " into " ) something , they have a shared lexicon that helps dinstinuish them from those who are n't .
Among other things , a shared vocabulary helps experts and professionals get a message across more quickly .
But it also helps build their passion .
Just figuring out the commonly - used phrases , words , names , stories , etc. are part of what gives people a sense of belonging .
A sense of being a part of something special .
A sense of having learned -- and earned -- their way in .
So in this case , exclusionary is n't necessarily a bad thing .
Becoming a part of something new usually is n't that simple , especially if that new thing has real value .
Pick an area where people are truly passionate , and there is virtually always a learning curve that includes new ideas , concepts , skills , knowledge and specialized terms .
Most people have an " I Rule " experience in part because they 've " crossed the chasm " and learned what the hell the experts are talking about . "
Where this whole thing gets interesting is that many of the Web 2.0 buzzwords actually DO - - for some people -- compress and convey rich information .
In other words , while I make a distinction between empty buzzwords and domain - specific terms , sometimes there 's no clear line between the two .
One guy 's Web 2.0 empty buzzword is another one 's meaningful addition to the emerging technology lexicon .
And that brings up the other thing I like about Web 2.0 - - that it has engaged so many people 's minds in actively creating / defining / interpreting the meaning of the ideas , words , and concepts .
Web 2.0 is both ambiguous and meaningful ... but not for everyone .
For many , the words are just useless marketing speak with no there there .
My problem with the Web 2.0 terms is not that they are meaningless .
And my problem is not that they are too complex and should be dumbed down .
My problem is that they are focused on the technology and the business model , rather than focusing on what those things will mean to the end -user .
And when I say " mean to the end - user " , I do n't mean that the end - user cares about the words .
The end - user cares about what WE -- the developers / implementors of Web 2.0 - ish products or services -- are creating for them .
When I say that the Web 2.0 words are n't user - driven , I do n't mean that the users should be driving or even understanding the words .
But if a deep concern for users is n't driving the meaning of these words , we 're in for a flock of crap products and services that implement 2.0 goodness but do nothing to inspire or engage users .
Again , my problem with 2.0 words is not about what they mean , or how consice or confusing they are , as much as about what they 're focused on .
So , back to the " specialized words " thing ... in helping support or build a community of passionate users , I would not discourage specialized lexicons -- even ( or especially ) if that specialized lexicon means separating the newbies from the experts .
That 's as it should be and is part of what adds value to becoming an expert in the first place -- you get to have this rich , complex , efficient communication with others and , yes , you might also consider that a way to show off .
And I am not about to moralize on this one and suggest that wanting to " show off " is a bad thing .
It 's a part of human nature to take pride in how hard we 've worked to learn this much and get this good at something .
It 's human nature to feel good about , well , kicking ass .
Being recognized as an expert is certainly not the main benefit ( or driving motivation ) for becoming passionate about something , but for many people - - it 's a nice little side benefit .
Think about it ... come on , really think about it .
Somewhere in your past ( maybe even within the last 48 hours ) , you 've felt that little ever - so - slightly - I 'm - better - at - this - than - you feeling that came from being able to keep up with a book , speech , or conversation that had words and phrases not known to " the rest of us . " ; )
OK maybe you did n't feel all superior , but you at at least have felt the energy that comes from engaging and communicating at that higher level of complexity .

Kathy , love the post , love the site .
The bit about being user - centered is key .
Not only do people not care about buzzwords , software , or developers , they usually do n't even think about them .
The idea that the average non-designer thinks about design is a figment of the designer 's imagination .
Instead , most people are off solving the mountain of problems that plague their own life .
Here 's an example .
I once saw a person shopping on Gap for a scarf .
I was observing them go through the site , watching them click on this , read that , ignore the other thing , etc .
I was thinking about the designers , the writers , the images , the content providers , all these things .
And so I assumed that the person thought about at least some of this stuff .
There was a problem in checkout , some error having to do with their credit card .
They got frustrated .
Upset . Worried .
I asked a couple questions about what they were thinking , expecting to hear that the user experience was bad , or the designers were n't good , or the checkout system had serious usability issues .
Nope , not even close .
This guy was upset because his girlfriend wanted this scarf , and would n't be able to impress her if he did n't get it for her ...

Kathy ,
This is a great post .
You 're so perceptive about the difference between the words experts use among other experts , and the dreadful buzzcrud people use to try to sound like experts , when they 're nothing of the sort .
Buzzwords are terms drained of all passion and meaning through overuse and misuse .
They become the equivalent of a smokescreen to conceal shoddy thinking and apathy .
That 's why BS is often made up of 90 % buzzcrud ; and why it 's about as interesting as watching your toenails grow .

Kathy ,
Another fabulous post .
How do you do it ?
I loved your comments on Web 2.0 -- and found affirmation for my next column in gotomedia 's " gotoreport " ( not yet online but will appear at http://www.gotomedia.com).
A preview :
" So I ’m going out on a limb to say that Web 2.0 is really about users .
It ’s how developers emerging from cubicle cocoons admit what we user - obsessed sorts have long understood — that users rule .
All that Web 2.0 talk of systems , applications and platforms is ultimately about empowering end -users to achieve their dreams on the Web without restriction . "
It 's no panacea , but if we designers grab the momentum generated by users choosing sites that let them kick ass ( to quote a noteworthy author ) , Web 2.0 might turn out to be more steak than sizzle .

" .. while I make a distinction between empty buzzwords and domain - specific terms , sometimes there 's no clear line between the two . "
The blurry line becomes more clear , I think , if you think separately about each individual usage of a term .
The same word can be used to convey information or to sound impressive , and each usage should be judged separately - is it being used to communicate or mislead ?
I think there are two non-obvious directions you can take this idea :
a) Perhaps it 's all a con game : if you are able to impress your listener you used jargon ; if not , it 's a buzzword ;)
b ) More seriously , it 's jargon if the listener understands you ; if he did not , you just employed an empty buzzword .
Even if your usage did indeed have content .

Amazing post as ususal , it 's a great pleasure to see another new insightful post .
Perhaps my message here is an example of what you describe .
I 've been a newbie user for months of your Creating Passionate Users blog , and finally I feel expert enough to post something .
It 's an interesting phenomenon about wanting to be an expert , wanting to be a leader .
The user wants to be able to say " I rule " .
But over what .
It seems to be a natural part of human psychology to want a more secure position in the herd , and a feeling of " I rule " certainly feels more secure than " I suck " .
Yet perhaps there 's a basic AntiPattern here .
Rather than " I rule " being a side benefit for domain mastery , if it overrides the well being of the domain itself -- lingo and buzzword mastery start just becoming a tool of the AntiPattern , and the domain itself suffers .
A good steward of a domain builds the domain for the value the domain brings to all the users .
A bad steward gains domain mastery for the purpose of compensating for a deep " I suck " feeling somewhere in life , by having an " I rule " feeling over the domain users .
And the only way to do that is to shoot down ( or flame ) the competition !
It seems the greatest movements these days that promote creating passionate users , like this blog , like open source , are more about contribution to a domain , rather than ruling the domain primarily for ego gratification .
People are starting to get wise , emotionally at least , to the empire builders who do n't give a **** about the users , they just want the " I rule " feeling .

I would n't buy something unless I knew how it could help me .
If something was advertised using words like " uses web 2.0 " , I would n't know whether to buy it as this term means different things to different people , and my understanding might be different to that of the suppliers .
If someone says " takes 2 seconds to load each web page instead of 5 " , I would be more impressed .
By all means use domain specific terms when talking to others in your field to save time , but only when these terms are going to be understood by them in a similar way .
Posted by : Richard Jonas | Dec 13 , 2005 10:21:24 AM
I wonder if the distinction between jargon and buzzword hinges around whether the term describes something you want to implement for people , or something you want someone to implement for you ( not quite whether you 're a developer or a marketer but what your investment in the term is ) .
Contribution cultures rather than exploitation cultures .
Fascinating blog BTW - thank you !

Shutting down the Bin Laden unit squandered 10 years of expertise in the war on terror , said Michael Scheuer , who founded the unit in 1995 and arguably knows more about Bin Laden than any other western intelligence official .
He believes the unit was dismantled because of bureaucratic jealousies within the CIA , and that the closure delivers a further setback to a pursuit that has been squeezed for resources for the past two years .
" What it robs you of is a critical mass of officers who have been working on this together for a decade , " he told the Guardian .
" We had a breed of specialists rare in an intelligence community that prides itself on generalists .
It provided a base from which to build a cadre of people specialising in attacking Sunni extremist operations , who sacrificed promotions and other emoluments in their employment in the clandestine service , where specialists were looked on as nerds . "
A 22 - year CIA veteran , Mr Scheuer became aware of Bin Laden in the 1980s when the Saudi - born militant was on the fringes of the US - backed mujahideen fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan .
In 1995 , when western intelligence agencies knew little about Bin Laden , Mr Scheuer was charged with setting up a unit that would track what support he was giving to Islamist groups , and determine whether he was a threat .
Mr Scheuer left the agency in 2004 after writing a scathing book about its counter - terrorism efforts , called Imperial Hubris .
He is now a consultant on terrorism .
CIA officials disclosed this week that the Alec unit - named after Mr Scheuer 's now teenage son - had been disbanded , and its agents reassigned .
The agency described the shakeup as a necessary adaptation to the changing nature of the US war on terror .
" The reorganisation just reflects the understanding that the Islamic jihadist movement continues to diversify , " a US intelligence official said .
Mr Scheuer said he disagreed with the argument it was making that Bin Laden was isolated , the organisation was broken and that he was now just a symbol .
" How do you explain the fact that he is able to dominate international media whenever he wants to ? "
Yesterday , the FBI said it had foiled a plot to blow up the railway tunnels which run beneath the Hudson river into Manhattan , and send a torrent of water gushing towards Wall Street .
The leader of the cell , Assem Hammoud , 31 , amember of al - Qaida , and two other plotters were arrested in Beirut .
None of the conspirators had ever entered the US .
In video footage released on the internet on Thursday and yesterday , Bin Laden 's deputy , Ayman al - Zawahiri , claimed to have directly masterminded last year 's London bombings .
He said two of the bombers , Mohammad Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer , had received explosives training at al - Qaida camps , and the organisation had helped to choose the targets .
In recent weeks authorities have made arrests of alleged al - Qaida activists in Manchester , London , Toronto and Miami .
" Bin Laden has always said the main activity of al - Qaida is the instigation ... of Muslims to jihad , " Mr Scheuer said .
" All of the people who have been picked up have said they were inspired by Bin Laden , that they trained in their own countries and used information picked up on the internet .
" So the fire that Bin Laden was trying to set is what we are beginning to see around the world and , unfortunately , nowhere more than in the west . "
He said the dismantling of the unit reflected a myopia in an intelligence community uncomfortable with the independence of the CIA agents who championed Bin Laden 's pursuit .
" From the very beginning , Alec was an anomaly in that it was not subordinated to any area division , and it was given the authority to communicate with overseas stations - with or without the permission of area divisions .
That caused a great deal of heartburn among very senior leaders at the agency , " he said .
The infighting went on for years .
In 1998 , a few months before car bombs blew up US embassies in Tanzania and Kenya , Mr Scheuer was told to be ready to disband - only to see the unit saved by the then agency director , George Tenet .
But it was only a temporary reprieve .
The staff was reduced from 25 to eight .
More recently , the unit became a repository for inexperienced officers , who were rotated in for 60 - or 90 - day stints .
During the past two years the hunt for Bin Laden came second to fighting the insurgency in Iraq .
With the worsening security situation in Afghanistan , more intelligence resources are being diverted towards propping up the government of Hamid Karzai in Kabul than to tracking down leads on Bin Laden .
The Bush administration continues to claim success in the fight against al - Qaida , noting that it has killed off two - thirds of its known leadership at the time of the September 11 2001 terror attacks .
But as Mr Scheuer notes , al - Qaida seems to have no difficulty in replacing its senior leaders .
A decade after he first began keeping tabs on Bin Laden , he continues to be surprised by al - Qaida 's resilience .
" I do n't think anyone could have expected to see the success of such an organisation , " he said .
For observers familiar with the disunity of the Palestinians and other Arab causes , al - Qaida was a departure from the known .
" One of the things that really slowed down the western response to Sunni extremists , but al - Qaida specifically , is that when intelligence agents looked at a group made up of Yemenis , Egyptians , Saudis , Algerians and converts , the natural response was to say , ' That is not going to last 10 minutes .
They can't get along together . '
It took a long time for people to realise we were seeing an animal of a very unique nature .
We have n't even begun to understand where our enemy is coming from . "

Last Friday night , Australian rock band Jet played at the Nippon Budokan , one of Japan ’s most historic and revered event venues .
The first foreign rock band ever to play there was the Beatles back in 1966 in a performance memorable for all the wrong reasons , and Stippy.com was there last Friday to find out whether or not Jet cut the proverbial mustard .
One of the biggest cheers of the night from the 10,000 - strong , but rather subdued , crowd was saved for the appearance of two local Japanese heroes – one a rotund gentleman and one a younger thinner man .
Jet , a rock band from Australia which has sold over 3.5 million albums worldwide , was in full swing and had just been joined on - stage by the newly - crowned Japanese national air - guitar champions .
Wearing glow - in - the - dark white t- shirts , the two men windmill and power - chord in accompaniment to a suitably muscular Jet performance of Last Chance before leaving the stage covered in glory .
It seems that moments like this are all part of the often surreal experience of attending a music concert in Japan .
On this particular evening , Japanese - style “ meat pockets ” or nikuman were the choice of pre-gig nourishment for the overwhelmingly young Japanese crowd , while only small groups of gaijins seem to be bothering with the time - honored pre-show ritual of getting hammered on beer .
( Stippy Disclaimer : We were of course not involved in this ) .
The band merchandise stalls were buzzing with customers as people waited patiently for an opportunity to buy an over - priced t- shirt or three .
As a result , great throngs of people were walking round in black t- shirts which display the faces of their heroes for the evening .
Japan is clearly a lucrative stop on the world concert circuit , and this is evidenced by the fact that it holds sway over the second largest music market in the world .
Japan accounts for around 20 % of world wide music sales and covers more than 80 % of the total amount of sales in Asian region .
Concert venues can range from tiny live houses through to the mega arenas such as Tokyo Dome and Saitama Super Arena .
Jet , however , was lucky enough to play at the historical Nippon Budokan – a hall originally built for the judo competition in the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics .
Its name , rendered into English is “ martial arts hall ” .
It contains three halls , the largest of which holds 14,000 people and is modeled after a hall in Horyuji Temple in Nara .
It is located in Kitanomaru Park in the center of Tokyo , two minutes ’ walking distance from Kudanshita Subway Station , and near Yasukuni Shrine , famous for being a spiritual home for Tokyo ’s right - wing nationalists .
The 42 m ( 140 ft ) high octagonal structure holds 14,201 people .
The national championships of the different branches of the martial arts ( Judo , Kendo , Karate , Aikido , Shorinji Kempo , Kyudo , etc. ) are held annually at the Budokan .
Professional wrestling is also a tenant as the Budokan is frequently used by the Pro Wrestling NOAH association , who often hold major events there .
These kinds of event show just what a cultural venue is to the Japanese , a far cry from the rock - band cries of Jet .
An intriguing part of the evening was crossing the moat and walking through the huge stone entrance which is akin to a great traditional temple , then entering the arena and seeing a huge Japanese flag hung in the middle of the arena , with Beatles music playing in the background to stir an excitement cocktail inside the stomachs of the beer drinking fans .
Although many may not have been aware of the significance of this scene .
In the West , the Nippon Budokan is most famous for being the venue in which the Beatles made their Japanese debut .
The band played at the venue five times between June 30 and July 2 , 1966 .
The 10,000 tickets available for each concert sold out almost immediately , and the ticket stubs and pamphlets are now collector ’s items and fetch premium prices .
The Beatles soon found out that Tokyo was not all “ free - love ” and “ peace beads ” , however , as the group incurred the wrath of militant students who objected to their performance at traditional Budokan .
Several death threats followed and the group left Japan in poor spirits after its four days in Tokyo .
A classic picture from one of the Beatles 1966 performances .
Also , the group ’s Budokan concerts rank as some of the worst performances the Beatles ever gave .
The Japanese audience was instructed not to stand up during the show , and an overwhelming police presence meant that the audience was happy to listen intently to the music and give polite applause at the end of each song .
This was the first time the Beatles could hear themselves during a show since they were used to a wall of screams confronting them at every concert and performance , and it was apparent that they sounded awful .
Ringo Starr talked about this in the Beatles Anthology video , and even specifically cited the first Budokan concert as being the performance that really opened up their eyes as to how bad their on - stage playing and singing had become .
Soon after the Beatles gave up touring and became a strictly studio - based band .
Jet ’s Nic Cester could possibly sympathize with the Beatles on that point .
The lack of crowd involvement on this night prompted the lead singer to chastise the audience on several occasions for their muted reaction .
Hit songs such as Look What You ’ve Done and Are You Gonna Be My Girl were greeted with hearty cheers , but predictably the songs taken from most recent album Shine
On were tolerated rather than enjoyed .
The guitars were huge and the band ’s energy levels high , but the performance was blighted by muddy vocals – a surprise since the Budokan is such an acoustically - sound venue .
The star of the night , however , is Jet ’s drummer Chris Cester who looks like Dennis Wilson from a -far and drums in a style reminiscent of Animal from the Muppets .
The band encore with Shine On and Rollover D.J. and the show finished exactly two hours after it began .
The crowd shuffled out in a controlled fashion and then headed off into the night .
The black t- shirts mean that only heads and bare arms can be seen bobbing off into the distance .
No fights , no drunks , no drugs , lots of spending , a little cheering and an almost full martial arts hall – the unique experience of attending a concert in Japan .
EVER WONDER what it ’s like to be a pariah ?
Publish something sharply critical of Israeli government policies and you ’ll find out .
If you ’re lucky , you ’ll merely discover that you ’ve been uninvited to some dinner parties .
If you ’re less lucky , you ’ll be the subject of an all - out attack by neoconservative pundits and accused of rabid anti-Semitism .
This , at least , is what happened to Ken Roth .
Roth -- whose father fled Nazi Germany -- is executive director of Human Rights Watch , America ’s largest and most respected human rights organization .
( Disclosure : I have worked in the past as a paid consultant for the group . )
In July , after the Israeli offensive in Lebanon began , Human Rights Watch did the same thing it has done in Iraq , Afghanistan , Chechnya , Bosnia , East Timor , Sierra Leone , Congo , Uganda and countless other conflict zones around the globe :
It sent researchers to monitor the conflict and report on any abuses committed by either side .
It found plenty .
On July 18 , Human Rights Watch condemned Hezbollah rocket strikes on civilian areas within Israel , calling the strikes “ serious violations of international humanitarian law and probable war crimes . ”
So far , so good .
You ca n’t lose when you criticize a terrorist organization .
Advertisement
But Roth and Human Rights
Watch did n’t stop there .
As the conflict ’s death toll spiraled -- with most of the casualties Lebanese civilians -- Human Rights Watch also criticized Israel for indiscriminate attacks on civilians .
Roth noted that the Israeli military appeared to be “ treating southern Lebanon as a free - fire zone , ” and he observed that the failure to take appropriate measures to distinguish between civilians and combatants constitutes a war crime .
The backlash was prompt .
Roth and Human Rights Watch soon found themselves accused of unethical behavior , giving aid and comfort to terrorists and anti-Semitism .
The conservative New York Sun attacked Roth ( who is Jewish ) for having a “ clear pro-Hezbollah and anti-Israel bias ” and accused him of engaging in “ the de-legitimization of Judaism , the basis of much anti-Semitism . ”
Neocon commentator David Horowitz called Roth a “ reflexive Israel - basher ... who , in his zest to pillory Israel at every turn , is little more than an ally of the barbarians . ”
The New Republic piled on , as did Alan Dershowitz , who claimed Human Rights Watch “ cooks the books ” to make Israel look bad .
And writing in the Jewish Exponent , Jonathan Rosenblum accused Roth of resorting to a “ slur about primitive Jewish bloodlust . ”
Anyone familiar with Human Rights Watch -- or with Roth -- knows this to be lunacy .
Human Rights
Watch is nonpartisan -- it does n’t “ take sides ” in conflicts .
And the notion that Roth is anti-Semitic verges on the insane .
But what ’s most troubling about the vitriol directed at Roth and his organization is n’t that it ’s savage , unfounded and fantastical .
What ’s most troubling is that it ’s typical .
Typical , that is , of what anyone rash enough to criticize Israel can expect to encounter .
In the United States today , it just is n’t possible to have a civil debate about Israel , because any serious criticism of its policies is instantly countered with charges of anti-Semitism .
Think Israel ’s tactics against Hezbollah were too heavy - handed , or that Israel has n’t always been wholly fair to the Palestinians , or that the United States should reconsider its unquestioning financial and military support for Israel ?
Shhh :
Do n’t voice those sentiments unless you want to be called an anti-Semite -- and probably a terrorist sympathizer to boot .
Advertisement
How did adopting a reflexively pro-Israel stance come to be a mandatory aspect of American Jewish identity ?
Skepticism -- a willingness to ask tough questions , a refusal to embrace dogma -- has always been central to the Jewish intellectual tradition .
Ironically , this tradition remains alive in Israel , where respected public figures routinely criticize the government in far harsher terms than those used by Human Rights Watch .
In a climate in which good - faith criticism of Israel is automatically denounced as anti-Semitic , everyone loses .
Israeli policies are a major source of discord in the Islamic world , and anger at Israel usually spills over into anger at the U.S. , Israel ’s biggest backer .
With resentment of Israeli policies fueling terrorism and instability both in the Middle East and around the globe , it ’s past time for Americans to have a serious national debate about how to bring a just peace to the Middle East .
But if criticism of Israel is out of bounds , that debate ca n’t occur -- and we ’ll all pay the price .
Back to Human Rights
Watch ’s critics .
Why waste time denouncing imaginary anti-Semitism when there ’s no shortage of the real thing ?
From politically motivated arrests of Jews in Iran to assaults on Jewish children in Ukraine , there ’s plenty of genuine anti-Semitism out there -- and Human Rights Watch is usually taking the lead in condemning it .
So if you ’re bothered by anti-Semitism -- if you ’re bothered by ideologies that insist that some human lives have less value than others -- you could do a whole lot worse than send a check to Human Rights Watch .

A regional nuclear war would have long - lasting effects on the planet .
100 Hiroshima - sized bombs would have an unprecedented effect on global climate .
Punchstock
More than 20 years ago , it was theorized that " a nuclear winter " would occur in the event of a superpower war using nuclear weapons .
Now new computers , better climate - modeling techniques , and comparisons to natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions , shows that even a regional conflict would throw the planet into turmoil .
Global climate and the environment would be drastically altered for decades by two nations hitting each other with a total of just 100 Hiroshima - sized ( 15 kilotonnes ) nuclear bombs , according to an analysis of such a conflict .
Millions of tonnes of soot would be blasted at least 12 kilometres high , circulating and completely covering the globe within a month .
" The global climate change would be unprecedented in the record of human history , " says Alan Robock , an atmospheric scientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey .
And that 's using less than 0.03 % of the explosive yield of the planet 's current total nuclear arsenal .
" Instantaneously , it would be colder than the little Ice Age , " says Robock .
A regional attack would shrink crop -growing periods in the middle latitudes by 30 days , they add , drastically impacting available food supplies .
And a global ozone hole would be created by the blasts , exposing the Earth to more damaging radiation .
Small war , big impact
A panel of US atmospheric scientists , including Robock , announced their results at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco on 11 December .
Beyond the horrific loss of millions of lives from such a nuclear exchange , the team is seeking to highlight the long - term global impact from a war between nations that could manufacture bombs .
Such nations cited included Argentina , Mexico , Pakistan , India , Taiwan and Japan .
To build their model , the team hypothesized that the bombs would be targeted at major population areas .
Burning material — such as plastics , fossil fuels and buildings — would generate heat capable of carrying soot high into the stratosphere , where mechanisms to remove the particles from the air are very slow .
Older models did n't properly account for this effect , says Robock , and so did not realise how long - lived the climate impacts would be .
The team 's results are also published online in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Discussusions1 .
Growing threat
The public generally believes that the threat of nuclear war is decreasing because of the easing of tensions among superpowers , says the team .
But in reality , the scientists warn , threats from regional conflicts are actually higher and increasing .
" We are at a perilous crossroads , " says Brian Toon , a team member from the University of Colorado at Boulder .

In the Middle East , the Korean peninsula and the Asian subcontinent , where nations are seeking to join the bomb club , they say there is great potential for calamity .
Japan alone could make from its fissionable material 20,000 Hiroshima - sized weapons .
Rick Turco , a team member from the University of California at Los Angeles , noted that a regional war — such as between India and Pakistan — could generate soot levels of millions of metric tonnes .
" Human society is extremely vulnerable at this point in time , " says Turco .

Haskell has been tying my brain in knots .
Sure , it keeps teaching me all sorts of amazing things , but it 's also forcing me to relearn the basics .
Right now , I 'm trying to implement simple data structures in Haskell .
It 's challenging , because most typical data structures are based on updating pointers , and Haskell does n't allow that .
( Well , I could cheat , and use the IO monad , but where 's the fun in that ? )
Fortunately , Chris Okasaki has done some amazing research into Haskell ( and ML ) data structures .
He wrote an excellent thesis , which was later published as Purely Functional Data Structures .
It 's a comprehensive book , well - written , and highly recommended for anyone programming in a functional language .
Let 's take a look at a data structure from Okasaki 's book : A purely functional queue .
It 's competitive with a traditional queue ( on average , at least ) , but it does n't use any pointers .
The queue API
A queue is a list of values to process .
We can add values to the back of the queue , and retrieve values from the front .
In Haskell , we often begin by writing down the types of our functions .
If we 're lucky , the code will fill itself in almost automatically .
The first part of our API is easy :
-- A queue holding values of type ' a '. data Queue a = ??? --
Create a new queue .
newQueue :: Queue a --
Test whether a queue is empty .
empty :: Queue a ->
Bool
The next part is a bit trickier .
Since we can't update our actual Queue values , our data structure is read - only !
We can work around this by making enq and deq return an updated version of the Queue :
-- Add an item to the back of the queue , -- returning the updated queue .
enq :: Queue a -> a ->
Queue a --
Remove an item from the front of the -- queue , returning the item and the -- updated queue .
deq :: Queue a -> ( a , Queue a )
We could use this API as follows :
q = new Queue ` enq ` 1 ` enq ` 2 ` enq ` 3 ( x , q ' ) = deq q -- x is 1 ( y , q '' ) = deq q ' -- y is 2
Now , the tricky bit : Making it run quickly .
Haskell queues , in O ( 1 ) amortized time
We could represent our queues as lists , but they'd be slow .
Appending a value to the end of a Haskell list requires walking over all the existing values .
The trick is simple :
We represent a queue as two lists .
The first list contains the front of the queue , and the second list contains the back .
We store the back part in reverse order , so we can add a new value in constant time :
data Queue a = Queue [ a ] [ a ]
The newQueue and empty functions are trivial :
newQueue = Queue [ ] [ ] empty ( Queue [ ] [ ] ) =
True empty _ = False
Adding a new item to the queue is easy .
We just append it to the second list :
enq ( Queue xs ys ) y = Queue xs ( y : ys )
The first two parts of enq are similarly straightforward :
--
If the queue is empty , raise an error .
deq ( Queue [ ] [ ] ) = error " Ca n't deq from an empty queue " --
If there 's at least one item in the front -- part of the queue , return it .
deq ( Queue ( x : xs ) ys ) = ( x , Queue xs ys )
But what if the front part of the queue is empty ?
We can just reverse the back part and move it to the front :
--
If the front part is empty , reverse the -- back part , move it to the front , and try -- again . deq ( Queue [ ] ys ) = deq ( Queue ( reverse ys ) [ ] )
Our implementation of enq runs in constant time .
But deq occasionally needs to reverse a list , which requires walking the entire length of the list .
Fortunately , each item only gets moved once , so deq averages out to constant time .
And note that our queues are " persistent " -- we can hold onto earlier versions of the queue , in case we need to implement " Undo " or some sort of backtracking .
( Update :
As mauke points out , using this queue persistently can break the amortized O ( 1 ) guarantees .
See Okasaki for a discussion and simple fix . )
There 's a lot more good stuff in Okasaki 's book :
True constant - time queues , an explanation of how laziness and strictness affect running time , and a wide variety of standard data structures .
Highly recommended .
Look , everybody , we 're all looking for answer , you know .
We all want to understand who we are and where we come from , but ... soemtimes we want to know the answers so badly that we ... believe just about anything .

ほら、僕達はみんな答えを求めてるでしょ。僕達は一体何で、僕達はどっから来たのか。でも、時には答えを求めるあまり………ほとんど何でも信じてしまうんだ。
VOODOO な理論達：平成の万能大学者・VOODOOな理論達：いいセンいってる南堂久史さん 経由で知っ た http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA011700/physics/catwjs.htm「シュレーディンガーの猫の核心 by 南堂久史」なのだけれども、はてなブックマークがこんなひどい状況。
300人以上がこのシュレディンガーの猫の話をころりと信じたら、僕も少しは行動しなきゃいけない気になりますよ。ひとつ上の記事も、郡司さん・野矢さんは何を考えているかまじめに考えて自分が得るところがあると思いますが、南堂さんはそういうところが感じられないから、いままでも南堂さんのことを記事に何度かしていますが、それでもあんまり考察したくないっていうのが正直なところではあるのですが。
え、これでご本人は 「数学的に等価」を名乗っているのか。う〜ん。分からん。
まず、相対主義に逃げられてしまいそう、なので抑えておきます。つまり、僕の文章も彼の文章も、対立する二つのもので「50:50の重みで合わせて読むことで中立的な観点が得られる」と思われることへの恐れです。
物理学は自然を記述する学問です。記述するときに、数式と自然言語を使います。
もちろん、人間ができることは、あくまでもすべて記号を操作することです。僕が量子論を正しいと思っているのも、もしかしたら、騙されているだけで、量子論でしか説明できないといわれてやった実験も実は測定器が教授の部屋に無線ランで繋がっていてその出力を見ていただけかもしれない。あるいは、この世の中は映画マトリックスのようなものなのかもしれない。
でも、実験を繰り返して、そうして少しずつ自然を記号で記述していって、その結果、ものすごい精度で未来を予測できるようになりました。物理学がようやく軌道に乗って発展しだしたのは、奇跡の年、わずか100年前です。
その成果が、たとえば、集積回路だったりディスプレイだったり化学繊維だったり。乳児死亡率だってこんなに下がった。安全な水が飲めて。
実にすばらしいじゃないか。
たしかに、自然科学の智を利用して科学技術が産み出した数々のものは人が扱うにはあまりにも強力だ。それは人類を滅ぼすだけの力があるであろう。それでも、理性的にあることで、3人に1人が成人できず、無知のため恐れて迷信にすがっているよりも、ずっといい世界が待っていると信じている。
ここからは学科の某君と話した結果でてきた説明方針。しかし、彼は量子力学勉強していない人間がシュレディンガーの猫を分かろうとしても無理だ、とはっきりといった。だけれども、僕は何とかなると思っている。それに僕も彼もシュレディンガーの猫には全く不思議さを感じないわけで、そこを説明するべきであろう、と僕は考える。
恐らくだけれども、量子力学的な確率が古典的な確率と「全く違う」ことを言わなきゃいけなくて、そのためには純粋状態と混合状態の説明をするしかない。
一応、あらすじはこうなる。ここのところを読むだけでも、十分な説明になるようにしたつもりだ。
さて。実は、量子論の確率には「二種類」あります。片方は普通の確率だと思ってよいでしょう。けれども、残りの片方が、コペンハーゲン解釈といわれる「ふたを開けた瞬間に波動関数が収縮する」と解釈に物理学者たちを追い込んだのです。
この二つは 、
「 一時間前に猫が死んだ 」 ということが 「 今分かった 」 。
「 一時間前に猫が死んだ 」 ということが 「 今決まった 」 。
の違いだとも言えるでしょう。
なぜ、 「今分かった」だけではだめで「今決まった」でないといけないか。それはベル不等式( CHSH不等式の一種)が説明してくれるでしょう。このベル不等式の破れは確かに「不思議」。
詳細は省きますが 「開けるまで決まっていない」としない、どんな(局所的な)やり方でも実験と計算が合わなくなるのです。
たしかに、一応、局所的でないという抜け道はありますがそうすると、超光速で「何かが走って」つじつま合わせをしているか、ランダムに選んだつもりが誰かに選ばさせられていたか、ということになるのですが、それぞれ、人間には絶対出来ないようになっているけれども「何か」は超光速で走る(これは因果律が崩壊することを意味しています)、粒子は大局的な視点から行動している、かのように思う羽目になるのです。そして、これは大抵の人に受け入れられないでしょう。
もうひとつのエヴェレット解釈は多世界解釈とも呼ばれていて、宇宙全体の「状態」を考えると、その「状態」がどんどん「重ね合わさっていく」というものである。ありとあらゆる状態、たとえば「ナポレオンが
Waterloo で勝利した」状態もその中にある。実際は負けているわけで、そんなの変だよ、とよく言われる。もっとも、これは丁度、解析力学でばねの先におもりが繋がったあらゆる状態をまとめて考える、だとか、統計力学で実際は取ってもいない取りうるあらゆる状態に対して期待値を求める、だといったように、これは別に初めて聞く人が思うほど不思議ではないのです。けれども、これがために、実在の考え方ができない、という気持ち悪さがなくなるわけではないと思います。
皆様。こんな感じでどうでしょう。

Put simply , this is what happens when a Dell , IBM , or any other lithium - ion battery powered notebook catches fire / explodes .
PCPitStop decided to intentionally create conditions “ in which the Li-ON battery pack would explode inside a generic portable . ”

The results are dramatic .
There are numerous conditions where these fires can occur in real life .
Faulty battery packs ( driving the recalls ) , faulty protection circuits inside the PC , exposure to excessive heat , and blunt force are some of the major ways that this could happen to you

The report says , for example , that utilities should be encouraged to pursue financial incentives for customers to cut use during peak hours , thereby lowering demand for new power plants and transmission lines .
Financial incentives could reward customers ’ installation of more efficient equipment or , more drastically , reward a factory for closing on a day when electricity supplies are expected to be tight .
The president of the council , Rick P. Sergel , said in a telephone interview , “ The situation has existed for a long time , but we can not let it continue . ”
Planning for adequate capacity has become more difficult with the restructuring of the electric industry .
Where a handful of top - to - bottom companies once generated power , transmitted it and delivered it , hundreds of companies are now involved in only one or two phases of the process .
At the same time , getting permits to build new power lines has become more difficult .
The actual balance between supply and demand depends in part on changes in technology .
Grid operators can now push more power through existing lines , plant operators have found ways to make generators more reliable and sharp increases in the efficiency of how electricity is used could slow demand .
The report predicts that demand will increase by about 19 percent over the next 10 years in the United States , and slightly less in Canada , and that the construction of power plants and transmission lines to carry that load will fall far short of what is needed .
In this country , utilities have contracts with new power plants for only about a third of the capacity that will be needed ; in Canada , the number is about two - thirds .

Language | Static / Dynamic | Strong / Weak | Safety | Ada static strong safe C static weak unsafe C++ static strong unsafe Java static strong safe Javascript dynamic weak safe Lisp dynamic strong safe Pascal static strong safe Perl dynamic weak safe PHP dynamic weak safe Python dynamic strong safe Ruby dynamic strong safe
Conclusion
Notes
One topic that shows up very often in comparisons of programming languages is .
When the pros discuss the relative merits of , say , Java and Lisp , you might ( like me ) sometimes find yourself lost in the cornucopia of terminology wondering what the hell is " static " typing , why is it better / worse than " dynamic " typing , and how about that " strong " typing thingy , it surely sounds way better than " weak " typing , and oh , what has " safe " typing to do with it all .
This article is an attempt to put it all in order , at least for myself .
The topic of typing is controversial enough to have dozens of cross -contradictory definitions .
Here I 'll try to refer to the most commonly implied uses of the idioms .
In programming languages , data is divided to types .
integers , floats , strings , arrays of stuff , you get the idea .
For instance , in C , the following statement : Defines a variablewith a " floating point " type and assigns it a value .
Now this variable can be used anywhere a floating point value is expected , such as in thefunction .
In Perl , a string is defined and printed as follows : After the first line , is of a " string " type .
The simple examples of the last section actually demonstrate the difference between static and dynamic typing .
Note how in the C code , the float type is specified in the declaration of the variable , while in Perl no such specification is provided .
C is statically typed - the type is given to a variable at declaration time , or at .
In statically typed languages , the type pertains to a variable .
From the moment of the declaration , the variable may be assigned only data of its type ( give or take , which are also compile time constructs ) .
As a result , statically typed languages have a distinction betweenand - the compiler can perform type checking in compile time , before the program runs [ 1 ] .
Other well - known languages with static typing are C++ , C# , Java , Basic , Pascal , Ada and Fortran .
Perl is dynamically typed - the type of a variable can change during runtime .
In dynamically typed languages , the type pertains to data .
Variables just " point " to data ( not to be confused with C pointers ) , and they can point to data of different types at different times .
Dynamically typed languages usually do n't have a distinction between compile time and runtime , and type checking can not be performed before runtime .
Most of the " scripting " and " rapid development " languages are dynamically typed - Javascript , Lisp , PHP , Python , Ruby , Scheme and others .
The division to strong and weak typed languages is much less clear - cut than static vs. dynamic , and there is a lot of confusion on what strong typing means .
One common definition is .
Consider the following example from Perl ( a weakly typed language ) : This code will print ' 6 ' , although it seemingly performs addition on incompatible types .
This is because Perl is performing an implicit conversion when it sees we want to add a string that represents a number to another number .
On the other hand , Ruby is strongly typed and the above statement will generate a .
Another example is C ( weak ) vs. C++ ( strong ) : This line of code cleanly compiles in C , but generates an error in C++.returns , and while C does n't mind , C++ does , and demands an explicit cast .
While weak typing often allows for faster development , strong typing gives the compiler / runtime an ability to catch more errors that may be potentially dangerous .
Strongly typed languages demand more care from the programmer , requiring far more explicit type conversions .
Weakly typed languages , on the other hand , resort to large amounts of implicit type conversions .
Perl is probably the chief example of weak typing - the Perl hackers even have a name for this philosophy - DWIM ( Do What I Mean ) .
On the other extreme is Ada , where you sometimes feel like programming when your hands are tied behind your back , but as many Ada programmers note , once you get the damn thing to compile , it will probably run correctly .
Another point to note is that static typing almost always goes hand in hand with strong typing .
If you demand types in compile time ( static typing ) , you better enforce the usage of these types throughout the program and deny potentially dangerous implicit conversions ( strong typing ) .
The only notable statically typed languages without strong typing are C [ 2 ] and Basic .
For a proper explanation of safety , let 's first define trapped errors as execution errors that cause the computation stop immediately , and untrapped errors as execution errors that go unnoticed and later cause arbitrary behavior .
Now we can formally define a safe programming language as one that allows to write only programs that are safe .
The type safety enforcement of a programming can be static , catching potential errors at compile time , or dynamic , associating type information with values at run time and consulting them as needed to detect imminent errors , or a combination of both .
There is a common misconception that weak typing goes hand in hand with lack of safety .
This is far from the truth .
Most weakly typed languages defer the checking of operations until the last possible opportunity - at run time , where all the information about the operation is available , which allows for more thorough safety checks .
For example , while Perl has weak typing , it is definitely type safe .
Try to crash the system in a pure Perl program , if you challenge this statement .
On the other hand , while C++ is strongly typed , the following minimal program , while compiling cleanly , will crash spectacularly : Worse yet , a variation of this code may corrupt the program in very mysterious ways which are notoriously difficult to debug .
Languages that allow pointer arithmetic just can't be type - safe .
The flexibility of pointers is implemented in other languages by using references , which are safe forms of pointers , without the arithmetic .
C++ itself also provides references which is a good , safe substitute for pointers in most situations .
Below is a list of the some of most commonly used ( or discussed ) programming languages , and the typing groups they belong to .
I hope this article sheds some light on the widely misunderstood topic of typing .
As with all engineering tools , different languages have different approaches to typing , and each has its merits and its disadvantages .
Knowing the different approaches and what they entail helps up pick the correct tools at appropriate times . [ 1 ]
Providing the actual type for the compiler to see is calledand this is what most common languages use .
Some languages , like Haskell and OCaml employ a technique called type inference to automatically deduce the type of the variable .
These languages arestatic typed . [ 2 ]
C , in particular , is so notorious for its weak and unsafe typing , that many programmers recommend using the C subset of C++ ( sometimes referred to as C++--) instead of C itself for large scale programming ( C++ is also unsafe , but at least it is strongly typed , so the compiler is much less forgiving to errors that may lead to unsafe code ) , that many companies earn good money from creating static code checking ( Lint - like ) tools for C , and that embedded programmers invent restrictions on the usage of C to earn at least some safety ( Misra C .
In defense of C it can be said that C is deliberately unsafe , because of performance considerations .
The run time checks needed to achieve safety are sometimes considered too expensive .
Take array bounds checks , for instance , that cannot be completely eliminated at compile time , and will impose a performance degradation at run time .
Back in town we were fairly hard - pressed to find a proper bookstore .
Savaht was n’t familiar with any , which is a true testament to the level of education in the country .
We asked a few people and finally found ourselves in a store , which was indeed focused on selling books .
The man who ran the store was a French ex-pat who had been in Cambodia for a few years and was incredibly happy with his move , although I suspect there were a few reasons he was n’t interested in divulging leading up to his decision to hop .
The vast majority of the books , in fact , I ’d say at least 90 % of the books were bootlegs .
Much like in Thailand , copyright laws are a figment of the West ’s imagination and mean virtually nothing , so you can pick up a 25 dollar copy of Lonely Planet ’s Cambodia for a mere four dollars ; sure , the pages are photocopied , and the pictures are typically in black and white , but 25 dollars in Cambodia is literally someone ’s rent money for a month , so selling a book for that amount is highly unlikely .
I browsed the selections , which were mostly a pretty even split between cheesy fiction , and history / politics .
They were broken down by the author ’s country of origin , a unique and questionable way to separate books , but it turned out to be effective .
My favorite title was the photocopied version of Moby Dick .
Unable to remember which country Paulo Coelho hails from , I struck up a conversation with the Frenchy that was slinging the books , curly mustache and all , and asked him if he had copies of The Alchemist .
I saw a twinkle in his eye , which lead me to believe he was a fan of the author as well , so we talked about several other titles I ’d read by him and about The Alchemist itself .
I explained my reason for the purchase , was very interested in our encounter with Chin , and told me he thought I was doing a very good thing for him .
The predicament that Erick and I had been discussing since leaving Chin was which language we should try to find the book in for him .
His native language is Khmer , and while his English is pretty good , we were n’t sure that all of the metaphors would sink in and whether he would be able to extract the message from the book instead of just reading it as a story .
We decided to try and find it for him in Khmer , but , were supremely disappointed when Frenchy told us that he was fairly well versed in Coelho ’s translations , and while he has been translated to well over 100 languages , he was pretty sure that Khmer did n’t make the list of dialects .
He did , however , have the book in English , so I decided to get that for him and hope that he could perhaps use the book to better his understanding of the language ; I also figured it better to get it for him in English than to not get it for him at all .
With Frenchy ’s help I tracked down the poorly bootlegged copy , and handed over the three dollars and change that the book cost .
His cash register system was top notch .
He had an envelope that had a running total of the books he sold and the amount they went for , which was presumably his inventory , and a pocket in his pants from which he made change for me .
Having been to France , I was expecting him to be considerably more arrogant than he turned out to be , perhaps a few years in one of the poorest countries in the world would do all Frenchmen some good .
I ’m unsure how one could spend any period of time in Cambodia and not be humbled .
If seeing this place does n’t make everyone aware that our liberties , freedoms , and opportunities that we take for granted were given to us simply because we were fortunate enough to be born in the west , and that we , individually , did nothing to earn them or deserve them , then I do n’t know what could possibly hammer that in .
At home , I would n’t walk a mile down the street if someone were going to give me three dollars and change at the other end , it would n’t seem worth it , and on the other side of the world , a 21 year old named Chin , got his heart set on a new book he wanted to read , but was unsure if he would ever be able to save enough that same three dollars to purchase it .
How is that fair ?
What makes me so special ?
Why does my blue passport entitle me to the rest of the world when Chin will never be able to afford to buy a passport to go several hours west to Thailand ?
After quick , cold showers , we met Savaht back out in front of The Shadow of Angkor guesthouse and were ready to go to the concert .
Erick was wearing a clean , well - pressed shirt , a pair of warm - up style pants , a pair of clean walking shoes , had his hair done , and had just shaved .
I , on the other hand , was still wearing the same pair of cut off denim shorts that I had n’t changed out of nor washed thus far , the same damp - with - sweat v-neck I had worn for the last two days , flip - flops , and a sweat stained military style hat which has a wire brim enabling you to bend it to your specifications that I gave up on caring about several days ago and was now contorted in the most unorthodox shape .
I was looking pretty awesome .

( Bloomberg ) -- A New York Times story based on Donald Trump ’s long - sought - after tax data shows he avoided paying income taxes for most of the past two decades and paid only $ 750 the year he was elected president .
That does n’t mean he is n’t a billionaire .
By pairing moneymaking businesses with spectacular money - losers , the Trump Organization has been able to shield profits generated by office properties and “ The Apprentice ” from tax collectors .
It ’s a souped - up version of the formula deployed by America ’s landlord class for decades .
But tax losses are different from operating losses , and the new data do n’t necessarily show his business empire is heading into crisis , even if it ’s carrying sizable debts .
“ Your tax return at the end of the day shows income and whatever deductions are claimed against that income .
That ’s it , ” said Thorne Perkin , president at Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management .
“ It does n’t necessarily show net worth .
” The newspaper ’s report described the extent of Trump ’s tax - cutting strategies , such as taking deductions for consulting fees to his daughter and for hairstyling , which resulted in paying far less than poorer Americans .
Although the report raises questions about the legality of some of the maneuvers , the new details do n’t affect the Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimate of his wealth .
His net worth is based chiefly on the value of his office and commercial property holdings , minus debts that were already known .
The index estimated his net worth at $ 2.7 billion as of August , down $ 300 million from mid-2019 , hurt by declining prices for certain types of real estate holdings .
Trump ’s office properties include commercial spaces at Trump Tower , a leasehold on 40 Wall Street in downtown Manhattan and a 30 % interest in two office towers co-owned with Vornado Realty Trust .
Collectively , the assets are valued at about $ 1.9 billion , and Trump ’s share of the debt that encumbers them is about $ 670 million -- meaning they constitute almost half of his net worth .
Financial records for his golf courses in Europe have long shown that , after including items such as depreciation , they run in the red .
The tax data obtained by the Times reveal Trump ’s American golf courses operate similarly .
Depreciation is crucial for real estate investors .
Depending on the type of property at hand , they can write off a portion of its value over a useful lifetime pre-determined by the Internal Revenue Service .
That allows investors to claim tax losses on the property even when they ’re putting money in their pockets .
“ You want to show as much losses as you possibly can for your deductions , ” said Papamarkou ’s Perkin .
“ That ’s a big part of the advantages of real estate investing .
” The president ’s son , Donald Trump Jr. , disputed the Times ’s reporting on Tuesday while acknowledging that Trump exploited depreciation , tax credits and other provisions of the tax code .
“ He ’s paying tens of millions in taxes -- now , he ’s not going to pay more ” than he needs to , the president ’s son said in an interview on Fox Business Network .
“ And by the way , he ’s following the tax code that people like Joe Biden , who has been in DC for 47 years , have written .
He ’s playing by their rules .
Joe Biden is taking advantage of the same loopholes .
” The Times in a Monday story also revealed that when Trump did pay taxes it was because of cash from his role fronting “ The Apprentice ” and not as a real - estate developer .
He earned $ 197 million from the show and $ 230 million from branding , speaking engagements and licensing deals off the back of the fame the series provided .
As well as borrowing against Trump Tower and selling stocks and bonds , he plowed some of that money into the money - losing golf courses .
Carrying LoansThe tax documents described by the Times are n’t enough to draw conclusions about the profitability of Trump ’s empire .
But even if his golf courses are bleeding money , they contribute comparatively little to the tally of his fortune -- about $ 430 million before debt .
Prices for golf resorts are down after years of decreasing interest in the sport .
Younger generations simply are n’t taking it up as quickly as their elders are leaving it behind .
Trump has long been required to disclose a road map to his assets and liabilities .
In 2015 , then a contender for the Republican party ’s nomination for president , he released a financial disclosure listing the lenders behind his loans , ranges for their outstanding balances , when they were issued and when they must be repaid .
That several are due in the next few years is n’t unusual in commercial real estate , where most loans run five to 10 years and are refinanced regularly .
Unless there is a serious deterioration in the performance of his properties , it ’s likely his portfolio can be refinanced before loans mature .
Though Trump has carried on this balancing act for years , his re-election could make obtaining new loans harder if potential lenders do n’t want to face the prospect of foreclosing on a sitting U.S. president .
Conversely , Trump is engaged in a variety of court fights that could accelerate once he leaves office and complicate refinancing .
The Covid - 19 pandemic also may take a lasting toll on the value of his holdings , making future loans more onerous .
His biggest financial vulnerabilities remain his hotel in Washington , where the pandemic has slowed business , and Doral , a sprawling golf resort in Florida .
He has taken out nearly $ 300 million of personally - guaranteed loans from Deutsche Bank AG against these properties .
The debts mature in 2023 and 2024 , according to his personal financial disclosure .
Room to BorrowBut Trump , whose earlier career included a series of bankruptcies , also has a safety valve : the office properties .
When he refinanced Trump Tower in 2012 with a $ 100 million loan , it was appraised at $ 480 million .
A 2015 refinancing of 40 Wall Street fetched a $ 160 million loan on a $ 540 million appraisal .
That left both properties relatively low - levered for Manhattan real estate , suggesting either a newly learned financial conservatism on Trump ’s part or a squeamishness on the part of the lender , Ladder Capital .
Ladder , which specializes in loans for commercial property , is Trump ’s second - biggest lender after Deutsche Bank .
An August appraisal of the buildings by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , based on current net income and prevailing capitalization rates , was less sanguine , valuing them at $ 365 million and $ 375 million respectively .
But so long as the pandemic does n’t crater office values , the properties could carry far more debt , were Trump to need it .

So you think you have the Web all figured out ?
Well , think again .
Did you know that you could charter a private jet online , star in your own reality TV show , or download songs as you drive your car ?
That 's just the beginning .
You can tell your boss a few unpleasant truths without revealing your identity and sniff out trends before your oh - so - hip friends get wind of them .
Using the right sites , you can give Google a face - lift , promote your products or bloviate about your blog , publish a novel , write a business plan , scan your PC for spies , and get free tech help .
You can even use the Web to uncover government secrets and to predict your own demise .
( Those last two activities will be unrelated , we hope . )
Best of all , most of these sites wo n't charge you a dime .
Here are some of the more surprising things the Web can do for you .
Bennett Haselton writes " Every year just before election day , I usually get a few phone calls from machines that dial numbers and play a pre-recorded message telling people to vote a certain way .
I find these annoying even if I support the side I 'm being asked to vote for , and most people do n't realize that in most cases you can sue the organizations for making these calls , even if they are non-profits .
So , you can make some money while advancing a good cause ( i.e. stopping the bozos from doing it again ) .
Here 's how to file your case in Small Claims court , how to possibly negotiate an out - of - court settlement in advance , how to argue the case in court , and how to collect afterwards . "
His essay follows ...
Do you HAVE what it TAKES ?
Before proceeding , decide if you think the stress is worth it .
You 're almost certainly stepping outside your comfort zone here .
Small Claims can be frustrating because the rules and procedures vary so much from one judge to the next , and judges differ wildly in how they interpret the laws .
Their own biases come into play as well : they usually deal with cases involving people who have actually lost money or have been wronged in a serious way , and they may resent someone coming to court just to sue over a phone call .
In one particular case that provides a good example of what I 'm talking about , I sued a spammer who came to court and claimed he never sent the mails and did n't even know how .
When the judge stopped berating me long enough for me to continue , I then produced a tape recording of a conversation between me and the spammer , in which I had pretended to be an interested customer , and he offered to send 5 million e-mails for me for $ 500 , and explained how they were routed through China to hide the origin .
The judge got extremely flustered for a minute and then started to accuse me of " entrapment " ( even though the recorded phone call took place after I had received the original spam ) , and she never commented on the fact that the defendant had just been caught lying under oath .
I had n't really expected him to go to jail for that , but I thought I would at least win the case ; I did n't .
If you go to Small Claims court you have to be prepared to deal with that kind of Twilight Zone / Franz Kafka stuff .
But the worst that can happen is that you 'll lose .
How the law applies to non-profits
To clarify something important :
In general , you can sue non-profits for $ 500 for calling your number and playing a pre-recorded message , unless in the recorded message they ( a ) identify themselves at the beginning of the message ; and ( b ) give their return phone number ( other than the number of the machine making the call ) somewhere in the message .
Most pre-recorded messages from non-profits do not meet these requirements , particularly the second one .
The federal law which states this is divided into two parts .
The Telephone Consumer Protection Act , section ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ) , states :
" It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States , or any person outside the United States if the recipient is within the United States ... to initiate any telephone call to any residential telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior express consent of the called party , unless the call is initiated for emergency purposes or is exempted by rule or order by the Commission under paragraph ( 2 ) ( B ) " .
A person or entity may , if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State , bring in an appropriate court of that State ... an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation , or to receive $ 500 in damages for each such violation , whichever is greater .
and part ( b ) ( 3 ) ( A ) states :
Now , part ( 2 ) ( B ) says that the FCC is authorized to make federal rules and may grant certain exemptions to non-profits .
The actual rules that the FCC came up with are in the Code of Federal Regulations as 47 CFR 64.1200 .
The complete text of 47 CFR 64.1200 is here , but the relevant sections that apply are :
( a) No person may : [...]
( 2 ) Initiate any telephone call to any residential telephone line using an artificial or prerecorded voice to deliver a message without the prior express consent of the called party , unless the call is initiated for emergency purposes or is exempted by Sec. 64.1200 ( c ) of this section .
( c) The term telephone call in Sec. 64.1200 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this section shall not include a call or message by , or on behalf of , a caller : [...]
( 4 ) Which is a tax - exempt nonprofit organization .
(d) All artificial or prerecorded telephone messages delivered by an automatic telephone dialing system shall : ( 1 ) At the beginning of the message , state clearly the identity of the business , individual , or other entity initiating the call , and ( 2 ) During or after the message , state clearly the telephone number ( other than that of the autodialer or prerecorded message player which placed the call ) or address of such business , other entity , or individual .
The wording is important .
Section ( a ) prohibits parties from making phone calls using a pre-recorded voice .
Section ( c ) says that non-profits are exempt from the blanket ban in part ( a ) .
But then section ( d ) says that " All artificial or prerecorded telephone messages " must include a return phone number -- in other words , even if a party is allowed to make pre-recorded calls at all , they still have to conform to the restrictions in part ( d ) .
I think this clearly applies to non-profits as well , for two reasons :
First of all , part ( c ) does not say that non-profits are exempt from the entire law , it only says that they are exempt from the blanket ban in part ( a ) -- it does not say anywhere that they are exempt from part ( d ) .
say anywhere that they are exempt from part ( d ) .
Second , there 's a simpler way of looking at it : if part ( d ) does n't apply to non-profits and other parties that are exempt from the complete ban on pre-recorded calls , then who does it apply to ?
It does n't apply to commercial companies , because under part ( a ) , commercial companies can't make unsolicited pre-recorded calls at all , so it would make no sense to have a separate section requiring them to include a phone number .
What to do if you get a pre-recorded call
You probably do n't need to keep a portable tape recorder by the phone just to record the call and prove that you received it .
If you show up in court and claim that you received the pre-recorded phone call , it 's unlikely that the non -profit 's representatives , if they show up , will lie through their teeth and claim that it never happened .
If they lose in court , all they lose is $ 500 , but if they get caught lying under oath , they could in theory be convicted of a felony .
( Although to tell the truth , sometimes the enforcement of perjury laws in Small Claims court is pretty lax . )
The important things to note about the phone call are :
Does the organization making the call identify themselves at the beginning of the message ?
Did they give their return phone number anywhere in the message ?
Finding the right party to sue
If the answer to either of those questions is no , it 's suing time !
Even if the pre-recorded message gives the name of the organization , that may not be the actual party that used the machine to make the call .
For example I got a call with a message identifying the caller as " Bob Thurston , Washington State Patrol Troopers Association president " , but when I found his number and called him , he said the calls were actually being made by a group called Taxpayers for R - 51 .
If I 'm doing legwork to find out who made the call , sometimes I say that I 'm interested in running my own campaign using a machine to dial numbers and play a message , and I want to find out how they did it .
It 's not illegal to lie .
Once you 're reasonably sure you know the name of the organization that did it , you need to find the address where you can serve the papers on them .
There are two broad approaches to this :
Go to the Secretary of State 's website for the state in which the organization is located , go to " Corporations " search , and search on the organization 's name .
If they are listed as a corporation in the state , there should be an address given for their " Registered Agent " as well .
You 're done ; that 's the address you need .
If that does n't work , unfortunately the remaining methods are a lot less precise .
Your best recourse is to try and find the group using Google , and see if you can locate their street address .
What you do n't want is P.O.
Box or a rented mailbox , since you wo n't be able to serve papers on them there .
If you get an address like " 1234 100th Ave # 542 " , that 's ambiguous -- it could be an actual office building located at " 1234 100th Ave " where they 're in suite 542 , or it could be a rented mailbox company like Mail Boxes Etc. where they rent box number 542 .
Usually what I do is Google the first part of the address , " 1234 100th Ave " , along with the city name -- that way you 'll find other entities that share addresses at the same location .
If it 's an actual office building , usually you 'll find companies that rent the other office suites , and you can just call them up and ask them , " Hey , is that an actual office building at 1234 100th Ave ? "
On the other hand , if 1234 100th
Ave is a mailbox rental company , usually you 'll find pages where people list their addresses as " 1234 100th Ave , box 234 " or " 1234 100th Ave , PMB 341 " ( short for Postal Mail Box ) .
If you found the entity 's address through their listing on the Secretary of State website , you 're in luck , since companies are not supposed to list a P.O.
Box or rented mailbox as their registered agent 's address .
But if you found the address through Google , it may not be a real street address .
If it is n't , this is often where I hit a dead end , and with " only " $ 500 at stake I usually do n't have the time to keep looking .
But if you think you 've got their real address , keep going !
Filing in Small Claims
At this point you might be tempted to contact the organization first and negotiate a legal settlement as an alternative to suing them .
What I 've found however is that for cases this small , organizations usually wo n't take the threat of a lawsuit seriously until you actually serve them with legal papers , so I would n't bother negotiating until you 've done that .
( Also , if you try to negotiate in advance , this has the added disadvantage that once they know you 're going to sue them , if they 're a really underhanded bunch of people , they might try to make it harder for you to serve the papers on them . )
If you think it 's rude to just sue someone out of the blue -- well , shit , they called your house using a machine , did n't they ?
So , in Washington at least , you can get a blank Notice of Small Claim form just by sending a self - address stamped envelope ( should probably include about $ 1 worth of postage on the envelope since the forms can be heavy ) to the local District Court and requesting the form .
Then you can even file the case by filling out the form and mailing it back with a check for the Small Claims filing fee ( $ 25 in Washington ) , plus another self - addressed stamped envelope .
They 'll mail you back the forms to be served .
You never even have to go to the courthouse .
However , I 'd recommend sitting in on part of a Small Claims calendar at the local courthouse to see how it usually works , and to make sure you would n't be nervous going through with it if the other side does n't settle .
Then while you 're there , you can get the Small Claims form and file the case .
They will give you one copy of the Small Claims form for your records , and one copy that has to be served on the other party within a certain time frame ( in Washington , 10 days before the court date ) .
The clock is ticking , so now you have to serve the papers on the other party .
Serving the papers
Before having the Small Claims papers delivered to the defendant , you may want to attach a letter explaining that you 're suing them for a phone call received on such - and - such a date .
I tend to go that route , since I have nothing to hide anyway , and in any case the more you communicate , the more chance of getting a settlement .
So , throw that in with the papers and then get ready to serve the papers on the defendant .
When you filled out the Small Claims form , it probably came with a pamphlet describing how to serve the papers on the other party .
I 'm describing the rules for Washington State ; the rules in other states are similar .
There are two ways to serve the defendant : hiring a process server , or serving the defendant by mail .
Hiring a process server .
This is the preferred method if you do n't mind spending about $ 40 .
( If you win , the cost of service of process is added to the amount of the judgment , so you 'll get it back if the defendant pays the judgment . )
Using the online yellow pages , just search in and around the city where the defendant lives , for ( a ) private process servers , and ( b ) the sheriff 's department .
I 've called process servers and sheriffs in many different cities , and they charge amounts ranging from $ 10 to up to $ 150 for substantially the same service , and I 've never figured out why .
Sometimes the sheriff is the cheapest , and sometimes it 's one of the private process servers .
But whoever you use , make sure to find out what they require you to send them .
They always require a letter of instruction tell them where to serve the papers on the defendant .
In addition , be sure to ask them : can they serve papers on behalf of a private individual , or will they only do it on behalf of law firms ?
do they require a money order or can they take a plain old check ?
Serving the defendant by mail .
Go to the post office and have the papers mailed to the defendant by certified mail with a return receipt .
Here , you have to make a choice .
IF you think the organization will actually show up in court ( usually , if they 're a well - established group and they do n't want to be hit with a deluge of lawsuits because one person sued them and won ) , then certified - return - receipt is all you need .
But if you think they might NOT show up and you want to have airtight evidence that you served the papers on them properly , you need to also send by restricted delivery to a person ( i.e. a real human , not a company and not the organization itself ) who is an officer of the organization .
If you have their registered agent 's name and address , that 's the person to send to by restricted delivery .
If you send by restricted delivery , it goes out with a little green card attached to it , and if the postal worker is doing their job , they should deliver the envelope only to the person listed as the recipient , and require them to sign the card and write their name legibly above their signature .
Then , the green card gets mailed back to you .
However , very often I 'd find that the cards would come back with illegible signatures and no names or the wrong names .
If you use this method , try writing on the envelope : " Attention USPS !
This envelope MUST be delivered to the person named as the recipient , they MUST sign for it and their name must be printed LEGIBLY above their signature . "
I never got around to trying this , since by that time I 'd given up on serving papers by mail , and always used process servers .
Basically , the trade - off is that the stricter you want to be about how the papers are served by mail , the greater the chance that it wo n't work ( e.g. if the mailman can't find the person ) , but the more solid your proof of service will be if they do n't show up in court .
If you serve the defendant using a process server , you 'll get back an affidavit of service in the mail .
If you serve them by mail , you 'll get a return receipt that ( if the judge accepts it ) will constitute your proof of service .
Negotiate with the defendant
Once you get your proof of service back in the mail , now the defendant knows they 're being sued , so you can try to negotiate a settlement .
This depends on your style , and theirs .
One thing to keep in mind :
Do n't worry if they threaten to tell the judge that you filed a lawsuit and then tried to " blackmail " or " extort " money from them or " shake them down " .
Judges encourage parties to settle lawsuits out of court .
Unless the judge thinks your lawsuit is bogus to begin with , they 're not likely to be swayed by the defendant claiming you tried to negotiate a settlement .
But assuming your efforts to shake down , extort , blackmail etc . the defendant were unsuccessful and they do n't want to settle , the next step is your day in court .
Preparing for court
Make sure you bring all of the following :
Your proof of service ( see previous steps )
A copy of the Telephone Consumer Protection
Act with parts ( b ) ( 1 ) ( B ) and ( b ) ( 3 ) ( A ) circled .
A copy of 47 CFR 64.1200 printed out from this link , which shows the text of the law with proper indentation and formatting and makes it easy to read .
Circle parts ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) .
A copy of 47 CFR 64.1200 printed out from the official government site .
Just to prove that the stuff you printed out in the previous step was n't something that someone made up and posted to the Web as a prank .
However the way they have it laid out is harder to read .
A transcript of the phone call that you 're suing over , if it was left as a voice mail , or if you managed to grab a recording of it with a handheld tape recorder when you first got the call .
In court
Before the judge appears , a mediator may ask if you want your case to be handled by mediation .
If the other party is present , I 'd recommend trying this option .
The thing to remember about mediation is that if you and the other party can't reach an agreement , you can always go back before the judge .
You 're not giving up your day in court by agreeing to mediation .
If you can't reach an agreement , or the other party does n't want mediation , or the other party is n't there , then when the judge calls you to present your case , show the judge your proof of service , your record of when you received the phone call , and the laws that make it illegal and specify $ 500 in damages .
What happens next varies wildly , depending on the judge .
Some of them are polite and some of them yell at almost everybody .
Some of them hate junk calls as much as you do , and some of them hate amateur wannabe lawyers clogging the court 's time because they saw one episode of Law & Order and thought they could do it themselves .
The future at this point is a fog that I can't predict , so I 'm not going to try .
All that I can shout blindly into the fog is that judges do appreciate it if you stick to the law , and not try to make any emotional speeches about why you think the issue is so important .
( All that happened to you anyway was that you got a phone call , which means you 're not going to win the sympathy game anyway , so do n't play ! )
You 're out of the fog ?
You won ?
Great , keep reading !
After you win
If the defendant does n't pay after 30 days , call a local collection agency and ask them what you have to do for them to try to collect the judgment .
Collection agencies normally do n't charge any money up front , and only take a percentage of what they 're able to collect .
Unfortunately it can be as high as 40 or 50 percent .
The upside though is that they do n't get paid if they can't collect , so you know they 're going to try .
From that point onward , the collection agency will be able to give you better advice than I can , so my narrative thread ends here , hopefully with you holding a judgment in your hands .
If enough people do this , maybe the problem will go away .
Then again maybe all that will happen is that more non-profits will start putting the name of their organization and their phone number in the pre-recorded calls that they make , which means that you can't sue them .
Then your only recourse is to call them up and chew them out , so make it good !

" Massensterben " vor den Kanarischen Inseln Ralf Streck
Die Abschottung Europas führt dazu , dass Flüchtlinge und Einwanderer immer gefährlichere Routen nehmen
Tausende Schwarzafrikaner haben in den letzten Monaten auf dem Weg von Mauretanien zu den spanischen Kanarischen Inseln ihr Leben verloren .
Die spanische Regierung musste nun einräumen , Berichte über das „ Massensterben “ schon letztes Jahr erhalten zu haben .
Nun baut Spanien in Mauretanien Lager für die auf , die im Schnellverfahren abgeschoben werden .
Im vergangenen Herbst versuchten Hunderte Einwanderer und Flüchtlinge aus Afrika immer wieder die Grenzzäune zu den spanischen Exklaven Ceuta und Melilla im Sturm zu nehmen ( Ansturm auf die neue Mauer ) .
Dabei wurden von spanischen und / oder marokkanischen Sicherheitskräften etliche Menschen getötet ( Spanische Gründlichkeit ) .
Zum Teil wurde sogar scharf auf die unbewaffneten Menschen geschossen .
Die Hintergründe sind bisher nicht wirklich aufgeklärt , aber die Lage hat sich aufgrund des Verfolgungsdrucks um die Exklaven derart beruhigt , dass das aufgezogene spanische Militär wieder abgezogen wurde .
Die Einwanderung nach Spanien wurde dadurch aber ebenso wenig beendet wie mit der Abschottung der Küste um die Meerenge von Gibraltar zuvor .
Zunächst wurde dort der elektronische Schutzwall ( Sive ) aufgebaut , der danach auf die gesamte Südküste ausgeweitet wurde ( Europa rüstet auf gegen Einwanderer ) .
Genau das hatte dazu geführt , dass viele den
Weg über die von Marokko umschlossenen spanischen Exklaven suchten .
Marokko schob , finanziert von Spanien und der EU , zahlreiche Schwarzafrikaner in Richtung Algerien und Mauretanien ab und setzte sie zum Teil schlicht ohne Wasser und Nahrung in der Wüste ab ( " Man muss die Flüchtlinge mit allem Respekt als menschliche Wesen behandeln " ) .
Einige versuchten dann ihr Glück in der von Marokko besetzten Westsahara ( Überraschende Entscheidung zur Westsahara ) , denn diese liegt nur knapp 100 Kilometer gegenüber der Kanarischen Inseln .
Aber die Westsahara ist kein sicheres Pflaster .
Seit dem Ausbruch der so genannten „ Intifada “ hat Marokko das Gebiet abgeriegelt ) .
Die Zahl der Polizei - und Militäreinheiten wurde vor den Feiern zum 30 .
Jahrestag der Ausrufung der Demokratischen Arabischen Republik Sahara ( DARS ) im Februar noch weiter verstärkt , um Proteste der Saharaouis gegen die Besatzung schon im Keim zu ersticken .
Angesichts der geographischen Verhältnisse war es klar , dass die Flüchtlinge und Einwanderer nach Mauretanien ausweichen .
Mit kleinen Fischerbooten , „ Cayucos “ genannt , versuchen sie seit November letzten Jahres verstärkt die knapp 1.000 Kilometer über das Meer von Mauretanien zu den Kanarischen Inseln zurückzulegen .
Das Ergebnis ist fatal .
Inzwischen streitet auch die spanische Regierung nicht mehr ab , dass es dabei Tausende Tote gegeben hat .
“ Eine stille Katastrophe , von der wir nur die Spitze des Eisbergs sehen “
Zuvor hatte sie versucht das Problem klein zu reden .
Dabei hatte die spanische Guardia Civil schon im Dezember einen Bericht mit dem aussagekräftigen Titel verfasst : „ Massives Sterben von Einwandern “ .
Der Autor war der Vize - Einsatzdirektor der Militäreinheit , José Manuel García Varela :
In den letzten 45 Tagen haben sich zwischen 2.000 und 2.500 Menschen in Paddelboote eingeschifft , um auf die Inseln zu kommen , von denen nur 800 oder 900 angekommen sind , was bedeutet , dass zwischen 1.200 und 1.700 im Atlantik ertrunken sind .
Die sozialistische Regierung hatte zuerst behauptet , den Bericht nie erhalten zu haben , um die Untätigkeit vor der „ humanitären Katastrophe “ zu erklären , wie das Internationale Rote Kreuz die Situation bezeichnet .
Deren Präsident Juan Manuel Suárez del Toro erklärte : „ Es ist eine stille Katastrophe , von der wir nur die Spitze des Eisbergs sehen . “
Am Dienstag musste Verteidigungsminister José Bono zugeben , dass die Regierung die Informationen sogar schon vor der Guardia Civil hatte .
Sie stammten vom Geheimdienst ( CNI ) , der die Regierung routinemäßig informierte .
Gehandelt wurde in Madrid aber erst , als kürzlich 45 Tote vor den Kanaren geborgen wurden und täglich eine größere Zahl „ Boat People “ auf den Urlauberinseln ankamen .
Dort fühlte man sich in der Ruhe derart gestört , weshalb die konservative Regionalregierung vom sogar von einem „ nationalen Notstand “ sprach .
Wie viele Menschen auf dem 1000 Kilometer langen Weg ihr Leben verlieren und verloren haben , darüber kann nur spekuliert werden .
Der Rote Halbmond in Mauretanien schätzt , dass täglich 700 - 800 Menschen das Meer zu überschreiten versuchen .
Seit Beginn des Jahres sind aber nur knapp über 3.500 Flüchtlinge tatsächlich angekommen .
Sollten die Schätzungen zutreffen , kann man sich das Ausmaß der Katastrophe ausmalen .
Lager in Afrika , um die Flüchtlinge abschieben zu können
Seither wird in Madrid hektisch gearbeitet .
Letzte Woche wurde eine Regierungsdelegation nach Mauretanien geschickt , um dem Land finanzielle und praktische Hilfe anzubieten .
Das Ziel ist , die Einwanderer und Flüchtlinge im Vorfeld abzufangen , weshalb Mauretanien auch Patrouillenboote erhält .
Am Dienstag hat das Verteidigungsministerium 35 Militäringenieure nach Mauretanien geschickt , die nun ein Lager in Nuadibú aufbauen .
Spanien nutzt die Situation nun , um weitere Schritte in Richtung der EU - Lager in Afrika voranzutreiben .
In dem ersten Lager sollen zunächst Schwarzafrikaner aus Mali und Senegal interniert werden , die man per Schnellabschiebung von den Kanaren deportieren will .
Gesprochen wird von 170 Menschen .
Menschrechtsorganisationen wie Amnesty International und die Flüchtlingskommission ( CEAR ) halten diese Abschiebungen für illegal , weil sie gegen die spanische Verfassung verstießen .
Sie gewähre Flüchtlinge ein Recht auf Asyl , aber bei solchen Abschiebungen hätten sie keine Chance , einen Antrag zu stellen , von einer Einzelfallprüfung gar nicht zu sprechen .
CEAR fordert auch Aufklärung über den rechtlichen Status der „ Aufnahmezentren “ die Spanien in Mauretanien errichten will .
Das Spanien mit einem Land kooperiert , in dem es bis heute Sklavenhandel gibt - offiziell wurde die Sklaverei erst 1980 abgeschafft - , spricht für sich .
Interessant ist , dass die Lager ausgerechnet humanitär begründet werden .
Die Abgeschobenen sollen in Mauretanien würdige Bedingungen erhalten , damit sie nicht schlicht in der Wüste abgesetzt werden , heißt es .
Allerdings hatte sich Madrid hinter Rabat gestellt , als Menschenrechtsorganisationen diese Praxis angriffen , für die es mit der Organisation „ Ärzte ohne Grenzen “ Zeugen gab .
Auch die Befreiungsfront für die Westsahara ( Polisario ) fand im verminten Gelände hinter der so genannten Sicherheitsmauer immer wieder von Marokko ausgesetzte Gruppen vor .
Die Praxis hat Marokko nicht beendet .
Erst letzte Woche hat Rabat erneut 81 Senegalesen im verminten Niemandsland ausgesetzt .
Mauretanien hat sich geweigert , sie aufzunehmen .
Letztlich ist die Abschottungspolitik für die humane Katastrophe verantwortlich .
Die Verantwortliche für Einwanderung der spanischen Regierung hat eingeräumt , dass die Einwanderer und Flüchtlinge nur die Routen gewechselt haben .
Wieder einmal kündigt Consuelo Rumí neue Schritte an .
Die Zusammenarbeit mit den Transitländern und die Kontrolle durch die Polizei soll erhöht werden .
Doch angesichts ihrer Lage , halten Flüchtlinge und Einwanderer daran fest , dass es immer einen Weg nach Europa gibt ( Es werden immer mehr Menschen kommen ) .
Nur wenn sich die Lebensbedingungen dort ändern , wird sich an dem Phänomen etwas ändern .
Die Abschottung führt nur zu immer gefährlicheren Routen und immer mehr Opfern und wird die Lage weiter zuspitzen .
( Ralf Streck )
Memory and future thought go ' hand - in - hand ' Human memory , the ability to recall vivid mental images of past experiences , has been studied extensively for more than a hundred years .
But until recently , there 's been surprisingly little research into cognitive processes underlying another form of mental time travel -- the ability to clearly imagine or " see " oneself participating in a future event .
Now , researchers from Washington University in St. Louis have used advanced brain imaging techniques to show that remembering the past and envisioning the future may go hand - in - hand , with each process sparking strikingly similar patterns of activity within precisely the same broad network of brain regions .
"
In our daily lives , we probably spend more time envisioning what we 're going to do tomorrow or later on in the day than we do remembering , but not much is known about how we go about forming these mental images of the future , " says Karl Szpunar , lead author of the study and a psychology doctoral student in Arts & Sciences at Washington University .
"
Our findings provide compelling support for the idea that memory and future thought are highly interrelated and help explain why future thought may be impossible without memories .
" Scheduled for advance online publication Jan. 1 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the study sheds new light on how the human mind relies on the vivid recollection of past experiences to prepare itself for future challenges , suggesting that envisioning the future may be a critical prerequisite for many higher - level planning processes .
Other study co-authors are Jason M. Watson , a Washington University doctoral graduate now assistant professor of psychology at the University of Utah ; and Kathleen McDermott , an associate professor of psychology in Arts & Sciences and of radiology in the School of Medicine at Washington University .
McDermott , principal investigator for the University 's Memory and Cognition Lab , where the research is based , suggests that the findings are notable for two reasons .
First , the study clearly demonstrates that the neural network underlying future thought is not isolated in the brain 's frontal cortex , as some have speculated .
Although the frontal lobes play a well - documented role in carrying out future - oriented executive operations , such as anticipation , planning and monitoring , the spark for these activities may well be the very process of envisioning oneself in a specific future event , an activity based within and reliant upon the same neurally distributed network used to retrieve autobiographical memories .
Second , within this neural network , patterns of activity suggest that the visual and spatial context for our imagined future often is pieced together using our past experiences , including memories of specific body movements and visual perspective changes � data stored as we navigated through similar settings in the past .
These findings , McDermott suggests , offer strong support for a relatively recent theory of memory , which posits that remembering the past and envisioning the future draw upon many of the same neural mechanisms .
Previous speculation has been based largely on the anecdotal observation of very young children , cases of severe depression and brain damaged persons with amnesia .
" There 's a little known and not that well investigated finding that if you have an amnesic person who can't remember the past , they 're also not at all good about thinking about what they might be doing tomorrow or envisioning any kind of personal future , " McDermott explains .
They comprehend time and can consider the future in the abstract sense ( e.g. , that global warming is a concern for the future ) , but they cannot vividly envision themselves in a specific future scenario .
"
The same is true with very small children -- they do n't remember particularly what happened last month and they can't really tell you much of anything about what they envision happening next week .
This is also the case with suicidally depressed people .
So , there 's this theory that it all goes hand - in - hand , but nobody has looked closely enough to explain exactly how or why this occurs .
"
In this study , researchers relied on functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to capture patterns of brain activation as college students were given 10 seconds to develop a vivid mental image of themselves or a famous celebrity participating in a range of common life experiences .
Presented with a series of memory cues , such as getting lost , spending time with a friend or attending a birthday party , participants were asked to recall a related event from their own past ; to envision themselves experiencing such an event in their future life ; or , to picture a famous celebrity -- specifically former U.S. President Bill Clinton -- participating in such an event .
The " Clinton - Imagine " task was introduced to help researchers establish a baseline level of brain activity for a cognitive event that was in many ways similar to the other two tasks but did not involve the mental projection of oneself through time .
Bill Clinton was chosen because pre-testing showed he was easy for participants to visualize in a variety of situations .
Comparing images of brain activity in response to the " self - remember " and " self - future " event cues , researchers found a surprisingly complete overlap among regions of the brain used for remembering the past and those used for envisioning the future � every region involved in recollecting the past was also used in envisioning the future .
During the experiment , participants were not required to describe details or explain the origin of mental images elicited by the memory cues , but in post - testing questionnaires most indicated that they tended to place future - oriented images in the context of familiar places ( e.g. home , school ) and familiar people ( e.g. family , friends ) , which would require the reactivation of those images from neural networks responsible for the storage and retrieval of autobiographical memories .
Conversely , the neural networks associated with personal mental time travel showed significantly less activity when participants imagined scenarios involving Bill Clinton .
The reason , researchers suggest , is that participants had no personal memories of direct interaction with Clinton , and thus , any images of him had to be derived from neural networks responsible for semantic memory � our context - free general knowledge of the world .
In fact , participants later reported that their mental images of Clinton tended to be less vivid ( e.g . " I see Bill Clinton at a party in the White House , alongside several faceless senators " ) .
" Results of this study offer a tentative answer to a longstanding question regarding the evolutionary usefulness of memory , " McDermott concludes .
" It may just be that the reason we can recollect our past in vivid detail is that this set of processes is important for being able to envision ourselves in future scenarios .
This ability to envision the future has clear and compelling adaptive significance .

Programming and Madness
I just read your piece entitled Programmers and really liked it .
I have some experience with understanding of human relationships , and with healing , I 'd like to discuss with you .
You may recall we met quite a while back , at the introduction to Frontier .
I was working for Dave Johnson , at Working Software .
I did the Word Services Apple Event Suite that allows Spellswell to spellcheck text in other programs via AE's .
I was n't always a programmer .
I originally studied physics , and wanted to get a PhD and be a scientist .
I 've even published some papers in the astrophysical journal and the physical review letters .
I spent most of my life from childhood through college preparing to be a scientist .
I had dreams of winning the Nobel prize .
I studied physics and astronomy at the California Institute of Technology , one of the most prestigious , and most rigorous institutes for these fields .
I even got to observe with the 200 inch telescope on Mt. Palomar .
But my education was disrupted by mental illness .
It started as severe depression .
But suddenly my mood brightened and I was on top of the world - I felt happier than I ever had .
After a short time I was quite out of control .
I got depressed again .
I started seeing visions .
I left school , spent a long time drifting , eventually transferred to UC Santa Cruz and continued a half - hearted effort at studying physics .
Once one of the best students at CalTech , I was suspended from UCSC for failing too many classes .
I attempted suicide twice .
In the summer of 1985 I spent six weeks in a mental hospital .
They gave me powerful tranquilizers but I was unable to sit still or even read the newspaper .
I was hearing disembodied voices talking to me .
Hallucinations , but the sounded as real to me as someone standing next to me .
The voices did not say much but they were deeply frightening to me .
I was diagnosed manic depressive .
I was given lithium to take , which is moderately effective at preventing mania - the high , what starts out as a happy , creative feeling but turns into frenzied insanity and paranoia .
It does not help for depression .
It also does n't help to turn a wrecked life into something worth living .
I spent a lot of my time on the computers at school .
UCSC had an open - access policy where any student could get on a Unix machine .
I whiled away my time writing programs , just to keep myself occupied .
After a while I managed to BS my way into a programming job .
I did n't know what I was doing but I made up for it by studying real hard .
I bought a Macintosh with a friend - $ 1000 for a used 512k .
We were so poor it was months before we could buy an external floppy , well over a year before we could upgrade it to a Mac plus .
I learned to program a Mac with 1 MB of memory , two floppy drives and no hard disk .
Eventually I saved up enough money to buy a 100 MB hard disk and my life got a lot easier .
I worked low - paid jobs as a system administrator and a tester .
Finally Dave Johnson was willing to take a risk on me .
He was broke and I was willing to work cheap .
But by then I knew my stuff .
Dave gave me a lot of freedom to create .
I had become particularly good at Macsbug debugging and this paid off on all the INITs I wrote for Dave , as well as all the debugging I did on his existing products .
I debugged QuickLetter , Spellswell , Lookup and Findswell , and went on to write Last Resort , Working Watermarker , Toner Tuner and the Random House Websters Electronic Dictionary .
Around the time you and I met , I organized a committee of our competitors in the spelling business , some word processor developers and folks at Apple to develop the Word Services Apple Event Suite .
The suite is a reality - it is not widely used , in part because of Apple 's failure to evangelize Apple Events or to use them in their own products , but the suite works very well .
I 'm very proud of it , and now I 'm writing a version of it for the BeOS .
I have Spellswell ported to Be already .
I won honorable mention in the Be Masters Awards at the May developer conference for it .
Sometimes I look back on this , and think of all the chaos I have been through , and it just amazes me .
It amazes me that I am even still alive , let alone as successful as I am .
Here is something important that I learned in the process .
It is something that they teach you in mental hospitals : Reality does n't just happen to you .
It is something that you make .
Most people think that the things they experience are real .
They think the world just sort of happens .
But they are wrong .
There is an objective reality , the reality of the physical world , but it is too complex and too detailed to be really experienced .
The physical world is also devoid of meaning and significance .
Most of it lies outside of our ability to sense it - we see only a narrow spectrum of the possible wavelengths of light .
We can not see things that are very small .
Our experience is first filtered physically by our senses .
Then we interpret it , first biologically - for example , bright flashes or sharp noises draw our attention as they warn us of danger .
Then they are interpreted by our culture and our personalities .
There is much we have in common with others in our society , so it appears that we share an objective reality , but this can be seen as an illusion if we go to a different culture , or if we enter a different reality by going insane .
One of the things I 've learned to do is to make a reality that I am comfortable living in .
One that is free of the fear and the despair of the insanity that I experienced .
I can do this on my own only temporarily - manic depression causes a powerful disruption in one 's brain chemistry that wipes out any form of conscious control .
To prevent this , I take a number of drugs .
Psychiatric drugs have a strange effect .
When I take them , other people change their behaviour .
Things that are true become false .
Things that are false become true .
A life that I am convinced will be filled only with despair for the rest of my existence becomes serene and even joyful .
The CIA stops tapping my phone .
Programming played a big part in my recovery .
Besides giving me a way to make a living , it provided me with a new identity .
The sort of analysis and problem solving that takes place while one programs helped me to understand my life .
I 've always had pariticular difficulty understanding human relationships .
It gave me a safe place to be while I learned to deal with other people .
I 'm starting to move beyond programming .
All of my life I have always derived most of my pleasure from my work .
I program at work all day and then go home and write code for fun .
I like to write screensavers and post them on the net .
I started programming the BeOS just for fun - I hope to make money off it but it would n't particularly disappoint me if I do n't .
It 's fun to program .
But I feel a void in my life that programming is not filling .
I 'm just starting to work on filling that void .
I 'm starting to find things to do that do n't involve programming .
I 've just started taking piano lessons , and have resumed practicing my art ( I taught myself to draw while I was insane at CalTech .
I was out of my skull but really was able to draw well ) .
I 'm becoming more involved with other people , making new friends .
I 'm starting to date women , something I 've never done much of .
I 'm doing well at managing my illness .
I 've been through the worst of times but that is past me now .
One thing I feel like doing now is raising the public consciousness about it .
I want to help other manic depressive people live better , and to be better understood by society .
There is still a tremendous stigma against mental illness .
Many people fear or distrust the mentally ill .
Mentally ill people often hide their illness , and live in fear of being exposed .
I 've written a web page about my experiences with manic depression .
Some of the mental health indexes have linked to it so I am starting to correspond with a number of people about it , other manic depressives or their friends and relatives or just curious people .
I 'm also starting to be more open about it .
After I worked for Dave Johnson a couple of years I told him about it and he has been very supportive of me .
I 'd like you to read this web page and tell me what you think .
I hope that you will find it interesting and useful .

A decision by Brazil 's Congress to curb the powers of labor auditors threatens to jeopardize an antislavery program that led to the release of more than 15,000 slaves and made Brazil a world leader in fighting indentured servitude , officials and activists said here this week .
Brazilian lawmakers passed a new law on Tuesday that unites two federal tax bodies in a bid to streamline a complex and bureaucratic system .
But one key amendment in the bill strips labor auditors and prosecutors of their power to determine the relationship between employers and employees .
The amendment was included at the behest of media companies , who routinely use freelancers and who , under the existing statute , could be punished for doing so by labor auditors .
Under the new law , judges are now responsible for defining that relationship .
An apparently unintended consequence of the change is that auditors can no longer determine what constitutes slavery , say prosecutors , auditors , and human rights activists .
" This will make it substantially more difficult to register and document incidents , " said Walter Nunes , president of the federal judges association .
The amendment also prevents prosecutors from leveling immediate fines on employers found to have deliberately kept slaves .
Until now , prosecutors who accompany government auditors to track down reports of slavery in the remote outposts of the Amazon jungle had the power to fine employers they determined were keeping slaves .
Last year guilty employers were forced to pay around $ 3 million in back pay to workers they used as indentured servants .
Congress 's decision was met with anger and disappointment by antislavery campaigners , who say it will neutralize all the previous work done by a government that had made eradicating slavery one of its proudest boasts .
" The campaign against slavery was successful because auditors were able to recognize slavery and demand that employers pay up , " said Rosa Jorge , the president of the auditor 's union .
" Now , employees have to go through the justice system , and there are two things that can happen , " she says .
" Either they cut a deal – and normally that is not good for workers – or they spend years waiting for the case to come to court .
But these slaves wo n't go to court , many of them do n't even now that courts exist . "
Brazil has a hidden but serious problem of slave labor .
The International Labor Organization ( ILO ) estimates that there are 40,000 slaves working in Brazil today .
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva made eradicating what he called " Brazil 's shame " one of his main goals , and he doubled the Department of Labor Oversight 's budget and increased the number of mobile antislavery units from four to seven .
The units follow up on reports of abuse in some of the most inhospitable places in this continent - sized nation and free workers lured into slavery by promises of big payoffs .
Workers are routinely taken to remote outposts and prevented from leaving , sometimes by armed guards .
The captives , most of whom are poor and unskilled , are put to work and made to pay exorbitant prices for basics like tools , soap , and food .
Many end up owing money , even after spending months doing hard work like cutting down trees or clearing cattle pastures .
Lula 's campaign was a huge success , with officials freeing more than 15,000 slaves since he came to power in 2003 .
The ILO lauded Lula 's efforts in a 2005 report on slavery worldwide .
Now , though , that work is in jeopardy , and unionists , lawyers , prosecutors , and human rights workers are banding together to pressure Lula into vetoing the amendment .
Myriad voices have condemned the clause , with judges saying it will add to the backlog in their courts , ministers calling it detrimental to the average worker and the Brazilian Bar Association ruling it unconstitutional .
About the only ones happy with the decision are big businesses .
The decision gives employers more leeway to deal with freelance employees , a move that , they argue , is vital in a job market where short - term contracts are increasingly common .
Large companies are now free to hire freelancers without paying them the benefits entitled to full employees .
Employers , moreover , will no longer be at the mercy of " the arbitrariness of auditors , " says Armando Monteiro , the president of the National Confederation of Industry .

RAMADI – Reports of the setting - up of U.S. - backed Sunni militias have brought new uncertainty to deepening chaos within Iraq .
Some Sunni leaders from the troubled al - Anbar province west of Baghdad recently met away from their tribes to set up new militias , according to local reports .
These new armed groups have received early praise from Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki and U.S. officials .
The United States had earlier called for the disarming of all militias for the sake of social peace and reconciliation , but that policy has clearly changed .
The occupation forces now back both Shia and Sunni militias in different areas of the country .
These new groups are drawing strong condemnation from other Sunni tribal chiefs .
“ They are a group of thieves who are arming thieves , and this is something dangerous and nasty , ” Sheik Sa’adoon , chief of a large Sunni tribe near Khaldiyah in al - Anbar , told IPS .
“ This only means we will have more disturbances here , and it could create local civil war . ”
Another tribal leader in the area , speaking to IPS on condition of anonymity , said “ they are only doing this in order to kill as many Sunnis as possible , and this time with Sunni hands . ”
He said true tribal leaders should lead any militias they form , rather than issue orders from the Green Zone , the U.S. and Iraqi government enclave in Baghdad .
“ Leaders should lead their soldiers on the battlefield , but those so - called sheiks are well protected behind concrete walls inside the dirty zone [ Green Zone ] , ” he said .
“ How can they win a battle by remote control ? ”
The controversial move appears to have brought widespread condemnation also from academics , Iraqi military leaders , and even Shia politicians .
“ It is a new way of making millions of dollars , ” a professor at al - Anbar University in Ramadi told IPS .
Brig .
Gen. Jassim Rashid al - Dulaimi from the new Iraqi army in Anbar province told IPS : “ I can not imagine 30,000 more guns in the Iraqi field .
I hope they will reject the idea .
Iraq needs more engineers and clean politicians to solve the dilemma of the existing militias rather than recruiting new ones to kill more Iraqis .
The idea sounds to me as turning the country into a mercenary recruitment center . ”
Shia leader Jaafar al - Assadi said the move will bring more violence .
“ Al - Anbar will fight even more now with the guns given to those fools , ” he told IPS .
“ They are surely going to sell their weapons to the terrorists or surrender to them sooner or later . ”
Some of these group leaders have distanced themselves from the new militias .
Sheik Hamid Muhanna , chief of the large tribe al - Bu Alwan , appeared on al - Jazeera denying the creation of such militia .
He said he and the other sheiks are in control of their tribes , and those who met Maliki speak for themselves only .
The main Sunni religious group , the Association of Muslim Scholars ( AMS ) , remains staunchly opposed to any continuation of the occupation .
“ It is all in the hands of the Americans ; we are trying to cover the sun with a piece of glass , ” Sheik Ahmed from AMS told IPS in Baghdad .
“ The occupation power is too strong for any player to make a major change , and so we should believe in our own capabilities without dreaming of useful solutions from our enemy . ”
The association has consistently refused to take part in Iraqi politics under U.S. occupation .
The new militias are riding the back of what is controversially referred to as federalism , under which each group appears headed its own way .
Thafir al - Ani , official spokesman for al - Tawafuq , a major Sunni parliamentary group , resigned as chairman of a constitution committee last week .
“ I would have had to take part in dividing Iraq under the flag of federalism , which would have put a mark in my history as one of those who established the dividing of my country , ” he said .
The solutions being put forth are all driven by personal and sectarian interests , and fail to consider what is best for the country , Maki al - Nazzal , a political analyst from Fallujah , told IPS .
“ The change that could take place is an Iraqi people ’s ‘ Orange Revolution , ’ which could occur with all Iraqis , regardless of their ID information , ” al - Nazzal said .
“ But that would be very dangerous without international protection to the people who would do it because Iraqi rulers today , together with the U.S. Army , could massacre demonstrators . ”
The “ Orange Revolution ” was the name given to public protests across Ukraine in November 2004 against a government and an election seen as illegitimate .
The revolution was widely believed to have had U.S. support .
A member of an Iraqi Human Rights non-governmental organization who asked to be identified as Ibrahim said the United Nations must take a stronger stand in Iraq .
“ The international community must take its real role in the country , ” he told IPS .
“ UNAMI ’s [ UN Assistance Mission for Iraq ] hands are tied , and they are only monitoring the disastrous situation without doing anything to help stop the bleeding of Iraq . ”

Sy Hersh tells us that the echos of Iran Contra weighed heavily in Negroponte 's decision to resign his post and is claiming that Bush is funneling money without authorization or oversight that has ended up in the hands of Sunni jihadist groups .
Download Download
The President is taking his notion of executive privilege to the extreme ---- running covert operations , using money that 's not authorized by Congress ... Negroponte is too ethical for Cheney ...
Hersh :
There has been some violence .
So America , my country , without telling Congress , using funds not appropriated , I do n't know where , by my sources believe much of the money obviously came from Iraq where there is all kinds of piles of loose money , pools of cash that could be used for covert operations .
All of this should be investigated by Congress , by the way , and I trust it will be .

Thanks to CNN for the full transcript :
BLITZER : Near the end of your article , you have this explosive point in there about John Negroponte , who is now going to be the deputy secretary of state , as opposed to the head of U.S. intelligence .
You write this : " I was subsequently told by the two government consultants and the former senior intelligence officials that the echoes of Iran - Contra were a factor in Negroponte 's decision to resign from the National Intelligence directorship and accept the position of deputy secretary of state . "
Explain what you were hearing , because that is obviously a very explosive charge .
HERSH : Yes .
It is probably the single most explosive , if you will , or depressing -- or distressing sort of thing I discovered in the last few months , which is simply this .
This administration has made a policy change , a decision that they are going to put all of the pressure they can on the Shiites , that is the Shiite regime in Iran , the Shiite -- and they are also doing everything they can to stop Hezbollah -- which is Shiite , the Hezbollah organization from getting any control or any more of a political foothold in Lebanon .
So they essentially , I quote the -- I saw Nasrallah , the head of Hezbollah , and he described it this way , as " fitna ( ph ) , " the Arab word for " civil war . "
As far as he is concerned , we are interested in recreating what is happening in Iraq in Lebanon , that is Sunni versus Shia .
And in looking into that story , and I saw him in December , I found this .
That we have been pumping money , a great deal of money , without congressional authority , without any congressional oversight , Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia is putting up some of this money , for covert operations in many areas of the Middle East where we think that the -- we want to stop the Shiite spread or the Shiite influence .
They call it the " Shiite Crescent . "
And a lot of this money , and I can't tell you with absolute certainty how -- exactly when and how , but this money has gotten into the hands -- among other places , in Lebanon , into the hands of three -- at least three jihadist groups .
There are three Sunni jihadist groups whose main claim to fame inside Lebanon right now is that they are very tough .
These are people connected to al Qaeda who want to take on Hezbollah .
So this government , at the minimum , we may not directly be funneling money to them , but we certainly know that these groups exist .
My government , which arrests al Qaeda every place it can find them and send -- some of them are n Guantanamo and other places , is sitting back while the Lebanese government we support , the government of Prime Minister Siniora , is providing arms and sustenance to three jihadist groups whose sole function , seems to me and to the people that talk to me in our government , to be there in case there is a real shoot - 'em - up with Hezbollah and we really get into some sort of serious major conflict between the Sunni government and Hezbollah , which is largely Shia , who are basically -- or as you know , there is a coalition headed by Hezbollah that is challenging the government right now , demonstrations , sit-ins .
There has been some violence .
So America , my country , without telling Congress , using funds not appropriated , I do n't know where , by my sources believe much of the money obviously came from Iraq where there is all kinds of piles of loose money , pools of cash that could be used for covert operations .
All of this should be investigated by Congress , by the way , and I trust it will be .
In my talking to membership -- members there , they are very upset that they know nothing about this .
And they have great many suspicions .
We are simply in a situation where this president is really taking his notion of executive privilege to the absolute limit here , running covert operations , using money that was not authorized by Congress , supporting groups indirectly that are involved with the same people that did 9/11 , and we should be arresting these people rather than looking the other way …
BLITZER : And your bottom line , Sy …
HERSH : … and could lead to a real mess …
BLITZER : Your bottom line is that Negroponte was aware of this , obviously , and he wanted to distance himself from it ?
That is why he decided to give up that position and take the number two job at the State Department ?
HERSH : He -- that is one of the reasons , I was told .
Negroponte also was not in tune with Cheney .
There was a lot of complaints about him because he was seen as much of a stickler , too ethical for some of the operations the Pentagon wants to run .
As you know , this Pentagon has been running covert operations .
I think Mr. Gates ' job and one of the things he wants to do is get some control over it .
But under Rumsfeld we were running operations all over the world with who knows what money and who knows what authority , because most of those operations were not briefed to the intelligence committees .
And the Pentagon has basically been open about it in saying , hey , this is military stuff that has nothing to do with CIA operations .
We have nothing to do with them .
We are running military operations .
And the president has the authority to do this .
But Negroponte was unhappy about -- in general about some of the things .
He also , I do n't think , liked -- he may not have been terrific at his job , that is another factor .
But certainly John Negroponte went through this issue , Iran - Contra in the ' 80s , when we had the first big debate over the use of unlawfully obtained money to buy arms .
We know , the whole arms - for - hostages business was to generate cash to fight the war -- the Contra war against the Sandinistas , that mess that we had .
Negroponte was ambassador to Honduras there , very sensitive to the issue that took place 20 years ago .
He did not want a repeat of it .
And I frankly -- it is something that I think to be asking him in congressional session or whatever .
But I have that -- you know , I understand this is very serious stuff .
And my magazine understands this is very serious stuff .
And we have really taken a lot of time with this story and couched it as carefully as we could and with all of the caveats , this is serious business .
BLITZER : The article is entitled " The Redirection : Is the Administration 's New Policy Benefiting Our Enemies in the War on Terrorism ? "
That is the subtitle , the author , Seymour Hersh .
Sy , thanks very much for joining us from Cairo .
HERSH : Thank you .
What started in a Petri dish like this one could ultimately provide protein for 500 million people every year ( Image : Kathleen Phillips / Texas Agricultural Experiment Station )
Cotton that has been genetically engineered so its seed is no longer toxic could provide protein - rich food for poor countries .
The researchers say the technology used could make other toxic plants safe to eat .
Cottonseed contains about 22 % protein , and the cotton already produced worldwide has enough protein to meet the requirements of 500 million people .
But it also contains the toxin gossypol , making it poisonous to animals , including humans .
In people , gossypol lowers blood potassium to dangerous levels , resulting in fatigue and even paralysis .
A surprising side effect is that gossypol is an effective male contraceptive , but research on this aspect was abandoned in the late 1990s .
Attempts to eliminate gossypol from cotton plants in the 1960s and 1970s failed : insects that had previously been kept at bay by the toxin happily ate the modified plant .
Keerti Rathore of Texas A & M University in the US has managed to remove gossypol from cotton seed without affecting the toxin load in the rest of the plant , meaning the plant will contain edible seed but not be destroyed by crop pests .
Reversed sequence
Rathore and his colleagues achieved this – after what he says has been a 10 - year race with teams in China and Australia – using RNA interference ( RNAi ) technology .
The team chose to target an enzyme that is critical in the production of gossypol .
They constructed a genetic sequence that would only be active in cotton seeds and which contained a portion of the enzyme ’s gene , followed by the same sequence in reverse .
They introduced their construct into cottonseed cells .
There , it generated a strand of messenger RNA with two halves which stuck to each - other in a hair - pin shape .
In cells , this hairpin RNA gets chopped up into small bits by a “ dicer enzyme ” and , through a mechanism that is not completely understood , the small bits stick to the original enzyme ’s messenger RNA .
This tags the RNA , labelling it for destruction by a cellular mechanism known as the RISC complex .
The net result is that the production of gossypol in the modified cottonseeds is interrupted .
Roast and grind
Rathore says the kernel of the non-toxic cotton seed can be roasted and salted and has a “ nutty flavour ” .
He says the kernel can also been ground into a flour and combined with wheat and corn flours to enrich them with protein .
Danny Llewellyn , a plant biologist at CSIRO in Australia who has also been trying to remove gossypol from cottonseed , says the research will “ allow cottonseed to be used more widely as an animal feed and extend its uses as a substitute for other high - value oils , like canola ( rapeseed ) oil . ”
Already , unmodified cottonseed is used in limited amounts to feed cattle , because bacteria in their rumen detoxify it .
But the modified seed could make cotton plants more valuable to farmers because they could sell the seed as feed for pigs and chickens , or even human food , once they have sold the fibres around the seeds .
“ It will certainly be a useful addition to cotton farmers in developing countries who grow cotton as a cash crop , ” says Llewellyn .
China and India are the world ’s first and third largest cotton producers , respectively .
However , many developing countries have long resisted the introduction of genetically modified crops and cotton farming has been criticised for the large amounts of irrigation water it requires .
Indian pea
“ RNAi technology is probably the most exciting technology of modern times , ” says Rathore .
“ Many scientists are trying to use it to address the problems of cancer , AIDS and heart disease , but the fact is that the same technology can be used to fight food shortages too . ”
He says it could be used to make another crop safe to eat , such as Lathyrus sativus , also knows as grass pea , chickling vetch , or Indian pea .
This legume is an emergency crop which farmers in Asia and Africa plant in times of drought because it is resists the toughest growing conditions .
L. sativus produces a high - protein seed , but also contains a neurotoxin which paralyses the lower body when eaten in large quantities .
“ A lot of times when you see people with this sort of paralysis in Asia it ’s because they are forced to plant grass pea , ” says Rathore .
He says RNAi is “ perfect ” to address the problem .
While Rathore ’s team has created gossypol - free cottonseed in the laboratory , the research remains in its early stages .
The trait has been shown to be stable in three generations of plants , but the team must demonstrate it is stable in field trials , and there will be a whole series of safety tests .
He does not expect his gossypol - free cottonseed to be on sale for at least 10 years .

If you have n’t heard by now , the ultra popular social network Facebook ( generally for college students ) got a pretty major facelift .
I logged into my account to find a new Facebook “ feed . ”
Apparently they did n’t want to be left out of the feed frenzy !
The last time I checked , there were 26,000 names on the petition to have this feed removed , and it keeps growing !
The general consensus with this new debut is that Facebook now crosses the line from “ Social Network ” to “ Stalker ’s Paradise . ”
The news feed looks something like : “ John added ____ to his favorite movies , ” or “ Susie and Kim are now friends ” or “ Lisa is now in a relationship ” ( complete with a heart ) or “ Dan added new photos ” ( complete with thumbnails of newly added photos ) , or “ Jeff joined the group– The Croc Hunter , a legend of our time .. RIP Steve Irwin . ”
It is literally a whole page - plus some of stalkish , useless information .
Some of the comments I have seen include “ Facebook is the ultimate stalkers dream now .. sick ” to “ I ’m thinking Facebook scares me . ”
There is even a group called “ Students Against Facebook News Feed ” with nearly 26,000 members ( and counting ) who say this is the official petition .
In comparison , there is a group titled “ Students in favor of Facebook News Feed ” with 17 lonely members .
I ’m sure there are some people who like every last juicy detail about every so called friend they have on their list .
That ’s why I think they need to make this an optional feature disabled by default .
They ’ve gone a little bit far now by making a feed of every single update and change a user makes .
Change can be good , but in this case I think they went a little too far too quickly .
They need to take a step back and take the feedback from the millions of users seriously .

Love on a farm boy 's wages
We need a new word for videogames .
The term was coined back in the 1970s to describe something that at the time was a completely new and revolutionary artform ( it must be barely conceivable to today 's gamers that there was a time in living memory when such things as games played on a TV screen simply did n't exist ) , and the image it conjured up was a straightforward one of Asteroids , Pac - Man and Space Invaders - that is , an abstract , magical and ultra-modern type of entertainment , born in technology and totally unrelated to any kind of leisure pursuit that had ever gone before it .
The very word " videogame " inherently depicted something exciting , glamorous and - because most games were located in arcades , places where under - 18s were n't allowed - slightly forbidden and dangerous too .
For want of anyone bothering to come up with a better replacement in the last 30 years , " videogames " is still the umbrella term we use for all forms of interactive electronic entertainment displayed on a screen , and as a result the clarity and purity of its meaning has been debased and corrupted .
Now , " videogame " encompasses everything from gruelling work simulators like Gran Turismo 4 or America 's Army to the town - hall nerd - conventions of online role - playing fantasy communities like World Of Warcraft , or the semi-interactive fiction of point - and - click adventures and single - player RPGs , or even TV quiz shows like Buzz .
There 's nothing actually wrong with any of those things ( well , for the purposes of this particular argument there is n't , anyway ) , but they 're not videogames .
THIS is a videogame :

FOR YOU .
Grid Wars 2 , by Mark Incitti , is a freeware game for PC and Mac .
It is , as the alert viewers of WoS will instantly recognise , not unlike Geometry Wars , the secret bonus game concealed within Project Gotham Racing 2 for the Xbox .
( Or to be strictly accurate , not unlike its sequel , Geometry Wars : Retro Evolved , which runs on the Xbox 360 and is the flagship title of the machine 's online service , Xbox Live Arcade . )
In itself that 'd be passingly interesting - particularly for anyone who did n't want to fork out £ 300 for a state - of - the - art , all - singing , all - dancing Xbox 360 in order to play a vector - graphics Robotron game - but while GW2 is undeniably closely related to GW : RE , it 's the ways in which it 's different that make it remarkable .
Remarkable , in fact , to the extent that it 's possibly the single most perfect piece of pure videogame design that this reporter has seen in the last decade .
The defining characteristic of all good game design - not just videogames - is the marriage between accessibility and depth .
If you can create a game that anyone can pick up , understand and start playing in seconds without having to even glance at an instruction manual , yet which players will still be organically learning the subtleties of , and developing new tactics and strategies for , hours and days and weeks later , then you 're a great designer .
Any idiot can do one of the two , and even experienced authors who seem to understand the skill of combining both can get it spectacularly right , and then catastrophically wrong , in two almost identical circumstances .
But GW2 creator Mark Incitti has taken a game that was already very delicately balanced , added and changed elements that fundamentally alter the nature of the gameplay , and still come up with something that recognisably possesses the character of its parent yet is a vastly - almost immeasurably - different , and superior , game .
And if we 're going to try to understand how such a feat can be achieved , we 're going to have to examine both why Geometry Wars is good , and why Grid Wars 2 is so much better .
If you remember Starstrike 2 on the Speccy , you 'll feel at home in this shot .
The original Geometry Wars and its largely - the - same 360 follow - up are both obvious and unashamed descendants of Eugene Jarvis ' legendary coin - op Robotron .
In all three games , the player is placed in a single static screen and then assailed by hordes of enemies from a small cast list , each exhibiting very distinct behavioural characteristics .
Some track the player slowly but relentlessly , some are fast , some try to avoid his fire , and so on .
Geometry Wars actually simplifies the already - stripped - down mechanics of Robotron , reducing the number of gameplay elements and removing the " levels " structure , replacing it with a single continuous assault .
To compensate , it racks up the speed , negating much of the tactical play that can be employed in the arcade game in favour of a pure reaction and co-ordination test .
The major innovation of Geometry Wars , though , is the introduction of black holes .
From time to time , unassuming - looking red circles appear on the GW playfield .
They neither move nor shoot , and if unmolested present no danger to the player except one of careless collision should you not be looking where you 're going .
However , if disturbed by a stray bullet or an enemy bumping into them , the black holes will spring to life .
Exerting an initially very weak gravitational pull , they draw enemies into their core , causing the hole to expand and spin and its gravity to increase , dragging in more and more enemies .
If the growth is unchecked by the player shooting bullets into it , eventually the black hole reaches critical mass and explodes , spewing out a horde of tiny enemies which spiral towards the player at high speed , normally resulting in his swift demise .
In the Geometry Wars games , that 's pretty much all there is to it .
In Grid Wars 2 , though , it 's only the beginning .
" Hey , cut out the damn choreography .
This is n't bloody Riverdance . "
In GW2 , y'see , despite all appearances you 're not really a space warrior at all .
What you are , in fact , is a farmer .
The black holes are your fields , and the enemies are your sheep and cattle .
If WoS was to write a " Have You Met Your Father ? " feature on Grid Wars 2 , its true ancestors would n't be Robotron and Geometry Wars , they'd be It 's The Wooluf ! and Command & Conquer , because this is really a game not about shooting space monsters , but about animal herding and resource management .
It 's fortunate , then , that your reporter is descended from a long line of shepherds , and is hence ideally suited to explain further .
The black holes contain the key to racking up high scores in GW2 .
Blasting baddies nets you only a few tens of points , and while staying alive and avoiding using your screen - clearing smart bombs will build up a multiplier ( the highest your correspondent has ever seen it get is 7x , and letting off a smart bomb scores zero points and resets the multiplier to 1x ) , it 'll still take you forever to break a million points just by wiping out waves of bad guys .
What you CAN do with them , however , is " bank " them by luring them into the black holes , and then blow up the black holes by repeatedly shooting them , which scores a LOT more points .
The finer workings of exactly how many more still elude this reporter at the time of writing , but if you really stuff one of those little dark stars with evil beasties before you wipe it out , you can easily notch well over 100,000 points from a single supernova .
To do this , however , you 'll have to " farm " the hole - this is , lure a lot of enemies into it until it expands , shoot it back down to a more manageable size , then lure some more in until it expands again , then keep repeating the whole process until you dare n't risk leaving it any longer and blow it to pieces .
( Because if you lose a life or use a smart bomb , the black hole is destroyed , you do n't get any points , and all your hard work will have been for nothing .
You wo n't even have an EU subsidy to show for it . )
And how do we farm a black hole , apart from " very carefully " ?
Well , that 's when Grid Wars 2 starts to get really clever .
" Hang on , I seem to have wandered into Gradius IV by mistake . "
If you 've been paying attention so far , you 'll have noticed the bit where we observed that the enemies in Geometry Wars " exhibit distinct behavioural characteristics " .
( And if you have n't been paying attention so far - ooh !
Are n't the pictures pretty ? )
And while none of the enemies which appear in both games have had these characteristics significantly altered in GW2 ( the only notable change is that the cluster of baddies generated by an exploding supernova now rushes straight at you instead of taking a looping path ) , the way their traits impact on the game relative to the " farming " principle has a whole new dimension .
In the Xbox games there simply is n't time to plan ahead at anything other than the tactical level .
( ie " How do I stay alive for the next three seconds ? " )
But the slightly slower pace and different scoring system of Grid Wars 2 open up strategic possibilities which simply do n't exist in Geometry Wars .
By exploiting the various ways in which the baddies react to your actions , it 's possible to deliberately and calculatedly cause them to spend most of their time not attacking you , but being dragged into black holes in their hundreds and getting helplessly trapped there until you destroy the holes for a big fat points bonanza ..
Sometimes it's as simple as putting a hole between you and a pack of enemies ( such as the dumb blue diamonds , which just head straight for you regardless of what might be in the way ) .
Sometimes ( eg with the green squares which run away from your shots ) it 's the slightly more sophisticated method of putting the enemies between the hole and your fire , driving them into the hole as they flee from the bullet stream .
Sometimes it 's desperately hovering at the edge of the black hole and shooting the enemies before they fall into it , because otherwise it'll be overwhelmed and explode before you have the chance to blow it up and get the points .
And sometimes , most terrifyingly , it 's sitting in the midst of a huge wave of deadly enemies on the edge of a whirling star of death and not shooting at all .
Your frazzled and shredded reporter lets off a smart bomb in a moment of weakness .
The latter scenario arises when you find yourself trapped on the same side of a large black hole as an onrushing pack of green baddies , with too much mayhem going on around you to get to the relative safety of the other side .
The enemies are all being pulled into the hole , but if you shoot at them the force of your bullets ' repulsion will actually overpower the hole 's gravity , giving the enemies a fraction of a second in which to do what they really want to do , which is barrel head - first into you .
Or , if you 're surrounded by the pink boxes with crosses in them , shooting them will cause them to break up into two smaller enemies which have a different , looping pattern of movement and are less susceptible to the hole 's gravitational pull , again allowing them just enough leeway to suicidally ram your ship .
So you have to sit there on the brink ( you have to get right up close , because as the stars expand their gravity repels your bullets and you need to be almost point - blank to hit them ) , fighting against the star 's gravity yourself , not shooting at these savage space monsters who are swarming menacingly just a few pixels away , while remaining constantly alert for other attackers ( like the tiny white pinwheels and blue circles who can pass through the black hole completely unaffected by its gravity ) , but sometimes also shooting frantically into the core to prevent it going critical as enemies from all side are hauled into its black heart .
( You can't shoot into the star all the time , or your bullets will still generate enough repulsion at that range to stop the baddies being drawn into the core .
It 's a tightrope act . )
Every fibre of your being is screaming out to pour laser death into the relentless attackers breathing right on your neck , or to unleash a smart bomb and release the unbearable tension , but you need to marshal nerves of steel and an iron will to fight the instinct and hold on in there to realise all the points you 've worked so hard to earn .
It 's exhausting .
The snakes are so lovely , and so passive , you feel a pang of guilt every time you shoot one .
But even when you 've mastered such demanding skills , all of this bitterly - won knowledge is still just tactical experience - short - term localised survival techniques .
To play Grid Wars 2 strategically - that is , to intelligently maximise your scoring over the entire game rather than just stagger from emergency to emergency - you 'll need to take account of the bigger picture .
And for those of you still scratching your head from nine paragraphs ago and going " Hang on - Command & Conquer ? " , that 's where Grid Wars 2 reveals its true nature .
It does n't , after all , take too much of a mental leap to see what GW2 takes from a game like It 's The Wooluf !
The similarity of the shepherding principles , the indirect persuasion of enemies to go where you want them to , is plain enough .
But Command & Conquer ?
How could a frenzied Robotron - derived retro shoot - 'em - up possibly share videogame DNA with a complex resource - managing real - time strategy wargame ?
Has WoS lost its mind ?
But there 's no need to fear for your reporter 's mental health , viewers .
Because if you 've got any kind of wits about you at all , it 's easy to grasp why at heart GW2 and C&C are built from the same blueprint .
It might help if you think of the Grid Wars playfield as being a C&C campaign map viewed from an orbiting satellite , with the footage being viewed on fast - forward .
This is real - time strategy all right , it 's just that the " time " part is moving a little quicker than you 're used to .
And the resource management ?
Oh , come on , alert and perceptive viewers of WoS .
Do we have to spell this whole thing out for you , or what ?
When black holes get big enough , they start to exert gravitational force on each other .
Your resources in Grid Wars 2 are , of course , personified by the black holes .
They 're both the bases which serve as your primary line of defence ( by drawing the enemies away from the mobile HQ represented by your ship and / or destroying them ) and the factories which turn the game 's raw materials ( the baddies ) into the desired end product ( points ) .
But just like in any good RTS , you have to manage them carefully - if you let too many black holes survive and grow , you risk losing control of the situation like a bad plate - spinning act in a circus , unable to react in time if one hole is suddenly overwhelmed by a wave of newly - generated baddies while you 're dealing with one on the other side of the screen .
And of course , exploding black holes unleash hideous swarms of particularly vicious enemies .
If you destroy too many of the holes as they appear , though , you 'll have no protection from the massive hordes of attackers that your guns alone are n't enough to cope with , and you also wo n't be able to take advantage of the huge points benefits they provide .
You can score reasonably well in GW2 just by staying alive and killing stuff , but the mathematics of the game 's difficulty progression means there 's a glass ceiling through which you 'll never break if you do n't master the art of black - hole - farming .
Man !
What a pickle !
Unchecked , they 'll form double - and triple - star systems which are a nightmare to control .
But this feature is n't meant to be a tips book .
There are so many tricks and subtleties to playing Grid Wars 2 that we'd be here for a week if we started listing them all .
The ramifications of the incredibly simple rules which govern the physics of how black holes act and move around the screen and link up and break apart could fill a whole chapter by itself , as could descriptions of the characteristics of the different enemies and how to exploit them .
( The game 's Red Clone enemies , for example - monstrously brutal attackers reminiscent of the Recognisers from Tron and who charge straight at you from behind the protection of a forward - facing force field - are right up there for pure evil with all of the most infamous opponents of videogame history , like Defender 's horrifying Baiters or the small spaceship in Asteroids .
The sheer joy of learning the various ways to outwit one and shoot him in his defenceless back is a pleasure I 'll leave you to discover for yourselves . )
It 's not even , ultimately , a piece just about how incredible Grid Wars 2 is .
For that , we'd have to rant on for another few thousand words about all of its other wonderful features , like the unparalleled use of perfectly - balanced audio cues to give the player complete knowledge of what 's happening onscreen without their ever having to take their eyes off the area around their ship ; the endless range of control options , offering totally customisable joypad , mouse or keyboard controls ( including 8 - way digital PS1 joypad , if you 're an old - skool purist like this reporter ) , shaming the lazy ineptitude of professional developers ; the wealth of game configuration choices , providing for completely different kinds of game ( this feature chiefly describes GW2 as played on a 1280x1024 playfield , but you can choose from 34 different sizes , for more arcadey or more strategic play as you prefer ) ; the open - source coding , supporting easy - to - implement user mods for custom graphics , sound and gameplay ; the beautifully simple and intuitive user interface ... well , we could go on and on .
The gang 's ( nearly ) all here !
( Heck , we have n't even touched on the game 's many less - tangible , but no less wonderful , qualities - the perfect balance between the enemies ' abilities and yours ; the ebb and flow of the single continuous level , with periods of incredibly intense activity offset by little breaks where you can catch your breath ; the tactical depth added by the need to chase and catch your power - ups , rather than being arbitrarily handed them as in Geometry Wars ; the sheer evocative beauty of the glowing neon graphics , triggering memories of Tron , Tempest and Blade Runner yet never allowed to overpower and obscure the action with pyrotechnic effects as can happen in the 360 game ; the unobtrusive yet atmospheric music ; the way the game changes character from minute to minute , one moment an intricate weave through a maze of shifting barriers and swooping snakes , the next a Butch - and - Sundance charge of foolhardy bravado against a solid wall of enemies ; etc etc etc . )
What we 're really here for , chums , is to appeal for clarity .
Because something like Grid Wars 2 does n't belong alongside TOCA Race Driver 3 , or Fable , or Guild Wars .
They have nothing in common except that they 're all displayed on a screen , and you would n't call a letter from the Gas Board a " book " just because they were both made of words , would you ?
TOCA is a simulation .
Fable is interactive fiction .
Guild Wars is a virtual community .
They all use the medium of electronic entertainment to reproduce some other type of activity in a more convenient or cheaper form , and hooray for them .
Some people like that sort of thing .
But Grid Wars 2 is a videogame .
You could n't do it on a board , or in a field , or on paper , or in a convention centre .
It 's a definitive example of an artform that did n't exist - could n't have existed - before Pong , and it deserves to be recognised as such in its own right .
If you care about the cultural perception and acceptance of gaming - and frankly this reporter does n't give a monkey 's nuts about that , but he DOES care about communication and language and universal understanding - you need to acknowledge that fact .
With two precious extra lives floating around , use of a smart bomb here is justifiable .
WoS apologises that this feature is a little all - over - the - place .
It 's part eulogy , part playing guide , part polemic and part random stream of consciousness .
The fact is , in the week or so your correspondent 's been playing Grid Wars 2 , its abstract forms and events have been firing ideas and observations and thoughts into his head almost as much as they 've been firing laser blasts at geometric shapes , and this feature can only brush fleetingly across the surface of most of them lest it end up 20,000 words long .
Not many books provide such mental stimulation , and certainly not a single " narrative - led " computer game ever has .
People will tell you that games like this are simple thumb candy , fairground reaction - testers deserving only of being condescendingly patronised in grimy little ghetto neighbourhoods of " retro " in the gleaming silver Delta City that is modern gaming .
Those people should be drowned at sea in rusted chains .
The best philosophy is not that which tells you things , but that which teaches you how to figure things out for yourself .
As long as videogames attempt nothing more noble than to feebly mimic other forms they 'll never attain such heights , and will never deserve to .
Only when they throw off the shackles of such low self - esteem and do the things that they alone can do , can they ever hope to achieve any true cultural worth .

" I wanted to see what it was like , " she said .
" It was O.K. to watch .
Once you had your mind made up to do it , you just suck it up and go with it . "
The solitary protester outside , Jim Dawson , 74 , stood a court - mandated distance from the clinic with a video camera , taping women as they entered , and promising them hellfire if they went through with it -- as he has for a decade .
Mr. Dawson drives 40 miles from Vilonia , Ark. , bringing cardboard signs that say " Abortion Kills , " and usually departs by midmorning .
On days when the clinic is closed , he pickets the Clinton presidential library .
" I do n't stop many of them , " he said , " but a little bit goes a long way . "
The Women
At the clinic , patients allowed a reporter to attend their consultations and even operations , but most spoke only if they could use just their first names .
" It 's not something I would talk about , " said " M , " a high school teacher who agreed to be identified only by her middle initial .
She wore a miniskirt and T - shirt , her blond hair pulled back from her forehead .
She said she had never discussed abortion with relatives or colleagues .
Only two friends knew she was here .
" I 'd lose my job , " she said .
" My family 's reputation would be ruined .
It makes me nervous even being in the waiting room .
You do n't want to know who 's here , you do n't want to be recognized , and you do n't want to see them ever again .
Because in society 's eyes , you share the same dirty secret . "
Even most staff members at the clinic insisted on using only their first names -- " to protect my identity from the antichoice people , " said Lori , a nurse practitioner .
Several said they had not told family members what they did for a living , or were ostracized if they had .
" My oldest son wo n't let me see my grandchildren , " said Sherry Steele , 57 , a surgical assistant who started working at the clinic after her daughter had two abortions .
The New York Times agreed to anonymity to encourage candor and to get a representative sample of women .
( Those who volunteer their full names are by nature an unrepresentative minority . )
On this August weekend , the women entering the Little Rock clinic resembled those who have abortions nationwide .
They were mainly in their 20's , more likely to be poor and African - American than the area population .
Most were already mothers , many single .
They arrived as a result of failure of one sort or another : a poor sexual decision , a broken relationship , a birth control method that just did not work .
More than half of all women who have abortions say they used a contraceptive method in the month they conceived , according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute , a research group that supports abortion rights .
While abortion rates have been falling generally since 1990 , the decline has been steepest among teenagers , and rates are lowest among educated , financially secure women .
Researchers attribute the drop in teenage abortion to reduced rates of pregnancy , as a result of better access to contraception -- including the three - month Depo - Provera injections -- and abstinence .
Syria ’s interior minister , Ghazi Kanaan — who was recently questioned by UN investigators over the assassination of Lebanon ’s former prime minister — has been found shot dead in his office .
President Bashar Assad may consider his minister ’s “ suicide ” as rather convenient , though in fact it could serve to weaken his regime
AFP
Kanaan ( left ) had been Assad 's man in Lebanon
SUICIDE is an oddly common exit for top Syrian officials .
Five years ago , a recently disgraced prime minister , Mahmoud al - Zubi , managed to shoot himself , repeatedly , while under house arrest .
Now the country 's interior minister , Ghazi Kanaan , has met a similar fate .
This latest death , however , is far more significant .
On Wednesday October 12th , Syria announced that Mr Kanaan had been found dead in his office , having supposedly shot himself in the mouth .
His death was disclosed only hours after he telephoned a Lebanese radio station to deny rumours about information he is said to have passed to United Nations investigators .
They had recently questioned him and other Syrian security officials over the assassination of Rafik Hariri , a former prime minister of Lebanon who had opposed Syria 's military and political domination of his country .
Mr Kanaan ended his radio interview by saying : “ I think this may be the last statement I give . ”
Almost simultaneously , Mr Assad was giving an interview to America 's CNN television , repeating his denials that he or his regime had anything to do with Hariri 's murder .
More intriguingly still , in another recent interview , the Syrian president said that if anyone in his government were found to have “ acted alone ” , this would be considered as treason , punishable by death .
Mr Kanaan was both a ruthlessly seasoned intelligence operator and a member of the Alawite minority that dominates Syria 's power elite ( and to which Mr Assad belongs ) .
For 20 years until 2002 , Mr Kanaan virtually ruled Lebanon in his capacity as Syria 's proconsul in the neighbouring state .
A master manipulator of Lebanon 's viciously contesting factions , he systematically bled Syria 's enemies before helping to seal the accord in 1989 that ended Lebanon 's 15 years of civil war and ensconced Syria as Lebanon 's final arbiter .
The ensuing peace , enforced by a security establishment that reported directly to Mr Kanaan , richly rewarded his friends , top Syrian generals and pro-Syrian Lebanese politicians alike .
Brought back to Damascus as head of the Political Security Directorate three years ago , before becoming interior minister in October 2004 , Mr Kanaan was a pillar of the regime .
But his apparent removal from direct oversight of Lebanon boded poorly for Syria 's fortunes .
Growing Lebanese resentment of Syrian tutelage erupted after the killing , in February , of Hariri , which many Lebanese instinctively blamed on Syria .
International opprobrium forced Syria to pull out its troops and undermined the patronage network created by Mr Kanaan , such that the Lebanese elections this summer produced a determinedly anti-Syrian government .
More damaging yet , the UN's investigation into Hariri 's murder fingered the Lebanese security chiefs that Mr Kanaan had put in place , several of whom were arrested .
Last month , the UN's chief investigator , Detlev Mehlis , pressed his inquiries still closer .
Bowing to intense diplomatic pressure , Mr Assad let him question senior intelligence officials , including Mr Kanaan and his successor in Lebanon until the Syrian withdrawal , Rustum Ghazale .
In the radio interview he gave minutes before his death , Mr Kanaan denied rumours reported in Lebanese media that he had handed the UN investigators extensive files on corruption in Lebanon during his tenure and had shown them photocopies of cheques he had received from Hariri .
As yet , the outcome of the UN team 's interrogations remains unknown .
Mr Mehlis is due to report to the UN Security Council within days .
Speculation has mounted , however , as to how Mr Assad 's fragile regime may respond if it is implicated in Hariri 's murder and told to surrender officials for trial .
Because Damascus is diplomatically isolated , and squeezed militarily between Israel and America 's forces in Iraq , Mr Assad may have concluded that it would be wise to offer a scapegoat .
Was that Mr Kanaan ?
Even if the UN sleuths ' trail of clues stops at the door of Mr Kanaan , that may not get Mr Assad off the hook .
The loss of such a stalwart figure in his wobbly regime seems likely to weaken it further , especially if Mr Kanaan 's allies find it hard to swallow the official line that his death was suicide .
The president , his clan and the ruling Baath party face a crisis as grave as any since his father , Hafez Assad , consolidated Syria 's dictatorship 35 years ago .
Where once it could rely on support from the Soviet Union and pan-Arab solidarity , Syria now has few friends in the world except Iran .
America is annoyed at Syria 's suspected abetting of Iraqi insurgents and at the support it offers other groups America regards as terrorists .
America 's ambassador in Iraq recently spoke darkly of “ all options ” being open regarding how Syria might be punished .
Should the Security Council be presented with proof of the Assad regime 's complicity — or worse — in the Hariri assassination , and should Damascus fail to hand over suspects for trial , Mr Assad 's government is sure to be punished by further isolation , and an internationalisation of sanctions that are now unilaterally imposed by America .
These would serve only to intensify the unrest that has been building in Syria at such ills as corruption and high unemployment .
Whether the regime would react to such pressures by reforming , lashing out or collapsing ( if not overthrown ) is hard to predict .

A US district judge sentenced notorious terrorist , Shahawar Matin Siraj , to 30 years in prison this past Monday for agreeing to blow up the 34th Street subway station in Manhattan .
The next day , by amazing coincidence , his family was arrested on immigration charges .
No doubt you ’re scratching your head , trying to recall who Shahawar Matin Siraj is .
If he ’s dangerous enough to merit 30 years in the slammer and a deported family , why have n’t you heard of him ?
Likely because his case does n’t pass the laugh test .
The usual suspects are bragging that their jihad against him has saved civilization , but it ’s shamefaced bragging of the kind you hear when a 10th - grader beats up a kindergartner .
They dare not ballyhoo their triumph lest the serfs finally rouse themselves and yell , " Are you serious ?
You ’re reading our mail and tapping our phones and groping us at airports because of guys like him ? "
Siraj was a 22 - year - old Pakistani working in Brooklyn , NY at an Islamic bookstore — located , ominously enough , next to a mosque .
Both Siraj ’s family and his attorneys have described him as " witless and impressionable . "
His uncle admitted , " He ’s my nephew , but he ’s not too bright … .
He ’s not dangerous , he just talks . "
Siraj ’s hours in the bookstore and the mosque , where he prayed , as well as his lack of sophistication recommended him to 50 - year - old Osama Eldawoody .
An Egyptian immigrant who became a US citizen , Eldawoody is also a " paid police informant . "
For several years after 9/11 , he and an undercover cop prowled both bookstore and mosque .
Eldawoody collected $ 100,000 of our taxes for chatting up " radical young Moslem men , " a.k.a. customers at the bookstore , and for reporting the license - plate numbers of cars parked at the mosque .
Would n’t it be easier if we simply required Moslems to wear yellow crescents on their sleeves ?
The snitch and his undercover sidekick honed in on Siraj , " not the brightest bulb in the chandelier , " and another dim wit as well .
James Elshafay is just 21 ; his short life has been nasty and brutish .
His Irish mother and Egyptian father separated when he was a toddler .
He suffers from schizophrenia and depression , as do other members of his family , and takes drugs of which Leviathan approves to counter these ills .
He took drugs Leviathan does n’t approve as a teen , perhaps because a " male relative " molested him .
He drank to excess , sniffed glue , and dropped out of the ninth grade in his school on Staten Island .
He volunteered for the Army , but he was so damaged even those body - snatchers would n’t have him .
In short , Elshafay and his friend Siraj sound more like threats to themselves than to the American Way of Life .
We ’ve all known folks like them : there ’s a glazed look in their eyes as they work to decipher such sentences as " You want fries with that ? " and " The red light means STOP . "
Often they ’re eager to please and readily agree to just about anything ; you could suggest a blind date with Hillary Clinton , and you ’d get a goofy grin and a " Sure ! "
Some of us , to our shame , may have mocked or even bullied children like them when we were kids .
Then we grew up .
We learned that wounded souls and minds are still worthy of respect , that their slow wits do n’t exempt us from the Golden Rule , and that only the truly vicious take advantage of them .
Enter Eldawoody , the NYPD , the FBI , and the whole apparatus of prosecutors , judges , and other criminals fighting a largely invented but highly useful " War on Terror . "
Eldawoody showed Siraj and Elshafay pictures of their fellow Moslems ’ torture at Abu Ghraib and told them US soldiers were raping Iraqi girls .
He claimed he belonged to a terrorist organization — well , OK , he does collaborate with the Feds — and could supply explosives .
According to Siraj , Eldawoody suggested “ blowing up the buildings and blowing up the Wall Street places . ”
Unfortunately for Siraj and Elshafay , the man pretending to be their friend and Moslem mentor , the one who told them his imam had declared a fatwa for killing Americans , was wearing a wire .
When Siraj exclaimed , " That [ US soldiers ’ raping Iraqi girls ] was enough for me .
I ’m ready to do anything .
I do n’t care about my life , ” Eldawoody ’s tape caught it .
Trying to impress the older man , Siraj also mentioned blowing up the 34th Street subway stop , which links to New York ’s Penn Station .
He and Elshafay allegedly possessed crude drawings of the station when they were arrested .
Siraj was tried and convicted in May .
The chief witnesses against him were the drugged Elshafay , the corrupt Eldawoody , and his own words , taped without his knowledge .
Siraj has no criminal record .
He was a member of no terrorist organization .
He possessed no explosives or other means of carrying out the scenarios Eldawoody concocted .
Nevertheless , Judge Nina Gershon sentenced him to 30 years .
Ray Kelly , New York ’s police commissioner , called this travesty “ an important milestone in safeguarding New York against terrorist plotters whether home - grown or foreign . ”
But Siraj ’s attorney described it truthfully : " In essence , what we have is the New York City Police Department creating a crime so they can solve the crime and claim a victory in the war on terror .
… What the government has done by painting this young man …as the mastermind behind the plot to bomb the 34th Street subway is really creating a devil so that they can lock up the devil . "
You might think Leviathan would rest content after entrapping and railroading " the devil . "
But no .
Now the beast is rampaging after Siraj ’s parents and sister .
Like torture , punishing a " criminal ’s " family is an ancient horror that modern , supposedly enlightened societies shun .
And like torture , Bush ’s Amerika has revived it .
This is especially infuriating since the Bible Bush claims to follow specifically condemns such injustice : " The fathers shall not be put to death for the children , neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers : every man shall be put to death for his own sin . "
( Deut. 24:16 ; see also Jer. 31:30 and Ezek. 18:1—13 . )
A dubious immigration battle cloaks the State ’s vindictiveness against the Siraj family .
These folks follow a form of Islam so secular their neighbors in Pakistan beat and burned Mr. Siraj .
He sought asylum here .
Our merciful bureaucrats rejected the application , so the family appealed .
That apparently makes them " fair " game for Leviathan .
But will the State bother with such an excuse the next time ?
When the rest of us are arrested for smoking pot , or for refusing to show ID , or for protesting the war , will our families be locked up , too ?
The passage in Deuteronomy continues almost eerily , " Do not deprive the alien or the fatherless of justice … "
Let us tremble with Jefferson when we reflect that God is indeed just and that His justice cannot sleep forever .

The study will analyse the language and style of texts
Researchers will scrutinise volunteers ' SMS messages to tease out patterns in the language and style of texts .
The University of Leicester team hopes the work will yield tools that allow identification of a text author .
Analysis of texts proved crucial in convicting Stuart Campbell of the murder of Danielle Jones in 2002 .
The 15 - year - old Essex schoolgirl disappeared in June 2001 .
Following a police investigation , her uncle Stuart Campbell was put on trial for her abduction and murder .
As part of his alibi , the defence showed two text messages purportedly sent by Danielle after she disappeared .
Analysis by a forensic linguist highlighted differences in the spelling of words before and after Danielle 's disappearance .
The prosecution said the later messages were sent by Mr Campbell after he had abducted Danielle , using her phone .
Mr Campbell was found guilty of her murder in 2002 .
Volunteers needed
The new study aims to build on this kind of analysis to develop a forensic toolkit for investigations involving texts .
The six month study will analyse the linguistic conventions of texters .
The different parts of speech that people leave out seem to be fairly consistent
Dr Grant , University of Leicester
Forensic authorship analysis , as the technique is known , is already used extensively for written documents like letters and e-mails .
It is often used to analyse abusive or threatening e-mails or in cases of copyright infringement .
It has not been widely used to study text messages .
" As texting is both a relatively new mode of communication and a particularly informal way of using language , there is not a strong expectation that texters will follow linguistic conventions , " said Dr Tim Grant , one of the team behind the study .
" This freedom therefore allows for significant individual differences in text messaging style , and this can be used to identify the text 's authors . "
The researchers are asking people to submit their texts to study
Although the study is still in its early stages , Dr Grant has some idea of what general patterns may emerge .
" There seems to be systematic variation in the words people leave out of text messages , particularly if you use predictive text messaging , " he said .
" You wo n't leave letters out , but to be quicker in the texting you will leave words out . "
For some people this will be pronouns , so they will write " went to the shop " rather than " I went to the shop " .
Others will leave determiners out , and will write " went to shop " .
" The different parts of speech that people leave out seem to be fairly consistent , but the purpose of the study is to find out if that is actually true , " said Dr Grant .
The team also hope to identify patterns that give clues to the age and gender of the author .
The team are now looking for at least 100 volunteers who are willing to hand over 10 messages for analysis .
They are particularly interested in groups of people who text each other .
" In all languages we know that groups tend to start sounding like one another , said Dr Grant .
" Text messaging is likely to be a microcosm of these more general linguistic features . "
The study will be conducted anonymously .

Nicholas Negroponte wants to make millions of the machines
The green machine was showcased for the first time by MIT 's Nicholas Negroponte at the UN net summit in Tunis .
He plans to have millions of $ 100 machines in production within a year .
The laptops are powered with a wind - up crank , have very low power consumption and will let children interact with each other while learning .
" Children will be able to learn by doing , not just through instruction - they will be able to open up new fronts for their education , particularly peer - to - peer learning , " said Mr Annan .
He added that the initiative was " inspiring " , and held the promise of special and economic development for children in developing countries .
Green machine
The foldable lime green laptop made its debut at the World Summit on the Information Society , which is looking at ways of narrowing the technology gap between rich and poor .
We really believe we can really make literally hundreds of millions of these machines around the world
Nicholas Negroponte , MIT
Net control row rumbles on UN predicts ' net of things '
It can also be held and used like a handheld games console and can function as a TV .
" The idea is that it fulfils many roles .
It is the whole theory that learning is seamless , " said Professor Negroponte , who set up the non-profit One Laptop Per Child group to sell the laptops to developing nation governments .
" Studies have shown that kids take up computers much more easily in the comfort of warm , well - lit rich country living rooms , but also in the slums and remote areas all around the developing world . "
There has already been firm interest in the machines from governments , though no laptops have yet been manufactured .
Professor Negroponte said he had asked the most enthusiastic countries , Thailand and Brazil , not to give written commitments to buy the machines until they had seen the working model , likely to be produced in February .
There has also been interest in the machines from five manufacturers and three big brand name technology firms , but no firm commitments had been made .
Big name supporters
The laptops will be encased in rubber to make them durable and their AC adaptors will act as carrying straps .
They have a 500MHz processor , with flash memory instead of a hard drive which has more delicate moving parts , and four USB ports .
They link up and share a net connection through " mesh networking " .
A working prototype of the machine was on show
" The initial plan is to start with countries that are big and very different to each other , " said Professor Negroponte .
" We are launching with six countries initially , then six months later , as many countries as possible . "
Those include countries in the Arab world , two Asian , one sub-Saharan , and South American nations .
The project also has some big name supporters on board , including Google , and media mogul Rupert Murdoch .
But it will rely on open - source software so that support for local content and languages can easily be built .
Although the laptops will initially be available to government only , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) is in talks with commercial manufacturers to make it available on the open market .
To take part in the initiative , governments have to commit to buying a million machines for around $ 100 each .
Mr Annan urged leaders and stakeholders at the summit to do their utmost in ensuring that the initiative was fully incorporated into efforts to build an inclusive information society .
" We really believe we can really make literally hundreds of millions of these machines around the world , " Professor Negroponte said , as costs continued to drop .
He added that it was critical that children actually owned , instead of loaned , the machines .
To overcome the potential problem of secondary " grey markets " for the machines , Professor Negroponte said the idea was that they would be so ubiquitous and prominent it would deter potential re-selling .
" I hope there would be community pressure so it does not appear in the secondary market .
The technology is in it so that the machine is disabled if not connected to the network after a few days , " he added .
Sharing and collaborating
Technical breakthroughs have already driven the prototype design , but every technical breakthrough in the next five years would mean costs would continue to fall , he said .
HAVE YOUR SAY
They could n't have chosen a different colour for those $ 100 laptops ?
That awful lime green will hurt the eyes after a while

One computer with a wi- fi or 3G net modem , for example , would share the connection with others in a classroom .
He explained that the display did not have a backlight or colour filters that more pricey LCD laptop displays used , so saved power .
Instead , bright LEDs are used which reduced power consumption by a factor of 10 .
The screens are dual - mode displays so that the laptop can still be used in varying light conditions .
Although children will be able to interact with each other through the machines , education was still the priority for the laptops .
But by using mesh networking , the vision is for children to interact while doing homework , and even share homework tips on a local community scale .
Collaboration will also be encouraged by using open - source software , which the children could develop themselves and use in local communities .
" Every single problem you can think of , poverty , peace , the environment , is solved with education or including education , " said Professor Negroponte .
" So when we make this available , it is an education project , not a laptop project .
The digital divide is a learning divide - digital is the means through which children learn leaning .
This is , we believe , the way to do it . "
The House version of the 2007 intelligence authorization bill would grant CIA and NSA security personnel the authority to make arrests for “ any felony ” committed in their presence , no matter how remote from the foreign intelligence mission it might be , the Baltimore Sun reported today .
Section 423 of H.R. 5020 “ appears …to grant to CIA security personnel powers that have little to do with the primary mission of ‘ executive protection , ’ and potentially creates a pretext for use or abuse of these powers for the purposes of general domestic law enforcement — something no element of the CIA has ever been empowered to perform , ” wrote Danielle Brian of the Project on Government Oversight in a letter to members of the House Intelligence Committee opposing the provision .
Section 432 of the bill grants similar authority to NSA security personnel .
The bill also includes measures intended to increase penalties for unauthorized disclosures of classified information .
See “ Congress cracking down on U.S. leaks ” by Siobhan Gorman , Baltimore Sun , April 25 .
BURIED IN THE NEWS last week was one of the most potentially significant stories of recent years .
The Military Times released its annual poll of active - duty service members , and the results showed something virtually unprecedented : a one - year decline of 10 percentage points in the number of military personnel identifying themselves as Republicans .
In the 2004 poll , the percentage of military respondents who characterized themselves as Republicans stood at 60 % .
By the end of 2005 , that had dropped to 56 % .
And by the end of 2006 , the percentage of military Republicans plummeted to 46 % .
The drop in Republican Party identification among active - duty personnel is a sharp reversal of a 30 - year trend toward the “ Republicanization ” of the U.S. military , and it could mark a sea change in the nature of the military -- and the nature of public debates about national security issues .
For most of U.S. history , issues of national security rarely divided Americans along sharp party lines :
The old adage that “ politics ends at the water ’s edge ” generally held true .
The military , while institutionally conservative with a small “ c , ” was not closely identified with a particular political party .
But somewhere between the end of the Vietnam War and the middle of the Clinton era , the U.S. military began to look like a wholly - owned subsidiary of the Republican Party .
The rightward shift was dramatic :
In 1976 , 25 % of civilians characterized themselves as Republicans , while 33 % of military officers were Republicans -- a military - civilian “ gap ” of only 8 % .
By 1996 , the military - civilian gap on party affiliation had grown to 33 % ; while 34 % of civilians self - identified as Republicans , so did a whopping 70 % of military officers .

In Britain , the Anglican Church used to be snidely described as “ the Tory Party at Prayer . ”
In the United States over the last 30 years , the military became , to a significant extent , the Republican Party at War .
The Republicanization of the professional military came about for many reasons , some obvious , some less so .
To some extent , it resulted from changing perceptions of how “ pro-military ” the two main parties were :
In the wake of the Vietnam War , the Democratic Party became associated , in the popular mind , with antiwar , antimilitary policies .
With the end of Vietnam - era conscription , which guaranteed a relatively representative military , a higher percentage of Republicans than Democrats may have opted to join the military ( at least as officers ) , while many career military personnel transferred their allegiance to the political party they saw as “ on their side . ”
But the Republicanization of the military was not just because of “ natural ” self - selection .
It also resulted from changed recruitment and base - closing policies , combined with the steady Republicanization of the American South .
The period since the late 1960s saw the closure of many northeastern ROTC programs and the expansion of those programs in the South .
By the late 1990s , more than 40 % of all ROTC programs were in the South -- mainly at state universities -- though the South is home to fewer than 30 % of the nation ’s college students .
Similar patterns in base closures have meant that disproportionate numbers of military personnel are now stationed at bases in the South and Southwest .
For a time , the Republicanization of the military became self - reinforcing .
The GOP has controlled the White House for all but 12 of the last 34 years and has made a determined effort to identify itself with the military and to court military voters .
By the turn of the millennium , the perception that Republicans were “ pro-military ” while Democrats were “ soft ” on defense had become an entrenched facet of American politics .

The latest Military Times poll offers the most telling evidence yet that this is beginning to change .
Although the reasons for the recent military flight from the Republican Party can only be guessed at , it ’s a safe bet that disgust at Bush administration bungling in Iraq is the single biggest factor .
The poll shows that only 35 % of military personnel approve of the president ’s handling of the war , and three - fourths of those polled say that the military is “ stretched too thin to be effective . ”
Anecdotal evidence suggests that many career officers also are skeptical of the administration ’s approach to combating terrorism and unhappy with its undermining of the norms of the Geneva Convention .
The partial de-Republicanization of the military is a hopeful sign -- and not just for Democrats .
A politicized military presents a threat to democratic ideals of civilian control .
Over the last 30 years , the Republicanization of the military also has had a deeply distorting effect on public debates about national security , making it almost impossible to question Republican national security policies without being labeled “ anti-military . ”
As we struggle to move beyond the horrors of Iraq , we desperately need to develop fresh approaches to changing security threats .
That requires a military that is n’t partisan -- and political leaders who wo n’t make posturing in front of the troops a substitute for responsible policies .

At PC World , we spend most of our time talking about products that make your life easier or your work more productive .
But it 's the lousy ones that linger in our memory long after their shrinkwrap has shriveled , and that make tech editors cry out , " What have I done to deserve this ? "
Still , even the worst products deserve recognition ( or deprecation ) .
So as we put together our list of World Class winners for 2006 , we decided also to spotlight the 25 worst tech products that have been released since PC World began publishing nearly a quarter - century ago .
Picking our list was n't exactly rocket science ; it was more like group therapy .
PC
World staffers and contributors nominated their candidates and then gave each one the sniff test .
We sought the worst of the worst -- operating systems that operated badly , hardware that never should have left the factory , applications that spied on us and fed our data to shifty marketers , and products that left a legacy of poor performance and bad behavior .
And because one person 's dog can be another 's dish , we also devised a ( Dis ) Honorable Mention list for products that did n't quite achieve universal opprobrium .
Of course , most truly awful ideas never make it out of somebody 's garage .
Our bottom 25 designees are all relatively well - known items , and many had multimillion - dollar marketing campaigns behind them .
In other words , they were made by people who should have known better .
In fact , three of the ten worst were made by Microsoft .
Coincidence ?
We think not .

An Empire of Liberty ?
by Ryan McMaken by Ryan McMaken

Robert Kagan ’s feature , " Cowboy Nation , " in the October 23rd issue of The New Republic , contends that the United States , contrary to the popular myth , is now and always has been a nation committed to aggressive and often violent expansionist tendencies .
As a leading neoconservative , Kagan ’s analysis is meant to prove that American intervention throughout the world is perfectly in line with the United States government ’s long history of projecting its power to every corner of the globe .
Thus , tradition allows and even demands that the United States continue to have its hand in domestic and international affairs from Tokyo to Rome and from Ottawa to Buenos Aires .
While I ’ll take exception to his conclusions here , it is nevertheless difficult to disagree with Kagan ’s assertion that America ’s history is indeed a history of aggression .
One need n’t know every detail of American foreign policy history or of the history of westward expansion to see that the history of America in the world is not the America of George Washington ’s Farewell Address , but is much more the history of Theodore Roosevelt ’s Great White Fleet and of Roosevelt ’s ally and disciple Albert Beveridge who made things quite clear in 1898 as he defended the American occupation of the Philippines with his speech entitled " The March of the Flag " :
It is a glorious history our God has bestowed upon
His chosen people ; a history heroic with faith in our mission and our future ; a history of statesmen who flung the boundaries of the Republic out into the unexplored lands and savage wilderness ; a history of soldiers who carried the flag across blazing deserts and through the ranks of hostile mountains .
… Therefore , in this campaign , the question is larger than a party question .
It is an American question … .
Shall the American people continue their march toward the commercial supremacy of the world ?
Shall free institutions broaden their blessed reign as the children of liberty wax in strength , until the empire of our principles is established over the hearts of all mankind ?
For Beveridge , the answer to these questions was obviously yes .
" Cowboy Nation " is subtitled " Against the Myth of American Innocence , " and Kagan asserts that while one can have a debate over the current role of the American state in the world , the position that the natural state of American affairs is one of international humility and isolationism , is based more on fancy than on fact .
In short , Kagan ’s argument is this :
The American Republic , driven by the ideology of liberalism , in its very essence , has always seen expansion and righteous aggression in the name of spreading its enlightened ideology as both justified and laudable .
Liberalism , that is , classical liberalism , accepts only one truth — the truth of universal rights , and that if the world will not acknowledge those rights , then it is the role of the United States to force it to do so .
Kagan takes the reader through a long list of American wars , interventions , and massacres that all occurred in the name of spreading liberty to every corner of the globe .
The blessings of liberty were to be spread , by force if necessary , across the American continent , and finally to Asia and beyond .
In all of its talk of peace , but of its frequent preference for war , Kagan contends that the American attitude is akin to that of the nationalist Henry Clay who , while agitating for an invasion of Canada in 1812 , declared " no man in the nation desires peace more than I , but I prefer the troubled ocean of war , demanded by the honor and independence of the country , with all its calamities and desolations , to the tranquil , putrescent pool of ignominious peace . "
While he does not phrase it as such , Kagan is illustrating a very specific phenomenon : the American penchant for accepting the use of authoritarian means to achieve liberal ends .
The American elites who promoted dozens of wars , invasions , and interventions throughout the history of the Republic , and the public which accepted them , accepted the proposition that liberty could be spread through despotism , and that enlightenment could be secured by the musket and bayonet .
The conclusion that such attitudes have their origins in liberalism is troubling .
Ideologies are composed of both ends and means .
For the classical liberal , the end is political liberty .
The liberal world is a world in which governments are established by men to protect natural rights , and if governments fail to protect the rights of those who have created them , justice demands that they be abolished .
In practical application , the means of the liberals from the Levellers to the Anti-Federalists to the Manchesterites had always been a weakening of the state through lower taxation , de-militarization , and decentralization .
Yet , the spread of the American state across the continent and beyond has produced something quite different .
Liberal ends can only be achieved through liberal means .
The notion that political liberty can be spread by illiberal means , that is , by means that violate natural rights wholesale — war , extermination , concentration camps , and conquest — is an incoherence rarely acknowledged by the proponents of such visions of glory and " national honor . "
The proposition for a global forced march toward " liberalism " forms a corrupted ideology in which governments shall be established for the world by Americans , and should those governments violate the natural rights of their subjects , they shall not be abolished without the express permission of the United States government .
Thus , far from being a catalogue of the grand victory of liberalism over the despotisms of the world , the history of American expansion and conquest is indeed a long tale of repeated defeat for liberalism at the hands of the nationalists who took it upon themselves to spread the blessings of liberty by whatever means deemed necessary .
Therefore nationalism , not liberalism , guides the history of American expansion throughout North America and beyond .
This becomes all the more clear when we witness that in the minds of Americans , the fortunes of liberty are assumed to be virtually inseparable from the fortunes of the American state itself .
Kagan addresses this issue tangentially , identifying " individualism " as the engine behind American expansionism .
From the very beginning , the culture of westward expansion was one in which the state was expected to provide the military infrastructure for the drive west .
As Kagan points out , settlers from the 17th century through the 19th demanded that the state protect the settlers ’ prerogatives to move westward in the Indian lands and the lands of other Europeans powers .
It is of no small importance that after the British Empire removed the French from North America , thus opening up greater opportunities for British settlers into the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys , the colonists later felt themselves much aggrieved that the British did not open up all the trans - Appalachian lands for settlement .
The British simply did not wish to provide the military personnel to deal with the settler demands for protection that they knew would come .
This was an important issue in the fomenting of the American Revolution , and after the United States secured the land all the way to the Mississippi with the Treaty of Paris , American settlers demanded that the American state clear the land of Indians and foreigners for American settlers .
Everywhere they settled , they expected and demanded protection from the United States government .
Settlers such as Joe Meek led delegations to Washington demanding military assistance from the federal government in order to control the Indian population and to rid the territories of foreign influence .
While many settlers moved west only to pursue their own fortunes and to mind their own business , at least as many moved west with the full expectation that the American government would not be far behind and would be prepared to drive off the Indians and to impose the blessings of liberty upon the land .
Everywhere Unionism prevailed , whether in Texas as the independent republic was absorbed into the United States — only to be crushed when it attempted to secede a mere generation later — or in California , where the founders of the short - lived California Republic never doubted for a moment the benefits of making way for the United States army to provide a buffer against both the Indian and Hispanic natives .
This was not " individualism " as Kagan calls it , but a deeply held nationalistic conviction among settlers that the destiny of the frontier was not to be one of free and independent communities , but one which projected the power of the American state across the continent .
Presumably , had the settlers been interested in self - government , they would have defended and governed themselves rather than repeatedly appealing to the American central government for aid .
Yet , this was not the case .
Few envisioned an independent and free land across the trans - Mississippi frontier as Thomas Jefferson once had .
Most wished only to gain their share of the new American Empire while cheap land was still available .
Thus , almost from the very beginning , the spread of liberty became synonymous with the expansion and empowerment of the American government .
To his everlasting shame , Jefferson undermined what little opposition there was among the old anti-Federalists of the early Republic when he convinced them to go along with the Louisiana Purchase .
New England Federalists and many Republicans saw the folly of it all .
But those who have succumbed to nationalism , as Jefferson did as President , have never had a problem with the ends justifying the means , and the unconstitutional Purchase , as Henry Adams described it , " gave a fatal wound to ‘ strict construction . "
John Randolph of Roanoke said simply , " the Louisiana Purchase was the greatest curse that ever befell us . "
But Jefferson , in one of the great oxymoronic moments of history , declared his intent to create an " empire of liberty . "
An empire , of course , that would require pacification of the natives , and a standing army to protect its borders .
The Louisiana Purchase was just a taste of what was to come .
In addition to creating a vast territory to be administered not by the states , but directly by the federal government , America ’s first great move west meant a sudden expansion in the responsibilities and commitments of the central government .
And this meant more taxes , more government , and more soldiers .
The purchase of the territory was peaceful , but how many lives and how much treasure were expended in countless Indian wars , in dozens of military outposts , and in international intrigues as the Republic drove to acquire more and more territory and to pacify , conquer , and spread " liberty " to foreign populations in both North America and beyond ?
As Robert Higgs has so thoroughly illustrated in Crisis and Leviathan , every new war , every new territory , and every new " victory " for the spread of American " liberty " brings greater and greater power to the American state , and greater and greater oppression to its people .
This happens through debt , taxation , through regulation , and through a thousand laws to crush a thousand perceived slights and threats to the Republic ’s boundless ambition .
And all the time , the need for defense of the new territories ever more convinced the population of the need for a vast standing army , the very thing once perceived as the greatest threat to liberty by the American revolutionaries .
But throughout the 19th century , and into the 20th , few ever questioned this legacy or its effects on the fate of American liberties .
Certainly , there was the American Anti-Imperialist League founded by Oswald Garrison Villard ( a future member of the " Old Right " ) and supported by the likes of Grover Cleveland and Carl Shurz , but their protests failed to have much impact .
During the Mexican war , William Lloyd Garrison ’s newspaper went so far as to openly hope for an American defeat , declaring that “ Every lover of Freedom and humanity throughout the world must wish them [ the Mexicans ] the most triumphant success . "
But the zeitgeist was never with the anti-imperialists .
As the United States moved from starting wars with the Mexicans and the Indians to seize lands and treasure , it turned to far away provinces of other world powers to satisfy the ambitions of Americans who really did agree with Beveridge that the United States could not stop its drive of militarism until " the empire of our principles is established over the hearts of all mankind . "
Kagan gets his history right , but the story of American expansion , far from a victory of liberalism over the despotisms of the world , is in fact a long eulogy told over the corpse of American Liberalism .
Liberalism had looked good , and many spoke well of it , but few showed much interest in the liberal program .
Many were convinced that liberalism could be transplanted from the young Republic across the globe using nationalist and other authoritarian means , but every year it becomes more apparent that somewhere along the line , the operation killed the patient .
Among modern critics of American foreign policy as too imperialist or too aggressive , there is often a feeling that somewhere in America ’s past , there was a time of isolationism and humility in which Americans and their political leaders were reluctant to become involved in issues beyond the nation ’s own borders .
It is difficult to see when exactly this time actually existed .
From Andrew Jackson ’s wars against the Indians of the Southeast , to the annexation of Texas , to the Mexican War , to the occupation of the Philippines , and finally to our own time , with the voracious drive for more territory , for more international prestige , national honor , and boundless international influence , the United States has never been , except for brief but glorious intervals , either isolationist or meek in the international sphere .
This does n’t mean that such a tradition is therefore inevitable or even justified .
Only if we wish to appeal to " tradition " or to the past for its own sake must we accept the past as a mandate for the future .
Spain , too , was once an aggressive and expansive power yet few Spaniards would today chose " the troubled ocean of war " over the " putrescent pool of ignominious peace " for the sake of taking Spanish liberty to the ends of the earth .
While they were usually ignored , the true defenders of American liberalism and American liberty provided a formidable tradition of their own .
The frenzy of nationalism , that perennially attractive drug to so many Americans , need not continue to be the bane of liberty forever .
The tradition of the partisans of peace and liberty can be embraced any time .
There are American critics of empire in every age .
From the early critics of the Louisiana Purchase , to the individualist anarchists like Spooner and Tucker and on to the Anti-Imperialist League and the Old Right , there have always been voices of dissent .
Their tradition is there and we would do well to learn from it .

Demonstrating against the constitution
AFTER three deadlines and painful negotiations , Iraq finally has a draft constitution , endorsed by leaders of Iraq 's Kurds and Shias .
Iraq 's president , Jalal Talabani ( a Kurd ) , said in a ceremony on Sunday August 28th that only the Koran is perfect , but the constitution was “ the first of its kind , written by representatives of important Iraqi factions ” .
But Sunni Arab leaders , who object to crucial provisions in the constitution , said the document was a failure and could provoke civil war .
Officially , the draft had been due on Thursday .
But the negotiators took several more days to try — ultimately unsuccessfully — to reach consensus .
Thursday night 's deadline came after a three - day extension the drafters had given themselves on Monday .
And Monday 's deadline was itself an extension from the previous Monday .
All of this delaying was in an attempt to get the Sunnis , who dominated Iraq under Saddam Hussein , on board .
Many of the contentious issues had been settled by Thursday .
For example , Islam is to be “ a basic source ” of Iraqi law , reflecting a compromise between religious Shias who wanted it to be the main source , and secular Iraqis ( including most of the Kurds ) who preferred to have weaker references to Islam .
Clerics will be allowed to serve on the supreme court , but they will not constitute a majority .
But while the religion issue has been settled , provisions in the constitution for a federal system of government remain unacceptable to the Sunnis .
The draft hands considerable powers to the provinces .
It also allows provinces to join together into regions .
The Kurds have controlled an enclave in northern Iraq since the first Gulf War in 1991 .
The Sunnis accept that they will continue to do so , but they are much less relaxed about the potential ambitions of the Shias , who are the biggest ethnic group in Iraq by some way .
Sunnis fear an Iraq dominated by a Shia super - region .
But since the Shias are a majority in Iraq , they would dominate any centralised government .
So why are many Shias for federalism and many Sunnis for centralisation ?
One reason is oil revenues .
The Kurdish - dominated north and the Shia - heavy south sit on nearly all of Iraq 's known oil and gas .
Some Sunnis feared that federalism would cut them out of a fair share of this .
Here , the Shias and Kurds compromised .
The constitution calls for revenues from the country 's existing oilfields to be shared according to the population of each province .
Revenue from new discoveries would belong to the province under which the oil lies .
This was seen as the best possible split between the haves and the have - nots .
But Sunnis — and some of the Shias that follow Muqtada al - Sadr , a radical cleric — see other problems with federalism .
Sunnis despise the Badr Forces , a militia allied to the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq ( SCIRI ) , one of the two main Shia parties in the current government .
SCIRI is close to Iran ; many of its leaders spent much of the Saddam era in the Islamic Republic next door .
And the Badr Forces fought alongside Iran during the long Iran - Iraq war in the 1980s .
Some observers worry that a Shia super - region in southern Iraq would be a foothold for Iranian influence .
So the constitutional deal struck between the Shias and Kurds has left the Sunni Arabs feeling coerced .
“ The streets will rise up , ” predicted Salih Mutlak , one of their negotiators , over the proposed federal system .
Indeed , on Friday thousands of Sunnis marched in Baquba against the constitution ( as did thousands of Mr Sadr 's Shia followers in eight cities including Baghdad ) .
A referendum on the constitution is expected to take place in October , in advance of general elections in December .
If two - thirds of voters in at least three provinces reject the document , it will fail , and the general election will produce another transitional government , tasked with picking up the pieces and pushing through a new version .
Sunni leaders are encouraging their followers to come to the polls — and more surprisingly , several militia groups , both Shia and Sunni , have been urging their supporters to do the same .
This apparent willingness to fight the constitution at the ballot box , rather than with bombs , is a step in the right direction .
Sunnis are thought to have a majority in four provinces , but it is not clear whether they can achieve the necessary two - thirds majority in three .
The Sunni provinces are also home to much of the current violence .
If this prevents voters from turning out , the constitution will appear even more to the Sunnis like a product made almost entirely without their input .
This would remove one of the rationales — pushed by the Bush administration — for setting the August deadline for drafting the document : that it would sap the Sunni insurgency that continues to take a toll on American troops and , in far greater numbers still , Iraqis .
With American nerves fraying , George Bush has his eye on the home front as well as Iraq itself .
Just 34 % of those answering a recent Newsweek poll approve of the president 's handling of the war .
And a CBS poll found that 59 % thought Iraq was not worth the loss of so many American lives .
Even Mr Bush 's supporters are starting to wonder .
“ By any standard , we 're not winning [ in Iraq ] , ” said Chuck Hagel , a Republican senator believed to be nursing presidential ambitions .
The current constitutional exercise will be one of the key determinants of overall success or failure .
If it works , Iraq may set a hopeful precedent for the entire Middle East , marking a big step forward in Mr Bush 's campaign to spread democracy to the region .
If it fails , it could mark the complete collapse of America 's Iraqi experiment .
Roma – Sul numero delle edizioni di Windows Vista si potrebbe aprire un banco scommesse .
C’è chi dice che saranno sei , chi dice che saranno sette e , dalle ultime informazioni trapelate on - line , si fa largo l’ipotesi che saranno addirittura otto .
Ad alimentare il Vista - scommesse è la stessa Microsoft , che pochi giorni fa si è lasciata sfuggire , in un “ angolino ” del proprio sito web , l’elenco delle edizioni in cui dovrebbe essere commercializzato il suo prossimo sistema operativo .
Stando a quanto involontariamente rivelato dal big di Redmond , Windows Vista arriverà sul mercato in sei edizioni base : Starter 2007 , Home Basic , Home Premium , Business , Enterprise e Ultimate .
A queste si aggiungeranno le versioni “ N ” delle edizioni Home Basic e Business , che similmente a Windows XP N , e in conformità alle richieste dell ’ Unione Europea , saranno prive del Windows Media Player .
“ Microsoft ha recentemente pubblicato una pagina web con lo scopo di testare il sistema di help di Windows Vista ” , ha affermato un portavoce dell ’azienda .
“ Questa pagina , che è rimasta on - line solo poche ore , conteneva informazioni incomplete sulla line - up della famiglia di prodotti Windows Vista .
Maggiori informazioni sulle edizioni di Vista verranno divulgate nelle prossime settimane ” .
Rispetto alla lista trapelata lo scorso anno , nel nuovo elenco manca all ’appello l’edizione Professional , inoltre la Small Business viene ora semplicemente chiamata “ Business ” : è probabile , vista la stretta somiglianza tra Professional e Small Business , che Microsoft abbia deciso di accorpare queste due edizioni in un unico pacchetto .
L’ultima differenza riguarda la Starter Edition , a cui Microsoft ha aggiunto il suffisso “ 2007 ” : questa modifica è stata probabilmente introdotta per differenziare ulteriormente questa edizione , specificamente indirizzata ai mercati in via di sviluppo .
La Starter Edition , che non porterà neppure il nome “ Vista ” , mancherà di molti dei componenti che faranno parte delle altre edizioni , tra cui l’interfaccia grafica
Aero e le funzionalità media center .
Windows Vista Business sarà all ’incirca l’equivalente di Windows XP Professional , a cui dovrebbe però aggiungere funzionalità integrate per il backup , il mirroring e la gestione dei fax .
L’altra edizione business , Windows Vista Enterprise , comprenderà anche il software di virtualizzazione Virtual PC e strumenti avanzati per la cifratura dei dati .
Infine , l’ Ultimate Edition dovrebbe sposare le caratteristiche delle edizioni Home e Business e condirle con qualche funzionalità aggiuntiva .
Inspired by projects that harness spare time on PCs , one programmer wants to hand back control of internet searching to users
Are you worried about Google 's growing dominance of the internet search market ?
Alex Chudnovsky certainly is .
To develop a community - led alternative , the Birmingham - based Russian programmer is building a new type of search engine .
By harnessing the power of distributed computing , he 's already managed to build an index that covers 1bn web pages .
He has called his venture Majestic - 12 , possibly a reference to the alleged secret committee formed after the 1947 Roswell UFO incident .
His passion for technically challenging work stems from worries about Google 's iron grip on the market , its tight control of search results , and even whether some sites are indexed at all .
" Because of their success , they have effectively created a monopoly in the virtual world .
Monopolies never end up well for consumers , " says Chudnovsky , who has developed search engines and other software for leading UK retailers .
" I want to build the biggest UK search index . "
He has a challenge .
The market research firm Nielsen / NetRatings says Google has a UK market share of more than 60 % , with Yahoo and MSN trailing by a substantial margin .
" To many , search and Google are synonymous .
Its dominance increases bit by bit each month , " says a spokesman .
Chudnovsky , though , wants to use the technique that has worked so well - at least for recruitment - for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ( Seti ) , cancer searches , climate change modelling and , most recently , cracking a set of encrypted messages sent from a submarine during the second world war .
Distributed computing lets many participants do little bits of work to create a huge result , using spare time on their computers .
Big shoes to fill
Chudnovsky has a huge result to follow .
Google stopped publicising the size of its search index when it reached 8 bn pages four months ago .
" We maintain the largest collection of documents searchable on the web , " says a Google spokeswoman .
" We estimate this expanded search index to be more than three times as large as any other search engine .
We update the entire index about once a month , and some areas more frequently . "
In his latest book " An Introduction to Search Engines and Web Navigation " Mark Levene , the professor of computer science at Birkbeck College , says Google has more than 15,000 servers and " crawls " - examines for indexing - 3,000 URLs per second .
( Other estimates have ranged from 31,000 to 79,000 servers . )
Your home PC is clearly no match .
For example , you cannot crawl more than 1 m pages a day on a 2 M bps broadband connection .
It will take you 8,000 days ( about 22 years ) to acquire a Google - sized but hopelessly out - of - date index .
The solution ?
Recruit like - minded people who donate computer time , as they do for Seti@home and other projects .
" Google 's database is about 8 bn pages , so fewer than 10,000 people taking part in this project can recrawl the whole of Google 's database every single day , " says Chudnovsky .
A large - scale distributed crawling project has been attempted and involved thousands at its peak .
Danny Sullivan , the editor - in - chief of Search Engine Watch , points to Looksmart 's Grub project ( http://grub.looksmart.com) of 2003 , which is no longer operational .
Majestic - 12's volunteers - 60 so far - are crawling about 50 m pages a day using unlimited broadband connections and software that runs in the background .
Over the past few months , 7bn pages have been crawled although , at 1bn pages , the completed index lags behind for now .
This is stored centrally to enable the Majestic - 12 distributed search engine ( via majestic12.co.uk ) to return fast , relevant results .
" Ideally , I 'd like to distribute the search index , " says Chudnovsky .
This is a challenging proposition that would see duplicate chunks of a huge index distributed between broadband - connected PCs .
There are also parallels with peer - to - peer systems such as Gnutella , which share music , films and software .
A small - scale experiment with one country , perhaps Finland , may happen later this year .
Professor Jon Crowcroft of Cambridge University says this type of collaborative web crawling and indexing is very reasonable .
" Many search engines do this to reduce the traffic load returning to a single central site - distributing the index itself is OK , so long as you have an efficient mechanism to search the index . "
These efforts also interest Professor Levene .
" I hope the project succeeds .
People finding novel ways of doing crawling or search is good for the competition , " he says .
Should Google , Yahoo , and MSN be worried ?
" It would be hard to push Google out of the way - they 're just going to buy you out . "
Chudnovsky 's aspirations are more community - minded , helping to develop a search engine that users control .
Nevertheless , his innovative code might revitalise searches on corporate websites or , more controversially , assist with search engine optimisation .
But as video , images and music are added to burgeoning search engine indices , crawling and search tasks will need to become more distributed .

First of all , thanks for the positive response to part 1 of this introduction .
Comments are very welcome .
The goal of this introduction is to write a " Mini Reddit " called " List It ! " .
The first part focused on the model component i.e. the underlying data and how to implement it using an SQLite database .
This second part will concentrate on the view component , which presents the data to the user .
The third part will be on the controller .
Our user interface consists of two pages : the frontpage shows the list of links with the highest scores and the submission page where a user can enter the name and url of a new entry .
To give an impression of where we are headed , here is screenshots of the final result :
In the Model - View - Controller organization , the controller receives a request from the client ( user ) , retrieves data from the model , lets the view construct a web page and the sends a response back to the client .
The view thus consists of a series of functions turning datainto web - pages .
PLT
Scheme supports multiple ways of representing web - pages .
One option is to use strings :
Since the structure of the document is lost with this choice , all but the most simple manipulations of the document , becomes harder to program than they should .
Instead we will use X - expressions ( S - expressions representing XML ) to represent our web - pages .
The above example becomes : Besides X - expressions another popular choice in the Scheme world is SXML ( if you are into serious XML - manipulations look into SXML and SSAX ) , which are similar to X - expressions in terms of use .
The beauty of X - expressions is that , since they are normal lists , we can use the builtin functions to manipulate them .
Another major convenience is we can use unquote ( written as a comma ) to insert the result of a Scheme expressions into the X - expression : which , when evaluated , results inAttributes are placed right after the tag :
To avoid writting boilerplate stuff ( charset , stylesheet , content type etc. ) each and every time a web page is constructed , we will use the general web framework from PLaneT ( the PLT Scheme " CPAN " - note that packages are downloaded automatically if needed ) .
In the example above , theonly received the body , so it used the site wide default arguments for the title , the stylesheet and the " header " .
Obviously we need to override the defaults for our List It ! site : After overriding the defaults we get :
Use the keywordswithe , in order not to use the site wide defaults .
The funtionbuilds an X - expression representing the submission page .
It takes no arguments , since it does n't rely on data from the model :
The submission page consists of a form with two input fields .
One for the url and one for the title .
The functionrececives a name of the form , the action .
The default method for submitting is POST , but one can use the keyword argumentto choose something else .
The functionbuilds an input field .
Other types of input fields are : andClicking the submit button will post the parameters action , url and title to The submitted entries are ranked according to their score .
The entry with the highest score has rank 1 , the next rank 2 and so on .
Only a limited number of entries can be showed at a time , so we imagine the entries divided into pages .
The functionbelow receives three arguments : a page number , the rank of the first entry of the page in question and the list of entries
The functiongenerates an X - expression for the " menu " on top of the screen
The functiongenerates an X - expression representing the list of entries .
The " menu " consists so far of a single menu item " submit - new - link " .
The list of entries is received byas a list of vectors .
The first vector holds the column names in the database , and can thus safely be ignored .
A DIV of class " entries " is used around the list of entries , so we single them out in the stylesheet .
Next we use an eager comprehension list - ec to generate a list of X - expressions , one for each entry .
Since we want the result to be of the formand notwe use unquote - splicinginstead of just unquote .
The eager comprehension first checks to see , whether entries is the empty list - and if so , an empty list of X - expressions is generated .
The clauseiterates over the elements of the list entries ( minus the first element ) , binding entry to each element in turn , also the index variablecounts from 0 and up .
The clause ( : match # ( id header url score ) entry ) uses pattern matching to bind the variables , andto the elements of the entry vector .
The final expressioncan now use the variables to generate the X - expression for the entry in question .
The table is used to position the rank , the up - and down - arrow and the link .
I am able to do the same in CSS - but not in all browsers at the same time .
The alert reader will probably wonder , why the form is introduced .
Why are n't the arrows two simple links to , say , Well , a click at the above url would result in the entry getting a vote .
The problem lies in what happens next .
If the user now reloads the page , the entry will get an extra vote .
Bookingmarking the page will also result in extra votes , when the user returns .
The form - solution sends the parameters " behind the scenes " , so that the url becomes .
This obviously solves the bookmarking problem .
The reload problem is solved via the Post / Redirect / Get pattern - which I 'll discuss in detail in the post on the controller .
The functionbuilds a link that submits the form ( it 's in the web - framework ) , it involves a little JavaScript .
The functionreturns an X - expressionrepresenting various images .
In this tutorial only the up - and down - arrow is supported , but if anyone is interested , I have a version supporting all of Tango ( an excellent source of icons ) .
Web2.0 = Ajax / Cometなの？とかプロセスIDは今でも16ビットなの？とかはサテオキ、
個々のクライアントがサーバに要求する処理量は小さなものでハードウェアの性能上は問題がなくても、あまりにもクライアントの数が多くなるとサーバがパンクする――。これが最近Web開発者の間で話題となっている「C10K問題」（クライアント1万台問題）だ。
Ajax やCometなどのクライアント側技術に伴うサーバ側の問題に関していろいろ誤解があるようなので,書いておきたい.きっとlingrの中の人はこの記事読んでニヤニヤしてるはず.
以下、記事にないことも書いてあるのでそのつもりで.
誤解その1 Ajaxによ るWebアプリの台頭でサーバ側の負荷が増大する
Ajaxの典型的な使い方はサーバに問い合わせてページの一部分だけを
変化させるというモノだ.これはページ全体を書き換える従来の方法と違い ,
すでにレンダリングされている画像の呼び出しなどがなくなるので,かえって
サーバへの負荷が下がるケースもある .
つまりあ るWebアプリを操作するのに必要なクリック数が一定だとすると,Ajaxによってサーバ側の負荷はおおむね下がる.
もちろんマウスオーバなどでサーバに問い合わせるようなサービスに関してはこの限りではない.
誤解その2 1コネクションの維持に1スレッドもしくは1プロセス必要
サーバ側から見た場合,クライアントからopenされたソケットというのは
単なるオープンされたファイルディスクリプタになる.よってそれを
維持するのに1プロセスもしくは1スレッドが必要ということはない.
ネットワークプログラムでforkやスレッドが必要なのは,ソケットからの
要求に対して同時並行的に処理を行う必要があるからで,cometのように
クライアントからの書き込み要求は 別Port,あとは大多数の
維持コネクションへの処理を行うケースに関しては当てはまらない.
またソケットからの要求のwatchに関しても
http://d.hatena.ne.jp/yamaz/20061106
で書いたようにselectのようなビジーループ方式ではなく ,
kqueueやepollなどのイベントドリブン方式の処理を行うことで
十分にスケールできる .
ところ でTCPのコネクションとはいったい何だろうか?
実態として はTCB( Transmission Controll Block ) と呼ばれる構造体で ,
FreeBSDだとtcpcbという名前で/usr/include/netinet/tcp_var.hに
定義されており,1コネクションごとに生成されカーネルメモリ内に格納される.
これはTCPのコネクションに関するデータが保存されており ,
TCB がカーネルに存在することをもって , TCP の仮想チャネルが実現されている .
誤解その3 コネクションが増えるとソケットの数が不足する
ソケットは確かに不足するが,カーネルパラメータで増やすことが可能だ.
またカーネルがソケット1個を保持するのに必要なメモリもたかが知れてる
ので問題にはならない .
誤解その4 コネクションが増えるとポートの数が不足する
これはよくわからないのだが,これも時々同僚から聞いた.曰く、
「 TCP ヘッダ のPort用のフィールドは16ビットだから65536
コネクションまでしか扱えない 」 ということらしい.たしかにPort用のフィールド長は変更できないので ,
ホントだったら大変だ.しかしTCPはコネクションを
( クライアント 側IP , クライアント 側 Port , サーバ 側IP , サーバ 側Port )
の組で管理しているので , 同一IPから65536のコネクションが張られない限り問題は起きない.
NAT 越しのアクセスで6万5000ものコネクションが張られるケースだと問題は起きるかも知れないが ,
いずれにしてもクライアント側の問題でサーバ側には関係ない.
結論 というわけ でOS やプロトコルの制限 がC10K の ネックになることはなく ,
cometのような小さな処理の1万2万程度の同時コネクションならば
正しい対処を行うことによって今のPCマシンで余裕で対処できる.
よって引き続きネックになるのはマシンパワーであるというのがyamaz的見解だ.
マウスやキーボードの挙動すべてがサーバ側に送られる未来はあまり
想像したくないが,仮にそうなったとしてもベンダーにだまされること
なく , あわてず騒がす対処していきたい . ( おしまい ) 1/18追記 どうも勘違いさせる文章だったようなので,フォローアップしました.あわせて読んでいただけると幸いです.

I 'm guessing that anyone reading this is already familiar with the idea of programs that output themselves .
If you 're not there 's a great list of such programs here .
But what I was surprised to discover at the weekend was that there is in fact a bit of general theory about this .
In particular , what do we need in a computer language to guarantee we can write a self - replicator ?
Consider the following in Haskell : Evaluate this expression in an interactive Haskell session and it prints itself out .
But there 's a nice little cheat that made this easy : the Haskell ' show ' function conveniently wraps a string in quotation marks .
So we simply have two copies of once piece of code : one without quotes followed by one in quotes .
In C , on the other hand , there is a bit of a gotcha .
You need to explicitly write code to print those extra quotation marks .
And of course , just like in Haskell , this code needs to appear twice , once out of quotes and once in .
But the version in quotes needs the quotation marks to be ' escaped ' using backslash so it 's notactually the same as the first version .
And that means we can't use exactly the same method as with Haskell .
The standard workaround is not to represent the quotation marks directly in the strings , but instead to use the ASCII code for this character and use C's convenient %c mechanism to print at .
For example : Again we were lucky , C provides this great %c mechanism .
What do you need in a language to be sure you can write a self - replicator ?
It turns out there is a very general approach to writing self - replicators that 's described in Vicious Circles .
What follows is essentially from there except that I 've simplified the proofs by reducing generality .
We 'll use capital letters to represent programs .
Typically these mean ' inert ' strings of characters .
I 'll use square brackets to indicate the function that the program evaluates .
So if P is a program to compute the mathematical function p , we write [ P ] ( x ) = p( x ) .
P is a program and [ P ] is a function .
We 'll consider both programs that take arguments like the P I just mentioned , and also programs , R , that take no arguments , so [ R ] is simply the output or return value of the program R. Now we come to an important operation .
We 've defined [ P ] ( x ) to be the result of running P with input x .
Now we define P( x ) to be the program P modified so that it no longer takes an argument or input but instead substitutes the ' hard - coded ' value of x instead .
In other words [ P( x ) ] = [ P ] ( x ) .
P(x ) is , of course , another program .
There are also many ways of implementing P( x ) .
We could simply evaluate [ P ] ( x ) and write a program to simply print this out or return it .
On the other hand , we could do the absolute minimum and write a new piece of code that simply calls P and supplies it with a hard - coded argument .
Whatever we choose is irrelevant to the following discussion .
So here 's the demand that we make of our programming language : that it 's powerful enough for us to write a program that can compute P( x ) from inputs P and x .
This might not be a trivial program to write , but it 's not conceptually hard either .
It does n't have gotchas like the quotation mark issue above .
Typically we can compute P( x ) by some kind of textual substitution on P.
With that assumption in mind , here 's a theorem : any program P that takes one argument or input has a fixed point , X , in the sense that running P with input X gives the same result as just running X. Given an input X , P acts just like an interpreter for the programming language as it outputs the same thing as aninterpreter would given input X.So here 's a proof : Define the function f( Q ) = [ P ] ( Q ( Q ) ) .
We 've assumed that we can write a program that computes P( x ) from P and x so we know we can write a program to compute Q( Q ) for any Q .
We can then feed this as an input to [ P ] .
So f is obviously computable by some program which we call Q. So [ Q ] ( Q ) = [ P ] ( Q ( Q ) ) .
Now the fun starts :
In other words Q( Q ) is our fixed point .
So now take P to compute the identity function .
Then [ Q ( Q ) ] = [ P ] ( Q ( Q ) ) = Q ( Q ) .
So Q( Q ) outputs itself when run !
What 's more , this also tells us how to do other fun stuff like write a program to print itself out backwards .
And it tells us how to do this in any reasonably powerful programming language .
We do n't need to worry about having to work around problems like ' escaping ' quotation marks - we can always find a way to replicate the escape mechanism too .
So does it work in practice ?
Well it does for Haskell - I derived the Haskell fragment above by applying this theorem directly , and then simplifying a bit .
For C++ , however , it might give you a piece of code that is longer than you want .
In fact , you can go one step further and write a program that automatically generates a self - replicator .
Check out Samuel Moelius 's kpp .
It is a preprocessor that converts an ordinary C++ program into one that can access its own source code by including the code to generate its own source within it .
Another example of an application of these methods is Futamura 's theorem which states that there exists a program that can take as input an interpreter for a language and output a compiler .
I personally think this is a little bogus .
If you 're a dj , and you buy your music on CD , you might go out and play for a packed house some time .
And why should n't you ?
You 've paid for the music , and your venue will have a PRS licence to cover the public performance .
If you 're a bit more modern , you might download the tracks instead - as we know , there 's no great saving for you doing so , as the prices of downloads are artificially inflated so the cost of a track on record and a track without the overheads of physical distribution costs the same .
You go to the same venue , with the same public performance licences , and you 're sorted .
Right ?
Wrong .
Apparently , for no reason other than the music you 're playing is coming from a laptop , you 're expected to have another £ 200 licence .
Why ?
Because the music industry is greedy .
That 's not what Peter Leathern , Business Affairs director of the PPL , is saying , of course .
They 're being reasonable .
They are reasonable men :
" Rather than saying stop it , do n't do it , we 've actually tried to embrace what people want to do and come up with a licence to be able to do that . "
Is n't that great of them ?
What guys .
But how can your average dj - a person who 's more likely to be an enthusiast than a superstar , making a few quid and possibly being paid in drinks instead of actual money - come up with £ 200 ?
Is n't that going to wipe out not just the profit margin for a lot of small djs , but also raise their expenses beyond a manageable level ?
Leathern reminds them they have a choice :
" You do n't actually have to DJ using a laptop .
You can use vinyl , you can use CD , so we 're saying that if it's not worth your while spending £ 200 then do n't do it . "
Yeah , you cheapskates - you keep struggling with your boxes of vinyl if you do n't want to help carpet the PPL offices and keep the indoor fountains flowing at record company HQs around the world .
The PPL are being reasonable :
Mr Leathem said the licences were intended to make life easier for DJs , who could buy a single licence instead of having to contact the individual copyright owner of each track for permission .
And they 're not going to come and seek you out .
Not yet :
He said PPL would not take action to enforce the licences in the early stage of the scheme .
But once awareness had grown , it would start pursuing unlicensed DJs , who could face penalties including legal costs and breach of copyright damages .
Venues would be urged to check DJs were licensed before hiring them and those who turned a blind eye could also find themselves in trouble with the law .
Of course , what the reasonable Mr. Leathern does n't explain is how the venues are to tell the difference between a bunch of tunes on a laptop which have been recorded from someone 's vinyl collection ( which - and forgive us if we 're wrong here , but copyright law seems to shift everytime a guy in a London office fancies a new doughnut - is perfectly okay and covered by existing licences ) , and which have been downloaded .
Of course , if they 're going to be forced by the threat of legal action to police the souce of music being played in their rooms , they 're going to take the line of least resistance and ban anyone who wants to use digital djing .
But do n't worry : they 're all reasonable .
Robert Hardaway , a professor of law at the University of Denver who wrote “ The Electoral College and the Constitution : The Case for Preserving Federalism ” ( 1994 ) , has counted 704 efforts to change or abolish the Electoral College .
Most , he said , were ill advised , including this one .
“ It ’s legal , but it would be a terrible idea , ” Professor Hardaway said .
“ Look at the trauma the country went through having a recount in Florida .
Suppose what would happen , in the face of a close national election , if we had to have a recount in every little hamlet . ”
Dr. Koza , whose dissertation at the University of Michigan was titled “ On Inducing a Nontrivial , Parsimonious Grammar for a Given Sample of Sentences , ” said the idea came to him in early 2004 , although he and Barry Fadem did not go public with it until February .
Working with state lotteries as chief executive of Scientific Games in Atlanta , he had learned how interstate compacts work .
Multistate lotteries like Powerball are based on such compacts .
What , he wondered , if a similar agreement bound states together to thwart the Electoral College ?
“ The bottom line is that the system has outlived its usefulness , ” said Assemblyman Thomas J. Umberg , the Anaheim Democrat who sponsored the bill here .
“ It ’s past time that Americans should elect their president by direct vote of the people . ”
Mr. Umberg and his staff met some of Mr. Schwarzenegger ’s top staff members on Wednesday and came away encouraged about the prospects of the legislation .
Although they received no commitment , it was clear that the governor , a Republican , was seriously considering the question and had not made up his mind about it , Mr. Umberg said .
“ It ’s anybody ’s guess which way he ’ll go , ” Assemblyman Chuck DeVore , an Irvine Republican who opposes the bill , said .
“ He ’s not your normal partisan politician . ”
National Popular
Vote bills were proposed in six legislatures this year .
California ’s was the only one to pass it , though the Colorado Senate voted for a version .
The group has found sponsors for bills in 22 states next year .
The Mystery of Falling State Corporate Income Taxes
The share of corporate profits in the U.S. collected by state governments via the corporate income tax has fallen sharply in the past quarter century .
Some commentators have even referred to this as the “ disappearance ” of the state corporate income tax ( SCIT ) .
Such claims , of course , are an exaggeration — after all , a longer perspective reveals that the share of profits collected by state corporate income taxes was actually lower in the 1960s than it is now .
Nonetheless , state public finance experts and state policymakers surely are correct in noting that , since around 1980 , corporate income taxes have become an increasingly smaller share of total state tax revenues and a smaller share of businesses ’ costs .
This Economic Letter attempts to unravel the mystery of falling state corporate income taxes by analyzing the primary determinants of these taxes and reviewing how they have changed in the last 25 years .
The primary factors determining SCIT
Before discussing the possible causes of the decline in SCIT / profits , it is useful to go over how corporate business income is taxed by states .
First , a corporation determines its federal taxable income ; in general , states use this as the basis for their own corporate income tax .
The corporation then allocates this income to any state in which it has a sufficient presence — or “ nexus ” — according to each state ’s allocation formula .
Once a business has allocated income to a state , it then subtracts any state - specific deductions ( for example , federal tax payments are deductible in a small number of states ) to arrive at state taxable income .
Finally , the firm applies the legislated ( or statutory ) corporate income tax rate to its state taxable income and then reduces that amount by the value of any state - specific tax credits .
Thus , three factors influence a state ’s corporate tax revenues as a share of profit ( income ) — its apportionment of federal taxable income , its legislated tax rate ( adjusted for deductions ) , and its tax credits — and common trends in these factors among states will have similar effects on the aggregate share of profits captured by state taxes .
In addition , this aggregate share will be affected by the share of corporate profits that is considered federally taxable and by the distribution of income across states .
How have the primary SCIT factors changed ?
One area of change has been in the formulas dictating how businesses allocate federal taxable income to the states .
Although each state has leeway in choosing its formula ( subject to the strictures of Public Law 86 - 272 , which bans states from taxing businesses with no physical presence in the state ) , traditionally , the formulas have required a business to allocate income to a state in proportion to its share of the business ’s nationwide sum of sales , payroll , and property , where each of the three is equally weighted .
However , over the past 30 years or so , most states have increased the weight on sales in this formula ( some all the way to 100 % ) to encourage businesses to invest and create jobs in their states .
As a result of different apportionment formulas , it is quite possible for more or less than 100 % of a business ’s income to be allocated among states .
For example , a manufacturer located in state A that sells its product in state B could end up allocating much less than 100 % of its federal taxable income to states A and B combined if state A ’s formula were based only on sales .
Some states have “ throwback ” rules to tax at least a portion of the income that escapes state taxation , but these are limited and far from universal .
The increasing non-uniformity across states in apportionment formulas over the past 30 years has afforded businesses increasing latitude to site operations so as to maximize the share of federal taxable income that escapes state taxation .
It is likely that this increased non-uniformity has contributed to the declining share of profits captured by states .
However , it also should be noted that the non-uniformity trend appears to have reversed itself somewhat in recent years , with the majority of states now weighting sales primarily or exclusively , so the contribution of this factor has probably waned .
A closely related factor that many state tax experts have pointed to for the decline in SCIT is increased tax planning or avoidance by businesses .
As Figure 1 shows , it appears that avoidance of federal corporate income tax ( FCIT ) is probably not a significant part of this explanation , as SCIT has fallen not just relative to total profits but also relative to FCIT over the last 25 years .
Still , there are other possibilities to consider .
For example , in recent years , a good deal of attention has focused on the use of so - called passive investment companies or PICs .
Because a handful of “ tax haven ” states do not tax specific forms of income , such as trademark royalties or interest income on loans , large multistate businesses often set up subsidiaries in these states to which the rest of the company pays large royalty fees or interest on loans .
This effectively shifts income out of other states and into the tax haven states , avoiding state taxation on the income .
The use of PICs has become increasingly common since the mid-1980s .
Intracompany income transfers are not publicly reported , so the extent to which this could explain the decline in SCIT ’s share of profits is unknown , but it seems likely that it is of at least some significance .
A third factor that would lower the share of profits captured by state corporate taxes could be a trend toward lower state tax rates , especially if it occurred disproportionately among states with large shares of national income .
In fact , however , corporate tax rates have been roughly constant , on average , since 1980 .
This is shown in Figure 2 , which plots the average top marginal corporate income tax rate among states from 1980 to 2004 .
( These rates have been adjusted for the deductibility of federal taxes from state income for those few states that allow such deductibility ) .
The figure provides both an unweighted average and an average weighting states by their 2004 gross state products ( as a proxy for corporate income ) .
While both measures have fallen since 1992 , they are at or above where they were in 1980 .
Thus , the decline in state corporate taxes ’ share of profits since 1980 cannot be attributed to changes in legislated tax rates .
Another possible factor behind the decline in state corporate taxes ’ share of profits could be shifts in economic activity toward states with lower tax rates .
Fisher ( 2002 ) analyzed this possibility in detail and found that states with higher legislated tax rates actually have experienced faster economic growth than other states , at least since the late 1980s .
Moreover , there is a zero , or a slightly negative , correlation between legislated tax rates and the sales - weight in apportionment formulas , so it does not appear that high tax rates are offset by more favorable apportionment rules .
A final important determinant of state corporate taxes is credits .
Many states offer businesses various tax credits to encourage particular activities .
The two most common types are investment tax credits ( ITCs ) and research and development ( R&D ) tax credits ( RDTCs ) .
The value of a credit is determined by multiplying the credit rate by some measure of the targeted activity , such as capital expenditures .
A trend toward higher credit rates , even if the level of targeted activity remains the same , would have a negative effect on state corporate tax revenues .
To the extent that these credits have shifted economic activity , and , hence , corporate income , toward states offering these credits , the negative effect is even greater .
Figure 3 shows that average credit rates for ITCs and RDTCs have indeed risen dramatically since 1980 .
The average ITC rate rose from 0.2 % in 1980 to 1.4 % by 2004 , while the average RDTC rate rose from 0 to 3.5 % .
The increase in each of these average credit rates is due to a combination of an increase in the number of states with credits and an increase in the credit rates for those states with a credit .
In 1980 , just six states had an ITC and no state had an RDTC .
By 2004 , 20 states had an ITC and 31 had an RDTC .
A simple back - of - the - envelope calculation provides a rough sense of the extent to which these tax credits could explain the declining SCIT share of profits .
Based on national data on business investment in equipment and structures and R&D , combined with the average credit rates , I compute that the amount of these credits ( combined ) grew by $ 22.4 billion between 1980 and 2004 .
If average credit rates had not changed , the credit amount instead would have grown by just $ 1.7 billion ; hence , about $ 21 billion can be attributed to the change in credit rates .
If this $ 21 billion were added to 2004 state tax revenues , I calculate that the SCIT share of profits would have fallen by about 25 % rather than the 50 % fall that actually occurred .
Conclusion
This Economic Letter has discussed a number of possible factors behind the steep drop in state corporate tax revenues as a share of profits since 1980 .
The average credit rate for the two most common types of credits has risen considerably since 1980 , while there has been no decline in corporate tax rates and no apparent shift in economic activity toward states with lower tax rates .
I find the increase in average credit rates could explain around half of the decline in SCIT ’s share of profits .
The increasing non-uniformity of taxation across states and the increasing exploitation of this non-uniformity also likely has played a role .
Specifically , the non-uniformity in apportionment formulas and the use of passive investment companies likely have increased the share of federal taxable income that escapes state taxation altogether .

Software products exhibit two general kinds of quality , which affect software schedules in different ways .
The first kind of quality that people usually think of when they refer to “ software quality ” is low defect rate .
Some project managers try to shorten their schedules by reducing the time spent on quality - assurance practices such as design and code reviews .
Some shortchange the upstream activities of requirements analysis and design .
Others–running late–try to make up time by compressing the testing schedule , which is vulnerable to reduction since it ’s the critical - path item at the end of the schedule .
These are some of the worst decisions a person who wants to maximize development speed can make .
In software , higher quality ( in the form of lower defect rates ) and reduced development time go hand in hand .
Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between defect rate and development time .
Figure 1 . Relationship between defect rate and development time .
As a rule , the projects that achieve the lowest defect rates also achieve the shortest schedules .
A few organizations have achieved extremely low defect rates ( shown on the far right of the curve ) , and when you reach that point , further reducing the number of defects will tend to increase the amount of development time .
This applies to life - critical systems such as the life - support systems on the space shuttle .
It does n’t apply to the rest of us .
The rest of us would do well to learn from a discovery made by IBM in the 1970s : Products with the lowest defect counts also have the shortest schedules ( Jones 1991 ) .
Many organizations currently develop software with defect levels that give them longer schedules than necessary .
After surveying about 4000 software projects , Capers Jones reported that poor quality was one of the most common reasons for schedule overruns ( 1994 ) .
He also reported that poor quality is implicated in close to half of all canceled projects .
A Software Engineering Institute survey found that more than 60 percent of organizations assessed suffered from inadequate quality assurance ( Kitson and Masters 1993 ) .
On the curve in Figure 1 , those organizations are to the left of the 95 - percent - removal line .
That 95 - percent - removal line–or some point in its neighborhood –is significant because that level of pre-release defect removal appears to be the point at which projects achieve the shortest schedules , least effort , and highest levels of user satisfaction ( Jones 1991 ) .
If you ’re finding more than 5 percent of your defects after your product has been released , you ’re vulnerable to the problems associated with low quality , and you ’re probably taking longer to develop your software than you need to .
Design Shortcuts
Projects that are in a hurry are particularly vulnerable to shortchanging quality - assurance at the individual - developer level .
Any developer who has been pushed to ship a product quickly knows how much pressure there can be to cut corners because “ we ’re only three weeks from shipping . ”
For example , rather than writing a separate , completely clean printing module , you might piggyback printing onto the screen - display module .
You know that ’s a bad design , that it is n’t extendible or maintainable , but you do n’t have time to do it right .
You ’re being pressured to get the product done , so you feel compelled to take the shortcut .
Two months later , the product still has n’t shipped , and those cut corners come back to haunt you .
You find that users are unhappy with printing , and the only way to satisfy their requests is to significantly extend the printing functionality .
Unfortunately , in the two months since you piggybacked printing onto the screen - display module , the printing functionality and the screen - display functionality have become thoroughly intertwined .
Redesigning printing and separating it from the screen display is now a tough , time - consuming , error - prone operation .
The upshot is that a shortcut that was supposed to save time actually wasted time in the following ways :
The original time spent designing and implementing the printing hack was completely wasted because most of that code will be thrown away .
The time spent unit - testing and debugging the printing - hack code was also wasted .
Additional time must be spent to strip the printing - specific code out of the display module .
Additional testing and debugging time must be spent to ensure that the modified display code still works after the printing code has been stripped out .
The new printing module , which should have been designed as an integral part of the system , has to be designed onto and around the existing system , which was not designed with it in mind .
All this happens , when the only necessary cost–if the right decision had been made at the right time –was to design and implement one version of the printing module .
And now you still have to do that anyway .
This example is not uncommon .
Up to four times the normal number of defects are reported for released products that were developed under excessive schedule pressure .
2
Projects that are in schedule trouble often become obsessed with working harder rather than working smarter .
Attention to quality is seen as a luxury .
The result is that projects often work dumber , which gets them into even deeper schedule trouble .
Error -Prone Modules
One aspect of quality assurance that ’s particularly important to rapid development is the existence of error - prone modules , which are modules that are responsible for a disproportionate number of defects .
Barry Boehm reported that 20 percent of the modules in a program are typically responsible for 80 percent of the errors .
5
On its IMS project , IBM found that 57 percent of the errors clumped into 7 percent of the modules .
1
Modules with such high defect rates are more expensive and time - consuming to deliver than less error - prone modules .
Normal modules cost about $ 500 to $ 1000 per function point to develop .
Error - prone modules cost about $ 2000 to $ 4000 per function point to develop .
2
Error - prone modules tend to be more complex than other modules in the system , less structured , and unusually large .
They often were developed under excessive schedule pressure and were not fully tested .
If development speed is important , make identification and redesign of error - prone modules a priority .
Once a module ’s error rate hits about 10 defects per thousand lines of code , review it to determine whether it should be redesigned or reimplemented .
If it ’s poorly structured , excessively complex , or excessively long , redesign the module and reimplement it from the ground up .
You ’ll shorten the schedule and improve the quality of your product at the same time .
Quality - Assurance and Development Speed
If you can prevent defects or detect and remove them early , you can realize a significant schedule benefit .
Studies have found that reworking defective requirements , design , and code typically consumes 40 to 50 percent of the total cost of software development ( Jones 1986 ) .
As a rule of thumb , every hour you spend on defect prevention will reduce your repair time from three to ten hours .
2
In the worst case , reworking a software requirements problem once the software is in operation typically costs 50 to 200 times what it would take to rework the problem in the requirements stage ( Boehm and Papaccio 1988 ) .
It ’s easy to understand why .
A 1 - sentence requirement can expand into 5 pages of design diagrams , then into 500 lines of code , 15 pages of user documentation , and a few dozen test cases .
It ’s cheaper to correct an error in that 1 - sentence requirement at requirements time than it is after design , code , user documentation , and test cases have been written to it .
Figure 2 illustrates the way that defects tend to become more expensive the longer they stay in a program .
Figure 2 .
The longer a defect remains undetected , the more expensive it becomes to correct .
The savings potential from early defect detection is huge–about 60 percent of all defects usually exist by design time ( Gilb 1988 ) , and you should try to eliminate them by design time .
A decision early in a project not to focus on defect detection amounts to a decision to postpone defect detection and correction until later in the project when they will be much more expensive and time - consuming .
That ’s not a rational decision when time is at a premium .
Quality - Assurance Practices
The various quality - assurance measures have different effects on development speed .
Here is a summary .
Presentations
The most common quality - assurance practice is undoubtedly execution testing , finding errors by executing a program and seeing what happens .
The two basic kinds of execution testing are unit tests , in which the developer checks his or her own code to verify that it works correctly , and system tests , in which an independent tester checks to see whether the system operates as expected .
Testing is the black sheep of QA practices as far as development speed is concerned .
It can certainly be done so clumsily that it slows down the development schedule , but most often its effect on the schedule is only indirect .
Testing discovers that the product ’s quality is too low for it to be released , and the product has to be delayed until it can be improved .
Testing thus becomes the messenger that delivers bad news .
The best way to leverage testing from a rapid - development viewpoint is to plan ahead for bad news–set up testing so that if there ’s bad news to deliver , testing will deliver it as early as possible .
Technical Reviews
Technical reviews include all the kinds of reviews that are used to detect defects in requirements , design , code , test cases , and other work products .
Reviews vary in level of formality and effectiveness , and they play a more critical role in maximizing development speed than testing does .
The least formal and most common kind of review is the walkthrough , which is any meeting at which two or more developers review technical work with the purpose of improving its quality .
Walkthroughs are useful to rapid development because you can use them to detect defects earlier than you can with testing .
Code reading is a somewhat more formal review process than a walkthrough but nominally applies only to code .
In code reading , the author of the code hands out source listings to two or more reviewers .
The reviewers read the code and report any errors to the code ’s author .
A study at NASA ’s Software Engineering Laboratory found that code reading detected about twice as many defects per hour of effort as testing ( Card 1987 ) .
That suggests that , on a rapid - development project , some combination of code reading and testing would be more schedule - effective than testing alone .
Inspections are the most formal kind of technical review , and they have been found to be extremely effective in detecting defects throughout a project .
Developers are trained in the use of inspection techniques and play specific roles during the inspection process .
The “ moderator ” hands out the material to be inspected before the inspection meeting .
The “ reviewers ” examine the material before the meeting and use checklists to stimulate their reviews .
During the inspection meeting , the “ author ” paraphrases the material , the reviewers identify errors , and the “ scribe ” records the errors .
After the meeting , the moderator produces an inspection report that describes each defect and indicates what will be done about it .
Throughout the inspection process you gather data about defects , hours spent correcting defects , and hours spent on inspections so that you can analyze the effectiveness of your software - development process and improve it .
Because they can be used early in the development cycle , inspections have been found to produce net schedule savings of 10 to 30 percent ( Gilb and Graham 1993 ) .
One study of large programs even found that each hour spent on inspections avoided an average of 33 hours of maintenance , and inspections were up to 20 times more efficient than testing ( Russell 1991 ) .
Comment on Technical Reviews
Technical reviews are a useful and important supplement to testing .
Reviews find defects earlier , which saves time and is good for the schedule .
They are more cost effective on a per-defect - found basis because they detect both the symptom of the defect and the underlying cause of the defect at the same time .
Testing detects only the symptom of the defect ; the developer still has to isolate the cause by debugging .
Reviews tend to find a higher percentage of defects ( Jones 1986 ) .
And reviews serve as a time when developers share their knowledge of best practices with each other , which increases their rapid - development capability over time .
Technical reviews are thus a critical component of any development effort that aims to achieve the shortest possible schedule .
The Other Kind of Quality
I mentioned at the beginning of the article that there were two kinds of quality .
The other kind of quality includes all of the other characteristics that you think of when you think of a high - quality software product–usability , efficiency , robustness , maintainability , portability , and so on .
Unlike the low - defect kind of quality , attention to this kind of quality tends to lengthen the development schedule .
Summary
When a software product has too many defects , developers spend more time fixing the software than they spend writing it in the first place .
Most organizations have found that an important key to achieving shortest possible schedules is focusing their development processes so that they do their work right the first time .
“ If you do n’t have time to do the job right , ” the old chestnut goes , “ where will you find the time to do it over ? ”

Building Your First Cluster
Page 1 of 3
Introduction
Getting started with what appears to be a very powerful , very complex idea ( in computing , at least ) is often a daunting proposition , and cluster computing is no exception .
There is so much to learn !
So many things can go wrong !
It might require new , specialized , expensive hardware and software !
Looking over some of the articles on this website can easily reinforce this view , as some of them describe very sophsticated tools and concepts .
Anybody who has ever tackled a major new computing project is aware of how costs can spiral , energy and time fritter away , and benefits seem unreachably distant in the middle of the mess .
This classic Fear , Uncertainty and Doubt ( FUD ) has propelled many a corporate or government project manager to spend huge amounts of money to get shrink - wrapped parallel supercomputers and full service contracts because at least that way they can put a firm upper bound on costs and have a fairly predictable benefit , even when their task is actually trivially parallel and could be run at a fraction of the cost on commodity hardware .
In Universities and many government labs , though , there exist large numbers of researchers who simply do n't have the deep pockets that this kind of throw - money - at - it response requires but who do have an unbounded appetite for compute cycles .
For well over a decade , this group of individuals ( I 'm one of them ) have been working on ways of getting cycles in a predictable way , at modest cost ( using commodity components instead of expensive " big iron " supercomputers ) , without having to be an absolute computing genius to make it all work .
After all , some of us want to foist all the real work of cluster programming and management off on graduate students eventually , right ?
This column will present a distillation of all of this experience and effort by all of these bright people that hopefully will convince you that hey -- cluster computing with commodity systems is n't really all that difficult or expensive , and that you can see a clear path to significant benefits after reading as little as a single article ( for example , this one ) !
In this column today we will review the simplest of designs for a cluster you may already have -- two or more ( linux / unix ) workstations on a completely generic local area network .
This sort of " cluster " is easy to build and actually free in many environments ( or rather , for the economically picky , is available at zero marginal cost , significantly improving the productivity of your existing resources ) .
To demonstrate its potential utility , we will learn to actually run an absolutely trivial " demo " parallel task -- one that does no real work but contains a very clear " placeholder " where real work can be inserted .
This parallel task will be used in various incarnations in future columns to demonstrate things like parallel scaling laws and parallel libraries .
A final note before proceeding .
This column is for beginners at cluster computing , but is not really intended for beginners at computing altogether .
It does presume a passing acquaintance with Unix ( preferrably Linux ) , TCP / IP networking , a programming language or three at the single computer level .
This column will primarily use C , perl , and / bin/sh ( as well as numerous other tools in a standard workstation installation of Red Hat Linux ) in the discussion and examples , although for the most part they are really Unix - agnostic .
If you are a real beginner at computers altogether , you will likely need to do a bit of work and learn to install and manage and program at the single computer level .
Fortunately , bookstores , the internet , and other columns and articles in this and other linux magazines ( like Linux Magazine ) make this quite easy these days .
The software you need is at the end of the article ( cut and paste ) or you can download a tar file .
Sidebar One : NOW Cluster Recipe
The following are the ( very generic ) ingredients for a small " getting started " NOW - style compute cluster : 2 - 8 PC's ( Intel or AMD will be easiest ) .
Their ( linux - supported ) hardware configuration can be quite flexible , but for " workstation " nodes should include adequate memory ( minimum 128 MB ) , room on their HD for a comfy linux workstation installation ( 4+ GB ) , and a 100BT ethernet interface , preferrable a " good " one .
128 MB ) , room on their HD for a comfy linux workstation installation ( 4+ GB ) , and a 100BT ethernet interface , preferrable a " good " one .
A 100 BT switch with at least as many ports as you have computers , and enough cabling and wiring to connect all the workstations to the switch .
Linux ( or perhaps FreeBSD ) , installed on each node .
I personally am currently using Red Hat Linux version 9 for my own NOW as it permits PXE / Kickstart / Yum installation and maintenance ( to be described in future columns ) but just about any reasonably modern Linux will suffice .
All the workstation nodes should have e.g.
Openssh ( server and client ) , perl version > 5.8.0 ( with thread support ) , gcc , make in order to run the examples , although a good programmer ought to be able to rewrite the perl " taskmaster " in C using posix threads quite easily .
I include the perl example because ( frankly ) it is really cool that perl now has the ability to manage threads and it is a bit easier to hack around with a script than with C sources .
To " configure " the cluster for the example , one system should probably be set up as an NFS server for / home and all the systems should share account space .
ssh should be configured ( according to its man pages ) so that one can transparently execute remote commands without entering a password , e.g. : rgb@lilith | T:101> ssh lucifer date Sun Sep 7 08:27:08 EDT 2003
Is There a Supercomputer in the House ?
A parallel supercomputer requires only two basic hardware components : a bunch of processors and a way for those processors to talk to one another and other private and shared resources .
In the case of a NOW those components are realized as workstations and servers ( each typically with one or at most two processors ) and an ordinary TCP / IP network .
In almost any modern Unix / Linux based business , such a network can be found -- workstations and servers serving staff , programmers , and nowadays , even executives as Open Office , KDE , Gnome and their associated office tools mature .
Universities almost invariably have workstation clusters of this sort to serve students and faculty alike .
There exists a network of Linux workstations in my house , serving my wife and kids ( as well as my own professional needs ) and in fact it was used to test and debug things like the parallel programs that accompany this article ( as I write it sitting at my laptop in my downstair den , connected via wireless to my house Local Area Network ( LAN ) ) .
If you have such a NOW , great !
Check the sidebar entitled " NOW Cluster Recipe " and make sure that all the workstations have the setup described there .
If not , do n't despair !
The same sidebar gives you a basic set of ingredients and an outline of installation instructions .
These installation instructions are necessarily terse and are more of a configuration specification , as it simply is n't possible to tell you how to install linux or freebsd or a commercial Unix itself for every possible hardware or distribution permutation .
This is well - documented elsewhere , however , and should n't be a terrible obstacle .
So go ahead , prepare your LAN , get to where you can enter " ssh target date " and see the date setting on the " target " workstation ( without a password ) , and then return and start the next section .
Putting the NOW to Work : A Simple Parallel Task
At this point you should be sitting at a Linux / Unix workstation on a LAN set up to permit remote logins and command execution on at least one other system .
These systems ( as far as this article is concerned ) can be Internet accessible or even on a Wide Area Network ( WAN ) as we 're going to use ssh only as a remote connection protocol , although network performance is likely to be more consistent on a LAN .
Perform the following tasks :
Get software at the end of the article ( cut and paste ) or download a tar file .
Put the code for task.c and its Makefile in a subdirectory on your system (s ) and build it ( just entering " make " should do it , if gcc and make are installed and correctly set up ) .
Put the resulting " task " binary on a consistent path on all the systems .
This might be someplace like $ HOME / bin / task or / tmp / task .
I 'm assuming the latter in the taskmaster script below .
You can execute task without arguments to see its argument list , and can execute it by hand once or twice with arguments to see what it returns .
Put the taskmaster script in a convenient place -- probably your working subdirectory where you have the task .c source .
If you execute the taskmaster script without arguments ( be sure to set its executable bits ) it will also tell you its argument list .
If it complains about not knowing about threads , you will need to update your version of perl to one that includes thread support .
Create a file named " hostfile " containing the names or IP numbers of the host (s ) you wish to use in your parallel computation .
I 'd recommend having at least four participating hosts ( one of which can be the " master " host that you are working from ) .
Do n't worry about load balancing or the network or whether the computers in question are all the same speed -- task only does simulated work with a fixed delay , so any computers used will result in a fairly predictable task scaling ( more on that later ) .
Also , task uses almost no memory or CPU , so you also do n't have to worry about annoying the console users of any workstations you are borrowing -- they wo n't even know the task is there .
Here 's what task and taskmaster do .
task seeds a system random number generator with the seed you give it .
It then loops nwork times , sleeping for delay seconds and then printing a uniform deviate in the range [ 0.0,1.0 ) on stdout .
If delay is " big " it simulates a lot of work for a little communication ; if delay is " small " it simulates a relatively little work for a lot of communication .
taskmaster is responsible for distributing an instance of task to some or all of the hosts in a hostfile passed to it as an argument .
You can control how many with another argument ( we do n't really check if this is more than the available host pool , so be careful ) .
Finally , you tell taskmaster how many uniform deviates it should try to make in parallel , with what delay for each .
taskmaster then partitions the task , creates separate threads ( one per host ) , executes task on the remote host via ssh in each thread .
It then collects the returns from those jobs ( reading their stdouts and putting the uniform deviates in an array ) and prints them all to the screen , more so you can see that actual work was done on the remote hosts than for any practical purpose .
Finally , taskmaster returns the timing , which is very important and will be used in future columns to explore the mysteries of parallel scaling laws .
By varying nhosts , nrands , and delay we can learn lots of things about parallel scaling even in this simple environment , and even experienced cluster programmers may find the threaded taskmaster script a useful base from which to write a more careful task distribution mechanism .
One with actual error checking , for example ...
You are now ready to go !
Here are some example of taskmaster usage on my own NOW cluster ( named " eden " , if anybody cares ) , configured with seven available hosts .
The email I got a few days ago ( which I posted on this site ) really bothered me .
I felt an an intense need to do something but I did n’t know what .
How can we find out the truth ?
How can we learn what ’s really going on ?
So here ’s what I decided to do .
I ’m putting up $ 1000.00 of my own cash to send 2 people to New Orleans and the Gulf Region for a weekend to find out what ’s really going on .
I ’m going to supply you with a cool ass video / camera , a place to stay and a rental car .
Look at it as a vacation that matters .
I want you to document what you see .
Stay out of the tourist traps and talk to real people .
Get their stories and get to the truth of what ’s really going on in the region .
And I ’ll post it on this site and some others .
I want you to go deep .
Follow up on some of the rumours .
It ’ll probably be kind of scary .
( It may even be dangerous . )
But this is the United States of America and this is one of the most important stories of our time .
I write a lot about change , institutional collapse and personal empowerment .
I do n’t write enough about responsibility .
I feel we all have a responsibility to do what we can .
So if you feel like getting from behind you laptop and getting at the truth , email me .
If you own a company or blog or just feel the urge to want to help with the expenses email me .
We can set up sponsorships of some kind .
Corporations sponsor old media anyway so I have no problem with that .
Let ’s put the tools at our disposal to use and get at the truth and then pass it along
.
I ’m sure my lawyer is freaking out .
Fuck that .
Let ’s do something important .
[ RELOADED : Doing this is not an attack against regular journalism .
It ’s just that there are things I think myself and others are interested in that is not or has n’t been reported by mainstream journalism .
That ’s why we are using this approach .
Thanks to everyone who wants to be involved .
I will be in contact with you within 24 hours . ]

A few days ago in #chipy , the chat room for the Chicago Python Users Group , we had a chat about how Python determines equality .
It 's a pretty neat and extensible technique , so I 'm going to walk through how I recently used it for playing cards .
Here 's the basic Card class .
Note that I 'm going to totally skip things like error - checking and documentation to keep the example obvious .
values = ( ' 2 ' , ' 3 ' , ' 4 ' , ' 5 ' , ' 6 ' , ' 7 ' , ' 8 ' , ' 9 ' , ' 10 ' , ' J ' , ' Q ' , ' K ' , ' A ' ) suits = ( ' h ' , 'c ' , ' d ' , 's ' ) class Card : def __init__ ( self , value , suit ) : self.value , self .
suit = value , suit def __repr__( self ) : return " < Card : %s %s > " % ( self.value , self.card )
Man , does code get short when you do n't bother checking for errors .
The usage is pretty clear , but there 's one odd issue :
>>> Card ( ' 3 ' , 's ') < Card : 3s > >>> Card ( ' 3 ' , 's ' ) == Card ( ' 3 ' , 's ' )
False
Huh ?
That 's odd , an instance of Card does n't equal another Card just like itself ?
Well , let 's look at the Python docs .
It talks a bit about comparing the builtin types ( numbers , strings , lists ... ) and then says : " Most other types compare unequal unless they are the same object " .
Python does this by comparing the ids of the objects .
You can call id ( ) on your objects and see that even identically - constructed objects have different ids because they 're in different locations in memory .
This is decent default because you would n't want Python walking deeply through all of your objects , a potentially expensive operation .
Python does do a little bit more for equality , as implied by that " most " in the documentation .
Python does one more thing for us .
It looks for a function named __eq__ to call on the left - hand object and uses it to determine equality .
So let 's add it to Card :
def __eq__( self , card ) : return self.value == card.value and self .
suit == card.suit
Easy enough .
And usage :
>>> Card ( ' 3 ' , 's ' ) == Card ( ' 3 ' , 's ')
True >>> Card ( ' 3 ' , 's ' ) == Card ( ' K ' , 'h ' ) False >>> Card ( ' 3 ' , 's ' ) != Card ( ' 3 ' , 's ')
True
Now that last one is a bit surprising .
Back at the docs , we learn " There are no implied relationships among the comparison operators .
The truth of x==y does not imply that x!=y is false .
Accordingly , when defining __eq__ ( ) , one should also define __ne__ ( ) so that the operators will behave as expected . "
That 's :
def __ne__( self , card ) : return not self .
__eq__(card )
After that , the Cards equate properly and everything 's happy .
One of the best things about Python is that it regularly gives you a sensible default and then lets you customize your code to work seamlessly with the language .
This is what us Python fans mean when we go on and on about code being " Pythonic " .
In a later article , I 'll address using the Flyweight design pattern to solve this example in a different way .

| WILLisms.com | Wednesday Caption Contest : Part 52 . » Trivia Tidbit Of The Day : Part 313 -- Spending Too Much On The Military ?
Too Much Mandatory Spending - Last night , Hoodlumman directed me to this very neat graphic titled " Death and Taxes , " which offers a neat visual of how our tax money is spent :
There 's an extremely large version over at deviantART , as well .
Anyway , it 's a look at America 's 2004 Federal Budget .
It 's very , very well - done .
It 's also flawed in a major way .
Setting aside that the final numbers all ended the year different from the depiction ( not the artist 's fault ) , the artist tries to make the point that the United States spends too much on the military and not enough on other priorities .
( Here ) :
In order to make such a claim , the artist uses a misleading sleight of hand to exclude mandatory / entitlement spending such as Medicare and Social Security from the picture , then has the nerve to claim that President Bush is misleading folks for including those gargantuan programs in his budget report .
Well , here 's the truth .
Even if we do pretend entitlement programs did not exist in FY2004 , far more discretionary dollars went to non-military spending than expected ( . pdf ) : Again , not the artist 's fault .
He made his graphic with the best information available at the time , prior to the money actually being spent .
It is , however , the artist 's fault that his entire otherwise awesome graphic is worthless without putting mandatory spending into perspective .
So , let 's put it into perspective ( click for a larger version ) :
And , actually , to be truly proportional to budget reality , we 'd need to shrink down the circles in the top left and increase the circles in the top right just a bit .
If that defense spending circle is worth $ 398 billion ( something the artist assumed at the time ) , then the entitlement spending circles are proportional .
And one more tidbit : According to the CIA World Factbook , the United States spent roughly 4 % of GDP on the military , which positioned America in 26th place in the world in military spending as a percentage of its economy .
Despite that relatively low level of spending ( the U.S. spent in the double - digits throughout much of the 20th century ) , the United States still spent more than six times more than second place China in actual dollars .
That 's , perhaps , one reason why many left - wingers at home and abroad want to destroy America 's economy with high taxes , overzealous environmental and labor regulations , and other Marxist ideology - in - action .
America 's enormous , booming economy allows for substantial force projection in the world , all at a relatively low cost .
Unfortunately , as those mandatory spending elements , which , for the most part , were set into action under the New Deal and Great Society , grow unsustainably over the next few decades , American taxpayers will no longer be able to choose priorities on the top left or top right .
It 's sinister , the lack of entitlement reform in this country .

" If we ignore the huge elephant in the room , you 'll see that discretionary spending is out of control ... "
Yowza .
If SS and other entitlement programs were reigned in , then gov't pols and other feel - good legislation lover would have billions to spend on the arts , NPR or whatever .

Wow !
I shudder to think what you might come back with if you took an entire month off !...
Posted by : Ironman at April 18 , 2006 06:12 PM
Sorry , but there is nothing misleading about it .
It is a representation of the discretionary budget .
In fact , in the big circle in the middle , it quite clearly states what it means .
...it's a look at America 's 2004 Federal Budget
This is simply misleading on your part .
The author clearly states that it is the Federal discretionary budget .
By ignoring this fact , you are building a strawman case in claiming it is " misleading " .
United States spent roughly 4 % of GDP on the military , which positioned America in 26th place in the world in military spending as a percentage of its economy .
Despite that relatively low level of spending ...
" Relatively low level " .
How can you keep a straight face and say that ?
Look at your own link .
Around what other countries is the United States clustered around ?
You do n't see too many Western nations or democracies do you ?
You should compare the US to comparable nations - Australia , UK , Canada , France , Germany - they all spend considerably less on the military as a proportion of GDP and spend hugely less from an absolute point of view .

Why is it necessary to compare the U.S. to so - called ' comparable nations ? '
Europe and Canada take advantage of U.S. largesse by not spending their own money on defense .
They are freeloaders .
Posted by : Ken McCracken at April 19 , 2006 04:29 AM
There 's nothing misleading in my post .
At all .
It 's only misleading to exclude mandatory spending from a visual representation of where tax dollars go , then whine about how we spend more on jets than on hospitals , which the artist did .
It 's also absolutely ridiculous for the artist to say the President is misleading people by including mandatory spending in the budget .

I do n't think the author of the graphic was trying to fool anyone , he was just taking a particular perspective .
How is the portion of the federal budget on which the the government has some choice divvied up ?
The sub - title of " where your tax dollars go " is slightly misleading , but it is clearly explained what the chart depicts .
BTW , some of the numbers on the military side astounded me .
Nuclear Submarines ?
Anti-missle defense ?
Aircraft carriers ?
Why are these relics of the cold war still relevant in today 's world ?

Interesting correlation on the people who think that the depiction was n't misleading and the people who think that we do n't need defenses .

Today the budget is $ 440 Billion for the military , more than the entire world combined .
China ?
34B / Year Iraq before we invaded ?
$ 1.8 / year .
Yep we have our priorties right .
Right in the gutter .

The Russian is serving aboard the International Space Station
He beat a previous record of 747 days , 14 hours , 14 minutes and 11 seconds held by fellow Russian Sergei Avdeyev .
Krikalev is the current commander of the International Space Station ( ISS ) and is scheduled to stay on board the orbiting platform until October .
He has also stayed aboard the Mir space station during his 20 - year career .
The cosmonaut is serving out a stint on the ISS that began on 14 April .
Together with Nasa astronaut John Phillips , he hosted the crew of space shuttle Discovery when they arrived at the station in July .
Long duration
Sergei Krikalev was born in Leningrad ( now St Petersburg ) , Russia , in 1958 .
Krikalev served aboard the first US - Russian shuttle mission
The 46 - year - old was selected as a cosmonaut in 1985 and completed his basic training in 1986 .
He made his first long - duration mission to the Russian Mir space station in 1988 .
The cosmonaut flew aboard space shuttle Discovery on STS - 60 , the first joint US / Russian shuttle mission in 1994 .
He was also part of the first crew to stay aboard the International Space Station .
Krikalev and Phillips are due to return to Earth on 7 October .
But they are currently preparing for two spacewalks , the first of which takes place on Thursday .
They will replace experiments , install a television camera , and move equipment during the scheduled six - hour extra-vehicular activity ( EVA ) .
IMMIGRATION DEBATE IMMIGRATION DEBATE
Policy : Mexico opposes fence | House , Senate divided Enforcement : Who watches watchmen ? |
High - tech plan pitched to fight illegals | Daily game of cat and mouse Utah turns into mini-melting pot Chertoff : Reforms needed Outlaws plague Arizona refuges California city votes on immigration issue LOS ANGELES  Landlords who rent to illegal immigrants could face $ 1,000 fines , and homeowners who hire undocumented workers could have their cars impounded under a measure being voted on today by the San Bernardino City Council .
A group opposed to illegal immigration in the city of 200,000 , located 70 miles east of Los Angeles , collected more than 2,200 signatures to force the council to consider the tough proposal .
If the council does n't approve the measure today , the issue will go to voters on a citywide ballot .
Four of the seven council members said in interviews that they expected the measure to fail today because of concerns over enforcement costs and court challenges .
" Cops do n't need to be checking under mattresses to see if some landlord is renting to some illegal immigrant , " Councilman Dennis Baxter said .
" We have bigger fish to fry : crime , gang activity .
Whoever is cutting the next - door neighbors ' lawn is a lower priority . "
Joseph Turner , 29 , who led the petition drive , said the city charter would mandate a special election by September .
The financially strained city will try to shift the ballot measure to November 's general election to save the $ 300,000 cost of a special election , Councilman Neil Derry said .
Turner said he wants the proposal approved before November " so I can have a potential impact on the November election throughout this country .
It might embolden candidates to be more aggressive on the immigration issue , and we can get more representation . "
The measure would be the most far - reaching crackdown on illegal immigration by any U.S. city , Turner said .
As Congress considers legislation on the issue , some cities are getting tough on illegal immigrants while others are offering refuge .
Costa Mesa , Calif. , recently ordered police to check suspected felons ' immigration status .
Cambridge , Mass. , and California 's Maywood and Coachella have declared themselves " sanctuaries " where police do n't check papers .
States are wading into the controversy , too .
Colorado Gov. Bill Owens , a Republican , signed into law May 1 a bill prohibiting sanctuary cities .
Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue , a Republican , last month signed a measure requiring officials to verify the legal status of people seeking many state benefits .
Nearly half of San Bernardino 's population is Hispanic , Census figures show .
Turner , an aide to a Republican member of the California Legislature , said a victory for his group would " put to bed the myth that a Latino backlash will hurt the Republican Party if it fights illegal immigration . "
Armando Navarro , coordinator of the National Alliance for Human Rights , a coalition of Hispanic activist groups , said , " We are going to mobilize large numbers of people " to defeat the measure .
He called it " heinous and racist . "
An election would be " very close , " Derry said .
Councilman Chas Kelley said voters would n't be thinking about the high cost of enforcing the measure .
" They just want something done about this issue . "
Kelley said the measure " makes sense " and he 'll vote for it today to avoid an election .
Baxter said the city is trying to find money for 40 more police officers and can't afford the measure : " Does Joseph Turner think this is Beverly Hills ? "

„ Wir sind am Ende der Sackgasse “
Auszug aus dem Brief , mit dem sich die Lehrer der Rütli - Hauptschule an die Berliner Senatsverwaltung wenden
„ Wie sinnvoll ist es , in einer Schule alle Jugendlichen zu sammeln , die keine Perspektiven kennen ? “
BERLIN taz ■
„ Wir müssen feststellen , dass die Stimmung in einigen Klassen zurzeit geprägt ist von Aggressivität , Respektlosigkeit und Ignoranz uns Erwachsenen gegenüber .
Türen werden eingetreten , Papierkörbe als Fußbälle missbraucht , Knallkörper gezündet und Bilderrahmen von den Wänden gerissen .
Werden Schüler / innen zur Rede gestellt , schützen sie sich gegenseitig .
Täter können in den wenigsten Fällen ermittelt werden .
Laut Aussage eines Schülers gilt es als besondere Anerkennung im Kiez , wenn aus einer Schule negative Schlagzeilen in der Presse erscheinen .
In vielen Klassen ist das Verhalten im Unterricht geprägt durch totale Ablehnung des Unterrichtsstoffs und menschenverachtendes Auftreten .
Lehrkräfte werden gar nicht wahrgenommen , Gegenstände fliegen zielgerichtet gegen Lehrkräfte durch die Klassen .
Einige Kollegen / innen gehen nur noch mit dem Handy in bestimmte Klassen , damit sie über Funk Hilfe holen können .
Auch von den Eltern bekamen wir bisher wenig Unterstützung .
Termine werden nicht wahrgenommen , Telefonate scheitern am mangelnden Sprachverständnis .
Über das Quartiersmanagement haben wir zwei Sozialarbeiter / innen mit türkischem und arabischem Migrationshintergrund beantragt , um vor allem mit den Eltern ins Gespräch zu kommen .
Aber diese Maßnahme allein wird die Situation nicht deeskalieren .
Wenn wir uns die Entwicklung unserer Schule ansehen , so müssen wir feststellen , dass die Hauptschule am Ende der Sackgasse angekommen ist .
Welchen Sinn macht es , dass in einer Schule alle Schüler / innen gesammelt werden , die weder von den Eltern noch von der Wirtschaft Perspektiven aufgezeigt bekommen , um ihr Leben sinnvoll gestalten zu können ?
In den meisten Familien sind unsere Schüler / innen die Einzigen , die morgens aufstehen .
Es gibt für sie in der Schule keine positiven Vorbilder .
Sie lernen Jugendliche , die anders leben , gar nicht kennen .
Hauptschule isoliert sie , sie fühlen sich ausgesondert und benehmen sich entsprechend .
Perspektivisch muss die Hauptschule in dieser Zusammensetzung aufgelöst werden zugunsten einer neuen Schulform mit gänzlich neuer Zusammensetzung . “
Pyongyang announced it had carried out a nuclear test on 9 October
Pyongyang also warned of " merciless " blows against any country infringing on its sovereignty , the official KCNA news agency reported .
There are reports of new activity at last week 's test site , and South Korea and Japan say they have intelligence of a possible second test .
The US says air samples have confirmed the 9 October blast was nuclear .
China has appealed to Pyongyang not to escalate tensions , urging its key ally to resolve the issue " through dialogue and consultation " .
We want peace but do not fear war
N Korea 's foreign ministry
Full text of statement
The UN Security Council unanimously voted on Saturday to impose sanctions , targeting Pyongyang 's weapons and missile programmes as well as luxury goods .
In its first official statement since the vote , North Korea 's foreign ministry said it " vehemently denounced " the resolution and called it a " product of US hostile policy " towards the country .
" The resolution can not be construed otherwise than a declaration of a war " against the North , the statement from the foreign ministry said , echoing comments made by North Korea 's ambassador to the UN on Saturday .
The statement repeated North Korea 's previous claim that it wanted peace and a de-nuclearised Korean peninsula .
NEW UN SANCTIONS
Bans sale to , or export from , N Korea of military hardware Bans sale or export of nuclear and missile related items
Bans sale of luxury goods Freezes finances and bans travel of anyone involved in nuclear , missile programmes Allows inspection of cargo to and from N Korea Stresses new resolution needed for further action

But it warned " we will deliver merciless blows without hesitation to whoever tries to breach our sovereignty and right to survive under the excuse of carrying out the UN Security Council resolution . "
Second test ?
US envoy Christopher Hill , who is in South Korea , warned North Korea not to carry out a second nuclear test .
" I think we would all regard a second test as a very belligerent answer on North Korea 's part to the international community , " he said .
Both South Korea and Japan have said they are aware of intelligence suggesting North Korea is possibly preparing for a second nuclear test .
A White House official said US spy satellites had detected suspicious movements near the 9 October blast site but these could not be confirmed as relating to a second test .
In the past , North Korea is thought to have staged activity at nuclear and missile sites to attract attention and step up diplomatic pressure , the BBC's Charles Scanlon in Seoul says .
N KOREA NUCLEAR PROGRAMME
Believed to have ' handful ' of nuclear weapons
But not thought to have any small enough to put in a missile Could try dropping from plane , though world watching closely
Q&A : Nuclear crisis N Korea 's mercurial leader
But analysts in Seoul say North Korea will need to conduct further tests in order to develop a credible nuclear deterrent , he adds .
US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has warned North Korea that a second nuclear test would be a provocative act that could only deepen its isolation .
She was speaking as she prepared for a tour of Asia to bolster the sanctions the UN has imposed on North Korea .
Her visit follows that of American envoy Christopher Hill , who has arrived in Seoul from Tokyo to continue talks on how to enforce the sanctions .
South Korea has publicly backed the sanctions outlined by the UN Security Council but it says it wants to continue joint economic projects with its neighbour despite the nuclear test .
Today , while looking for a replace for Winamp / WMP 11 , I stumbled across a beautiful little piece of software that uses less than HALF the memory of Winamp , WMP and about quarter of the memory that iTunes uses !
You may now be curious about what this program may be called .
Well its called musikCube , and it is one of the best little music players I have stumbled across ever .
Now , lets cover some basics .
musikCube is not a program meant to be near as flashy as WA / WMP with AVS or tons of skins .
No , instead this is a program that plays music while not taking a crap all through your RAM .
PLUS !
It ’s open source for all you open source junkies .
It is a library based player , so if you ’re like me and love to have your music organized by song or artist , which is something almost none of the other small mem players do , this is for you !
Running on about 10,000 k mem on my machine its quick responsive and very , very simple to use .
You start it up , it asks where to scan , you tell it and it does in within minutes !
I have over 4 k songs ( not a lot but a good size ) and it scanned it in less than 3 minutes .
Not only is it quick , it supports a good range of formats mp3 , WV , FLAC , WMA , OGG , M4A / AAC and several others .
The only problem is that this great piece of support is horribly under supported and is in a development slump .
From what I gather in the forums , many people are wanting to take this project and keep running with it , so if you can code C++ , look into it !
So please , give this program a hook .
If you like it tell some friends , and digg this story .
The more people that hear about this the more likely that this project will be picked up again and ran with in hopes of giving us an ever better player ( though I do n’t see how that can be done 😉 )
Israeli tanks have been struck by huge roadside bombs planted in expectation that Israeli armor would roll across the border , said one tank lieutenant , who in keeping with military policy would only give his first name , Ohad .
At least two soldiers from his unit have been wounded by snipers who are accurate at 600 yards .
The Hezbollah fighters “ are not just farmers who have been given weapons to fire , ” he said .
“ They are persistent and well trained . ”
Another tank company commander , a captain who gave his name as Edan , said that about 20 percent of the missiles that have hit Israeli tanks penetrated the Merkava armor or otherwise caused causalities .
Col .
Mordechai Kahane , the commander of the Golani brigade ’s Egoz unit , first set up to fight Hezbollah , told the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot of one of the worst early days , when his unit went into Marun al Ras in daylight , and lost a senior officer and a number of men .
“ Hezbollah put us to sleep ” building up its fortifications , he said .
“ There ’s no certainty that we knew that we were going to encounter what it is that we ultimately encountered .
We said , ‘ There is going to be a bunker here , a cave there , ’ but the thoroughness surprised us all .
A Hezbollah weapons storeroom is not just a natural cave .
It ’s a pit with concrete , ladders , emergency openings , escape routes .
We did n’t know it was that well organized . ”
General Kuperwasser , too , respects Hezbollah ’s ability “ to well prepare the battlefield , ” but says , “ We ’re making progress and killing a lot of them , and more of them are giving up in battle now and becoming prisoners , which is a very important sign . ”
Google 's decision to censor its search engine in China was bad for the company , its founders admitted yesterday .
Google , launched in 1998 by two Stanford University dropouts , Sergey Brin and Larry Page , was accused of selling out and reneging on its " Do n't be evil " motto when it launched in China in 2005 .
The company modified the version of its search engine in China to exclude controversial topics such as the Tiananmen Square massacre or the Falun Gong movement , provoking a backlash in its core western markets .
Asked whether he regretted the decision , Mr Brin admitted yesterday : " On a business level , that decision to censor ... was a net negative . "
The company has only once expressed any regret and never in as strong terms as yesterday .
Mr Brin said the company had suffered because of the damage to its reputation in the US and Europe .
Last year in a speech in Washington Mr Brin admitted the company had been forced to compromise its principles to operate in China .
At the time , he also hinted at a potential reversal of its stance in the country , saying " perhaps now the principled approach makes more sense " .
From what was said yesterday a policy change seemed unlikely in the near future .
Co-founder Larry Page said : " We always consider what to do .
But I do n't think we as a company should be making decisions based on too much perception . "
Much of the harm had come from newspaper headlines , he said , which affected perception for most people , who then did not read the actual articles .
Since moving into China , Google has been compared to Microsoft because of its dominant position and power .
" We are very sensitive to people talking about us in that way , " said Mr Brin .
Mr Page described the differences between the two technology companies by saying " we have very open partnerships , we are very clear about being fair with revenues . "
Speaking about one of the hot topics of this year 's meeting in Davos , Mr Brin said he had decided to offset his carbon emissions after growing concerned about his own use of private jets , despite not really being sure about the efficacy of such programmes .
" I was concerned about my private jet travel and whatnot ... I wanted to offset it so I did . "
Mr Brin said yesterday that he would feel a " bit better about it " by doing something " more specific " but declined to outline what that might be .
The company 's charitable arm , Google.org , takes an interest in the environment , they said .
Both men are known to have driven fuel - efficient Toyota cars .
Exactly what is inside the two men's private jet , however , has become the stuff of dotcom legend after a legal spat between the holding company that owns the Boeing 767 and a designer hired to re-fit it , went public last summer .
Documents published in US newspapers included plans for a lounge for Eric Schmidt , the chief executive , and two state rooms for the co-founders .
There were also calls from the founders for hammocks to be hung from the ceiling of the plane .
Both founders yesterday offered some solace to the newspaper industry , which has been most threatened by the growth of online news providers .
Larry Page said : " I believe in the future of newspapers , " before admitting that he reads all his news online .
His colleague said he read a Sunday newspaper " and it 's nice " .
Rather than suggest paid - for content was doomed , they called for a new model to collect revenues .
" I should probably pay for the Wall Street Journal but I do n't because it's a hassle , " said Mr Page , who is worth billions .
" I 'm not worried about the money thing , it 's just a hassle . "
It 's really hard to sort through the lies and fabrications from the Bush Administration about Iran in just the past week .
An analysis in today 's Washington Post takes a crack at it :
Burdened by its troubles in Iraq , the Bush administration is being doubly scrutinized over its policy toward Tehran .
For weeks , despite occasional saber rattling , officials from the president on down have insisted there are no plans to attack Iran .
Instead , they have said they are fully committed to a peaceful resolution of all outstanding grievances , including Iran 's nuclear weapons activities , support for terrorists in Lebanon and support for insurgents in Iraq .
" We 've been very careful in what we 've said over the last few weeks , " Undersecretary of State R. Nicholas Burns , the administration 's point man on Iran , said in an appearance yesterday at the Brookings Institution .
Asked about the " highest levels " charge , Burns replied : " The president . . . did not claim that today .
We are not claiming that today . "
That was precisely what the military asserted in its Baghdad briefing for reporters Sunday , a secretive session in which no cameras or tape recorders were allowed and no names were given for the speakers .
Enough already .
Note to the media : The Bush Administration is lying to you -- AGAIN .
It 's time for the reporters in Baghdad to out the speakers at that now infamous Sunday briefing .
Reporters in the traditional media know the back story here .
They need to share it .
Here in DC , the Scooter Libby trial showed the games that the Bush Administration plays with the media .
They 've played the media for fools .
The same thing is happening this time with Iran .
The Bush Administration expects the media to abide by their " rules . "
But , when the Bush Administration is lying ( again ) , there are no rules .
So , the media has an obligation to bust this open .
Who were the Baghdad briefers -- and who put them up to that briefing ?
That would be a good start .
I remember switching my homepage from AltaVista to Google back in 2000 for one simple reason : it was blazingly fast .
It 's the same reason I do n't use personalized Google , or Google suggest as my homepage : they 're simply too slow .
Dare Obasanjo * wonders if AJAX apps are rolling page load speeds back six years :
One big problem with the AJAX craze that has hit the Web is how much slower websites have become now that using Flash and DHTML to add " richness " to Web applications is becoming more commonplace .
My mind now boggles at the fact that I now see loading pages that last several seconds when visiting Web sites more and more these days .
Dare uses Yahoo !
Mail as an example , but I 've experienced similarly long load times for the new Hotmail beta , too .
The load times can be so long that a combination disclaimer / escape hatch appears below the loading animation :
Maybe I 'm just impatient .
However , there 's a lot of concrete data to support the theory that unless you make it load fast , nobody will stick around long enough to find out what you have to offer .
For instance , a recent study found that most shoppers will only wait four seconds for a page to load before abandoning the site entirely .
Dare also cited this post by Greg Linden which provides more quantitative data on page load times from Google and Amazon :
Google VP Marissa Mayer just spoke at the Web 2.0 Conference and offered tidbits on what Google has learned about speed , the user experience , and user satisfaction .
Marissa started with a story about a user test they did .
They asked a group of Google searchers how many search results they wanted to see .
Users asked for more , more than the ten results Google normally shows .
More is more , they said .
So Marissa ran an experiment where Google increased the number of search results to thirty .
Traffic and revenue from Google searchers in the experimental group dropped by 20 % .
Ouch .
Why ?
Why , when users had asked for this , did they seem to hate it ?
After a bit of looking , Marissa explained that they found an uncontrolled variable .
The page with 10 results took .4 seconds to generate .
The page with 30 results took .9 seconds .
Half a second delay caused a 20 % drop in traffic .
Half a second delay killed user satisfaction .
This conclusion may be surprising -- people notice a half second delay ?
-- but we had a similar experience at Amazon.com .
In A /B tests , we tried delaying the page in increments of 100 milliseconds and found that even very small delays would result in substantial and costly drops in revenue .
And let 's not forget the classic reference on application responsiveness : Response Time in Man-Computer Conversation Transactions , written way back in 1968 by R.B. Miller .
I know it primarily through Jakob Neilsen 's Response Times : The Three Important Limits .
0.1 second is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is reacting instantaneously , meaning that no special feedback is necessary except to display the result .
is about the limit for having the user feel that the system is reacting instantaneously , meaning that no special feedback is necessary except to display the result .
1.0 second is about the limit for the user 's flow of thought to stay uninterrupted , even though the user will notice the delay .
Normally , no special feedback is necessary during delays of more than 0.1 but less than 1.0 second , but the user does lose the feeling of operating directly on the data .
is about the limit for the user 's flow of thought to stay uninterrupted , even though the user will notice the delay .
Normally , no special feedback is necessary during delays of more than 0.1 but less than 1.0 second , but the user does lose the feeling of operating directly on the data .
10 seconds is about the limit for keeping the user 's attention focused on the dialogue .
For longer delays , users will want to perform other tasks while waiting for the computer to finish , so they should be given feedback indicating when the computer expects to be done .
Feedback during the delay is especially important if the response time is likely to be highly variable , since users will then not know what to expect .
The 10 second number seems too high for today 's world of ubiquitous broadband and quad - core CPUs .
That level of delay should be increasingly rare .
I 'd argue the user attention threshold is now more like 5 seconds .
If your application is going to spend more than 5 seconds doing something , you owe your users an estimate of when you 'll be done , and real - time feedback on your progress .
A basic hourglass does n't cut it .
What 's more important ?
Getting flash after 5 seconds , or functional no - frills layouts in less than a second ?
Let 's get our priorities straight .
Speed still matters .
And remember , the perception of speed is just as important as actual speed .
If you can't be fast , be clever .
Exploit progressive rendering and HTTP compression .
* It 's ironic , then , that Dare 's blog is so incredibly slow to load every time I 've directly visited it .
One benefit of RSS aggregators , I suppose , is that I rarely need to .
When it comes to optimize the layout of your office space , nothing helps to free desk space more then a nice , flat LCD screen .
That 's probably one of the main reason everyone has one these days .
Apart from that , they 're also very cheap , easy on the eyes and consume less electricity than their CRT counterparts .
With all that said , there ’s really no reason not to have one sitting on your desk in 2007 .
But these screens are not perfect .
In fact , you have to be very careful when cleaning them up .
Too much pressure using the wrong kind of cloth will most likely scratch your display and could even burn some of its pixels .
So the question is , what is the proper way to clean an LCD screen ?
First , you 've probably seen some of those LCD cleaning solutions in computer stores right ?
The good news is that if you do not want to pay for a commercial product , mixing up your own solution is very easy .
If you do n't want to take any chances and prefer to use a professional product , please see our recommendation at the end of this article .
So to get started , you only need 2 ingredients :
Next , you will need to find a good , soft piece of
Now that we have everything we need , start by turning off your screen .
Dampen your piece of soft cloth with your cleaning mixture and then wipe the display gently from top to bottom .
Never spray liquid directly onto the LCD .
When you 're done , wait a few minutes to let your screen dry , and then turn it back on .
Voila , you 're done !
Your screen should now be sparkling clean .
And if you absolutely want to use a product that was specifically made to clean LCD screens , Amazon.com has a really cheap and effective
The recipe is easy :
Mix the Isopropyl alcohol and distilled water in equal parts ( 50/50 ) inside an empty Windex - like bottle .
Do not use tap water !
Doing so will leave white smears on your screen after cleaning it up because of the dissolved minerals inside the water .
When finished mixing , just close the bottle using the " spray " adaptor that comes attached to it .
Next , you will need to find a good , soft piece of microfiber cloth to clean your display .
Avoid paper tissues at all cost !
Using those on your screen would be just like scrubbing sandpaper on it and may scratch it permanently .
You would n't want to do that right ?

An analysis of mice infected with the reconstructed 1918 influenza virus has revealed that although the infection triggered a very strong immune system response , the response failed to protect the animals from severe lung disease and death .
The study which was published by Mount Sinai researchers , working in collaboration with scientists from the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology , appeared in the online edition of Nature on September 27 .
“ This study gives scientists new insight into how highly pathogenic influenza viruses , such as the 1918 Spanish flu , cause disease , ” says Christopher F. Basler , PhD , Assistant Professor of Microbiology , who collaborated with Peter Palese , PhD , the Horace W. Goldsmith Professor and Chair of Microbiology , and also Professor of Medicine and Adolfo Garcia - Sastre , PhD , Professor of Microbiology .
Members of the research team , many of whom had collaborated on the reconstruction of the 1918 influenza virus , wanted to know why the virus , which killed 20 to 40 million people , was so lethal .
In the study , researchers infected one group of mice with the reconstructed 1918 influenza virus and a second group with benign human influenza .
The mice infected with the 1918 virus showed a rapid and potent immune system response , yet the animals also developed severe lung disease and died .
The animals infected with the more benign viruses did not develop an immune response that was as strong , and fewer of these animals died .
Genes were expressed from lung tissue samples taken from the mice , enabling the researchers to trace the immune response to each of the infections .
The potent immune system reaction of the mice infected with the 1918 virus is one of the main questions raised by the study , according to Dr. Basler .
Did the very strong immune system response contribute to their death or was the immune system too overwhelmed to fight the infection ?
“ When the body responds to infection , there are components of the immune system that can be beneficial and those that can be harmful , ” Dr. Basler says .
“ Our next step is to repeat these experiments , but deconstruct what the immune system is doing so that we can understand why it is reacting so strongly , yet failing to fight the infection .
By understanding the trajectory of this particular infection , we may also gain insight into how to treat other types of viral infections that are a threat to public health .
This could help us develop more targeted therapies to combat pathogenic infections , including different types of influenzas or perhaps avian influenza . ”

THE Russian community in London has until recently been regarded by the natives with wry amusement .
The exiled tycoons and billionaire tax refugees at its centre have boosted the price of high - end houses , imported expensive football players along with their befurred wives and provided useful fodder for the gossip columnists .
But Russian visitors have also brought political intrigue , business grudges , shady pasts — and , apparently , polonium .
That was the radioactive substance used to poison Alexander Litvinenko , who before defecting to Britain worked for both the KGB and the FSB , one of the KGB 's post - Soviet successors .
Mr Litvinenko died in a London hospital on November 23rd , having fallen ill on November 1st .
On that day , he met Mario Scaramella , an Italian muckraker who has investigated the KGB 's activities in Italy , at a Piccadilly sushi bar , and two or more visiting Russians ( also ex- KGB ) at a posh London hotel .
On December 7th , as Mr Litvinenko was buried in London , it emerged that several staff at the hotel bar had shown traces of radiation — making it a likely scene of the crime — as have rooms at several establishments in which the visiting Russians stayed , and planes on which they flew between London and Moscow .
So has part of the British embassy in Moscow , which the Russians attended to explain themselves .
German authorities have also detected radiation at several sites in Hamburg that one of the Russians , Dmitri Kovtun , visited before the fateful hotel meeting with Mr Litvinenko , suggesting that Mr Kovtun was already contaminated before they met .
As well as the flying KGB men , the Litvinenko affair now encompasses a long cast of characters , some of whom may be accomplices or escaped co-targets or the stooges in frame - ups .
This melange has predictably produced an orgy of conspiracy theories , some of which are probably smears and disinformation , circulated by people who have taken Mr Litvinenko 's demise as a grand opportunity to discredit their enemies .
The initial , rushed assumption among many in London was that the Kremlin did it — or if not the Kremlin directly , the FSB ; or if not them , then former KGB / FSB men .
( Vladimir Putin , another former spook , himself once reputedly remarked that there is no such thing as ex-KGB men ) .
Many in these organisations reviled Mr Litvinenko , who accused the FSB of various crimes .
One of his allegations was that the FSB orchestrated a spate of mysterious bombings of Russian apartment blocks in 1999 , which contributed to the eruption of a new Chechen war and hence to Mr Putin 's election as president in 2000 .
Several others who have investigated the bombings have wound up either dead or in prison .
Some see Mr Litvinenko's death as part of sequence of recent murders that included the contract killing in October of Anna Politkovskaya , a crusading journalist and devout Kremlin critic .
The main rival version propagated by the Kremlin 's allies is that the Litvinenko poisoning and Politkovskaya shooting were instead the work of forces bent on discrediting Mr Putin .
This version generally tries to implicate Boris Berezovsky , a so - called oligarch who helped bring Mr Putin to power but then fell out with him and fled to London .
Mr Litvinenko claimed that , as an FSB officer , he had been ordered to kill Mr Berezovsky ; the tycoon became his sponsor when both were in London .
Yegor Gaidar , a former Russian prime minister who thinks he was himself poisoned in Ireland on the day Mr Litvinenko died , believes that his own ailment was part of such an effort , though Mr Gaidar has not publicly named any names .
But there are other theories , including the idea that Mr Litvinenko 's murder — as it is now officially classified by Scotland Yard detectives — is somehow part of an ongoing power struggle inside the Kremlin , in advance of Mr Putin 's putative departure from office in 2008 .
There are several sub - theories : that the point is to undermine one or other of his possible successors , or somehow to force Mr Putin to stay in office , which some who have profited during his presidency would like .
Then there is the theory that Mr Litvinenko was himself hawking the polonium around London to potential buyers , or ( so say some in Moscow ) had been helping Chechen terrorists to build a “ dirty bomb ” .
Or that he had fallen foul of Russian gangsters , who are not always easily distinguishable from the government .
And so on .
Cui bono ?
The scandal has arisen at a time of already increased tension between Russia and Britain , partly induced by Britain 's refusal to extradite Mr Berezovsky .
Sergei Lavrov , Russia 's foreign minister , has given warning that it threatens to make Anglo - Russian relations even worse .
The Kremlin was said to be angry that accusations Mr Litvinenko supposedly made against Mr Putin from his deathbed were publicised .
The Russians apparently misconstrued the police protection given to Mr Litvinenko in hospital as some sort of incarceration .

Mourning Anglo- Russian relations ?
Realising the damage that is being done to the reputation of Russia and Russians , the Kremlin has been trying to appear co-operative with the team of British detectives who arrived in Moscow on December 4th .
Yet the co-operation will be tightly circumscribed .
Yuri Chaika , Russia 's attorney - general , said that the British officers would be allowed to make no arrests nor question witnesses directly .
It is almost inconceivable that anyone could ever be extradited .
Serving or former FSB officers are unlikely to be questioned .
One , Mikhail Trepashkin , claims to have useful information .
But , like Mr Litvinenko , Mr Trepashkin has investigated the 1999 apartment bombings .
He is currently in prison in the Urals .
The Russians , meanwhile , have begun their own investigation into Mr Litvinenko's death and Mr Kovtun 's alleged poisoning .
That is as likely to result in as much obfuscation as elucidation : whoever is guilty , the Russian reflex — as , for example , the Kursk submarine disaster in 2000 and the Beslan school massacre of 2004 prove — is to cover up and prevent any blame sticking anywhere important .
With their Russian colleagues , the London detectives managed to speak to Mr Kovtun , but as of December 7th had yet to interview Andrei Lugovoi , an associate of Mr Kovtun who met Mr Litvinenko several times in the month before his death .
Mr Lugovoi protests his innocence .
The polonium may be the most important clue , though it has various possible implications .
One is that the choice of a radioactive poison was intentionally sensational .
If so , it was designed either to demonstrate the scope and ruthlessness of the murderers , and to send a hair - raising message to Mr Litvinenko 's friends and hosts .
Or — according to another rationale — to damage Mr Putin 's reputation and Russian - Western relations .
Alternatively , whoever chose it may have thought that it would have been untraceable .
Instead it left a radioactive trail that is helping the British police decipher where and by whom it was given to the victim .
But even if the assassin is identified , the ultimate authors of the crime are very unlikely to be .
White House vows to review 485 contacts with Abramoff Administration says the lobbyist did not have undue influence with staff members
WASHINGTON — The White House denied Friday that convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff had undue influence in the Bush administration but said it would review a House committee report detailing at least 485 contacts between Abramoff and administration officials .
" I 'll tell you what it accurately portrays is the fact that Jack Abramoff was an exuberant practitioner of sleaze , " said administration spokesman Tony Snow , " to the point where it 's very difficult within the report itself to figure out how many actual contacts there are . "
The House Government Reform Committee report , based on records from Abramoff 's former firm , said it could not tell if the former lobbyist overstated his influence .
" The fact is , if he was telling people that he was getting results , they were getting ripped off , " Snow said .
The report documents Abramoff 's claims of far more White House contacts than the administration has acknowledged .
The records detail Abramoff and his associates ' contacts with key Bush adviser Karl Rove , former White House aide Ken Mehlman ( now national GOP chairman ) , former Rove assistant Susan Ralston ( a former Abramoff employee ) , Rove associate Ralph Reed and several other officials .
In January , Abramoff pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy , mail fraud and tax evasion in conjunction with his lobbying activities .
Rove , asked by ABC News on Friday whether he had accepted gifts from Abramoff , said , " Afraid not . "
Mehlman told Fox News on Friday that as White House political director his job included meetings with " interested parties " and " in some cases , political supporters . "
" And it was all stuff that was above board , " he said , adding that the report indicates Abramoff " may have been exaggerating . "
" I look at it as guys talking big about what they were doing with the White House , " he said .
Reed said he had not seen the report , which said Abramoff 's White House lobbying efforts produced mixed results .
Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said the report raises new questions about the links between Abramoff and " his co-conspirators in the Republican culture of corruption and the Bush White House . "
Rep. Tom Davis , R - Va. , and chairman of the committee that produced the report , steered clear of political rhetoric .
" We will let others construct a circumstantial house of cards and quibble about how many e-mails it takes to consummate a close friendship in Washington , " Davis said .
Mr. Goldstein said that rather than speed up the process of producing more ethanol , Congress should “ step back and reflect on the damage we have already done . ”
By contrast , ethanol advocates in Congress are pushing to accelerate research into cellulosic sources with the stated goal of speeding the timetable for when corn can be supplemented — or supplanted — as the chief ethanol crop .

“ We need additional funds for transitioning to making more energy crops for our national security , ” Senator Tom Harkin , an Iowa Democrat and the new chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee , said in an interview earlier this month . ”
The agriculture secretary , Mike Johanns , said there will be an “ adjustment period “ for ethanol that will last a few years .
But he is confident that more corn will emerge to ease the pain of higher grain prices , as seed companies improve yields and farmers shift their acreage from other crops .
“ When you look at the whole constellation of issues , and advancements that are out there , it is a very encouraging time for agriculture , ” Mr. Johanns said in an interview .
The race to crack the code to produce cellulosic ethanol more efficiently has attracted dozens of researchers , venture capitalists and even the interest of major oil companies like BP and Chevron .
Vinod Khosla , a major venture capitalist who has poured money into seven different start - up companies , has been pushing Washington lawmakers to set more aggressive targets to ensure that the demand for corn moves beyond corn .
“ If I am going to take the risk , the market has to be big , ” Mr. Khosla said .
The Renewable Fuels Association is trying to balance the competing concerns .
The organization was not always interested in rapid expansion , particularly if that meant allowing competition for A.D.M. from sources like Brazilian sugar .
David Hallberg , the association ’s founding president , said he left after four years in the job partly because he grew tired of disputes with A.D.M. executives over the future direction of the industry .

A recent post by Mike on his blog Mike - o- Matic gave me flashbacks to some of the most ill - informed management decisions it ’s been my horror to witness in the past .
He provided 7 tips for the great build or buy debate which plagues IT departments everywhere .
For those who do n’t work in IT , this debate is basically “ do we buy and off - the - shelf product to accomplish what we need or do we develop a custom tool in - house ? ”
Again , if you do n’t work in IT this might not seem relevant to you but I do n’t think there ’s a job today that is n’t affected by IT implementation decisions so this article might give you some insights into why certain IT systems that feel useless have been inflicted upon you .
There is not one single answer to this question .
If you are working in a place that decrees there is a single answer ( “ we will always buy an existing product ” – “ we will always build our own solutions ” ) that ’s your whole problem summed up there .
If each situation is n’t judged on its own merits then it ’s pretty much inevitable that some inappropriate decisions will be made .
It should n’t be surprising that I have a bias towards up - front analysis – I am a Business Analyst after all – but I do n’t recommend crippling progress with exhaustive ( or should that be exhausting ) analysis at the cost of actually doing something .
This being the angry blog of Mr Angry , I ’ll illustrate my points with some insane decisions I ’ve witnessed that have made me truly angry .
The first example I ’ll use is a business that had a chronic problem with people developing a custom tool for every little task .
I did n’t realise how bad the problem was at first because most of my work revolved around the core systems – propping up aging IBM AS / 400 mainframes rather than developing any new tools .
As an aside , I do n’t even mention working on these dinosaurs of the Big Iron Age on my resume from fear a recruitment agency will try to place me somewhere else that uses them .
I know some people like mainframes – I ’m not one of them .
Realistically , it is n’t surprising that people were developing custom tools in this environment because the process for making changes to mainframe systems is n’t exactly nimble .
The trouble is , the decisions being made were all short - term gain , long - term pain .
One of Mike ’s recommendations was to ban widespread use of MS Access across companies to limit people ’s ability to make their own custom applications .
He was being tongue in cheek but it ’s a classic example of “ a little knowledge is a dangerous thing . ”
People learn how to build their own little database applications so they run off and do it despite the fact it would usually be better to have a common tool used across the company .
In this company , people went one better ( which really means one worse ) and were building applications in Excel .
People often stretch Excel ’s ability ( it ’s a spreadsheet , dammit , that ’s all it should be used for ) to make it perform like a database ( a bad idea as illustrated in this fun comic ) but these people were actually building full - blown VB applications in Excel .
For the non-geeks that means that although it looked they were running a custom built program , it was all jury - rigged on top of Excel .
The data they were working with could n’t be shared across the business ( like it could have been if it was built on the mainframe as it was supposed to be ) and it was pushing Excel way beyond its intended limits which meant it could collapse at any moment .
This was actually the problem I had been called to look at , their “ solution ” kept crashing and losing all their data .
I heard they were running their work in Excel and though that meant they were running complex spreadsheets .
I was absolutely stunned when I saw what they were doing .
They had gone so far as to design a complex graphical user interface in VB and paste it on top – it looked like a fancy web application .
“ What can you do fix the problem ? ”
It was a few minutes before I could think of something to say beyond :
“ You ’re the problem , my solution is to shoot you and put a hand grenade in your hard drive so nobody else copies your idea . ”
In short , this was a textbook case of people developing custom solutions when they should have been looking for a standard company - wide application .
The people doing this thought they were right because they believed they had solved their problem .
What they had was a work - around , not a solution .
The main problems with their work - arounds were that they were n’t available across the whole company ( and a real solution was needed company wide ) and they were totally unreliable .
For the other side of the coin I ’ll use an example of a company that insisted on buying a system instead of looking at the possibility of developing a solution in - house .
One of the problems this company had was they were trying to do too many big things at the same time and so management ’s focus was completely splintered .
The financial system , e-commerce engine and web publishing system were all planned to be replaced concurrently .
Any one of these projects is a major undertaking but to plan to do all three at the same time is pretty goddam scary .
Oh , and a new head of IT ( Chief Information Officer / CIO ) was put in place at the same time .
The new CIO issued a blanket ruling : “ We are not a specialist IT development company , ” ( accurate enough statement ) “ so we will not develop any software in - house .
We will always buy off the shelf .
And we will never use open source , we will only use commercial products . ”
Ouch .
That did not go down well in the IT department .
The problem with his seemingly logical statement was that we might not have been specialist developers but there were some highly skilled and very motivated coders in the IT department .
I was just the shitkicker BA but there were some damn smart people there .
It was my job to put together the requirements and tender documents for the web publishing tool so off I went and started .
One day the lead developer comes up to me .
“ Can we put in a submission for this project ? ” he asked .
“ How do you mean ? ”
“ Show the development team the tender documents all the vendors are getting and we ’ll respond with our proposed solution along with everybody else . ”
He outlined their proposed solution .
They had a prototype that involved putting together a couple of open source applications to form a complete web publishing tool .
They had worked out how to copy the existing kludgy database of web content straight across so there would be no interruption to the site .
Once it was in this more stable architecture they could progressively tweak it until it was better structured which would make it much more manageable , allowing for the deployment of a consistent design across the site , easier editing and it would be much easier to manage the growth of the site .
This solution would be quicker to deploy than any alternative , easier to maintain and much cheaper than any alternative .
Management responded with a wall of silence .
The wall was occasionally broken with the rote “ we are not a development house ” line but largely there seemed to be a mentality of ignore it and it will go away .
This proved to be an effective strategy as all of the motivated developers quit over the next six months and so did I .
So the CIO ’s vision was not challenged and the company missed a huge opportunity .
At the end of the day , this is not a decision to make lightly .
As Mike pointed out , software developers are often the highest paid non-management staff in a company and having them work on development can be costly both in dollar terms and lost opportunity terms .
Uncontrolled custom development usually ends up with a series of incompatible ( and often unstable ) systems across departments that cost time and money to maintain and as often as not , this aspect causes reduced efficiency , not the improvements each individual claims .
But likewise , arbitrarily ignoring the possibilities of in - house development can cost the company more and can definitely affect the morale of the IT department ( an issue that management ignores at its peril ) .
The following list is a summary of Mike ’s 7 tips .
They are a good guide on how to make the best “ Buy or Build ” decision :
1 . Do research before building requirements
2 . Be willing to change your behaviour to suit a software tool
3. Consider open source
4 . Get a range of people involved in evaluating options
5. Focus on flexibility
6 . Remove the incentive to empire - build
7 . Ban people from building custom applications in Microsoft Access ( really , really ban them from building custom applications in Excel )
These are not necessarily in order of importance but number one should always be first as everything else flows from this .
In short , THINK before making a decision .
Feingold seeks censure of president Little support seen for condemnation of wiretapping program Sen. Russ Feingold introduces his resolution on the Senate floor Monday .
RELATED PREVIOUS CENSURE
The Senate has censured a president only once -- in 1834 , when an anti-administration coalition demanded that President Andrew Jackson produce a document having to do with his veto of a bill to recharter the Bank of the United States .
The body voted 26 - 20 to censure Jackson when he refused to provide the document to the Senate .
The censure was " expunged " from the record in 1837 by a Senate again in the hands of Jacksonian Democrats .
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Russ Feingold Senate Civil Rights September 11 attacks or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Russ Feingold introduced a resolution Monday to censure President Bush for authorizing a no-warrant domestic surveillance program , accusing Bush of breaking the law and misleading Congress about it .
" When the president of the United States breaks the law , he must be held accountable , " the Wisconsin Democrat told the Senate .
Feingold 's action will likely be largely symbolic .
No Republican senators , who hold a majority , are expected to vote for the resolution , and no other Democratic senators have expressed support for it .
" The president authorized an illegal program to spy on American citizens on American soil , and then misled Congress and the public about the existence and the legality of that program , " said Feingold , a potential presidential candidate .
( Watch Feingold , Cheney state their cases -- 2:01 ) The Bush administration has argued that the resolution authorizing military action after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , along with the president 's authority as commander in chief of the military , give him the power to order U.S. intelligence agencies to monitor calls between people in the United States and terrorism suspects overseas without a court order , as a 1978 law requires .
( Interactive : Government eavesdropping )
Administration officials have said the program , run by the National Security Agency , is necessary to battle terrorists , and that its disclosure in December damaged national security .
But Feingold said the administration 's case " would be laughable if this issue were not so serious . "
" The founders anticipated abuses of executive power by creating a balance of powers in the Constitution , " he said .
" Supporting and defending the Constitution , as we have taken an oath to do , require us to preserve that balance , and to have the will to act . "
The White House and its allies in Congress hit back quickly , with Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist calling for a snap vote on the resolution .
Frist , a Tennessee Republican , called the measure " a political stunt that is addressed at attacking the president of the United States of America when we 're at war . "
He criticized Feingold for introducing the censure resolution " at the same time we have terrorists right now intending to attack Western civilization and the people of our homeland . "
Democratic leaders objected to an immediate vote , saying Feingold 's resolution deserved more time for consideration .
" To try to limit debate on this most important matter that Senator Feingold is going to put before the Senate is inappropriate , " said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat .
Sen .
Joe Lieberman , a Connecticut Democrat who supports the Iraq war , said he does not buy the Bush administration 's argument that it had the legal authority to enact the program .
But , he said , " I 'd prefer to see us solve the problem . "
Cheney challenges Democrats Meanwhile , at a Republican campaign event in Feingold 's home state , Vice President Dick Cheney challenged Democrats to take a stand on the Feingold resolution .
He called the resolution an " outrageous proposition " and said it " poses a key test for our Democratic leaders :
Do they support the extreme and counterproductive antics of a few , or do they support a lawful program vital to the security of this nation ? "
The vice president asserted that Americans " agree with the president , and our administration 's position is clear --
If there are individuals inside our country talking with al Qaeda overseas , we want to know about it . "
Opinion polls have been closely split on the issue .
A CNN / USA Today / Gallup poll in February found that 47 percent of those polled thought the administration was right to authorize a warrantless eavesdropping program , while 50 percent disagreed .
In a CNN interview earlier Monday , Feingold said the administration was playing a " game of intimidation " that appeared to be working .
" Even Republican senators have said this is not within the law , " he said , referring to the wiretapping program .
" But the intimidation campaign of calling people names makes people apparently afraid of saying exactly what the law is and stand up for the Constitution . "
But a leading Republican skeptic of the NSA program , Pennsylvania Sen .
Arlen Specter , said Feingold 's censure resolution was " vastly excessive . "
If administration officials like Attorney General Alberto Gonzales are correct , Specter said , " then there is no violation of law by the president . "
Briefings on the program have been limited to congressional leaders and members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees so far .
Specter said he did not know if the program was legal and constitutional .
" I do n't have any basis for knowing , because I do n't know what the program does , " he said in the Senate .
Specter suggested that Feingold 's resolution be referred to his committee , which could hold hearings on the matter .
Gonzales would disclose no details of the program in a hearing held last month before the Judiciary Committee .
Feingold told CNN on Monday that censure would " send a clear signal " that Bush 's actions were wrong .

Will Rush apologize to MJ
Fox after he told Katie Couric that he was on his medication while filming an ad promoting embryonic stem cell research ?
Watching
Fox 's condition up close and personal is so sad to see and for Rush to mock him for a political agenda is tragic .
Limbaugh will never apologize or honestly regret what he 's done because it 's part of a long term strategy to once again attack the messenger .
Unfortunately for the country -- conservatives can say anything they want and never pay a price for their outlandish remarks so Limbaugh will escape unscathed .
Download - WMP Download - QT ( Arlen Parsa sent the QT )
CBS :
His body visibly wracked by tremors , Fox appears in a political ad touting Missouri Democratic Senate candidate Claire McCaskill 's stance in favor of embryonic stem cell research .
That prompted Limbaugh to speculate that Fox was " either off his medication or acting . "
Fox told Couric , " At this point now , if I did n't take medication I would n't be able to speak . "
He said he appeared in the ad only to advance his cause , and that " disease is a non-partisan problem that requires a bipartisan solution . "
" I do n't really care about politics , " Fox added .
" We want to appeal to voters to elect the people that are going to give us a margin , so we can't be vetoed again . "
The irony is that I was too medicated .
I was dyskinesic , " Fox told Couric .
" Because the thing about … being symptomatic is that it 's not comfortable .
No one wants to be symptomatic ; it 's like being hit with a hammer . "
Jame Hamsher sums it up nicely :
Rush has done his job well .
The goalposts are suddenly moved , this is considered a legitimate line of inquiry , it is reasonable to ask if someone suffering from Parkinson 's disease is either a fake or a dupe for backing those who want to pursue a cure and a few more votes might be squeezed out of Missouri .
It 's quite remarkable to see the incredulity with which the traditional media are greeting Rush Limbaugh 's comments about Michael J. Fox , as if nothing like this has ever happened before .
They seem completely unable to come to grips either with what is happening , or why it 's happening , or the role they are expected to play in this sordid , repetitious little drama ... read on
The right constantly attacks science now in the same fashion that they 've assaulted the press for so many years and if our media does n't step up soon --- then the same fate awaits them and they 'll end up genuflecting to conservatives too .
Neocon appeasement story Appeasement and Munich are favored neocon themes to promote and justify more war .
In a dangerous trend , they are being picked up by more columnists .
Strange that the more force that the U.S. applies in the Middle East , the more that the neocons wail appeasement and the more force they demand .
Strange , because repeated applications of force , the opposite of appeasement and applied in the name of avoiding appeasement , have brought no tangible gains .
They have brought losses , and losses should be cut .
Once again , neocons ca n’t think straight .
One should not throw good money after bad .
The U.S. ca n’t win in the Middle East .
It should take its chips off the table .
It should never have sat down at the table .
Neocons now call for armed confrontation with Iran in order to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons .
They want the U.S. to stand up to Iran and fight if necessary , starting a war if need be .
If rhetoric and public fears launched wars , we ’d already be in another one .
And Congressional resolutions and sanctions have in fact moved us closer to war .
This is a war that the U.S. cannot win physically .
It is a war that is morally lost the instant that the first bombs are dropped on Iran .
This is a war that leads to hundreds of years of future warfare setting Islamic peoples against the West .
There is no end to how much force neocons wish to apply , and anything less than total war is regarded as appeasement by them .
Some take this position because they believe that anything less than overturning Iran and preventing it from obtaining nuclear weapons means the destruction of Western civilization .
The neocon position has matters backwards .
Trying to overturn Iran by force will itself hasten the destruction of the West .
Neocons argue that Iran wants to bring down the entire West no matter what .
They infer that U.S. disengagement and negotiations are therefore useless and war is necessary .
They are incorrect on all counts .
Not all Iranians want to see the West destroyed , and not all are inflexible in their views .
But suppose that Dr. Ahmadinejad is one of the inflexible ones .
Suppose that he is indeed a “ certifiable apocalyptic ” ( see Gary North ) .
He can be restrained by those mullahs who do not share his beliefs or who have more realistic expectations .
It makes sense to play for time and attempt to divide the Iranians .
It does not make sense to play into Ahmadinejad ’s hands and bring on the conflict that he might desire or believe that he is called upon to instigate .
The neocon position entails the utter destruction of all Iranians who wish to see the West destroyed .
What they do not realize is that it also entails the continued destruction of anyone else who takes their place after they are destroyed .
And we can expect that initiating war on Iran will radicalize not only Iranians but also many other sympathetic Muslims .
What appeasement ?
On the face of it , the appeasement position is incredible .
Where ’s the appeasement ?
The U.S. has plenty of force and has not been reluctant to use it .
Where are the U.S. concessions ?
There have n’t been any .
Where ’s the Munich agreement ?
It does n’t exist .
Where ’s the Iranian industrial power comparable to Hitler ’s or the comparable ability to place a very large well - trained and equipped armed force into combat well beyond one ’s borders ?
Iran is incapable of destroying the West .
Where ’s the nuclear arsenal of Iran ?
Even if it had one , which it does not , it could not destroy the West without itself being destroyed .
Where ’s the history of aggressions and annexations by Iran that compare to Hitler ’s ?
Iran has supported Hizbullah which managed to get the Israelis out of Lebanon for a while and has used and supported terror tactics .
So have many nations .
So have many dictators that the U.S. has supported .
We condemn all such actions , but the question is whether they add up to a record like Hitler ’s .
They do not .
Why is Tehran so interested in negotiating with Washington , in a clear break with the past ?
Could it be that it sees a danger of being attacked ?
When Washington spurns Iran ’s overtures , the first in 25 years , is this appeasement ?
Of course not .
And if Washington agreed to negotiate in good faith , would this be appeasement ?
Of course not .
Meeting with Iranians and Ahmadinejad has many immediate benefits .
We gain information about what Iranians want .
We gain information about their divisions and the strength of their preferences .
We delay hostilities .
We learn more about Dr. Ahmadinejad .
We raise our moral stature .
We have a chance to change some of their minds .
The two sides might actually agree on a few further steps that lead away from war .
What do we lose ?
Iran gains time to pursue its nuclear ventures .
There is little we can do to stop that anyway , short of war .
Sooner or later , if Iran wants nuclear weapons , it will get them .
If starting a war with Iran is as bad as I think it is , with very negative long - term consequences , then meeting with Iranians is a very good investment .
The neocons simply want to ratchet up the level of violence to remake the Middle East .
Their argument is that if we do not , we ’ll be destroyed by Iran or by some pan-Islamic combine .
This is ridiculous .
The U.S. nuclear arsenal deterred the Soviet Union .
It can deter Iran .
The neocon answer to this is that Iran is led by hate - filled fanatics who will not face a reality like seeing their country effaced from the earth by hydrogen bombs .
How credible is that assumption ?
Should U.S. policy be based upon such an assumption ?
Not all Iranians are impervious to realities .
Many Iranian leaders have a definite political agenda .
Not all are expecting the imminent return of the Mahdi .
Iranian goals run up against American ambitions in the Middle East , and this is a basic source of conflict , not an abstract desire to destroy Western civilization and be destroyed in the process .
Churchill said “ A fanatic is one who ca n’t change his mind and wo n’t change the subject . ”
If we rely on the extreme beliefs of our homegrown neocon fanatics , whose own ideas are impervious to change and who ca n’t propose any course of action except war , then we shall ourselves destroy our own civilization .
Losing is not appeasement
The neocons do not realize that force is a great weapon as long as it ’s not used .
They did not understand that once the U.S. embarked on a policy of force in Iraq , it risked more than its initial stake .
Losing Iraq lost the U.S. prestige and credibility everywhere else in the region and wherever else it might be confronted .
It strengthened Iran ’s hand .
It weakened Israel’s .
Practically speaking , the American people and the military are much less likely and capable of underwriting another venture on the heels of a failed one .
Once an initial application of force goes wrong , as in Iraq , defeat and withdrawal begin to look like appeasement in the face of other threats , real or imagined .
In other words , what seems like appeasement to the neocons now is a direct consequence of resorting to force in the first place and losing .
A U.S. weakened by its missteps and unable to make good on its threats will indeed be more inclined to pull back .
If it does , it wo n’t be appeasement .
It will be the result of losses and seeking to stem further losses .
This will not be the end of the world or Western civilization .
It will , however , be attributable to the long - term ( flawed ) U.S. policy of trying to control the Middle East and to the specific neocon policies that included attacking Iraq , sanctions and threats against Iran , a diplomacy of pressure , and attacking Lebanon .
The Lebanon fiasco If Israel ever attacks Iran , it means the U.S. attacks Iran .
The U.S. has to restrain Israel if it is to avoid setting fanatic against fanatic and launching a hundred or more year ’s war .
From this standpoint , the U.S. miscalculated badly in encouraging Israel to attack Lebanon .
Neocons hoped that Israel would take out Hizbullah and reduce its threat .
They hoped for a widening of the war to Syria and Iran .
If Israel failed , the risk was that Hizbullah would be strengthened and Israel weakened .
Now that Israel has lost and Hizbullah won , the loss has exposed Israel ’s weak and vulnerable position .
Israel is surrounded by foes with renewed spirit and hope .
The balance of power has shifted in favor of Hizbullah , Iran , and Syria .
Hizbullah ’s political position in Lebanon has been strengthened .
Even if it has been temporarily weakened by loss of men , material , and position , it can quickly rebuild its operations and resupply its guerillas .
Israel wo n’t be able to stop the flow of weapons or prevent recruiting and training .
Israel ’s foes have several advantages .
Hizbullah ’s leaders can decide when they want to apply pressure .
They can bide their time .
They can decide how much pressure to apply and in what forms .
They have allies in Gaza .
They can maintain guerilla tactics and avoid outright massed attacks on Israel .
The odds are that they will stay with tactics of attrition , threat , terror , and political pressure , hoping to weaken Israel or gain concessions .
Some types of concessions that weaken it as a Jewish state might effectively , over time , spell the doom of Israel in its present form .
The game is a long - term game in which changes in the demographics in Israel can play a part .
Even out - migration of Jews from Israel can play a part .
Restraining Israel Iran is a state that aspires to be the Middle Eastern hegemon while the U.S. opposes Iranian dominance .
Iran and Syria have the advantage of Hizbullah , which buffers their direct involvement .
Israel ’s advantage is that it can use surprise attack , but against whom and will it succeed ?
It did n’t work against Lebanon .
Israel will try to block Hizbullah ’s resupply efforts while avoiding an expansion of hostilities .
It will try to rebuild its credibility .
A direct attack on Syrian territory would bring Syria into the war and then Iran , its treaty ally .
Once Iran is in , the U.S. would come in .
A major war would result .
The U.S. military cannot rationally support such a costly and risky war .
Therefore Israel ( rationally ) should be restrained by the U.S.
Will it be ?
The U.S. urged Israel on in Lebanon .
Influential interest groups like AIPAC that have no concern for U.S. interests will be urging the U.S. to support whatever Israel does to the hilt .
And our current leadership seems only too anxious to comply , partly because they are operating under one neocon illusion after another anyway .
This situation could not be more dangerous .
The U.S. support of Israel ’s attack on Lebanon has only made it more dangerous and has only shown us once again that U.S. policy is on a disastrous course .
Appeasement is not the problem whatsoever .
Stupidity is .
The U.S. should n’t even contemplate allowing Israel pre-emptively to bomb Iran for any reason .
This is the same as a U.S. attack .
What sort of world will we have after such an event ?
Such an attack would be long - term suicide for Israel and mean endless war for the U.S. Unfortunately , although the U.S. military cannot rationally recommend an Israeli air strike upon Iran , this does not mean that it could not happen .
The U.S. has blundered numerous times in the Middle East ( and elsewhere ) and can again .
Conclusion The U.S. has n’t appeased any country in the Middle East .
It has done just the opposite .
America ’s missteps in the Middle East have weakened its position .
All is not lost .
The U.S. can stop playing the foolish neocon war game , pull back , rebuild credibility , rebuild its financial and other strengths , take a breather , tone down the rhetoric , talk with its foes , rebuild its moral stature , and play for time .
This is the smart course to take , as opposed to setting the world ablaze .
The two main issues in the Middle East are oil and Israel .
U.S. can buy oil without controlling the politics of the Middle East .
It can deregulate energy , including nuclear energy , and resolve its energy problems without war .
The Israel issue ca n’t be resolved as easily .
Israel in its current political form is doomed .
It makes no sense for the U.S. to start a world war in order to preserve Israel .
It makes no sense for the Israeli tail to wag the U.S. dog .
The U.S. has to control Israel .
America got into this mess and only America can get out of it .
America has little choice but strongly to control Israel , if it can , to control negotiations , if it can , and to lead the way in settling all the outstanding questions surrounding Israel ’s existence and political nature .
The alternatives are that Israel will gradually be worn down anyway and / or that the U.S. will engage in the great folly of a major war .
Every official U.S. link with and every step into a foreign country creates costs and risks for the American people .
They usually are not worth it .
They usually cause losses .
Nowhere is this better demonstrated than in the Middle East .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
The American press in the first days of the Iraq war reported extensively on the Pentagon 's failure to post American troops in front of the National Museum in Baghdad , which , as a result , was looted of many of its great archaeological treasures .
Less widely reported , but to Phillips far more meaningful , was the immediate posting of troops around the Iraqi Oil Ministry , which held the maps and charts that were the key to effective oil production .
Phillips fully supports an explanation of the Iraq war that the Bush administration dismisses as conspiracy theory -- that its principal purpose was to secure vast oil reserves that would enable the United States to control production and to lower prices .
( " Think of Iraq as a military base with a very large oil reserve underneath , " an oil analyst said a couple of years ago .
" You ca n't ask for better than that . " )
Terrorism , weapons of mass destruction , tyranny , democracy and other public rationales were , Phillips says , simply ruses to disguise the real motivation for the invasion .
And while this argument may be somewhat too simplistic to explain the complicated mix of motives behind the war , it is hard to dismiss Phillips 's larger argument : that the pursuit of oil has for at least 30 years been one of the defining elements of American policy in the world ; and that the Bush administration -- unusually dominated by oilmen -- has taken what the president deplored recently as the nation 's addiction to oil to new and terrifying levels .
The United States has embraced a kind of " petro- imperialism , " Phillips writes , " the key aspect of which is the U.S. military 's transformation into a global oil - protection force , " and which " puts up a democratic facade , emphasizes freedom of the seas ( or pipeline routes ) and seeks to secure , protect , drill and ship oil , not administer everyday affairs . "
Phillips is especially passionate in his discussion of the second great force that he sees shaping contemporary American life -- radical Christianity and its growing intrusion into government and politics .
The political rise of evangelical Christian groups is hardly a secret to most Americans after the 2004 election , but Phillips brings together an enormous range of information from scholars and journalists and presents a remarkably comprehensive and chilling picture of the goals and achievements of the religious right .
He points in particular to the Southern Baptist Convention , once a scorned seceding minority of the American Baptist Church but now so large that it dominates not just Baptism itself but American Protestantism generally .
The Southern Baptist Convention does not speak with one voice , but almost all of its voices , Phillips argues , are to one degree or another highly conservative .
On the far right is a still obscure but , Phillips says , rapidly growing group of " Christian Reconstructionists " who believe in a " Taliban - like " reversal of women 's rights , who describe the separation of church and state as a " myth " and who call openly for a theocratic government shaped by Christian doctrine .
A much larger group of Protestants , perhaps as many as a third of the population , claims to believe in the supposed biblical prophecies of an imminent " rapture " -- the return of Jesus to the world and the elevation of believers to heaven .
Prophetic Christians , Phillips writes , often shape their view of politics and the world around signs that charlatan biblical scholars have identified as predictors of the apocalypse -- among them a war in Iraq , the Jewish settlement of the whole of biblical Israel , even the rise of terrorism .
He convincingly demonstrates that the Bush administration has calculatedly reached out to such believers and encouraged them to see the president 's policies as a response to premillennialist thought .
He also suggests that the president and other members of his administration may actually believe these things themselves , that religious belief is the basis of policy , not just a tactic for selling it to the public .
Phillips 's evidence for this disturbing claim is significant , but not conclusive .

Coutts was obsessed with violent porn sites
Methods used to combat child porn are set to be drawn upon and police officers could be given greater powers .
A Home Office spokesman confirmed an announcement would be made " shortly " , following international talks .
British sites carrying illegal sexually violent porn can be closed but images on foreign websites can be accessed .
Discussions on such websites have taken place between G8 countries and internet service providers .

Law hopes for Jane 's mother
The move comes after Home Secretary Charles Clarke met the mother of 31 - year - old teacher Jane Longhurst , from Brighton , who was murdered by Graham Coutts , a friend addicted to sexually violent internet porn .
Liz Longhurst , of Reading , Berkshire , was shocked such material was freely available and the new laws may make viewing such images from the UK could now be made an offence .
Mrs Longhurst has campaigned for new laws and welcomed reports of a government crackdown on such sites .
She told the BBC News website : " If it had not been for the publicity surrounding my daughter 's horrendous death , and starting off the trust and the campaign , I think nothing much would have been done .
" If something is brought in I will feel that my daughter 's death would not have been entirely in vain . "
International co-operation
One of the problems to be tackled is the lack of an international agreement on what constitutes obscene porn , meaning foreign sites with such images can be accessed from the UK .
A Home Office spokesman said : " We are looking at ways in which the current law might be strengthened .
" We want to do all we can to block access to illegal sites . "
Officials were in talks with internet firms and other people , he said .
UK sites publishing such material faced prosecution under the Obscene Publications Act , but effective action against overseas websites could " be achieved only through international co-operation " , he added .
" We have made a lot of progress in relation to child pornography and we will look at how lessons can be learned from that . "

Not everybody can evaluate all evidence ; we can't evaluate the evidence for quantum physics .
So it does have to be a certain amount of taking things on trust .
I have to take what physicists say on trust , for example , because I 'm a biologist .
But science [ has ] a system of appraisal , of peer review , so that I trust the physics community to get their act together in a way that I know from the inside .
I wish people would put their trust in evidence , not in faith , revelation , tradition , or authority .
What do you wish people knew about evolution ?
That is staggering ignorance of what evolutionary science is about ; if they think that 's what evolutionists believe , no wonder they 're skeptical of it .
How can a civilized country have adult people in positions of leadership who know so stunningly little about the leading biological concept ?
You said in a recent speech that design was not the only alternative to chance .
A lot of people think that evolution is all about random chance .
That 's ludicrous .
That 's ridiculous .
Mutation is random in the sense that it 's not anticipatory of what 's needed .
Natural selection is anything but random .
Natural selection is a guided process , guided not by any higher power , but simply by which genes survive and which genes do n't survive .
That 's a non-random process .
The animals that are best at whatever they do - hunting , flying , fishing , swimming , digging - whatever the species does , the individuals that are best at it are the ones that pass on the genes .
It 's because of this non-random process that lions are so good at hunting , antelopes so good at running away from lions , and fish are so good at swimming .
There are intelligent people who have been taught good science and evolution , and who may choose to believe in something religious that may seem to fly in the face of science .
What do you make of that ?
It 's certainly hard to know what to make of it .
I think it 's a betrayal of science .
I think they have a religious agenda which , for reasons best known to themselves , they elevate above science .
What are your thoughts about the despair some people feel when they ponder natural selection and random mutation ?
The idea of evolution and natural selection makes some people feel that everything is meaningless -- people 's individual lives and life in general .
If it 's true that it causes people to feel despair , that 's tough .
It 's still the truth .
The universe does n't owe us condolence or consolation ; it does n't owe us a nice warm feeling inside .
If it 's true , it 's true , and you 'd better live with it .
Is atheism the logical extension of believing in evolution ?
You criticize intelligent design , saying that " the theistic answer " -- pointing to God as designer --" is deeply unsatisfying " -- presumably you mean on a logical , scientific level .
Yes , because it does n't explain where the designer comes from .
If they 're going to emphasize the statistical improbability of biological organs -" these are so complicated , how could they have evolved ? " -- well , if they 're so complicated , how could they possibly have been designed ?
Because the designer would have to be even more complicated .
What other level ?
At whatever level where people say the idea of God is very satisfying .
Well , of course it is .
Would n't it be lovely to believe in an imaginary friend who listens to your thoughts , listens to your prayers , comforts you , consoles you , gives you life after death , can give you advice ?
Of course it 's satisfying , if you can believe it .
But who wants to believe a lie ?
Is atheism the logical extension of believing in evolution ?
They clearly can't be irrevocably linked because a very large number of theologians believe in evolution .
In fact , any respectable theologian of the Catholic or Anglican or any other sensible church believes in evolution .
Similarly , a very large number of evolutionary scientists are also religious .
My personal feeling is that understanding evolution led me to atheism .
How would you respond to people who say the most interesting or worthwhile aspect of human beings is behavior that natural selection would not promote ?
I 'm thinking of behavior like adopting children who are n't family members , voluntary celibacy , or people deciding to spend their whole life praying .
Adopting children that are not your own or a close relative 's is an interesting question .
Why do not just humans , but other species , do what on the face of it is the wrong thing to do from a selfish gene point of view ?
Cuckoos play upon this and actually engineer it so that other species raise [ baby cuckoos ] .
This is a mistake on the part of the foster parents , which have been " forced " to adopt the cuckoos .
By the way , I would hate this to be taken as any sort of suggestion that adoptive parents do n't love their adopted children ; of course they do .
But you could think of it as a kind of genetic mistake , in that human adults have strong parental instincts which make them long for a child .
If they can't have a child of their own , they can then satisfy those parental instincts by adopting a child .
In the same way , we have sexual instincts ; we long for sex and it does n't matter that we use contraception .
That 's , as it were , separating the natural function of sex , which is reproduction .
But we still enjoy sex in the same way that we enjoy being a parent even if it is not our own child that we 're looking after .
You 've said , " do n't name our present ignorance God " -- which you said is what intelligent design proponents are doing .
They 're taking an area where we 're ignorant and naming that God .
Do you think science will eventually explain everything we wonder about now ?
I do n't know the answer .
I 'm equally excited by both in a way .
I rather like the idea of understanding everything and I also quite like the idea of science being a never - ending , open - ended quest .
Where atheists find sources of joy and hope

Obviously , there are other things having nothing to do with science - music , poetry , sex , love .
These are all things that make life , to me , extremely worth living .
You 've criticized the idea of the afterlife .
What do you see as the problem with a terminally ill cancer patient believing in an afterlife ?
Oh , no problem at all .
I would never wish to disabuse or disillusion somebody who believed that .
I care about what 's true for myself , but I do n't want to go around telling people who are afraid of dying that their hopes are unreal .
If I could have a word with a would - be suicide bomber or plane hijacker who thinks he 's going to paradise , I would like to disabuse him .
I would n't say to him , " Do n't you see what you 're doing is wrong ? "
I would say , " Do n't imagine for one second you 're going to paradise .
You 're not .
You 're going to rot in the ground . "
How would you feel if your daughter became religious in the future ?
Well , that would be her decision and obviously she 's her own person , she 's free to do whatever she likes .
I think she 's much too intelligent to do that , but that 's her decision .
You talk about how your words have been twisted by religious people in the past .
Which words of yours have been twisted ?
Whenever I begin an argument by saying something that sounds as though it 's creationist , something like " the Cambrian Explosion is a sudden explosion of fossils almost as though they had no history , " I 'm obviously saying that as a prelude to explaining why .
But these people quote selectively .
It 's a demonstration of their fundamental dishonesty .
They 're not actually interested in truth , they 're interested in propaganda .
Are there one or two phrases you 've heard repeatedly quoted out of context that you 'd like to set the record straight about ?
Well , that 's one of them , about the Cambrian Explosion .
Another one is Darwin 's famous phrase , to suppose that " the eye , with all its inimitable contrivances " - he goes on about the complications of the eye - " could have been formed by natural selection , seems , I freely confess , absurd in the highest degree . "
He then goes on to explain it , and they never quote that .
They just stop there .
Dishonest .
The Design of Parallel Programming Languages

published in 1991
Prelude
" Show me . "
John held up the chalk , holding it by the top , the bottom pointed at his feet .
His smile was slight but visible , visible to everyone in the lecture hall ; his smile was aimed at me .
Who was more scared , the students , or me - the TA ?
That ’s something no one can ever know , but there were 50 of them and one of me ; if my answer is wrong , their answers would have been wrong .
Three months earlier , in my first quarter as graduate student at Stanford , in the Lab at the top of the hill , just before a volleyball game , I asked John McCarthy - the John McCarthy - whether I could have an office at the Lab and be supported by it .
The Lab being SAIL , the Stanford AI Lab , and I having been assigned elsewhere , in that dusty summer of 1975 , with the sharp fragrance of volleyball - courtside tarweed splattered on a background of eucalyptus ; hot and dry .
Hazy and dusty .
" Sure , " if I TAed 206 , the Lisp course .
OK , I knew Lisp , had learned it from the blue book - the Lisp 1.5 Programmer ’s Manual .
His book .
His language .
Some call his classes " Uncle John ’s Mystery Hour , " in which John McCarthy can and will lecture on the last thing he thought of before rushing late through the door and down the stairs to the front of the lecture hall .
But this class started out like anything but a mystery hour : John was reviewing the answers to the midterm .
The first few problems were routine , but this one maybe not , and he said , " Ah , this problem was intended to show you that there are some problems that Lisp is not good for . "
I can hear the worried thoughts behind me : " Er , but multiplying two polynomials seems so easy .
I musta got it wrong . "
And I , maybe I had graded it wrong .
John : " It turns out you need to pass global information , and the control structure is not regular .
Here are the six functions and two globals you need . "
So now you ’re thinking that the problem was stated funny .
Well , here it is : Let a 0 +a 1 x+a 2 x2 +...+a n xn be represented by the list ( a0 a 1 ... an ) ; write a function that multiplies two such polynomials .
The solution is easy too : if add - poly adds two such polynomials , and constant - multiply - poly multiplies a polynomial by a constant , then this is just :
( defun multiply - poly ( p1 p2 ) ( cond ( ( null p1 ) nil ) ( t ( add - poly ( constant - multiply - poly ( car p1 ) p2 ) ( cons 0 ( multiply - poly ( cdr p1 ) p 2 ) ) ) ) ) )
And those two helper functions are an obvious one or two lines of code .
John finishes his complicated explanation to a wash of silence .
I , lowly first - year grad student TA , peep : " I think Lisp can do better than that . "
And hope I have n’t blown it .
" Show me , " the smile begins with his eyes and spreads downward .
John ’s world is a world of ideas , a world in which ideas do n’t belong to anyone , and when an idea is wrong , just the idea - not the person - is wrong .
A world in which ideas are like young birds , and we catch them and proudly show them to our friends .
The bird ’s beauty and the hunter ’s are distinct .
And when John catches a bird on the way to class , we see it , and just the way he does .
So I write the few lines of code on the board , and John wonders at it : " Well , it looks like you ’re right , but you see , I was working on this other problem , talking to Gosper , and it threw me off track on this one .... "
Sometimes a bird flying past in a blaze of pretty song will distract a bird - catcher and maybe confuse him , too .
" That ’s OK John , " I say , my own smile flicking , " I would have given you partial credit . "
" I would expect that you ’d be able to see my solution is correct and give me full credit . "
" Nah .
I would have taken off 5 points for poor programming style . "
Some people wo n’t show you the birds they ’ve caught until they are sure , certain , positive that they - the birds , or themselves - are gorgeous , or rare , or remarkable .
When your mind can separate yourself from your bird , you will share it sooner , and the beauty of the bird will be sooner enjoyed .
And what is a bird but for being enjoyed ?
And if John ’s mystery hour is because he found a new bird , well , heck , let ’s just love him for it .
Ever since that day I ’ve patterned myself after him , and we ’ve had a long , strange road together - catching birds .
Ha , that ’s it !
Introduction
In 1984 , John McCarthy and I proposed a parallel dialect of Lisp , which we called Qlambda - later , the name was changed to Qlisp .
A number of papers have been written about Qlisp , several implementations have been made , and generally Qlisp is considered by researchers to be one of the standard parallel Lisp languages .
The initial motivation for the language was to study medium - grained parallelism within the context of a relatively small multiprocessor ( up to 16 processors ) with a shared memory system ( a single address space ) .
Two of the key problems of parallel programming we wished to solve were controlling excessive parallelism - spawning too many processes and thereby wasting resources - and determining reasonable semantics for Lisp functions that were now operating in a parallel context .
Qlisp also defined a number of constructs for speculative computation .
Speculative computation is the practice of spawning a number of processes to explore a set of possible approaches to computing a result , and the process that succeeds in computing the result deactivates or kills the others .
As Qlisp evolved , a number of higher - level constructs were defined and other language features were adopted and modified from other parallel dialects .
Examples of adopted features are futures and locks .
Examples of higher - level constructs are heavyweight futures and partially , multiply invoked functions .
Nevertheless , the problem has remained that it is difficult to write parallel programs in Qlisp and parallel languages like it .
Devising efficient means of execution appears an easier task than devising intuitive parallel languages ; that is , despite the several higher - level constructs added to Qlisp , Qlisp remains a low - level language , as discovered by programmers trying to use it .
It is here that another , very much more obscure bit of John ’s work has provided inspiration for new directions - samefringe .
Samefringe
In 1977 , in the pages of the ACM SIGART Newsletter , a debate raged over whether samefringe is the simplest problem that requires multiprocessing or coroutines to easily solve .
A number of people contributed solutions - including John McCarthy .
John ’s solution was startlingly simple .
The samefringe problem is this : two binary trees have the same fringe if they have exactly the same leaves reading from left to right .
( defun leaves ( tree ) ( cond ( ( atom tree ) ( list tree ) ) ( t ( append ( leaves ( car tree ) ) ( leaves ( cdr tree ) ) ) ) ) ) ( defun samefringe ( tree1 tree2 ) ( equal ( leaves tree1 ) ( leaves tree2 ) ) )
The problem , as stated in 1976 , was to write a samefringe program that does not consume a lot of storage , which the above solution will .
John ’s solution was this :
( defun samefringe ( tree1 tree2 ) ( or ( eq tree1 tree2 ) ( and ( not ( atom tree1 ) ) ( not ( atom tree2 ) ) ( same ( gopher tree1 ) ( gopher tree2 ) ) ) ) ) ( defun same ( x y ) ( and ( eq ( car x ) ( car y ) ) ( samefringe ( cdr x ) ( cdr y ) ) ) ) ( defun gopher ( tree ) ( cond ( ( atom ( car tree ) ) tree ) ( t ( gopher ( cons ( caar tree ) ( cons ( cdar tree ) ( cdr tree ) ) ) ) ) ) )
A key ingredient to this solution is the fact that gopher creates a small amount of additional storage , assuming that the Lisp has tail recursion removal ; but this solution is difficult to understand , and it seems as though it should be possible to write a parallel version of this program that is transparent to understand , even though it might not consume minimal storage .
Such a solution would have three processes , one each to traverse the trees and a third to do the comparisons .
That is , a solution should look like this :
( defun samefringe ( tree1 tree2 ) ( qflet t ( ( compare ( x y ) ( unless ( eq x y ) ( return - from samefringe nil ) ) ) ) ( labels ( ( traverse ( tree ) ( cond ( ( atom tree ) < report > ) ( t ( traverse ( car tree ) ) ( traverse ( cdr tree ) ) ) ) ) ) ( qprogn t ( traverse tree1 ) ( traverse tree2 ) ) < test > ) ) )
where < report > represents a mechanism that reports tree to compare as one of its arguments , and < test > tests whether the same number of leaves were reported .
The program below , for contrast , is the simplest Qlisp program that is structured as envisioned .
This solution is actually quite simple except that the control and synchronization mechanisms are mingled with the meat of the program , to an extent where it is nearly impossible to understand these essential parts of the program ; and this illustrates why Qlisp is a low level language .
( defun samefringe ( tree1 tree2 ) ( let ( ( s1 ( make - semaphore : count 0 ) ) ( s2 ( make - semaphore : count 1 ) ) ( sentinel ( list nil ) ) ( v nil ) ) ( flet ( ( compare ( leaf1 leaf2 ) ( unless ( eq leaf1 leaf2 ) ( return - from samefringe nil ) ) ) ) ( qlabels ( : parallelp t ) ( ( accept - leaf1 ( leaf ) ( wait - semaphore s2 ) ( setq v leaf ) ( signal - semaphore s1 ) ) ( accept - leaf2 ( leaf ) ( wait - semaphore s1 ) ( compare v leaf ) ( signal - semaphore s2 ) ) ) ( labels ( ( traverse ( tree report ) ( cond ( ( atom tree ) ( funcall report tree ) ) ( t ( traverse ( car tree ) report ) ( traverse ( cdr tree ) report ) ) ) ) ( traverse - tree ( tree report ) ( traverse tree report ) ( funcall report sentinel ) ) ) ( qlet t ( ( x ( traverse - tree tree1 #' accept - leaf1 ) ) ( y ( traverse - tree tree2 #' accept - leaf2 ) ) ) ( declare ( ignore x y ) ) t ) ) ) ) ) )
Design
This problem has inspired my research on the design of parallel programming languages .
Almost everyone who designs parallel languages is focused on the problem of writing programs that run fast , and the bulk of research in parallelism is aimed at the efficient use of processors .
The primary language feature that addresses ease of programming is the future , but this feature does not go very far towards rendering problems like samefringe easily solved .
The remaining sections introduce some new programming language concepts , each designed to help write the samefringe program .
Inherited Brands
The first concept is called inherited brands .
A brand is like a class , but instances have no brand - defined structure ( local storage ) .
Any object can be made an instance of a given brand , unless there would be a conflict .
Brands are thus like opaque types .
Brands plus structure definition yields classes .
All classes are brands .
Brands are organized into domains , where each domain can have its own notions of inheritance and method applicability .
Furthermore , some domains - the ones most interesting to us - permit objects to acquire and shed brands during execution ; such domains are called dynamic domains .
Domains determine brand conflicts .
The primary use of brands is to provide a means to dynamically tag objects during execution , and objects will generally accrete brands .
As we will see , it is useful to be able to tag an object with the process that produced it .
Processes are instances of brands in the process domain , and an object is an instance of a brand representing a process if that object was created or manipulated by that process .
Brands can be used to select methods exactly as classes can .
We will use the syntax x :c to indicate that the object named by x has the brand c .
The syntax x:c&d indicates that the object named by x has the brands c and d .

A process environment is a set of processes , each of which is an instance of the brand named process .
The set of these processes is first class .
Subsets of the processes can be distinguished by their brands , and control code can be written whose behavior depends on the state of the set of processes or the states of any of the processes in a process environment .
When certain important states are achieved or events occur within the environment , specific generic functions are invoked , and these generic functions may be specialized .
For example , when a process terminates , the generic function terminate is invoked by the system ; its default method returns t .
It is possible to distinguish various brands of termination : the brand completed indicates the process terminated by completion , killed means it was killed prematurely , and dead is a super - brand of completed and killed .
An important sub - brand of completed is quiescent .
A process is quiescent only when all processes spawned by it are also complete , including any spawned by implicit calls to terminate .
The following code creates a process environment :
( brand - let ( ( p1 ( process ) ) ( p2 ( process ) ) ) ( spawn p1 ( traverse tree1 ) ) ( spawn p2 ( traverse tree2 ) ) )
This code fragment creates two sub-brands of process , which is a class .
The variables p1 and p2 have lexical scope , and the processes they represent have indefinite extent .
spawn takes a brand and an expression , and creates an instance of the brand that will execute the expression .
A value returned from a process environment is branded by the process that originated it .
Furthermore , if an object passes through a process - by being bound to a variable within that process , for example - the object is also branded by that process .
The effect is that an object retains the history of its creation and manipulation by retaining its brands .
Functions also brand objects exactly as if they were processes .
Super - brands can be created to categorize functions , so that , for example , a scheduler can be written that will guarantee that no two functions of the same brand can be executed at the same time .
In some domains , a function brand is retained exactly during the dynamic extent of its invocation , and , in other domains , a function brand is permanently retained .
Improved PMI Functions
The basic idea of partially , multiply invoked functions ( PMI functions ) is to separate the process of coordinating the arrival of arguments from the process of executing the function on those arguments .
All calls to a function go through an interface to the actual implementation .
The implementation of the function receives arguments by position , while the interface accepts only named arguments , provides for all defaulting , and coordinates the arrival of arguments for the function from multiple sources .
This technique is similar to currying functions , but because all arguments to the interface are named , one does not need to curry in any particular order .
One could term it dynamic currying .
All calls to a PMI function that supply arguments to the same invocation receive the same future as their value .
A future is returned whenever some required arguments to the function have not been supplied to the interface by a function call .
If a particular invocation of a function has returned a future , the value returned when all required arguments have been supplied is a realized future .
This preserves the identity of all values returned for a particular invocation .
The improvement is to use brands and classes to distinguish arguments instead of explicit names .
The following is an example :
( defbrand p1 ( process ) ... ) ( defbrand p2 ( process ) ...)
( pmi-qdefun add - up ( x:p1 y: p2 ) (+ x y ) )
( add - up ( spawn p1 1 ) ) => < future > ( add - up ( spawn p2 2 ) ) => < the same future > = 3
The first call to add - up supplies the argument of brand p1 , and the second the argument of brand p2 .
These two are added to produce the result .
Discriminating on Callers
In CLOS , method applicability is determined by the classes of the ( required ) arguments .
As we will see , it can be convenient to discriminate on the class or brand of the calling function or process .
The following program prints p1 when the traversal of tree1 terminates , and p2 when the traversal of tree2 terminates .
Note that this uses the automatic invocation of terminate in process environments .
( brand - let ( ( p1 ( process ) ) ( p2 ( process ) ) ) ( gf-labels ( ( terminate : p1 ( ) ( print ' p1 ) ) ( terminate : p2 ( ) ( print ' p2 ) ) ) ( spawn p1 ( traverse tree1 ) ) ( spawn p2 ( traverse tree2 ) ) ) )
There are two methods for terminate , one invoked when called by p1 and one when called by p2 .
gf - labels defines methods and is similar in spirit to generic - labels in CLOS .
Waiting for Methods to Be Applicable
We have seen it is possible to write methods that are invoked if arguments are instances of process or function brands .
In a multiprocessing environment , it can happen that a generic function might be invoked that will have an applicable method at some point , but not at the time of invocation .
In CLOS , a method is applicable if the arguments to the generic function are of the right classes .
In the domain of processes - in which the brand of a process changes dynamically - we extend the concept of applicability as follows .
Suppose a generic function is invoked that is made up of methods , some of which are specialized on brands within dynamic domains .
If no method is applicable at invocation time , the generic function will wait until some method is applicable .
When a method becomes applicable , the processes that changed the brands of the arguments making the method applicable are paused until the generic function terminates .
Method combination provides a mechanism to define complex behavior based on the changing states of processes .
For example , one type of method combination would wait for the all arguments to be of the right brand at the same time , while a second type would freeze each as it becomes the right brand .
Here is an example :
( brand - let ( ( p1 ( process ) ) ( p2 ( process ) ) ) ( gf - labels ( ( complete : wait ( p:dead q:dead ) ( print ' both - dead ) ) ) ( complete ( spawn p1 ( traverse tree1 ) ) ( spawn p2 ( traverse tree2 ) ) ) ) )
When a process terminates , it becomes an instance of the brand dead ( and possibly also an instance of one of its sub- brands ) .
Here the method for complete will eventually be applicable , but possibly not at the moment it is invoked .
Now we can write a complete solution to samefringe , which is shown below .
The special form gf - flet is similar to gf - labels .
1 ( defun samefringe ( t1 t2 ) 2 ( let ( ( unique ( list nil ) ) ) 3 ( brand - let ( ( p1 ( process ) ) 4 ( p2 ( process ) ) ) 5 ( pmi-qflet ( ( compare ( x:p1 y: p2 ) 6 ( unless ( eq x y ) ( return - from samefringe nil ) ) ) ) 7 ( gf - flet ( ( terminate : process ( ) ( compare unique ) ) 8 ( complete : wait ( p:quiescent q:quiescent ) t ) ) 9 ( labels ( ( traverse ( tree ) 10 ( cond ( ( atom tree ) ( compare tree ) ) 11 (t ( traverse ( car tree ) ) 12 ( traverse ( cdr tree ) ) ) ) ) ) 13 ( complete 14 ( spawn p1 ( traverse t1 ) ) 15 ( spawn p2 ( traverse t2 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
Because there are two trees being traversed , there are two sub- brands of process , one for each tree , called p1 and p2 .
The function compare is a PMI function that takes one argument from each .
When each process terminates , terminate provides a unique end marker to compare .
The main program spawns two processes , one an instance of p1 and the other an instance of p2 .
Then the main program applies complete to those two processes , where the only method for complete is applicable when both its arguments are quiescent processes .
Therefore , complete and hence samefringe wait until both processes have terminated - including the calls to terminate and compare - unless the fringes are different .
Line 2 defines the unique object .
Lines 3 - 4 define two distinct sub - brands of process .
These sub - brands only exist during the dynamic extent of the brand - let .
Lines 5 - 6 define the comparison function , which compares an object produced by p1 to an object produced by p2 .
Line 7 defines the termination procedure for the processes .
When a process of brand p1 terminates , the system invokes terminate as if by p1 and then p1 becomes an instance of quiescent .
The characteristic of being of brand p1 is inherited by this invocation of terminate , which will pass on that brand to unique when it invokes compare .
Line 8 defines a generic function that returns t when invoked on two terminated processes .
Furthermore , if this function is applied to two processes , either one of which is not terminated , invocation will be blocked until they both are terminated .
Lines 9 - 12 are the simple traversal routine .
Lines 13 - 15 are the main body of the function .
Lines 14 - 15 spawn two processes , the first an instance of p1 and the second an instance of p2 .
The function complete will be invoked when the two processes terminate , and this function will return t in that event .
However , recall that compare might terminate the processes early .
Triggered Functions
Sometimes we wish to write some code that will run when certain events take place , but we wish the description of these events to be more than a simple interrupt or trap .
Such a facility will prove useful when modifying existing code .
For example , suppose there is an existing function called traverse that will visit all the nodes in a tree in some particular order , and we wish to compute samefringe on the leaves of two trees in the order traversed by traverse .
Here is an example traversal function :
( defun traverse ( tree ) ( operate tree ) ( unless ( atom tree ) ( traverse ( car tree ) ) ( traverse ( cdr tree ) ) ) )
This code traverses trees exactly as required for classical samefringe , but it invokes operate at every node whether internal or leaf .
We can modify this program without touching operate by using triggered functions .
A triggered function continually waits for the original program to achieve a complex state :
( defbrand atomic - tree ( predicated - class ) ( ) : predicate #'atom ) ( defgeneric watch - visit : method - combination : continuous ) ( defmethod watch - visit ( p:( operate tree : atomic - tree ) ) ( compare tree ) )
Here the method combination type indicates continuous invocation .
The function watch - visit is invoked on the tree traversal process , and the method shown is applicable when the argument ( a process ) to operate is an atomic tree .
The code below illustrates its use .
( defun samefringe ( traverse t1 t2 ) ( let ( ( unique ( list nil ) ) ) ( brand - let ( ( p1 ( process ) ) ( p2 ( process ) ) ) ( pmi-qflet ( ( compare ( x:p1 y: p2 ) ( unless ( eq x y ) ( return - from samefringe nil ) ) ) ) ( gf - flet ( ( terminate : process ( ) ( compare unique ) ) ( complete : wait ( p:quiescent q:quiescent ) t ) ) ( complete ( watch - visit ( spawn p1 ( traverse t1 ) ) ) ( watch - visit ( spawn p2 ( traverse t2 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
By " continually " we mean that when watch - visit is applicable , it is invoked and then immediately reinvoked ; however , there is only one invocation of watch - visit per triggering event .
That is , if an event invokes watch - visit , watch - visit cannot be reinvoked by that same event - the event must terminate first , at which point an event exactly like the first one can invoke watch - visit .
The domain brand that makes this work is one that retains brands only during the dynamic extent of invocation , which is the default domain .
This behavior can be implemented as follows .
The process that caused it to be applicable is paused and watch - visit is completed .
Once watch - visit is completed , the previously paused process is continued until the method would no longer be applicable .
At that point watch - visit is reinvoked .
For example , the order of events is this : process p1 begins to invoke operate on an atomic tree ; p1 is paused and watch - visit runs .
When watch - visit ends , p1 is continued until it exits operate .
At that point watch - visit is re-invoked ( and p1 continues as well ) .
The odd syntax means this : watch - visit will be called when the process p is within operate with a first argument of brand atomic - tree .
The argument to operate is available in the watch - visit method , as shown .
watch - visit could have been written without using continuous method combination as follows :
( defmethod watch - visit ( p : ( operate tree : atomic - tree ) ) ( compare tree ) ( watch - visit p ) )
Samefringe could have been written without explicit invocation of watch - visit by writing watch - visit as a generic function that will be triggered when operate is invoked with a first argument of brand atomic - tree , as follows :
( defmethod watch - visit : ( operate tree : atomic - tree ) : triggered ( ) ( compare tree ) )
samefringe would be exactly as above except there is no explicit invocation of watch - visit .
Triggered functions are but abstractions : we identified a common pattern of behavior and defined a stylized means to express that pattern .
Naming Variable Names
When piecing together programs from existing parts , we need to be able to refer to the variables of one program from another program .
This requires a means to additionally name variables to distinguish them from variables of the same name in other programs .
We can implement program - specific variables by qualifying their names with the process in which the program defining them is being executed .
Similarly if the need arose to introduce new variables , the same mechanism could be used .
Here is an example :
( brand - let ( ( p1 ( process ) ) ( p2 ( process ) ) ) ( let ( ( n:p1 0 ) ( n: p2 0 ) ) ( flet ( ( count ( l ) ( dolist ( i l ) ( incf n ) ) ) ) ( spawn p1 ( count ... ) ) ( spawn p2 ( count ... ) ) ... ) ) )
This program computes the length of two lists into two copies of the variable named n .
Improved Monotonic Variables
The concept of monotonic variables can be improved by using brands .
A monotonic variable is one whose value always increases or always decreases .
There is a brand monotonic and two sub-brands , monotonic - increasing and monotonic - decreasing .
Here are a few methods for an interesting generic function :
( defmethod = ( x: dead y: dead ) ( = ( unbrand x ) ( unbrand y ) ) ) ( defmethod = ( x:dead : y:monotonic - increasing ) ( if (< x y ) nil ( = x y ) ) ) ( defmethod = ( x:monotonic - increasing y: dead ) ( if ( < y x ) nil ( = x y ) ) )
The relation = can be decided before both values are computed if the process computing one is dead and the other is monotonic increasing .
This can then be used to terminate processes early .
We can complete the definition of = by defining similar methods for other combinations of dead , monotonic - increasing , and monotonic - decreasing .
We can write a different version of samefringe by using monotonic variables :
( defun samefringe ( t1 t2 ) ( brand - let ( ( p1 ( process ) ) ( p2 ( process ) ) ) ( pmi-qflet ( ( compare ( x:p1 y: p2 ) ( unless ( eq x y ) ( return - from samefringe nil ) ) ) ) ( let ( (n:p1&monotonic - increasing 0 ) ( n:p2&monotonic - increasing 0 ) ) ( gf - flet ( ( count : compare : trigger ( ) ( incf n ) ) ) ( labels ( ( traverse ( tree ) ( cond ( ( atom tree ) ( compare tree ) ) ( t ( traverse ( car tree ) ) ( traverse ( cdr tree ) ) ) ) ) ) ( spawn p1 ( traverse t1 ) ) ( spawn p2 ( traverse t2 ) ) ( = n:p1 n:p2 ) ) ) ) ) ) )
Here the function count is a triggered function : when some process becomes an instance of an invocation of compare , that process is paused while the body of count is executed .
That invocation of count retains the brands of the process that triggered it , so that incf increases the right variable .
Temporal or Historical Abstraction
Some of the problems in programming have to do with modifying a program to keep track of the history of a data structure or to answer questions about what things happened at what time .
We believe there is a new type of abstraction , called temporal or historical , that can make such changes simpler .
Again , this basic idea originated with John McCarthy .
The idea is to be able to refer to the computational past .
Here is some code suggested by some remarks by Vladimir Lifschitz :
( defun f ( n ) ( let ( ( x:0 nil ) ) ( dotimes ( i:0 n ) ( setq x:0 ( read ) ) ) ) ( dotimes ( i n ) ( print x:0 [ when ( = i:0 (- n i ) ) ] ) ) )
There are two named variables , x:0 and i:0 .
They are qualified names because later code will refer to them .
This code is read as follows : Create a variable x ( indexed by 0 ) .
Run a loop for i ( indexed by 0 ) from 0 to n - 1 , assigning x to the value of read .
Run another loop from 0 to n - 1 .
In this loop print the value of x:0 when the value of i:0 was (- n i ) ; that is , print the values that were read , backwards .
No intermediate data structure needs to be created by the programmer .
Brand - based description mechanisms are a step in the direction of temporal abstractions .
For example , a triggered function defines a temporal or historical abstraction , though in a primitive way : we can define a pattern of function invocation and argument spectrum such that instances of the pattern cause recordkeeping actions .
A better approach would be to specify a language of temporal patterns , so that historical events can be succinctly described .
Correspondences
A good use of historical abstractions is the correspondence .
The key problem in samefringe is to determine whether there is a 1 - 1 correspondence between the leaves of two trees such that corresponding leaves are the same .
A correspondence is a mapping between two processes .
Each process defines a set of objects ; we use variable naming to define those things that correspond .
The correspondence takes an element in the one set to the corresponding element of the second set .
A correspondence also has a failure function , which is invoked if the correspondence is not one - to - one .
This function is invoked whenever the failure is detected .
In the code shown below , map - correspondence takes a function and a correspondence c:D->R.
It enumerates the elements of D , passing them to the function .
( defun samefringe ( t1 t2 ) ( with - names ( node ) ( labels ( ( traverse ( x ) ( cond ( ( atom x ) x[ named node ] ) ( t ( traverse ( left x ) ) ( traverse ( right x ) ) ) ) ) ) ( brand - let ( ( p1 ( process ) ( ) ) ( p2 ( process ) ( ) ) ) ( spawn p1 ( traverse t1 ) ) ( spawn p2 ( traverse t2 ) ) ( let ( ( c ( correspondence ( -> node : p1 node : p2 ) ; domain , range #'( lambda ( ) ; fail function ( return - from samefringe nil ) ) ) ) ) ( map - correspondence #'( lambda ( node ) ; map function ( unless ( eq node ( c node ) ) ( return - from samefringe nil ) ) ) c ) t ) ) ) )
Conclusions
Too large a proportion of effort has gone into designing programming languages so that programs written in them run fast .
A much more precious commodity - if it can even be called a commodity - is the human , who must devise , design , code , debug , and maintain those programs .
Programming language designers argue that a small set of orthogonal features is best , yet the version of samefringe written in raw Qlisp using simple , orthogonal features is nearly incomprehensible .
It would seem to make sense that as our sophistication increases with programming and software developments , so should the sophistication of our programming languages .
Bibliography
Wow , Cant believe that Cafferty would make a joke in good taste .
Traveling abroad presents an ideal opportunity to master a foreign language .
While the immersion process facilitates communication in a diverse world , people are often surprised to find they have difficulty returning to their native language .
This phenomenon is referred to as first - language attrition and has University of Oregon psychologist Benjamin Levy wondering how it is possible to forget , even momentarily , words used fluently throughout one 's life .
In a study appearing in the January , 2007 issue of Psychological Science , Levy and his colleague Dr. Michael Anderson discovered that people do not forget their native language simply because of less use , but that such forgetfulness reflects active inhibition of native language words that distract us while we are speaking the new language .
Therefore , this forgetfulness may actually be an adaptive strategy to better learn a second language .
In the study , native English speakers who had completed at least one year of college level Spanish were asked to repeatedly name objects in Spanish .
The more the students were asked to repeat the Spanish words , the more difficulty they had generating the corresponding English labels for the objects .
In other words , naming objects in another language inhibits the corresponding labels in the native language , making them more difficult to retrieve later .
Interestingly , the study also showed that the more fluent bilingual students were far less prone to experience these inhibitory effects .
These findings suggest that native language inhibition plays a crucial role during the initial stages of second language learning .
That is , when first learning a new language , we have to actively ignore our easily accessible native language words while struggling to express our thoughts in a novel tongue .
As a speaker achieves bilingual fluency , native - language inhibition becomes less necessary , accounting for the better performances of fluent bilingual speakers in the study .
Although the value of suppressing previously learned knowledge to learn new concepts may appear counterintuitive , Levy explains that " first - language attrition provides a striking example of how it can be adaptive to ( at least temporarily ) forget things one has learned . "

I have something in common with Bill Gates and Larry Page :
Larry Page : I have a weird setup in my office .
I have one computer with three monitors : one flat - screen monitor and two regular ones .
I have my browser on one screen , my schedule on another and my e-mail on another .
I can drag things to different screens .
I also have a projector .
So if I 'm talking with everyone in my office , I can move stuff onto a big screen .
Bill Gates :
If you look at this office , there is n't much paper in it .
On my desk I have three screens , synchronized to form a single desktop .
I can drag items from one screen to the next .
Once you have that large display area , you 'll never go back , because it has a direct impact on productivity .
We 're all members of the three monitor club .
If you 're only using one monitor , you are cheating yourself out of potential productivity .
Two monitors is a no-brainer .
It 's so fundamental that I included it as a part of the Programmer 's Bill of Rights .
But you can do better .
As good as two monitors is , three monitors is even better .
With three monitors , there 's a " center " to focus on .
And 50 % more display area .
While there 's certainly a point of diminishing returns for additional monitors , I think three is the sweet spot .
Even Edward Tufte , in the class I recently attended , explicitly mentioned multiple monitors .
I do n't care how large a single display can be ; you can never have enough desktop space .
Normally , to achieve three monitors , you have to either :
Buy an exotic video card that has more than 2 monitor connections .
Install a second video card .
The first option is difficult because video cards with 3 + monitor connections are quite rare and usually expensive to boot .
The second option , adding an additional video card , is easier , but not without some compatibility pitfalls of its own .
But there 's a third way that may be easiest of all .
The Matrox TripleHead2
Go is a neat little external device that provides three display support from a single video output .
And it 's now available in analog VGA and digital DVI editions .
There is one big caveat , however .
In a modern three monitor config , the operating system sees each monitor as an independently controllable desktop .
You can set resolution , size , and position of the monitors independently , and windows can intelligently size themselves to each desktop on each monitor .
With the matrox Triplehead2 Go , you 're stuck with one mongo giant desktop that spans all your monitors .
This is a very old - school way of implementing multiple monitors .
Before Windows was properly aware of multiple displays ( think NT 4.0 era ) , the " giant desktop " was the only way you could get more than one display to work at all .
And " giant desktop " has a lot of downsides :
Maximizing a window becomes an exercise in futility .
You may not want your start menu on the leftmost monitor .
With two monitors , " centered " dialogs split the middle .
To avoid the many problems of " giant desktop " fakery , you really need the OS to know that you 're using two or three physical monitors , along with their resolutions , positions , and so forth .
But the Triplehead2 Go has its charms .
You do n't have to open your computer to install it , for one thing .
And it works with computers that can't be opened , such as laptops .
The Triplehead2 Go abstracts away the multiple monitors at a hardware level and presents itself to the operating system as a giant ultra widescreen monitor .
The Triplehead2 Go also has one unexpected strength : video games .
3D acceleration across multiple video cards is tricky at best .
And there 's no good way to tell a game to use multiple monitors unless it 's explicitly coded to do so .
The Triplehead2 Go device neatly sidesteps both of these limitations by externally simulating one ultra - ultra - wide monitor .
PCFormat UK experimented with the Triplehead2 Go in a couple recent and upcoming game titles , such as Armed Assault :
Armed Assault also takes advantage of an optional TrackIR head - tracking device .
The combination of a three - monitor setup with head tracking is incredibly immersive , and has to be seen to be believed .
Watch the video and be amazed .
Three - monitor setups are particularly strong in " simulator " type games where peripheral vision is crucial to gameplay .
PC Format UK tried it with the recently released GTR2 racing game , and the results are impressive .
There are lots more screenshots of various games running in triple - head mode at Tom 's Hardware and Neoseeker .
The traditional " add another video card " method is still the preferred way to gain entry into the prestigious three monitor club .
But for laptop users and gamers , the Matrox Triplehead2 Go is also a nice option with a few caveats .
Those of you who are now entering into the world of braiding may think that this is a confusing and difficult task .
In this article , we are going to prove you that this is not true .
Learning how to braid your own hair could be really useful for every girl .
Once you learn how to use the basic techniques needed for the different types of braids you will be able to do for yourself many wonderful hairstyles .
First of all , you need to make sure that your hair is brushed and then you can separate it in three sections .
You will start braiding by flipping the right strand over the middle one ( picture 2 ) and then the left strand over the new middle one ( picture 3 ) .
And then again – the right section over the middle and the left section over the middle .
All you have to do is to repeat these steps until you get to the end of your hair .
Secure the braid in place with a band .
We are going to start with a simple regular braid and then we will show you how to create a French braid and a Dutch braid .
So , this is how you do the usual three strand braid .
The French braid goes absolutely the same way , the only thing is that you will have to add some hair to the side sections every time you flip them .
Prepare your hair by brushing it .
You will start just like you did with the regular braid – separate your hair in three sections .
When you are ready to flip the right strand you need to add a small part from the remaining hair on your right side to it and then flip it over the middle .
The same goes for the left strand – add some hair to it and then flip it over the middle one .
Repeat these steps until you get to the end .
There you go – now you have your French braid .
Now , when it comes to a Dutch braid there is one specific difference and it hides in the flipping .
When you are Dutch braiding your hair you are not going to flip the sections of hair over the middle one , but under .
And this is the only thing that is probably harder to get used to .
You will get the idea when you see the next picture .
Do not be scared – it is easier than it looks , you just need patience and some practice .
Divide your hair in three sections and start with the right section by adding some hair to it flip it under the middle one .
Do the same with the left side – add some hair to the strand and place it under the middle one .
Keep repeating these steps until you have no more hair to add .
Then just finish the braid .
These braids are very simple but when you learn how to do them you will be able to create more and more gorgeous hairstyles for yourself every day .
The extraordinary amount of heat seething below Earth 's hard rocky crust could help supply the United States with a significant fraction of the electricity it will need in the future , probably at competitive prices and with minimal environmental impact , scientists now claim .
An 18 - member panel led by MIT has prepared the first study in some 30 years to take a new look at the largely ignored area of geothermal energy .
Geothermal plants essentially mine heat by using wells at times a mile or more deep .
These wells tap into hot rock and connect them with flowing water , producing large amounts of steam and super - hot water that can drive turbines and run electricity generators at the surface .
Unlike conventional power plants that burn coal , natural gas or oil , no fuel is required .
And unlike solar power , a geothermal plant draws energy night and day .
Geothermal research was very active in the 1970s and early 1980s .
As oil prices declined in the mid-1980s , enthusiasm for alternative energy sources waned and funding for research on geothermal and other renewable energy was greatly reduced , making it difficult for the technology to advance .
" Now that energy concerns have resurfaced , an opportunity exists for the U.S. to pursue the enhanced geothermal system option aggressively to meet long - term national needs , " said panel head Jefferson Tester , a chemical engineer at MIT .
Fossil fuels such as coal , oil and natural gas are increasingly expensive and dump carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere .
Furthermore , oil and gas imports from foreign sources are not necessarily secure in the world 's shifting political climate .
The United States is the world 's biggest producer of geothermal energy .
Nafi Toksöz , a geophysicist at MIT , noted that the electricity produced annually by geothermal plants now in use in California , Hawaii , Utah and Nevada is comparable to that produced by solar and wind power combined .
However , existing U.S. plants are concentrated mostly at isolated regions in the West .
There , hot rocks are closer to the surface , requiring less drilling and thus lowering costs .
Even then , drilling must reach depths of 5,000 feet or more in the West , and much deeper in the eastern United States .
Still , the panel now estimates geothermal power could meet roughly 10 percent of U.S. electricity needs by 2050 .
Their new study also finds the environmental impacts of geothermal development are markedly lower than conventional fossil fuel and nuclear power plants .
Tester and his colleagues emphasize that federally funded engineering research and development is still needed to lower risks and encourage investment by early adopters .
The report also noted that meeting water requirements for geothermal plants may be an issue , particularly in arid regions .
In addition , the potential for any seismic risks needs to be carefully monitored and managed .

What 's Down There
The crust thickness averages about 18 miles ( 30 kilometers ) under the continents , but is only about 3 miles ( 5 kilometers ) under the oceans .
It is light and brittle and can break .
In fact it 's fractured into more than a dozen major plates and several minor ones .
It is where most earthquakes originate .
The mantle is more flexible – it flows instead of fractures .
It extends down to about 1,800 miles ( 2,900 kilometers ) below the surface .
The core consists of a solid inner core and a fluid outer core .
The fluid contains iron , which , as it moves , generates the Earth ’s magnetic field .
The crust and upper mantle form the lithosphere , which is broken up into several plates that float on top of the hot molten mantle below .

彼らは、見かけよりずっと大人な側面がある一方で、ずっと子供っぽいところもあるのです。つまり、15歳の子供でありながら、ある側面は25歳並で、別の側面では5歳並みということもあります。我々はそれをそのまま受け止めてあげなければなりません。
近藤： ではPerl 6 は 大人になるのでしょうか。

Wall ： Perl 6 で 、Perlは成人します。日本語でいう「ハタチ」です。ある程度年も取ったし、頭の中の配線を再構築する、人生においておそらく最後のチャンスで、大人として受け入れられるようになる年です。「もう、これまでのようにティーンエイジャーみたいな振る舞いを続けるわけにはいけない」と思い始めていて、自分のどこを改めるべきかわかっていると同時に、どの部分はまだ子供らしさを残しても大丈夫かも心得ています。
人間同様、成人するまでに、20年かかったことを考えると、もしかしたらまだ40年くらいは「ロージン（老人）」にならず現役で活躍できるのかもしれません（笑）。
Perlのマイルストーンを振り返る
近藤： Perlの成長において、マイルストーン的な出来事はありましたか。
Wall ： 最初は小さなことだと思えたのに、後から非常に大きく流れを変えるような出来事がいくつかありました。
一例をあげれば、正規表現（検索対象の表記法）の書き方があります。最初のPerlでは、正規表現はgrep風の書き方をしました。例えば、正規表現の一部をグループにまとめる時には、カッコの前にバックスラッシュをつける必要があったのですが、その後これをegrep風に改め、カッコの前にはバックスラッシュをつけないことにしました。これはPerlがテキスト処理言語としても人気を高めた理由のひとつかもしれません。情報を圧縮する際によく利用されるハフマン符号というものがあります。その原理は、頻繁に使うものはできるだけ短くする一方で、あまり使われないものは長くてもかまわない、というものです。個人的にはこれを「簡単なことは簡単に、難しいことも可能に」
（Easy things should be easy , hard things should be possibleと い
う Perlのスローガンのひとつ）ととらえています。こうした考えがその後のPerlのつくり方にも影響していると思います。
Perl 2と3の 間でもそんなことがありました 。Perl 2 で は「 Perlはテキスト処理用言語だから」と言い逃れをしてきましたが、Perl 3ではバイナリデータも扱うようにしました。この頃、多くの人からいろいろな問題が寄せられてきたのですが、私は、問題の9割はテキスト処理の問題で、1割がバイナリデータの問題だという感触を得ました。そこで、ここでも「簡単なこと、つまりテキスト処理は簡単に、難しいこと、つまりバイナリデータの処理も可能に」を実践したのです。
近藤 : なるほど 。
Recently , in one of many speeches melding his Global War on Terror and his war in Iraq , George W. Bush said , “ Victory in Iraq will be difficult and it will require more sacrifice .
The fighting there can be as fierce as it was at Omaha Beach or Guadalcanal .
And victory is as important as it was in those earlier battles .
Victory in Iraq will result in a democracy that is a friend of America and an ally in the war on terror .
Victory in Iraq will be a crushing defeat for our enemies , who have staked so much on the battle there .
Victory in Iraq will honor the sacrifice of the brave Americans who have given their lives .
And victory in Iraq would be a powerful triumph in the ideological struggle of the 21st century . ”
Over three years after the 2003 invasion , it ’s not unreasonable to speak of George Bush ’s Iraq .
The president himself likes to refer to that country as the “ central front [ or theater ] in our fight against terrorism ” and a National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) , part of which was recently leaked to the press and part then released by the president , confirms that Iraq is now indeed just that  a literal motor for the creation of terrorism .
As the document puts it , “ The Iraq conflict has become the ’ cause célèbre ’ for jihadists , breeding a deep resentment of U.S. involvement in the Muslim world , and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement . ”
A study by a British Ministry of Defense think tank seconds this point , describing Iraq as “ a recruiting sergeant for extremists across the Muslim world . ”
So what exactly does “ victory ” in George Bush ’s Iraq look like 1,288 days after the invasion of that country began with a “ shock - and - awe ” attack on downtown Baghdad ?
A surprising amount of information related to this has appeared in the press in recent weeks , but in purely scattershot form .
Here , it ’s all brought together in 21 questions ( and answers ) that add up to a grim but realistic snapshot of Bush ’s Iraq .
The attempt to reclaim the capital , dipped in a sea of blood in recent months  or the “ battle of Baghdad , ” as the administration likes to term it  is now the center of administration military strategy and operations .
So let ’s start with this question :
How many freelance militias are there in Baghdad ?
The answer is “ 23 ” according to a “ senior [ U.S. ] military official ” in Baghdad  so write Richard A. Oppel Jr. and Hosham Hussein in the New York Times ; but , according to National Public Radio , the answer is “ at least 23 . ” Antonio Castaneda of the Associated Press says that there are 23 “ known ” militias .
However you figure it , that ’s a staggering number of militias , mainly Shi’ite but some Sunni , for one large city .
How many civilians are dying in the Iraqi capital , due to those militias , numerous ( often government - linked death squads ) , the Sunni insurgency , and al - Qaeda - in - Mesopotamia - style terrorism ?
Five thousand one - hundred and six people in July and August , according to a recently released United Nations report .
The previous , still staggering but significantly lower figure of 3,391 offered for those months relied on body counts only from the city morgue .
The UN report also includes deaths at the city ’s overtaxed hospitals .
With the Bush administration bringing thousands of extra U.S. and Iraqi soldiers into the capital in August , death tolls went down somewhat for a few weeks , but began rising again towards month ’s end .
August figures on civilian wounded  4,309  rose 14 percent over July ’s figures and , by late September , suicide bombings were at their highest level since the invasion .
How many Iraqis are being tortured in Baghdad at present ?
Precise numbers are obviously in short supply on this one , but large numbers of bodies are found in and around the capital every single day , a result of the roiling civil war already underway there .
These bodies , as Oppel of the Times describes them , commonly display a variety of signs of torture including : “ gouged - out eyeballs wounds in the head and genitals , broken bones of legs and hands , electric and cigarette burns acid- induced injuries and burns caused by chemical substances , missing skin missing teeth and wounds caused by power drills or nails . ”
The UN ’s chief anti-torture expert , Manfred Nowak , believes that torture in Iraq is now not only “ totally out of hand , ” but “ worse ” than under Saddam Hussein .
How many Iraqi civilians are being killed countrywide ?
The UN report offers figures on this : 1,493 dead , over and above the dead of Baghdad .
However , these figures are surely undercounts .
Oppel points out , for instance , that officials in al - Anbar Province , the heartland of the Sunni insurgency “ and one of the deadliest regions in Iraq , reported no deaths in July . ”
Meanwhile , in Diyala Province , northeast of Baghdad , deaths not only seem to be on the rise , but higher than previously estimated .
The intrepid British journalist Patrick Cockburn recently visited the province .
It ’s not a place , he comments parenthetically , “ to make a mistake in map reading . ”
( Enter the wrong area or neighborhood and you ’re dead . )
Diyala , he reports , is now largely under the control of Sunni insurgents who are “ close to establishing a ‘ Taliban republic ’ in the region . ”
On casualties , he writes : “ Going by the accounts of police and government officials in the province , the death toll outside Baghdad may be far higher than previously reported . ”
The head of Diyala ’s Provincial Council ( who has so far escaped two assassination attempts ) told Cockburn that he believed “ on average , 100 people are being killed in Diyala every week . ”
( “ Many of those who die disappear forever , thrown into the Diyala River or buried in date palm groves and fruit orchards . ” )
Even at the death counts in the UN report , we ’re talking about close to 40,000 Iraqi deaths a year .
We have no way of knowing how much higher the real figure is .
How many American and Iraqi troops and police are now trying to regain control of the capital and suppress the raging violence there ?
Fifteen thousand U.S. troops , 9,000 Iraqi army soldiers , 12,000 Iraqi national police , and 22,000 local police , according to the commander of U.S. forces in Baghdad , Maj . Gen. James Thurman  and yet the mayhem in that city has barely been checked at all .
How many Iraqi soldiers are missing from the American campaign in Baghdad ?
Six Iraqi battalions or 3,000 troops , again according to Thurman , who requested them from the Iraqi government .
These turn out to be Shi’ite troops from other provinces who have refused orders to be transferred from their home areas to Baghdad .
In the capital itself , American troops are reported to be deeply dissatisfied with their Iraqi allies .
( “ Some U.S. soldiers say the Iraqis serving alongside them are among the worst they ’ve ever seen  seeming more loyal to militias than the government . ” )
How many Sunni Arabs support the insurgency ?
Seventy - five percent of them , according to a Pentagon survey .
In 2003 , when the Pentagon first began surveying Iraqi public opinion , 14 percent of Sunnis supported the insurgency ( then just beginning ) against American occupation .
How many Iraqis want the United States to withdraw its forces from their country ?
Except in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq , strong majorities of Iraqis across the country , Shi’ite and Sunni , want an immediate U.S. withdrawal , according to a U.S. State Department survey “ based on 1,870 face - to - face interviews conducted from late June to early July . ”
In Baghdad , nearly 75 percent of residents polled claimed that they would “ feel safer ” after a U.S. withdrawal , and 65 percent favored an immediate withdrawal of U.S. and other foreign forces .
A recent Program on International Policy Attitudes or PIPA poll found 71 percent of all Iraqis favor the withdrawal of all foreign troops on a year ’s timetable .
( Polling for Americans is a dangerous business in Iraq .
As one anonymous pollster put it to the Washington Post , “ If someone out there believes the client is the U.S. government , the persons doing the polling could get killed . ” )
How many Iraqis think the Bush administration will withdraw at some point ?
According to the PIPA poll , 77 percent of Iraqis are convinced that the United States is intent on keeping permanent bases in their country .
As if confirming such fears , this week Jalal Talabani , the Kurdish president of the U.S. - backed Iraqi government ensconced in the capital ’s well - fortified Green Zone , called for Iraqis to keep two such permanent bases , possibly in the Kurdish areas of the country .
He was roundly criticized by other politicians for this .
How many terrorists are being killed in Iraq ( and elsewhere ) in the president ’s Global War on Terror ?
Less than are being generated by the war in Iraq , according to the just leaked National Intelligence Estimate .
As Karen DeYoung of the Washington Post has written : “ The war in Iraq has become a primary recruitment vehicle for violent Islamic extremists , motivating a new generation of potential terrorists around the world whose numbers may be increasing faster than the United States and its allies can reduce the threat , U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded . ”
It ’s worth remembering , as retired Lt. Gen. William Odom , former director of the National Security Agency , told a group of House Democrats this week , that al - Qaeda recruiting efforts actually declined in 2002 , only spiking after the invasion of Iraq .
Carl Conetta of the Project for Defense Alternatives sums the situation up this way : “ The rate of terrorism fatalities for the 59 - month period following 11 September 2001 is 250 percent that of the 44.5 month period preceding and including the 9/11 attacks . ”
How many Islamic extremist Web sites have sprung up on the Internet to aid such acts of terror ?
Five thousand , according to the same NIE .
How many Iraqis are estimated to have fled their homes this year , due to the low - level civil war and the ethnic cleansing of neighborhoods ?
Three hundred thousand , according to journalist Patrick Cockburn .
How much of Bush ’s Iraq can now be covered by Western journalists ?
Approximately 2 percent , according to New York Times journalist Dexter Filkins , now back from Baghdad on a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard University .
Filkins claims that “ 98 percent of Iraq , and even most of Baghdad , has now become ‘ off - limits ’ for Western journalists . ”
There are , he says , many situations in Iraq “ even too dangerous for Iraqi reporters to report on . ”
( Such journalists , working for Western news outlets , “ live in constant fear of their association with the newspaper being exposed , which could cost them their lives .
‘ Most of the Iraqis who work for us do n’t even tell their families that they work for us , ’ said Filkins . ” )
How many journalists and “ media support workers ” have died in Iraq this year ?
Twenty journalists and six media support workers .
The first to die in 2006 was Mahmoud Za’al , a 35 - year - old correspondent for Baghdad TV , covering an assault by Sunni insurgents on two U.S. - held buildings in Ramadi , capital of al - Anbar province on Jan. 25 .
He was reportedly first wounded in both legs and then , according to eyewitnesses , killed in a U.S. air strike .
( The U.S. denied launching an air strike in Ramadi that day . )
The most recent death was Ahmed Riyadh al - Karbouli , also of Baghdad TV , also in Ramadi , who was assassinated by insurgents on Sept. 18 .
The latest death of a “ media support worker ” occurred on Aug. 27 : “ A guard employed by the state - run daily newspaper al - Sabah was killed when an explosive - packed car detonated in the building ’s garage . ”
In all 80 , journalists and 28 media support workers have died since the invasion of 2003 .
Compare these figures to journalistic deaths in other American wars : World War II ( 68 ) , Korea ( 17 ) , Vietnam ( 71 ) .
How many U.S. troops are in Iraq today ?
Approximately 147,000 , according to Gen. John Abizaid , head of U.S. Central Command , significantly more than were in - country just after Baghdad was taken in April 2003 when the occupation began .
Abizaid does not expect these figures to fall before “ next spring ” ( which is the equivalent of “ forever ” in Bush administration parlance ) .
He does not rule out sending in even more troops .
“ If it ’s necessary to do that because the military situation on the ground requires that , we ’ll do it . ”
Finding those troops is another matter entirely .
How is the Pentagon keeping troop strength up in Iraq ?
Four thousand troops from the 1st Brigade of the 1st Armored Division , operating near Ramadi and nearing the end of their year - long tours of duty , have just been informed that they will be held in Iraq at least six more weeks .
This is not an isolated incident , according to Robert Burns of the Associated Press .
Units are also being sent to Iraq ahead of schedule .
Army policy has been to give soldiers two years at home between combat tours .
This year alone , the time between tours has shrunk from 18 to 14 months .
“ In the case of the 3rd Infantry , ” writes Burns , “ it appears at least one brigade will get only about 12 months because it is heading for Iraq to replace the extended brigade of the 1st Armored . ”
And this may increasingly prove the norm .
According to senior Rand Corporation analyst Lynn Davis , main author of “ Stretched Thin , ” a report on Army deployments , “ soldiers in today ’s armored , mechanized , and Stryker brigades , which are most in demand , can expect to be away from home for ‘ a little over 45 percent of their career . ' ”
The Army has also maintained its strength in through a heavy reliance on the Army Reserves and the National Guard as well as on involuntary deployments of the Individual Ready Reserve .
Thom Shanker and Michael R. Gordon of the New York Times recently reported that the Pentagon was once again considering activating substantial numbers of Reserves and the National Guard for duty in Iraq .
This , despite , as reporter Jim Lobe has written , “ previous Bush administration pledges to limit overseas deployments for the Guard . ”
( Such an unpopular decision will surely not be announced before the midterm elections . )
As of now , write Shanker and Gordon , “ so many [ U.S. troops ] are deployed or only recently returned from combat duty that only two or three combat brigades  perhaps 7,000 to 10,000 troops  are fully ready to respond in case of unexpected crises , according to a senior Army general . ”
How many active duty Army troops have been deployed in Iraq ?
Approximately 400,000 troops out of an active - duty force of 504,000 have already served one tour of duty in Iraq , according to Peter Spiegel of the Los Angeles Times .
More than one - third of them have already been deployed twice .
How is Iraq affecting the Army ’s equipment ?
By the spring of 2005 , the Army had already “ rotated 40 percent of its equipment through Iraq and Afghanistan . ”
Marine Corps mid-2005 estimates were that 40 percent of its ground equipment and 20 percent of its air assets were being used to support current operations , ” according to analyst Carl Conetta in “ Fighting on Borrowed Time . ”
In the harsh climate of Iraq , the wear and tear on equipment has been enormous .
Conetta estimates that whenever the Iraq and Afghan wars end , the postwar repair bill for Army and Marine equipment will be in the range of $ 25 - 40 billion .
How many extra dollars does a desperately overstretched Army claim to need in the coming Defense budget , mainly because of wear and tear in Iraq ?
Twenty - five billion above budget limits set by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld this year ; over $ 40 billion above last year ’s budget .
The amount the Army claims it now needs simply to tread water represents a 41 percent increase over its current share of the Pentagon budget .
As a “ protest , ” Army Chief of Staff Gen .
Peter Schoomaker chose not even to submit a required budget to Rumsfeld in August .
The general , according to the LA Times ‘ Spiegel , “ has told congressional appropriators that he will need $ 17.1 billion next year for repairs , nearly double this year ’s appropriation  and more than quadruple the cost two years ago . ”
This is vivid evidence of the literal wear - and - tear the ongoing war ( and civil war ) in Iraq is causing .
How is Iraqi reconstruction going ?
Over three years after the invasion , the national electricity grid can only deliver electricity to the capital , on average , one out of every four hours ( and that ’s evidently on a good day ) .
At the beginning of September , Iraq ’s oil minister spoke hopefully of raising the country ’s oil output to 3 million barrels a day by year ’s end .
That optimistic goal would just bring oil production back to where it was more or less at the moment the Bush administration , planning to pay for the occupation of Iraq with that country ’s “ sea ” of oil , invaded .
According to a Pentagon study , “ Measuring security and stability in Iraq , ” released in August , inflation in that country now stands at 52.5 percent .
( Damien Cave of the New York Times suggests that it ’s closer to 70 percent , with fuel and electricity up 270 percent from the previous year ) ; the same Pentagon study estimates that “ about 25.9 percent of Iraqi children examined were stunted in their physical growth ” due to chronic malnutrition which is on the rise across Iraq .
How many speeches has George W. Bush made in the last month extolling his War on Terror and its Iraqi “ central front ” ?
Six so far , not including press conferences , comments made while greeting foreign leaders , and the like : to the American Legion National Convention on Aug. 31 , in a radio address to the American people on Sept. 2 , in a speech on his Global War on Terror to the Military Officers Association on Sept. 5 , in a speech on “ progress ” in the Global War on Terror before the Georgia Public Policy Foundation on Sept. 7 , in a TV address to the nation memorializing Sept. 11 , and in a speech to the UN on Sept. 19 .
This week , the count of American war dead in Iraq passed 2,700 .
The Iraqi dead are literally uncountable .
Iraq is the tragedy of our times , an event that has brought out , and will continue to bring out , the worst in us all .
It is carnage incarnate .
Every time the president mentions “ victory ” these days , the word “ loss ” should come to our minds .
A few more victories like this one and the world will be an unimaginable place .
Back in 2004 , the head of the Arab League , Amr Moussa , warned , “ The gates of hell are open in Iraq . ”
Then it was just an image .
Remarkably enough , it has taken barely two more years for us to arrive at those gates on which , it is said , is inscribed the phrase , “ Abandon all hope , ye who enter here . ”

Now that companies have got tired of announcing iPod -Killers , iPhone - Killers are very much in .
Every major phone manufacturer has something to offer here .
LG , in fact , had announced an uncannily similar phone , LG KE850 even before Steve God Jobs announced iPhone in the last Stevenote .
( Digression – ever heard of the Reality Distortion Field ? )
So , an iPhone killer was planned even before iPhone was announced .
LG has almost been psychic in this .
The two phones look so similar in the sample shots , that they seem to have been designed by the same people .
Microsoft of course has not been sitting idly through the iPhone hype and is all set to convert it ’s ( unsuccessful ) iPod-Killer , Zune to it ’s iPhone - Killer , Zune Phone .
CrunchGear reports that the device could actually be available in May – a month before iPhone !
Samsung is not to be left behind .
It will show off its iPhone killer , unimaginatively named Ultra Smart F700 , at next week ’s 3GSM World Conference in Barcelona , Spain .
However , it ’s not solely touchscreen - based , and has a pull - down qwerty keyboard , and 3G which is conspicuously absent from the iPhone .
Nokia ’s very own iPhone - killer , according to PC Pro , is it ’s internet tablet , N800 .
However , the catch is that it ’s not exactly a phone .
It is primarily meant to browse the internet through WLAN , and does not come with GSM , or 3G connectivity .
So , if you wanna make calls , you are limited to VoIP .
There have also been rumors about Google and Samsung teaming up to create Google Switch , another iPhone - Killer .
The pictures of the device , however , have a distinct Photoshopped feel , and not many people are buying the rumors .
The best thing that can happen for a new phone is to be touted as an iPhone - Killer .
Like FIC Neo 1973 , based on OpenMoko Linux .
Indeed , here is an explicit comparison of Neo and iPhone .
A picture of Meizu M8 , an Oriental look - alike of iPhone is getting it ’s share of hype on gadget blogs .
Whether it ’s Steve Ballmer shrugging it off as too expensive , or Nokia calling it too ambitious , iPhone has had a very tangible effect on the industry , at least in the short term .
Interesting times ahead .
For a month , several small groups of Hizbullah militants on a Lebanese hillside have withstood heavy artillery shelling and airstrikes to continue firing hundreds of Katyusha rockets into Israel from positions just a few hundred yards from the border .
Even seasoned observers with the United Nations peacekeeping force in south Lebanon , known as UNIFIL , whose headquarters lies at the foot of the hillside , are baffled at how the guerrillas have managed to survive and keep up their steady rocket fire .
It 's just one example of Hizbullah 's surprising resilience in this war .
Their ability to continue fighting against the most advanced and powerful army in the Middle East is rooted in the group 's meticulous planning and thorough understanding of Israeli military doctrine and capabilities .
" They have done incredible staff work , learning the lessons of guerrilla warfare down the ages and carrying out a very deep and accurate analysis of the Israeli army , " says Timur Goksel , who served with UNIFIL from 1979 to 2003 and witnessed Hizbullah 's military evolution over two decades .
Israeli forces are poised to mount a full - scale invasion of south Lebanon – pending a last - ditch negotiation effort – in a bid to crush their Hizbullah foes and drive the remnants north of the Litani river , about 18 miles north of the border .
Still , despite two decades of experience fighting Hizbullah in south Lebanon , the Israeli military appears to have underestimated the resilience of their Lebanese opponents .
Using advanced anti-armor missiles , snipers , and roadside bombs , and operating from an complex system of bunkers and tunnels , Hizbullah 's battle - hardened fighters have survived airstrikes and artillery barrages enabling them to keep killing Israeli soldiers and firing rockets .
On Wednesday , 15 Israeli soldiers were killed , the highest toll in a single day since the war began .
" They have lots of strongholds , which are very well disguised , and we need to eliminate their ability to attack Israel from these places , " says a senior IDF military official .
" It 's a very hilly area and it 's not easy .
You can not identify their bunkers until you 're right there . "
Small forces of locals
The militants presently on the front line are thought to number no more than 1,000 , a fraction of the potential force Hizbullah could unleash .
The fighters are drawn from the villages on the front lines , using their intimate knowledge of the local terrain to their advantage .
Local groups of Hizbullah fighters communicate with each other by walkie - talkie using a code that draws upon their personal knowledge of each other and the geography .
If Israeli forces push deeper into Lebanon , moving to new towns and villages , they will encounter new lines of fresh Hizbullah combatants .
" Even I have been surprised at the tenacity of these groups fighting in the villages .
They have fought far beyond my expectations .
And they have n't even committed all their fully - experienced troops yet , " says Mr. Goksel .
The guerrillas are drawing on years of meticulous preparations and training , combined with access to newer weapons technology .
The most effective weapons system employed by Hizbullah 's front line guerrillas are antitank missiles .
Small teams of specially - trained fighters have inflicted comparatively heavy casualties on Israeli troops , using advanced missiles to knock out the formidable Merkava tank and using older versions to punch through the walls of houses sheltering Israeli soldiers .
In the current war , Hizbullah has used for the first time the Russian Metis - M , which can be fitted with an anti-armor warhead for destroying tanks , or a fuel - air explosive warhead to use against troops or bunkers .
The missile has a range of about one mile .
Hizbullah is also reported to be employing the laser - guided Kornet - E anti-tank missile which has a range of about 3.5 miles .
Individual fighters carry the shoulder - fired RPG - 29 , a more advanced version of the RPG - 7 loved by guerrilla groups around the world since the 1960s .
The RPG - 29 was first used by Hizbullah last November in a failed attempt to kidnap Israeli soldiers .
The ability of the well - trained missile teams to knock out Israel 's vaunted Merkava tanks has frustrated the traditional Israeli military doctrine for rapid armored thrusts deep into enemy territory .
Instead , Israeli forces have inched cautiously northward and even after more than two weeks of stiff fighting have yet to capture and secure key border towns .
Was Hizbullah underestimated ?
There 's been criticism in Israel that the military waited too long to move against Hizbullah with large forces of infantry and armored vehicles .
" I do n't think Hizbullah was underestimated by a great deal , but there was an expectation that the air attacks would cut off the command and control process , '' says Gerald Steinberg , political science professor at Bar Ilan University outside Tel Aviv .
" There was a hope that this could be done without large scale casualties . ''
In an indication of the difficulty , Israeli Chief of Staff Dan Halutz sidelined the general charged with overseeing the ground war in Lebanon .
The decision was the first time since the 1973 Arab - Israeli war that a general has had his authority curtailed in the middle of fighting .
" As a fighting army , I do n't find the IDF performing worse than it has in the past , '' said Yossi Alpher , the editor of the online Arab - Israeli journal Bitterlemons.org .
" These are probably the best trained and most highly - motivated Arab fighters we 've ever faced . ''
Mr. Alpher noted that Israel 's army has never succeeded in snuffing out rocket fire from Lebanon , going all the way back to the 1982 invasion .
If Israeli troops enter Lebanon in strength , Hizbullah will resort to another favorite weapon , the roadside bomb .
Roadside bombs killed more Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon in the 1990s than any other weapon , and the technology used to build and detonate them has become highly sophisticated .
Early roadside bombs consisted of home - made Claymore - style explosive charges that spray hundreds of ball bearings , and were detonated by a command wire or remote radio control .
Hizbullah 's bombs today include shaped - charge warheads which concentrate the blast in a single direction , similar to an anti-tank missile , to punch through the walls of armored vehicles .
They are detonated by infrared beam – when the beam is broken , the bomb explodes .
Military observers believe that Hizbullah long ago planted huge mines under all the roads crossing the border .
In June 2002 , a shepherd inadvertently stumbled across one of these bombs and alerted the local police , much to Hizbullah 's annoyance .
It consisted of 180 kilograms of plastic explosive that had been buried several feet beneath a road 500 yards from the border .
In anticipation of these land mines , Israeli tanks have avoided the border roads , cutting across country instead .
Secret , intricate bunker system
From the summer of 2000 , Hizbullah established an intricate and secret military infrastructure in south Lebanon , consisting of tunnels , expanded natural caves , and underground bunkers where weapons were stored and fighters could live .
Much of this construction work was carried out in remote stretches of the border away from the public gaze and at night .
Three years ago , residents of villages near a valley known to be controlled by Hizbullah were kept awake at night by the sound of explosions as the guerrillas dynamited the limestone cliffs to build new bunkers .
Highly trained Hizbullah marksmen have also contributed to Israel 's troop casualties .
Equipped with high - powered rifles , the snipers lie undercover for days at a time , picking off Israeli soldiers when the opportunity arises .
In July 2004 , a Hizbullah sniper shot dead with extreme precision two Israeli soldiers from a range of 500 yards .
Israeli commanders concede that while they claim to have destroyed many of Hizbullah 's long - range rocket launchers , including the 600 mm Zelzal which can reach Tel Aviv , the standard 122 mm Katyushas can be fired more easily by mobile teams without the need for launchers visible to spotter drones or surveillance planes .
Generally , the rockets are fired from multi- barreled launchers on the back of flat - bed trucks , but they can also be fired singly , even from a simple mounting of crossed sticks which is all but invisible to drones and aircraft when hidden inside an olive grove or orange orchard .
Some rockets are fired by timers , allowing the militants to escape the area in advance .
Despite saturation air coverage with missile - firing reconnaissance drones , F - 16 fighter - bombers and Apache helicopter gunships , the Israelis have been unable to stem the flow of rocket fire across the border .
Last week , Israeli commandos staged a pre-dawn raid on an apartment block on the outskirts of Tyre housing a team of Hizbullah militants who had been firing long - range rockets into Israel .
But hours after the raid , rockets were again being fired from the same location .
Weapons caches small , dispersed
Instead of stockpiling munitions in just a handful of arsenals , Hizbullah carefully dispersed ammunition , rockets , and weapons all over south Lebanon , stashing them in private homes , garages , basements , bunkers , and caves .
That has ensured that small isolated Hizbullah units have a readily available supply of weapons and ammunition .
" They have amassed huge stockpiles of rockets in the area , " says Gen. Alain Pellegrini , UNIFIL 's commander .
" I think the Israelis were hoping they would have had a faster success against Hizbullah by now . "
The most important weapon in Hizbullah 's arsenal may in fact be the motivation and determination of each fighter .
" The number one element is that Hizbullah is not afraid of the Israelis , " says Goksel .
" After 18 years fighting Israeli troops , they see them as vulnerable human beings who make mistakes and are afraid like anyone else . "

Record stores across America are turning up dead , including more than few established , high profile chains .
Who killed the record store ?
Was it the iPod , iTunes Store , or is the real killer still on the loose ?
The Fall of Tower Records
One of the chains forced to shut down its stores was the iconic Tower Records .
The company entered bankruptcy protection in 2004 .
Creditors subsequently bailed the chain out , hoping that it could be salvaged .
The National Association of Recording Merchants had repeatedly named Tower " Retailer of the Year " over the last three years , but that did n't stop the collapse of America 's eighth largest music store .
Tower was quickly liquidated this winter by Great American Group , whose bankruptcy bid won the remains of Tower 's retail music stores ; it quickly closed them all down , although stores outside the US and an online store are still being run independently under the Tower name .
Tower is n't the only music chain facing financial troubles .
• HMV closed all its US stores in 2004 .
• Virgin Megastores reported losses of $ 495 million over the last two years .
Trans World Success ?
The largest record store chain in the US is FYE .
It 's owned by Trans World Entertainment , which has been buying up troubled music store chains since 2003 : Camelot , Wherehouse Entertainment , CD World , and most recently Musicland and its Sam Goody and Suncoast branded stores .
Trans World had also hoped to buy up Tower Records and keep some of its stores open .
Despite continuing to expand its music store business however , Trans World reported slipping revenues over the last half decade .
One of the few music store chains actually doing well is Hastings , which has managed to increase its revenues in four of the last five years .
However , Hastings ' growth has largely come from books and videos rather than music sales , which currently only make up a quarter of its revenues .
Who killed the record store ?
The death of chains since 2004 provides some circumstantial evidence that points to Apple ’s iTunes Store .
The Washington Post fingered online sales , specifically mentioning iTunes next to a chart showing CD sales down and online sales up dramatically .
Did iTunes and Apple 's ubiquitous iPod conspire to kill the record store ?
Are the big record labels somehow to blame ?
Was it simply a mass suicide ?
CD+DRM = Failure
Things change in the music industry .
Over the last decade for example , music sales rapidly moved away from cassette tapes to CDs .
In 1996 , the RIAA reported that tapes accounted for nearly 20 % of sales .
Today , tapes are hard to find , while CDs expanded from 68.4 % in 1996 to 87 % of all purchased music in 2005 .
As the technology to rip CDs became commonplace , the labels hoped to move consumers from CDs to unrippable , DRM - encrypted discs , including DVD - Audio and SACD .
Both formats offer higher definition sound quality than standard CDs , as well as support for 5.1 surround channel sound .
Consumers did n't buy them however ; both formats combined only managed to make up 2 % of the music market in 2005 , after several years of rivaling each other in the bid to replace the CD .
Their failure offers a lesson that Blu - Ray and HD - DVD backers might benefit from contemplating .
SACD was introduced by Sony and Phillips , the same companies that had earlier hamstrung the release of DAT with excessive DRM .
DVD - Audio was pushed by the DVD Forum , a consortium that responded to the cracking of DVD ’s CSS by introducing even tougher encryption for DVD - Audio .
It has subsequently been cracked as well .
Online DRM Fails
The labels also hoped that Microsoft 's Windows Media DRM would help to sell music online , but none of Microsoft 's partner stores ever developed sales that amounted to anything .
As CD sales began to grow stagnant and online piracy expanded , the labels finally agreed to sell music in Apple 's iTunes Store .
In the years since , Apple has sold over two billion songs , and sales are rapidly increasing .
Still , downloads only amount to 5 - 6 % of the music sold over the last couple years , depending on who 's counting .
That means Apple 's iTunes Store - - which sold the vast majority of those downloads -- did n't have enough sales to kill the record stores , despite the graphic comparison of percentages of change printed by the Washington Post to suggest otherwise .
The huge percentages of growth really highlight that online music sales have rapidly expanded from nearly nothing just a year or two ago .
Online sales were tiny in the 2003 - 2004 period when the record stores began their steady decline .
Today , web retailers -- including Amazon - - are together selling more music on CDs than Apple is selling in FairPlay downloads .
Internet sales amounted to 8.2 % of all music in all formats outside of digital downloads .
Even adding Apple 's digital downloads to physical CD sales over the Internet to fails to add up to a killer blow to the music stores ; the shift to web based sales has largely only served to replace the direct mail sales by formerly sold through record clubs .
The Internet did n’t kill music stores .
Trail of the Real Killer
A look at the range of retail CD prices helps to establish what really killed the record stores .
In an article about the demise of Tower Records , Elaine Misonzhnik observed :
" Wal - Mart , Target and Virgin Megastores ( through the Amazon.com website ) have been selling the recently released Christina Aguilera CD Back to Basics for $ 11.88 .
But Tower Records was selling the same CD for $ 17.99 ; F.Y.E. for $ 14.99 ; and Amarillo , Texas - based Hastings Entertainment , Inc. for $ 15.39 . "
Ah-ha !
Record stores were trying to turn a profit , and simply starved to death .
Dramatically cheaper albums , sold by big box retailers , killed the business model of stores hoping to stay in business selling CDs at list prices .
How can Wal - Mart and Target afford to sell CDs for a third less than CD stores ?
Easy : the big box retailers are n't planning to make money on CDs , but rather offer CDs as loss leaders to generate foot traffic .
Music stores were trampled to death under the feet of shoppers running to Wal - Mart .
Retail Bandwagon
Other retailers have also found that selling CDs helps to attract customers and then keep them in the store longer .
Misonzhnik noted that Radio Shack , 7 - Eleven , and JC Penney have all added CD sales in attempts to bring in more customers .
Even Starbucks began selling CDs to encourage customers to linger , although it sells exclusive CDs which do n't directly compete with albums from record stores .
By selling popular CD titles at a loss , Wal - Mart , Target , and other retailers have traded the easy profits on CDs -- which formerly kept music stores in business -- into store advertising and then wrote it off as a business expense .
The Long Tail
The remaining business of record stores has been catalog sales : the long tail of titles that are not available in the limited selection of CDs offered at a deep discount by general big box retail stores .
However , many of the record store chains that are closing simply could n't afford to stock a huge selection of less popular acts , and were instead trying to compete directly against companies with no need to profit from CD sales .
That strategy has pushed customers interested in a broader selection to online sales : CDs from Amazon 's catalog and downloads from Apple 's increasingly large collection of music .
Wal - Mart Takes on Downloads
Having destroyed the music store , Wal - Mart has turned its market power to the Internet in hopes of dominating online sales as well .
The company teamed up with Microsoft to sell online downloads , and underpriced Apples iTunes Store with 88 cent songs .
Efforts of the pair of monopolizing giants to take over online sales have been blocked by Apple 's dominant position with the iPod.
Microsoft 's DRM does n't work on the iPod , cutting Wal - Mart out of the market for the vast majority of potential buyers of online music .
By forcing third parties to sell their music without DRM in order to work on the iPod , Apple has pushed buyers toward CDs and MP3s stores , and choked sales from rival DRM outlets selling Microsoft PlaysForSure music .
Last year , download sales essentially doubled over the year prior across the board , from current albums in recent release to catalog sales and " deep catalog , " the industry term for older and more obscure albums .
Sales growth in iTunes was actually stronger in catalog and deep catalog albums than in recent releases , underlining that the iTunes Store is picking up the broader , older album sales that dying record stores are leaving behind after being finished off in their attempts to compete in sales of recently released albums against the big box retail stores offering those same albums at cost .

One of the best known programming axioms is KISS — Keep It Simple , Stupid [ wiki ] .
It is something I have incredible difficulty with .
This past weekend was filled with reminders of KISS .
There were multiple comments on the complexity of my blog design .
I was putting together a GUI for a WordPress.com tool even though I usually exclusively program for the command line .
I finished off the weekend by reading Cory Doctorow ’s “ Eastern Standard Tribes ” where the main character is a user experience guru with nothing but distain for engineers and computer scientists and their inability to grasp how non-geeks think :
“ I spent the next couple hours running an impromptu focus group , watching the kids and their bombshell nannies play with it .
By the time that Marta touched my hand with her long cool fingers and told me it was time for her to get the kids home for their nap , I had twenty - five toy ideas , about eight different ways to use the stuff for clothing fasteners , and a couple of miscellaneous utility uses , like a portable crib .
“ So I ran it down for my pal that afternoon over the phone , and he commed his boss and I ended up eating Thanksgiving dinner at his boss ’s house in Westchester . ”
“ Were n’t you worried he ’d rip off your ideas and not pay you anything for them ? ”
Szandor ’s spellbound by the story , unconsciously unrolling and re-rolling an Ace bandage .
“ Did n’t even cross my mind .
Of course , he tried to do just that , but it was n’t any good - they were engineers ; they had no idea how normal human beings interact with their environments .
The stuff was n’t self - revealing - they added a million cool features and a manual an inch thick .
After prototyping for six months , they called me in and offered me a two - percent royalty on any products I designed for them . ”
It would be funny if it was n’t so painfully true .
I ’d happily add features until I ended up with a monstrosity like this .
My subconscious is a hamster in a wheel inside my head .
He ’s wearing black - rimmed coke - bottle lenses and a pocket protector .
This is what he ’s thinking :
I like coding .
Adding features means more coding .
Tweaking existing code that already works fine means more coding .
If I let something be finished then that means I ’ll have to stop coding .
I like coding .
My favorite post I ’ve ever read on the subject of simplicity is Joel Spolsky ’s critique of the Windows Vista start menu : “ each additional choice makes complete sense until you find yourself explaining to your uncle that he has to choose between 15 different ways to turn off a laptop . ”
But even he notes that the answer to simplicity is n’t having less features .
Having a sparse highly usable design is a feature in itself .
The key is to have robust features without confronting the user with multiple choices .
Simplicity is actually quite complex — which makes sense because otherwise Apple and 37signals would be the rules , not the exceptions .
John Maeda ’s Laws of Simplicity provides some rough guidelines for Getting to Simple :
Reduce –
The simplest way to achieve simplicity is through thoughtful reduction .
Organize – Organization makes a system of many appear fewer .
Time – Savings in time feel like simplicity .
Learn – Knowledge makes everything simpler .
Differences – Simplicity and complexity need each other .
Context –
What lies in the periphery of simplicity is definitely not peripheral .
Emotion – More emotions are better than less .
Trust –
In simplicity we trust .
Failure – Some things can never be made simple .
The One – Simplicity is about subtracting the obvious , and adding the meaningful .
Part of the reason why I blog is because it forces me to work on soft skills like this .
It ’s a subject I need to learn more about .

Life was different in Unit E at the state prison outside Newton , Iowa .
The toilets and sinks — white porcelain ones , like at home — were in a separate bathroom with partitions for privacy .
In many Iowa prisons , metal toilet - and - sink combinations squat beside the bunks , to be used without privacy , a few feet from cellmates .
The cells in Unit E had real wooden doors and doorknobs , with locks .
More books and computers were available , and inmates were kept busy with classes , chores , music practice and discussions .
There were occasional movies and events with live bands and real - world food , like pizza or sandwiches from Subway .
Best of all , there were opportunities to see loved ones in an environment quieter and more intimate than the typical visiting rooms .
But the only way an inmate could qualify for this kinder mutation of prison life was to enter an intensely religious rehabilitation program and satisfy the evangelical Christians running it that he was making acceptable spiritual progress .
The program — which grew from a project started in 1997 at a Texas prison with the support of George W. Bush , who was governor at the time — says on its
Web site that it seeks “ to ‘ cure ’ prisoners by identifying sin as the root of their problems ” and showing inmates “ how God can heal them permanently , if they turn from their sinful past . ”
One Roman Catholic inmate , Michael A. Bauer , left the program after a year , mostly because he felt the program staff and volunteers were hostile toward his faith .
Children who were allergic to eggs were able to essentially overcome their allergy by gradually consuming increased quantities of eggs over time , researchers at Duke University Medical Center and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences have found in a small pilot study .
" Participants who took a daily dose of egg product over the two - year study period were able to build up their bodies ' resistance to the point where most of them could eat two scrambled eggs without a reaction , " said A. Wesley Burks , M.D. , chief of Duke 's Division of Allergy and Immunology and a senior member of the research team .
" Egg allergies cause a significant decrease in quality of life for many people , so this study is exciting in that it brings us a step closer to being able to offer a meaningful therapy for these people . "
Egg allergy is one of the most common food allergies among children in the United States , Burks said .
Just how many children are allergic to eggs is unclear , but the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases estimates that 6 percent to 8 percent of children have some type of food allergy .
Most children outgrow egg allergy by age 5 , but some people remain allergic for a lifetime .
The findings are reported in an advance online edition of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and will appear in the journal 's January 2007 print edition .
The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the two universities .
The study is the first in a series of studies on food allergy " desensitization " that are under way at Duke and the University of Arkansas .
The goal , Burks said , is to offer food allergy sufferers protection from accidental ingestion of items that provoke reactions and , eventually , to induce complete or near - complete tolerance to those items .
Burks and his colleagues modeled the study on a commonly used method for treating seasonal allergy sufferers to alleviate symptoms .
In this approach , called immunotherapy , physicians give patients shots containing small amounts of the troublesome allergen in an effort to build their tolerance to it .
The therapy works on a cellular level to alter specific immune system cells , called lymphocytes , that play a part in orchestrating allergic reactions and to increase the immune system 's production of antibodies that attack and neutralize allergens , Burks said .

The seven subjects in the study , who ranged from 1 to 7 years of age , had a history of allergic reactions , including hives , wheezing and vomiting , when they consumed eggs or egg products .
For safety 's sake , none of the children enrolled had previously experienced a life - threatening allergic reaction , Burks said .
As an extra precaution , the subjects received a supply of epinephrine , which is commonly used to treat breathing problems that can occur with food allergy .
Instead of receiving shots , as seasonal allergy sufferers do , the subjects were given small doses of powdered egg orally , mixed in food .
" We started the subjects with a very small concentration of egg product -- the equivalent of less than one - thousandth of an egg -- and then we increased the dose every 30 minutes for eight hours in order to determine the highest dose that each subject could tolerate , " Burks said .
The subjects consumed the first doses in the study clinic .
The researchers then gave the children 's parents or caregivers a supply of egg product , allocated into the tolerated doses , which the subjects consumed daily at home , mixed with other foods .
The children returned to the clinic every two weeks .
At each visit , the researchers increased the subjects ' dosages until they reached the equivalent of one - tenth of an egg , Burks said .
The children then continued to take this " maintenance dose " daily for the duration of the study .
Over time , the children showed both an increase in tolerance to eggs and a decrease in the severity of their allergic reactions , Burks said .
At the end of the study period , most of the children could tolerate two scrambled eggs with no adverse reactions .
The researchers now are conducting two follow - up food allergy desensitization studies , Burks said .
In one study , subjects receive higher doses of egg to see if this will further reduce their sensitivity or even neutralize the allergy altogether .
The second study focuses on children who are allergic to peanuts , to see if the desensitization approach can build their tolerance and decrease the severity of their reactions .
Peanut allergy , which can be life - threatening , affects approximately 1 percent of children under age 5 , and its incidence has been on the rise over the past 15 years , according to Burks .
Studies have shown that about 20 percent of children with egg or milk allergy will go on to develop a peanut allergy .
Other members of the research team were Ariana Buchanan , Todd Green , Pamela Steele , Laurent Pons and Laurie Lee of Duke and Amy Scurlock , Lynn Christie , Karen Althage and Rick Helm of the University of Arkansas .
Libertarian Party officials say the problems facing Republicans in former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay ’s Texas district have created “ the perfect storm ” that could give their party its first victory in a congressional race .
Libertarian candidate Bob Smither got a boost yesterday when he was endorsed by former Rep. Bob Barr , a conservative Georgia Republican .
“ In light of the less - than - conservative agenda that the Republicans in Congress have pursued , I ’m delighted to support a Libertarian candidate , Bob Smither , who I think will most definitely stick to his small - government philosophy , ” Mr. Barr said yesterday in a telephone interview from his Atlanta law office .
“ I do n’t see him going to Washington and voting for bigger government the way so many Republicans have done . ”
A former federal prosecutor who gained national prominence in 1998 as one of the House Republicans chosen to present the impeachment case against President Clinton , Mr. Barr said the “ unique situation ” in the race caused him to back the Libertarian candidate .
Though Texas ’ 22nd District is strongly conservative — Mr. DeLay got 55 percent of the vote in 2004 and 63 percent in 2002 — the Republican Party removed its line from the ballot after courts ruled that it could not substitute another candidate for Mr. DeLay , who resigned from Congress under a cloud of scandal in June .
That leaves Mr. Smither , the Libertarian , as the only name on the ballot against the Democratic candidate , former Rep. Nick Lampson .
Republicans say they will unite to support a write - in candidate .
But Mr. Barr said that because “ it ’s very unlikely that a write - in candidate can win , ” backing Mr. Smither is the best hope of ensuring that the district “ continues to be represented by a conservative . ”
A fifth - generation Texan , Mr. Smither is a businessman who is well - known in the district south of Houston because of his work on behalf of missing children .
His 12 - year - old daughter , Laura , was abducted and killed in 1997 , leading Mr. Smither and his wife to found a nonprofit organization , the Laura Recovery Center for missing children .
In an open letter sent Tuesday to Republicans in the district , Mr. Smither said that if elected he would vote for a Republican as House speaker .
“ It appears at this point that Republicans may lose the majority in the House , ” Mr. Smither wrote .
“ If this occurs , a vote for liberal Democrat Nick Lampson will be a vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House . ”
Mr. Lampson has more than $ 2 million in campaign cash and has begun running TV ads .
Republicans have yet to decide on a candidate in a midterm election that many Democrats say offers their best chance to recapture the House since losing it in 1994 .
Several Republicans have offered themselves as write - in candidates for the seat , and Republican leaders in the district plan to gather tonight for a closed - door meeting at a church in a Houston suburb to decide which candidate to endorse .
Mr. Smither expressed doubt that any write - in candidate could be elected , noting technical difficulties presented by electronic voting .
“ They ’ll have to spell the name on an e-slate voting machine .
They ’ll actually be listed as an independent , not a Republican , ” he said .
Mr. Smither said Mr. Barr ’s endorsement “ shows that at least one very prominent Republican believes that there ’s a lot of common ground between how I feel and how conservative Republicans feel on a lot of issues . ”

Clever use of technology is bridging the gap between city and bush kids .
Narrabri is a classic Australian tiny - town of about 6000 - 7000 people , more than 550 km northwest of Sydney .
But the kids at the local high school now have the chance to experience real - life beyond their imagination , with a new Virtual Reality program .
The program is designed to give bush kids a similar kind of access to work experience that city kids get , in order to help them broaden their understanding of what kinds of jobs might be on offer once they finish school .
Trudy Staines , Secretary of the Committee of FUTURE EDU based in Narrabri said the program not only offers kids an insight into jobs that might be more city based , but could even help kids understand roles in space engineering , or detailed robotics .
She went on to explain she had tried the program herself , in an industry many locals are familiar with : farming .
“ I was up in the helicopter , mustering cattle .
Then they had me on the back of a truck as the cattle were loading .
Then I saw an abattoir , and finally , the meat in a restaurant .
Being able to see something from its inception to the end product will open up a whole world of possibilities for the students . ”
The program , funded by Santos , is part of a wider push of STEM education in the region .
Trudy said the nature of the region meant that a large number of jobs require an understanding of STEM .
“ We want our students to be able to stay in our community .
We have a lot of STEM industries here ; from agriculture to engineering .
And we need our students to come back and be a part of it .
That ’s how we ’ll keep our little community viable and sustainable . ”
Trudy said she ’s not only running programs for students themselves , but also teachers in the region , so they can take new technology and techniques back to their classrooms .
“ We ran a robotics training course for our teachers , and they loved it .
It was great for the whole community , as it will expose our kids to new ideas . ”
Many of the kids are on course to excel in the field , with students from the nearby town of Wee Waa recently selected to be a part of a major robotics competition in the USA .
“ They ’re called the Bush Bots , and they did really well .
They do n’t have the resources of many schools in the city , so to be invited to the US was a huge achievement . ”
While Trudy herself is based at the CSIRO , the whole community is in support of the push for more STEM opportunities for their kids .
“ The Narrabri Shire Science Awards have been running for about ten years .
We ask students to present their work publicly in local theatre , and it is judged by a local scientist . ”
She said local industry is also on board , as they ’re all aware of the critical need to keep young people in the region .
“ We have plenty of science days in local schools , and they ’re attended by industry so kids can get a better understanding of work life . ”
Trudy ’s work mirrors the national push to increase our school ’s participation in STEM subjects .
In the two decades from 1992 , participation in STEM fell sharply , even as enrolment in high school increased .
Like Narrabri , a huge number of our regions are reliant on STEM skills to fill employment needs - one estimate is 75 % of the fastest growing occupations will need STEM skills .
Which is why we have to get in early , and show students just how enjoyable working in these fields can be .
A study by the University of Sydney in 2015 showed that more than 50 per cent of our high school graduates complete school with no science study at all .
It ’s a stat that worries Trudy , as she knows without pushing programs such as Virtual Reality , Robotics , or other industry - based STEM education , students in her region will have very few opportunities if they wish to stay in their home towns .
She implored local kids to keep finding the fun things they love about STEM study , and explore different fields .
She ’s hoping that by continually offering new opportunities , students will find a field that is attractive to them .
“ Our vision is to support the creation of a region of future ready citizens confident and competent in STEM , ready to work with and for local organisations . ”

Do politicians really get the Internet ?
Google CEO and chairman Eric Schmidt does n't think so .
Although they understand that it is an important vehicle for getting the message out and mobilizing voters , he believes that 's where it ends .
" Many of the politicians do n't actually understand the phenomenon of the Internet very well , " Schmidt told the Financial Times .
Google 's CEO sees the Internet as an important tool in empowering voters by giving them unprecedented power to check up on politicians .
Within five years , Schmidt believes , Google or someone else will come out with " truth predictor " software that would give voters insight into whether statements made by politicians were accurate by comparing their statements to historical data .
" One of my messages [ to UK Conservative Party members ] is to think about having every one of your voters online all the time , inputting ' is this true or false ? ' " said Schmidt .
Having wireless fact - checking hardware at a press conference buzzing loudly when a politician starts slinging mud or is cutting loose with the hyperbole sounds fantastic .
It would definitely cause politicians to be more careful about what they say , but would it really make that much of a difference ?
The Internet already plays a role in politics .
Late last year , the Center for the Digital Future at the University of Southern California released a study focused on the Internet and politics .
Almost 40 percent of the respondents felt that the Internet provided them with more influence in the poliltical arena .
61.7 percent believed that the Internet is a big part of campaigns .
Anyone wanting to do some fact - checking on what a politician says or has said need only head to his or her favorite search engine or to sites like FactCheck.org .
In the study mentioned above , Jeffery I. Cole , director of the USC Annenberg School Center for the Digital Future , noted that the Internet " can be used just as easily for responsible campaiging or as a platform for political mischief and miscommunication . "
That is the case today , and there are also a large number of blogs and other sites devoted to tracking political utterances and pointing out mistakes and outright liesusually those uttered by members of another party .
The larger issue is the degree to which the electorate really cares about facts .
Sometimes the truth is unpleasant and makes us uncomfortable , and voters do n't want to be reminded of it .
Instead , they would rather hear half - truths , spin , and grand visions for how things could be one day if they just voted for Candidate X .
When the true Parliament of Whores is the entire electorate , " truth predictors " may not be much help to anyone .

Tiny Color Wireless Camera
For just $ 259 , you could own the “ World ’s Smallest Color Wireless Camera ” — measuring just 1 ″ x 1 ″ , it can be concealed just about anywhere .
It ’s powered by a single 9V battery and runs for approx .
10 hours — transmitting all video to TV channel 59 .
I ’m sure the FBI the NSA or even MI6 have even smaller versions .
However this is most likely the smallest color wireless camera readily available to consumers

Britain is less happy than in the 1950s - despite the fact that we are three times richer .
The proportion of people saying they are " very happy " has fallen from 52 % in 1957 to just 36 % today .
The opinion poll by GfK NOP for The Happiness Formula series on BBC
Two provides the first evidence that Britain 's happiness levels are declining - a trend already well documented in the United States .
Polling data from Gallup throughout the 1950s shows happiness levels above what they are today , suggesting that our extra wealth has not brought extra well - being .
It could even be making matters worse .
The British experience mirrors data from America , where social scientists have seen levels of life satisfaction gradually decline over the last quarter of a century .
Happiness levels were higher in post - war Britain
In the early 1970s , 34 % of those interviewed in the General Social Survey described themselves as " very happy " .
By the late 1990s , the figure was 30 % - a small but statistically significant drop .
The story of wealth failing to translate into extra happiness is the story of the Western world .
In almost every developed country , happiness levels have remained largely static over the past 50 years - despite huge increases in income .
What the happiness research suggests is that once average incomes reach about £ 10,000 a year , extra money does not make a country any happier .
How does Britain compare ?
Our poll asked people how satisfied they were with their lives as a whole using a one to 10 scale .
The mean score was 7.3 which puts the UK some way down the world rankings .
One recent table has Switzerland as the happiest country , followed by Denmark , Sweden , Ireland and the USA .
Britain comes eighth .
The Happiness Formula Wednesday , 3 March 1900 BST on BBC Two
Many different organisations , including the United Nations , have attempted to compare the happiness rates of different countries .
Should politicians try to make us happier ?
In our opinion poll we asked whether the government 's prime objective should be the " greatest happiness " or the " greatest wealth " .
A remarkable 81 % wanted happiness as the goal .
Only 13 % wanted greatest wealth .
Should schoolchildren be taught how to be happy ?
GfK NOP asked people whether they thought schools should put more emphasis on teaching students how to achieve a happy personal life and less on educating them for the world of work .
A majority - 52 % agreed that more emphasis should be placed on happiness - 43 % disagreed .
Less friendly ?
Our poll asked whether people felt their neighbourhood was more or less friendly now than it was 10 years ago .
43 % said less friendly , compared to 22 % of people who said it was friendlier .
So what makes us happy ?
Almost half of people - 48 % - say that relationships are the biggest factor in making them happy .
Second is health on 24 % .
When we asked people to choose the two most important sources of happiness in their lives , out of 1001 people only 77 people said work fulfilment .
According to the science of happiness , friends are crucial to our well - being .
Yet according to our opinion poll , most of us speak to only a small number of close friends every week .
Six out of 10 people spoke to five friends or fewer each week .
Two out of 10 spoke to only one or two friends .
And one person in 25 talked to no friends at all .
Contentment
We also asked people to say , in their own words , what happiness meant to them .
According to analysis by Ilona Boniwell , a psychologist at Oxford Brookes University , most people 's definition involved family and friends .
But the results threw up a surprise .
The second largest group of responses centred around contentment and inner peace .
It does appear that many people 's happiness is about escaping the stress and pace of modern life .

It has been suggested that rising levels of stress and depression may indicate that Britain is becoming more unhappy .
However , it is not clear whether clinical diagnoses reflect a real fall in happiness or a greater willingness to seek help for psychological problems .
Research throughout the world suggests that most people are slightly to moderately happy , and only a few people say they are unhappy .
The Happiness Formula poll found that 92 % of people described themselves as either fairly happy or very happy .
Only 8 % said they were fairly unhappy or very unhappy .
Professor Ed Diener , a leading psychologist based at the University of Illinois , said : " The idea that modern society is a sink of unhappiness seems wrong " .
However , average happiness scores do appear to be static or falling .
Happy together
Nearly half of married people told us they are " very happy " .
Only a quarter of singles said the same .
Researchers believe the key factor is the promise to stay together .
Is happiness linked to health ?
GfK NOP asked people how they would describe their state of health .
Among those who described themselves as " very happy " , 45 % said they had " very good " health .
Among those only " fairly happy " 23 % said they had " very good " health .
Our opinion poll asked whether people would take a legally available drug that made them happy if there were no side - effects .
Nearly three out of four , 72 % , of people said no and 26 % said yes .
The GfK NOP opinion poll for The Happiness Formula series was conducted by telephone .
The fieldwork was carried out between 28 - 30 October 2005 .
The sample size was 1001 adults aged 15 or over , and the margin of error is +/- 3 % .
Mark Easton presents The Happiness Formula series .
The first programme was broadcast on BBC Two on Wednesday 3 May at 1900 BST and will be broadcast at the same time for the following five weeks .
iTunes make more money for music companies than CDs , says Mr Jobs
Mr Jobs vowed to resist such pressure , after revealing that music firms were pushing for higher prices on Apple 's iTunes internet music store .
He said companies already made a bigger profit through iTunes than in CD sales .
Apple 's co-founder was speaking ahead of the Apple Expo showcase in Paris .
Record companies did not comment .
' Good price '
Mr Jobs said that by cutting out manufacturing jobs , selling through iTunes was already proving lucrative for record companies .
" So if they want to raise the prices it just means they 're getting a little greedy , " he said .
Big music companies are currently trying to alter the terms of their deals with Apple , with many contracts in the US due for renewal .
The iTunes site in the US charges 99 cents ( 55 p ) per song , with prices typically higher in Europe and Japan - it is 79 p per song in the UK .
If the price goes up a lot , they 'll go back to piracy
Apple chief executive Steve Jobs
" Customers think the price is really good where it is , " said Mr Jobs .
" We 're trying to compete with piracy , we 're trying to pull people away from piracy and say ' you can buy these songs legally for a fair price ' .
" But if the price goes up a lot , they 'll go back to piracy .
Then everybody loses . "
Apple has sold about 22 million iPod digital music players and more than 500 million songs though its iTunes music store .
It accounts for 82 % of all legally downloaded music in the US .
A spokeswoman for record company Warner Music declined to comment .
Rival firms Sony BMG , EMI and Universal were all unavailable .
The foremost social research institute in the United Kingdom has today revealed results of its annual ' Social Attitudes ' survey that show an overwhelming majority of people in Britain are ready to accept ID cards , phone tapping , curfews , electronic tagging , the opening of private mail and extensions to detention without charge .
The Guardian reports the findings from the National Centre for Social Research , a not for profit organisation that conducts research for public bodies such as central government , universities and charitable organisations .
In a series of questions that ask whether certain measures are " a price worth paying " in order to to reduce the threat of terrorism , the survey ( PDF ) found the following : • 81 % think that following people suspected of involvement with terrorism , tapping their phones and opening their mail is ‘ a price worth paying ’ .
• 80 % think that putting people suspected of involvement with terrorism under special rules – which would mean that they could be electronically tagged , prevented from going to certain places or prevented from leaving their homes at certain times – is ‘ a price worth paying ’ .
• 79 % think that allowing the police to detain people for more than a week or so without charge if the police suspect them of involvement in terrorism is ‘ a price worth paying ’ .
• 71 % think that having compulsory identity cards for all adults is ‘ a price worth paying ’ .
Conor Gearty , professor of human rights law at the London School of Economics and joint author of the report 's civil rights chapter , said : " The very mention of something being a counter - terrorism measure makes people more willing to contemplate the giving up of their freedoms .
It is as though society is in the process of forgetting why past generations thought these freedoms to be so very important . "
I would suggest , however , that the results here are misleading .
These answers only reveal the fact that when the word " terrorism " is used in a question , many more people automatically become less inclined to support civil liberties .
This is borne out by the fact that recent surveys on ID cards concluded that around 50 % were still against them .
Furthermore , if people had been asked " would you accept tapping of YOUR phone to combat terrorism ? " , the results would have looked very different .
People still do not associate the erosion of THEIR OWN freedoms with the war on terror .
The only thing these results proves is that people are being trained to be more susceptible to the fear of terrorism and hoodwinked into giving up their liberties in the name of false security .
And make no mistake it is a false security .
The questions in this survey make no sense when you take into account the fact that measures such as ID cards will have no bearing on the threat level of terrorism .
The government has even admitted this themselves .
So you may as well ask the question " Is having compulsory dancing lessons ' a price worth paying ' ? "
Further results from the survey , garnered from questions about more severe restrictions of civil liberties , reveal some disturbing signs : • 22 % think that torturing terror suspects in British jails to get information , if it is that the only way the information can be obtained , think this is ‘ a price worth paying ’ .
• 35 % think that banning certain peaceful protests and demonstrations is ‘ a price worth paying ’ .
• 45 % think that denying the right to a trial by jury to people charged with a terrorist - related crime is ‘ a price worth paying ’ .
• 22 % think that ‘ during war it is acceptable for the armed forces to torture people ’ .
Those who answered in the affirmative again fail to realise that the questions being asked here are ABSURD .
The results are mind boggling when you take into account the fact that Peanuts kill more people than terrorists , you have more chance of being struck by lightening than being a victim of terrorism , and its more likely that a lost deer or your own swimming pool will kill you than a terrorist attack will .
As Ohio State University 's John Mueller concludes in a report entitled A False Sense Of Insecurity , " For all the attention it evokes , terrorism actually causes rather little damage and the likelihood that any individual will become a victim in most places is microscopic . "
If you were to ask people " Is banning all forms of nut based snacks a price worth paying to reduce the threat of choking on a peanut ? " they would simply laugh at you or think you were mad .
People are being asked whether giving up their rights is acceptable in order to protect them from a threat that is just not there .
They do not realise this however as it has been shoved down our throats for the past five years that terrorists are everywhere , lurking behind every corner just waiting to kill everyone .
In a famous speech in the early eighties , before the " war on terror " had been cooked up , British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said " Democratic nations must try to find ways to starve the terrorist and the hijacker of the oxygen of publicity on which they depend . " .
Now I am no supporter of Thatcher , but the quote is key .
As soon as we lose the fear , the terrorists lose their power over us to control our behavior .
If western governments were really trying to win a war on terror as they claim then they would downplay and sideline acts of terror , pointing out that an individual has more chance of being struck by lightning than being killed in a terror attack .
The British director of public prosecutions , Sir Ken Macdonald , today rightly warned that a " fear - driven and inappropriate " response to the threat of terrorism could lead Britain to abandon the values of fair trials and the due process of law .
Giving up our liberties is what the real terrorists want and it should n't even be an issue .
The main problem with the fallout of this bogus " war on terror " , as the National Centre for Social Research has today shown , lies in the fact yet the vast majority of people do n't actually believe they are giving up anything when in actual fact they are giving away everything they have ever had .
This is how solarium spas for white - skinned people are being advertised on Moscow streets .
The sign on the guy ’s chest / back says “ I got my skin tanned in this solarium , go visit it too ” .
What can you say about it ?
Via Noah Schactman at Defensetech : Jeff Jonas , one of the nation ’s leading data mining experts , has serious doubts about whether our government ’s massive data mining projects have a remote chance of returning useful information .
One of the fundamental underpinnings of predictive data mining in the commercial sector is the use of training patterns .
Corporations that study consumer behavior have millions of patterns that they can draw upon to profile their typical or ideal consumer .
Even when data mining is used to seek out instances of identity and credit card fraud , this relies on models constructed using many thousands of known examples of fraud per year .
Terrorism has no similar indicia .
With a relatively small number of attempts every year and only one or two major terrorist incidents every few years — each one distinct in terms of planning and execution — there are no meaningful patterns that show what behavior indicates planning or preparation for terrorism .
[ …]
Without patterns to use , one fallback for terrorism data mining is the idea that any anomaly may provide the basis for investigation of terrorism planning .
Given a “ typical ” American pattern of Internet use , phone calling , doctor visits , purchases , travel , reading , and so on , perhaps all outliers merit some level of investigation .
This theory is offensive to traditional American freedom , because in the United States everyone can and should be an “ outlier ” in some sense .
More concretely , though , using data mining in this way could be worse than searching at random ; terrorists could defeat it by acting as normally as possible .
Treating “ anomalous ” behavior as suspicious may appear scientific , but , without patterns to look for , the design of a search algorithm based on anomaly is no more likely to turn up terrorists than twisting the end of a kaleidoscope is likely to draw an image of the Mona Lisa .

NASA 's Durable Spirit Sends Intriguing New Images From Mars
This mini-panorama was taken by Spirit on Aug. 23 , 2005 , just as the rover finally completed its intrepid climb up " Husband Hill . "
The summit appears to be a windswept plateau of scattered rocks , little sand dunes and small exposures of outcrop .
View all Spirit images from this press release
" When the images came down and we could see horizon all the way around , that was every bit as exhilarating as getting to the top of any mountain I 've climbed on Earth , " said Chris Leger , a rover planner at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
The summit sits 82 meters ( 269 feet ) above the edge of the surrounding plains .
It is 106 meters ( 348 feet ) higher than the site where Spirit landed nearly 20 months ago .
Spirit and twin rover , Opportunity , successfully completed their three - month prime missions in April 2004 .
They have inspected dozens of rocks and soil targets since then , continuing their pursuit of geological evidence about formerly wet conditions on Mars .
" Spirit has climbed to the hilltop and looked over the other side , but NASA did not do this just to say we can do it .
The Mars rovers are addressing fundamental questions about Martian history and planetary environments , " said NASA 's Mars Exploration Program Director Doug McCuistion .
The crest of " Husband Hill " offers Spirit 's views of possible routes into a basin to the south with apparently layered outcrops .
Shortly after Spirit landed , it observed a cluster of seven hills about 3 kilometers ( 2 miles ) east of its landing site .
NASA proposed naming the range " Columbia Hills " in tribute to the last crew of Space Shuttle Columbia .
The tallest of the hills commemorates Rick Husband , Columbia 's commander .
Volcanic rocks covering the plain Spirit crossed on its way to the hills bore evidence of only slight alteration by water .
When Spirit reached the base of the hills five months after landing , it immediately began finding rocks with wetter histories .
" This climb was motivated by science , " said Steve Squyres of Cornell University , Ithaca , N.Y. Squyres is principal investigator for the rovers ' science instruments .
" Every time Spirit has gained altitude , we 've found different rock types .
Also , we 're doing what any field geologist would do in an area like this : climbing to a good vantage point for plotting a route . "
Researchers are viewing possible routes south to apparently layered ledges and to a feature dubbed " home plate , " which might be a plateau of older rock or a filled - in crater .
The landing site and the Columbia Hills are within Gusev Crater , a bowl about 150 kilometers ( 95 miles ) in diameter .
The crater was selected as the landing site for the Spirit rover because the shape of the terrain suggests the crater once held a lake .
Volcanic deposits appear to have covered any sign of ancient lakebed geology out on the plain , but scientists say the hills expose older layers that have been lifted and tipped by a meteorite impact or other event .
" We 're finding abundant evidence for alteration of rocks in a water environment , " said Ray Arvidson of Washington University , St. Louis , Mo. Arvidson is deputy principal investigator for the rovers ' science instruments .
" What we want to do is figure out which layers were on top of which other layers .
To do that it has been helpful to keep climbing for good views of how the layers are tilted to varying degrees .
Understanding the sequence of layers is equivalent to having a deep drill core from drilling beneath the plains . "
Both Spirit and Opportunity have been extremely successful .
Their solar panels are generating plenty of energy thanks to repeated dust - cleaning events .
Spirit has driven 4,827 meters ( 3.00 miles ) , and Opportunity 5,737 meters ( 3.56 miles ) .

Making a strong pitch for America to stay competitive in the face of emerging economies such as India and China , President George W Bush has urged the Congress to raise the number of H - 1B visas that allow companies to hire foreign workers for scientific and high tech jobs .
" Congress needs to understand that nations like India , China , Japan , Korea and Canada all offer tax incentives that are permanent .
In other words , we live in a competitive world .
We want to be the leader in this world , " Bush said in a speech in Minnesota on Thursday .
To fill vacant jobs in the US , Bush urged the Congress to lift current limit on H - 1B visas that allow foreign workers to get jobs in the United States .
The Congress in 2005 capped at 65,000 the number of H - 1B visas , a third of the 195,000 allowed during the technology boom .
" I think it 's a mistake not to encourage more really bright folks who can fill the jobs that are having trouble being filled here in America , to limit their number .
So I call upon Congress to be realistic and reasonable and raise that cap , " Bush said , but did not say by how much he wanted the limit lifted .
He said that one part of the agenda to stay competitive was to study math and science , a theme he touched on in his State of the Union Address on Tuesday .
" It 's one thing to research , but if you do n't have somebody in that lab , well And so I got some ideas for the Congress to consider .
The first is to emphasize math and science early , and to make sure that the courses are rigorous enough that our children can compete globally , " Bush said in a speech at the 3M Corporation .
He said there are more high - tech jobs in America today than people available to fill them .
" So what do we do about that ?
And the reason it 's important -- and the American citizen has got to understand it 's important -- is if we do n't do something about how to fill those high - tech jobs here , they 'll go somewhere else where somebody can do the job . "
" There are some who say , we can't worry about competition .
It does n't matter , it 's here .
It 's a real aspect of the world in which we live , " he said .
" And so one way to deal with this problem , and probably the most effective way , is to recognize that there 's a lot of bright engineers and chemists and physicists from other lands that are either educated here , or received an education elsewhere but want to work here .
And they come here under a programme called H1B visas , " Bush said .
He said America should not fear competition .
" It 's important for us not to lose our confidence in changing times .
It 's important for us not to fear competition but welcome it . "
Senior administration officials noted that the number of H - 1B visas has fallen to 65,000 which in their estimation was ' too low ' and that it was imperative ' to bump that up . '

A new model forecasts largely ice - free summers by 2040
More details
The latest data presented at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting suggests the ice is no longer showing a robust recovery from the summer melt .
Last month , the sea that was frozen covered an area that was two million sq km less than the historical average .
" That 's an area the size of Alaska , " said leading ice expert Mark Serreze .
" We 're no longer recovering well in autumn anymore .
The ice pack may now be starting to get preconditioned , perhaps to show very rapid losses in the near future , " the University of Colorado researcher added .
The sea ice reached its minimum extent this year on 14 September , making 2006 the fourth lowest on record in 29 years of satellite record - keeping and just shy of the all time minimum of 2005 .
' Feedback loop '
Dr Serreze 's concern was underlined by new computer modelling which concludes that the Arctic may be free of all summer ice by as early as 2040 .
This is a positive feedback loop with dramatic implications for the entire Arctic region

Life in the changing Arctic
" As the ice retreats , the ocean transports more heat to the Arctic and the open water absorbs more sunlight , further accelerating the rate of warming and leading to the loss of more ice , " explained Dr Marika Holland .
" This is a positive feedback loop with dramatic implications for the entire Arctic region . "
Eventually , she said , the system would be " kicked over the edge " , probably not even by a dramatic event but by one year slightly warmer than normal .
Very rapid retreat would then follow .
Locally , this would have major consequences for wildlife in the region , not least polar bears which traverse ice - floes in search of food .
Loss of summer ice would seriously compromise the lifestyles of the region 's indigenous peoples , though it could also bring new trading opportunities as sea routes opened up .
On a global scale , the Earth would lose a major reflective surface and so absorb more solar energy , potentially accelerating climatic change across the world .
Sooner or later
In one of the model 's simulations , the September ice was seen to shrink from about 5.9 million sq km ( 2.3 million sq miles ) to 1.9 million sq km ( 770,000 square miles ) in just a 10 - year period .
By 2040 , only a small amount of perennial sea ice remained along the north coasts of Greenland and Canada , while most of the Arctic basin was ice - free in September .
Dr Serreze , who is not a modeller and deals with observational data , feels the tipping point could be very close .
" My gut feeling is that it might be around the year 2030 that we really see a rapid decline of that ice .
Now could it occur sooner ?
It might well .
Could it occur later ?
It might well .
" It depends on the aspects of natural variability in the system .
We have to remember under greenhouse warming , natural variability has always been part of the picture and it always will be part of the picture . "
The average sea ice extent for the entire month of September this year was 5.9 million sq km ( 2.3 million sq miles ) .
Including 2006 , the September rate of sea ice decline is now approximately - 8.59 % per decade , or 60,421 sq km ( 23,328 sq miles ) per year .
At that rate , without the acceleration seen in the new modelling , the Arctic Ocean would have no ice in September by the year 2060 .
For the peoples who live in the region , the absence of ice for large parts of the calendar would bring a fundamental change to their way of life .
Patricia Cochran chairs a group called the Inuit Circumpolar Conference , which represents indigenous peoples from Alaska , Canada , Greenland and Russia .
She commented : " For us the discussion around climate change is not just a theory ; it is a very stark and harsh reality .
" We are in fact losing our people because of changing sea and ice conditions .
So , for us , this is a very real issue , something that we are very concerned with , and hope to have our voices adequately represented , " she told the BBC .

Can I just say that this walking robot from the dynamos at Boston Dynamics really gives me goose - bumps — especially when it gets kicked and retains balance .
I mean , i do n't even think I could do that if I were carrying 120 lbs while walking backwards .
In addition to the load - bearing capabilities , this robot quadroped named BigDog can trot at 3.3 mph and climb a 35 degree slope — all things my sorry blogger ass can't seem to do these days .
Meh , whatever — because I know when BigDog 2.0 comes out , and it can carry over 200 lbs , it 'll be hauling my semi-portly ass wherever I want it to .

2006 -04 - 26 , 4pmIt all started , like most good protests , with a trip to Kinko 's printing to make a sign .
The request came from Richard Stallman for a 3 ' x2 ' sign , mounted and able to be carried with one hand easily .
Several frustrating minutes with Inkscape , two trips to the store and one foam - core backing later , we had our sign , and it stated our message clearly in black letters on white background : I arrived early at Richard 's office and he was about to take a phone call interview with a reporter from Brazil .
He had recently come back from a trip to the 2nd International Conference on GPLv3 in Porto Alegre , Brazil .
Richard was pleased with the sign , even though only a few supporters were able to come to the speech .
News of the event came late and we were only able to get an alert to our supporters at the last minute .
One of them , Chris , had never been to an FSF event before and this would turn out to be an interesting introduction .
We headed to the lounge where people were already gathering for the speech .
Richard had prepared some handouts for the audience , which he immediately started giving out .
He gave the signs to a fellow supporters in the audience .
The assistant to the faculty member in charge of organizing the event came over and asked Richard to stand outside the room , away from the people gathering for the speech .
He , of course , refused to leave as it was his right as a member of the public ( and even more his right as someone with an office in that very same building ! ) to be there .
He informed her that he had no intention of disrupting the speech .
The sign , he said , was loud only visually and would not disturb anyone listening to the speech .
The organizer 's assistant , who was clearly frustrated and had left briefly and come back , was standing in the way of the sign .
( I would soon learn that she had briefly left to make a phone call . )
I asked her politely if I could take a picture of Richard and the sign he was now holding .
She said she would prefer to be in the picture with Richard .
I did not catch the frustration in her voice as she steadfastly blocked my camera 's view of the words on the sign .
The speech started , and as promised , Richard did not interrupt it .
He continued quietly handing out leaflets to those who would take them .
I looked to my right , near the entrance to the lounge where the speech was taking place , and there were two of MIT 's police force , taking notes from the faculty member and his assistant .
Then there were three police .
Then four .
And then a plain clothes detective .
A very tall , very large police officer quietly asked Richard if he could come outside so that he could ask some questions .
Richard , again as is his right , said no , which escalated the officer 's response .
He took Richard by the upper arm and Richard loudly asked if he was being arrested -- he did n't know why the officer was grabbing him .
The officer pulled more and Richard yelled more .
" Am I being arrested ? " he asked .
This got the attention of everyone in the audience and stopped the speech momentarily .
The officer took Richard outside the room and the faculty member , his assistant , and some other people I did n't know were there .
The officer who had taken Richard by the arm then questioned the faculty member about why the police had been called .
They had been told that there was a disturbance that they needed to take care of .
The officer then asked what the disturbance was and the faculty member relented - they were worried that there would be an incident , but that it had n't yet happened .
The officer did not like this answer , but asked the organizer if it was ok if Richard stay as he was doing nothing wrong .
They said yes , as long as he agreed to sit ( there were many standing people in the audience and they were all told to sit by the officers because of the fire hazard ) .
Richard agreed to those terms and took a seat near the entrance of the event .
He held up his sign for the entire speech , while Chris passed out Richard 's handouts to late - comers .
It 's important that we do n't allow ATI and NVidious to feel comfortable about the way they mistreat our community .
( See this interview with RMS on ZNet for more on this issue . )
We should be equally critical of any company that acts this way .

Bill de hra recently highlighted a little experiment Ian Hickson ran in August :
I did a short study recently checking only for syntax errors in HTML documents , and the results were that of the 667416 files tested , 626575 had syntax errors .
Over 93 % .
That 's only syntax errors in the HTML , not checking the CSS , the content types , the semantic errors ( e.g. duplicate IDs -- 86461 of those files had duplicated IDs ) , or any other errors .
If you included those kinds of errors , you 'd probably find that almost all pages had errors that would trigger this warning .
Thus any sort of visible UI would be basically always saying " this page is broken " .
That would not be good UI for the majority of users , who do n't care .
Even Tim - Berners
Lee , the godfather of the Web , acknowledges that the move to enforce well - formedness on the web with XHTML has failed :
Some things are clearer with hindsight of several years .
It is necessary to evolve HTML incrementally .
The attempt to get the world to switch to XML , including quotes around attribute values and slashes in empty tags and namespaces all at once did n't work .
The large HTML - generating public did not move , largely because the browsers did n't complain .
Some large communities did shift and are enjoying the fruits of well - formed systems , but not all .
It is important to maintain HTML incrementally , as well as continuing a transition to well - formed world , and developing more power in that world .
Perhaps this is why there 's 63 HTML validation errors on Google 's homepage right now .
Like it or not , we live in a world of malformed HTML .
Browsers are n't compilers .
They do n't fail spectacularly when they encounter invalid markup .
And nor should they .
HTML is , and always has been , tolerant by design .
We 'll always be awash in a sea of tag soup .
Your browser does n't care if your HTML is well - formed .
Your users do n't care if your HTML is well - formed .
So why should you ?
The Dalai Lama has a cold .
He has been hacking and sniffling his way around Washington , DC , for three days , calling on President Bush and Condoleezza Rice and visiting the Booker T. Washington Public Charter School for Technical Arts .
Now he 's onstage at the Washington Convention Center , preparing to address 14,000 attendees at the Society for Neuroscience 's annual conference .
The mood is tense .
The State Department Diplomatic Security Service has swept the hallways for explosives .
Agents stand at their posts .
The 14th incarnation of the Living Buddha of Compassion approaches the podium , clears his throat , and blows his nose loudly .
" So now I am releasing my stress , " he says .
The audience dissolves into laughter .
The Dalai Lama is here to give a speech titled " The Neuroscience of Meditation . "
Over the past few years , he has supplied about a dozen Tibetan Buddhist monks to Richard Davidson , a prominent neuroscience professor at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
Davidson 's research created a stir among brain scientists when his results suggested that , in the course of meditating for tens of thousands of hours , the monks had actually altered the structure and function of their brains .
The professor thought the Dalai Lama would make an interesting guest speaker at the Society for Neuroscience 's annual meeting , and the program committee jumped at the chance .
The speech also gives the Tibetan leader an opportunity to promote one of his cherished goals : an alliance between Buddhism and science .
But the invitation has sparked a noisy row within the neuroscience community .
To protest the talk , some scientists set up an online petition , which was immediately hacked by the pro-Dalai Lama faction .
Others are boycotting the event or withholding their conference papers .
Still others have demanded - unsuccessfully - time for a rebuttal .
All of which may explain the lama 's ailment .
" His Holiness ' cold is a manifestation of the opposition of some scientists to his coming to the conference , " a young Chinese Buddhist explains to me .
The protesters complain that the Tibetan leader is n't qualified to speak about brain science .
They fret that he 'll draw media attention away from important findings presented at the conference .
Worst of all , his presence muddles the distinction between objective inquiry and faith .
" We do n't want to mix science and religion in our children 's classrooms , " says Bai Lu , a researcher at the National Institutes of Health , " and we do n't want it at a scientific meeting . "
One of the petition organizers , Lu Yang Wang , is even more blunt : " Who 's coming next year ? " he asks .
" The pope ? "
Richard Davidson , 54 , is at once a distinguished scientist and an avid spiritual seeker .
He became fascinated with meditation in the '60s .
As a graduate student at Harvard , he channeled that interest into the study of psychology and neuroscience .
In his spare time , he hung out with Ram Dass , Timothy Leary 's former LSD research partner turned mystic .
Davidson traveled to India for a meditation retreat , then finished his doctorate in biological psychology and headed to the University of Wisconsin , where he now directs the Waisman Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior .
The Dalai Lama learned of Davidson 's work from other scientists and in 1992 invited him to Dharamsala , India , to interview monks with extensive meditation experience about their mental and emotional lives .
Davidson recalls the " extraordinary power of compassion " he experienced in the Dalai Lama 's presence .
A decade later , he got a chance to examine Tibetan Buddhists in his own lab .
In June 2002 , Davidson 's associate Antoine Lutz positioned 128 electrodes on the head of Mattieu Ricard .
A French - born monk from the Shechen Monastery in Katmandu , Ricard had racked up more than of 10,000 hours of meditation .
Lutz asked Ricard to meditate on " unconditional loving - kindness and compassion . "
He immediately noticed powerful gamma activity - brain waves oscillating at roughly 40 cycles per second - éindicating intensely focused thought .
Gamma waves are usually weak and difficult to see .
Those emanating from Ricard were easily visible , even in the raw EEG output .
Moreover , oscillations from various parts of the cortex were synchronized - a phenomenon that sometimes occurs in patients under anesthesia .
The researchers had never seen anything like it .
Worried that something might be wrong with their equipment or methods , they brought in more monks , as well as a control group of college students inexperienced in meditation .
The monks produced gamma waves that were 30 times as strong as the students ' .
In addition , larger areas of the meditators ' brains were active , particularly in the left prefrontal cortex , the part of the brain responsible for positive emotions .
Davidson realized that the results had important implications for ongoing research into the ability to change brain function through training .
In the traditional view , the brain becomes frozen with the onset of adulthood , after which few new connections form .
In the past 20 years , though , scientists have discovered that intensive training can make a difference .
For instance , the portion of the brain that corresponds to a string musician 's fingering hand grows larger than the part that governs the bow hand - even in musicians who start playing as adults .
Davidson 's work suggested this potential might extend to emotional centers .
But Davidson saw something more .
The monks had responded to the request to meditate on compassion by generating remarkable brain waves .
Perhaps these signals indicated that the meditators had attained an intensely compassionate state of mind .
If so , then maybe compassion could be exercised like a muscle ; with the right training , people could bulk up their empathy .
And if meditation could enhance the brain 's ability to produce " attention and affective processes " - emotions , in the technical language of Davidson 's study - it might also be used to modify maladaptive emotional responses like depression .
Davidson and his team published their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in November 2004 .
The research made The Wall Street Journal , and Davidson instantly became a celebrity scientist .
Not everyone was impressed .
Yi Rao , a professor in the neurology department at Northwestern University , dismisses Davidson 's study as rubbish .
" The science is substandard , " he says .
" The motivations of both Davidson and the Dalai Lama are questionable . "
As a leader of those opposing the Dalai Lama 's speech , Rao criticizes Davidson for being a " politically involved scientist " who engineered the Dalai Lama 's invitation to lend scientific legitimacy to Buddhism and press the Chinese government to ease up on Tibet .
But the political critique cuts both ways .
Rao is Chinese , as are more than half of the 544 cosigners of the petition protesting the Dalai Lama 's lecture .
Many in the neuroscience community believe that Chinese opposition to the speech is fueled by the Chinese government 's long - running propaganda campaign against the Tibetan leader .
" It 's pretty transparent , " Davidson says .
Still , the broader point of Rao 's argument has undeniable force : Davidson 's close personal relationship with the Dalai Lama is unseemly .
Scientists are supposed to maintain professional distance from individuals and organizations that support their research and have a stake in the outcome .
If Davidson were receiving corporate support to study the effects of ice cream on the brain 's pleasure centers , he would n't hang out with Ben and Jerry .
Yet he 's frequently seen with the Dalai Lama , whom he clearly reveres .
Davidson bristles at this charge .
" I tremendously value my relationship with His Holiness and feel it has benefited my research , " he says with a thin smile .
" I have no intention of giving it up . "
The Dalai Lama 's fascination with science dates to his childhood , when young Tenzin Gyatso ( his birth name ) found a brass telescope that had belonged to his predecessor .
For years he has been meeting with leading figures in physics and biology to broaden his understanding .
He 's still scratching his shaved head over quantum mechanics .
The Tibetan leader believes that Buddhism and science have much in common .
Both are investigative traditions that seek to explain reality .
He admires the power of the scientific method and has famously stated his willingness to jettison Buddhist doctrines shown by science to be false .
However , since much of Buddhist doctrine - reincarnation , for instance - is inherently untestable , many of the Dalai Lama 's beliefs remain insulated from scientific critique .
Ultimately , Buddhists and scientists hold very different views of the universe .
Buddhists believe that mental and physical realms have an equal claim on reality .
That is , mental constructs that science considers imaginary are , to Buddhists , objectively real and perceptible .
In contrast , neuroscientists are materialists .
The mind can't be separated from the physical circumstances that give rise to it .
In this regard , Davidson 's views hew to the scientific mainstream .
" I believe mind is an emergent property of brain , " he says .
" Mind depends upon brain . "
The Dalai Lama has agreed to set this point aside for the time being .
What Buddhism has to offer science is a way to examine consciousness from the inside - though it would n't normally be accepted as scientific .
Neuroscience approaches the brain the same way Western science views all problems : from an external , objective perspective the Dalai Lama calls " third - person . "
Buddhist meditation provides an introspective , first - person way to study consciousness ; meditators can report their findings to scientists .
" If we very precisely look at when a thought arrives , what it does … all that is very empirical , " Ricard said in a 2003 radio interview .
" If different meditators reproduce the same descriptions , " it " has the character of science because it 's experimental . "
As much as the Dalai Lama enjoys dabbling in science , he has a greater purpose : to alleviate suffering .
Buddhism has an extensive toolkit of techniques intended to reduce misery and perfect humanity through quieting the mind and cultivating compassion .
The Dalai Lama wants to extract these methods from their religious context and ground them in the science of the brain in the hope that they will be widely adopted .
On this , Davidson and the Tibetan leader agree .
Kids take PE , Davidson points out .
" Would n't it be wonderful if they also attended a class called ME - mental education ?
The scientific work we 're doing is providing one small piece of that larger message . "
Standing onstage at the Washington Convention Center , the Dalai Lama clears his throat one last time and addresses the Society for Neuroscience .
If there is a prepared speech , he 's ignoring it .
For the next 30 minutes , in broken English and through his interpreter , he riffs on his childhood interest in science .
" Curiosity is part of my life , part of my self .
Look at this body .
Some areas have more hair , some less .
Why ? "
He stresses the importance of ethics in pursuit of scientific answers .
He 's especially concerned that researchers are not paying enough attention to the development of " warmheartedness . "
Like charity , this quality begins at home .
" Come home and be with your wife , your husband , or your children , " he beseeches the assembled neuroscientists , " and feel happy ! "
A few minutes later , he departs in a swarm of aides and security personnel .
Opponents of the Dalai Lama 's appearance fear a breach in the barrier between science and religion .
For now , though , brain researchers are staying on their side of the wall .
Davidson is the first to admit that his studies have n't proven that compassion is a skill to be cultivated - though clearly he believes it is .
" The honest answer is , we do n't know , " he says , " which is why longitudinal studies are necessary . "
Such research is just beginning .
Experiments that will follow novices through months of intensive training - the only way to test whether meditation actually changes the brain - are starting up at UC San Francisco and UC Davis .
Meditation research is blossoming at a dozen universities , including Harvard and Princeton .
Amid the flurry of Buddhist - inflected inquiry , however , there 's a risk that researchers ' beliefs and desires will influence the results of their experiments .
Already the Mind & Life Institute , an organization cofounded by the Dalai Lama to foster dialog between researchers and mystics , sponsors summer programs that are part scientific discourse , part Buddhist retreat .
These programs , Davidson says , are " producing a hybrid discipline of dharma practitioners and scientists . "
The scientific method is designed to counteract the bias of faith , but adulterating scientific objectivity with a first - person perspective makes it more likely that researchers will see what they want to see .
A few days before the Dalai Lama addressed the Society for Neuroscience , he stood before a similarly eminent crowd at the Mind & Life Institute 's 13th annual meeting .
The audience of 2,500 consisted mostly of scientists and clinicians , yet the mood was more dharma than Darwin .
Sessions opened to the guttural chants of Tibetan liturgical music .
Everyone stood and bowed when His Holiness entered the room .
During one presentation , Duke University professor of medicine Ralph Snyderman paused to tell His Holiness , " This is one of the most wonderful moments of my life , being here with you . "
It was a touching gesture .
It also crystallized the dilemma .
Scientists can try to test the validity of the Dalai Lama 's first - person perspective .
But if they allow reverence for him to cloud their judgment , they will cease to be scientists and take rebirth as something quite different : acolytes .

The Dalai Lama wants science to focus more on " warm - heartedness "
Roberts Continues To Stonewall On Logan v. Wayne
Judge John Roberts weathered another round of questioning today as his confirmation hearing entered its second day , but the controversal pick for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court left many senators frustrated and angry as he repeatedly declined to explicate his position on Logan v. Wayne .
Though he remained calm and composed while addressing members of the Senate judiciary committee , Mr Roberts refused to provide unambiguous answers when asked about the one of the most controversial questions even pondered by Congress .
Proceedings quickly became acrimonious Tuesday morning , as Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D - Mass . ) openly challenged Robert 's claim that he " had not made up his mind " on Logan v. Wayne .
" With all due respect , I find it frankly unbelievable that , in 30 years of public service , you could not have formed an opinion on this matter , " Kennedy said .
" So I would again ask that you simply answer the question : who would win in a fight , Wolverine or Batman ? "
Seemingly nonplussed , Roberts demurred , saying , " while I �m happy to talk about the individual strengths and weaknesses of each , I don�t think I should get into the application of their powers in a mano a mano confrontation . "
" Powers ? " interjected committee Chairman Sen. Arlen Specter .
" Batman does n't even have any powers .
So my colleague 's implication that Batman is even in the same league as Wolverine is nothing short of wishful thinking , would n't you agree , Mr Roberts ? "
Refusing to take the bait , Robert again declined to answer .
Questioning continued in this vein for most of the afternoon , with senators on both sides of the aisle pressing Roberts to clarify his stance .
" One of the most important responsibilities of a Chief Justice is adherence to existing precedence , " Sen. Sam Brownback ( R - Kan . ) reminded the nominee .
" I therefore call your attention to The Dark Knight Returns -- a four - part , 1986 mini-series in which Batman defeats Superman in hand - to - hand combat -- and ask you : if Bruce Wayne can beat Superman in a fight , is it not self - evident that he could defeat a mere mutant with ease ? "
Brownback remarks were later stricken from the record , however , after ranking Democratic member Sen. Patrick J. Leahy ( D - Vt. ) pointed out that The Dark Knight Returns is now considered to be an non-canonical " Elseworlds " story .
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch ( R - Ut. ) pressed Robert to rectify his current neutrality with remarks he made in a 1967 letter to Detective Comics , in which he described Batman as " the best superhero ever ! ! "
Roberts again insisted that the scope of his ruling was confined to DC titles only , and should in no way be construed as an endorsement of Wayne over any character residing in the Marvel Universe .
Though questions regarding Logan v. Wayne dominated today 's session , Roberts was also asked about about his views on civil rights , affirmative action , the limits of presidential power , and which Modest Mouse album kicked the most ass .
Pelosi Falls Short On Election Promises
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is discovering the cold truth about governing with a slim majority :
It 's much easier to promise behavioral change for Congress than to deliver it .
Advertisement
Pelosi vowed that five - day workweeks would be a hallmark of a harder - working Democratic majority .
So far , the House has logged only one .
Lawmakers plan to clock three days this week .
The speaker has denied Republicans a vote on their proposals during congressional debates -- a tactic she previously declared oppressive and promised to end .
Pelosi has opened the floor to a Republican alternative just once .
Pelosi set a high standard for herself when she pledged to make this " the most ethical Congress in history " -- a boast that was the political equivalent of leading with her chin .
And some critics have been happy to hit it .
She is drawing fire for putting Rep. William Jefferson ( D - La. ) , who had $ 90,000 in alleged bribe money in his freezer , on the Homeland Security Committee .
And The Washington Post reported during the weekend that she is helping chairmen raise money from donors with business before their committees .
Pelosi can count several big changes designed to curb abuses that plagued the Republican majority before it was dethroned in last fall 's elections , including new limits on gifts from lobbyists .
But her debut has not quieted skeptics who see her and the new majority failing to make the clean break with the deeply ingrained congressional culture .
" She has done exactly what she said she would do , " said Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly .
For Continuing Coverage of Iraq Visit
For example , he noted , while the House is not always in session five days a weeks , many committees are working throughout the week .
Pelosi promised an ambitious start to the new Congress , he said , and she had determined the best way to proceed was by limiting debate .
" In the future , " Daly said , " we will do business in the regular order . "
Pelosi seems to be following a familiar pattern .
Twelve years ago , Speaker Newt Gingrich promised to reform the House and govern by principles of fairness and transparency .
But , for leaders of both parties , the reality of ruling with a narrow majority translates into tight controls over floor debate , cozy relations with lobbyists and accommodating the needs of lawmakers ( who hate working long weeks ) .
Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a congressional watchdog organization , said Jefferson 's reelection put the new speaker in a bind .
" Pelosi had to put him somewhere , " said Sloan , who has also worked as minority counsel for the House Judiciary Committee for then - ranking member John Conyers Jr. ( D - Mich . ) .
" But I am troubled by the fact ... that ( Jefferson ) is the kind of guy who could not pass a security clearance test and yet now he has access to top - secret government info . "
Sloan also took issue with Democrats ' use of committee chairs for fundraising efforts , a tactic Republicans often abused in the last Congress .
" Given the scandals of last Congress , particularly involving ( disgraced former lobbyist Jack ) Abramoff , it does n't look good , " Sloan said .
" It is very hard for people to understand the difference between what 's legal and what 's illegal . "
Republicans are cutting Pelosi less slack than that .
Eager to brand her a hypocrite , GOP strategists are closely tracking what they call a growing list of " broken promises " and are encouraging their members to attack her for them .
" She promised the most open and honest Congress in history and by any objective score , ( Democrats ) have fallen short , " said Rep. Adam Putnam ( R - Fla . ) .
Pressed on whether voters will care about procedural complaints , such as lack of floor votes for GOP proposals , Putnam said : " I think voters do care if you shut down the process to the point people cannot even offer an alternative , and you are stifling debate … You do n't want to be constantly complaining about the process , but bottom line , they are abusing it . "
Some Democratic lawmakers privately warn that Pelosi could blow a rare opportunity to change voters ' perception of the party and Congress if she reverts to old Republican ways .
In a recent newspaper commentary , former Democratic Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana expressed concern " that the new Democratic majority in the House , which certainly understands the sting of unfair treatment , has on occasion yielded to the temptation of its newfound power to shut down Republican participation . "
So far , the GOP has been shut out of virtually every big debate .
The most recent example was the House fight over the war in Iraq , in which Democrats broke their promise to allow the GOP a vote on its nonbinding resolution supporting the troops .
Pelosi sympathizers said Republican critics are laying it on a bit thick .
" Oh , cry me a river , " said former Democratic Rep. Tony Coelho .
" For six years they ran a system that was autocratic , that did n't give the minority a shot at offering anything and now are saying ' mistreatment '
… They never even let the Democrats have a voice . "
Still , Pelosi 's experience with the recent Iraq debate illustrates her challenge .
She calculated that it would be harder to build bipartisan support for a Democratic resolution condemning the administration 's troop " surge " if the debate were muddied by a generic , support - the - troops vote .
In essence , she determined it was riskier , in the short term , to keep her pledge than to break it .
There is a practical reason for this approach , too .
Alternatives are ripe for mischief .
The minority party often puts together legislation designed to either embarrass or divide the other side .
That means there is almost always a temptation to backtrack on pledges of reform .
Gingrich and his self - proclaimed " revolutionaries " roared to power in 1994 with promises to undo the feather - nesting and strong - arm tactics that had come to mark the Democratic reign -- then discovered that what they once deemed outrageous seemed more defensible once their party was in charge .
In light of this history , say some congressional scholars , Pelosi soon will be facing a choice .
" If we do n't start seeing some opportunities for Republicans to offer real amendments on floor and to see some effort at collaboration that is genuine , " said Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution , " then she and Democrats will properly be subject to criticism . "
If you ever think about travel to Russia and visit Moscow , you might like visit Moscow subway .
It ’s definetely worth looking .
First of all architecture of Moscow subway is astonishing , I think I ’ll make a separate post about architecture of Moscow subway , because each stop , each station is so nice .
During Soviet era amounts worth of millions dollars were invested in the construction of Moscow subway .
Each station is like museum , with huge patchworks occupying some walls , high ceilings and antique type chandeliers .
And in those magnificent interriors nowadays you can meet people that look like really weird .
You can meet Comrade Stalin for example , sitting on the common passenger seat of Moscow subway .
Some commando riding a Moscow city subway .
The woman sitting next to him is n’t much interested in what ’s happening .
Have you ever seen such a huge balalaika ?
And the balalaika owner seems to be quitely sleeping , not caring his musical instrument to be stolen .
Who would need such a thing ?
Person who sent in this photo said that this scout girl was in her late thirties ..
This might be a proof of quantum , or even not quantum teleportation .
From Chicago , early 20s to Moscow city subway late 2006 .
There is a separate subject in every subway train and stop , the drunk people .
There is a lot of jokes about Russian people who drink a lot of alcohol , especially vodka .
Well , that is really so .
Not everyone but there are really a lot of people who drink , and sometimes drink a lot .
And sometimes they drink too much to continue their trip to home , or just their life trip , and they land in subway , which accepts those strangers with warm station buildings and speedlight trains .
Let ’s see some of the occasions of such hospitality :
People around those two guys are not interested in them , it ’s a common thing .
The young lady more ebmarassed by the fact she would be now on somebody ’s digital photo print than by the fact that a guy is sleeping next to her .
They do n’t spend a lot of time creating some new sleeping poses , just lay down and sleep .
Probably that ’s why they do n’t attract people ’s attention – there is no creative approach in their actions .
Though this guy took of his boots before putting his legs on the seat , at least he is polite , he cares not to spoil the seat .
Here is the example of mutual cooperation .
It ’s much more convinient to use one ’s friend ’s body as a pillow than to law down on a bare leathercloth seat .
Here we can see a perfect example of the teamplay ( or teamsleep ? ) .
He could not achieve a teamplay from dogs , so he had no other thing to do to lay down without a body - pillow .
And now en example of really creative approach .
A rule of peaceful sleep in Moscow city subway – do n’t lay down near the entrance , or you might be violently trampled down by a crowd .
By a crowd like this for example .
That ’s a real traffic jump inside of Moscow city subway .
And just imagine this is all happening deeply underneath the Earth surface .
People with claustrophobia is better to avoid such places , is n’t it ?
But somebody should keep an order in those places ?
Where is all the policemen in Moscow city subway ?
Look at some :
He probably broke a rule of not lying near the exit doors .
“ Officer is touched !
Anyone ??? ” .
No , nobody seems be caring that a police officer is violently beaten .
Just think about it .
This is what we call “ unrivalled power of argument and eloquence ” .
I think I forgot to include this officer in “ Sleeping in Subway ” section , still I can put him here .
Just another example of how you can get tired after the righteous job .
I suppose that someone would ask is there any Russian girls in Moscow city subway or no ?
Yes , for sure there are plenty of them , though such photos are not being submitted often just because Russian girls are everywhere in Moscow and Russia , not just in the subway .
Still I ’ve got some for you to show .
“ Serious .
Shady .
Smiling . ”
She is sitting on a stone tomb , probably she is not against if someone could make a monument of her sitting on the tomb .
Black and white Russian brides .
It ’s a kind of rhyme .
Those are gothic Russian girls .
And some more just curious photos from Moscow city subway :
He probably preferred not to drink and drive , but to drink and ride , ride on Moscow city subway .
Those guys also decided not to drive nor to dive , just to take their oars to the deep underground .
There are plenty of other interesting people that you would be able to meet if you decide someday to travel to Russia and then visit a Moscow city subway , but for those who are not planing travelling to Moscow those articles are .
The quality of the photos are often not brilliant , but I hope you can understand – the photos are often made by the means people have handy in the subway like cameraphones .
Some of the photos are submitted by viers of Russian LiveJournal community metro_persons .
The Peoples Daily Online posted a series of UFO images yesterday under the alluring title of “ Are they real UFO images ? “ .
It ’s difficult to really say if they are real , as it ’s hard for many to agree on just what is genuine ( that ’s a genuine photo as opposed to a genuine unidentified flying object ) .
Anyway , out of the five pictures , the above photo looks the most intriguing .
It is alleged to have been taken on November 25 , 2005 from onboard a ferry that runs between Vancouver Island and mainland Canada .
The rest , which are interesting , all seem to fall into the classic , blurred , silhouetted or silver dots in the sky category , with no easy way of judging distance , size or altitude .

How much airplay is this getting in American press ?
I talked about this case with a conservative friend of mine who completely denied it .
When I emailed this story to him , he was literally shocked to think that the US is torturing people who are NOT terrorists .
I truly believe that I 'm starting to get him to stop his unconditional support for Bush and his war .
Why it 's not okay to torture terrorists either will be our next discussion .
But it made me wonder how many of the 29 % ers just do n't have any clue what 's being done in their name .
BBC :
A Lebanese - born German , who accuses the CIA of having kidnapped and tortured him , says he is determined to get an apology from the US authorities .
Khaled al - Masri alleges that he was seized in Macedonia , flown to a secret jail in Afghanistan and tortured there .
" I 'll pursue the case until the Americans admit what they did to me , give an explanation and make an apology , " he told the BBC News website .
Munich prosecutors have ordered the arrest of 13 suspected CIA agents .
Mr Masri says he was abducted at the end of 2003 and detained for five months before being released in Albania after the Americans realised they had got the wrong man .
UPDATE : David sent in this clip from CNN discussing the arrest orders

質問と回答 ：
1章 : 基本的な理 解
1.1 : どうしてうちの管理職は、まともに働こうとしないのですか？
管理が業務内容なのです。ちょうどプログラムにアーキテクチャと設計が必要なように、人間が集団で機能するには、組織原理が必要になるのです。こうした仕事をさばく人間を割り当てることで、決定を行なう方法を決めるのに要する時間を減らし、他の人達がベストの仕事をできるよう解放できます。
1.2 : 管理職がいるということは、僕にとって有益なのでしょうか？
あなたの職種に依ります。管理職がいることで、あなたの仕事の効率が、個人としても、チームの一員としても劇的に向上することがありえますし、そうでなければ管理職があなたの仕事の邪魔にもなりえます。
管理職の存在が特に有益になる職場環境というのは：
大きな職場、特に異動が多い場合
大量の情報を計画に織り込まなければならないような職場
働く人間とその仕事の間に入る障害が大きくなりがちな職場
管理職の存在が妨げになる可能性がある職場は：
創造的な仕 事
基礎技術の研 究
もっと一般的に言うと、その仕事に実際に携わる人間がうまくやれるようにしっかりと助ける（その仕事を実際にやる能力はない）人間が必要な場合か、皆の同意を必要としない意思決定の量が多い場合、大抵マネージメントによる恩恵があります。もしその仕事が、一人の人がただ座ってやるだけでできることから成り立っているなら、管理職の存在が足手まといになるかもしれません。
朗報なのは、部下にとって「防波堤」となるような良い仕事をしてくれる管理職がいると、驚くほど生産性を向上させることが可能である、ということです。もし職場の全員が、その会社の別の部署（もしくは外の世界）と交流するのに、働くのを止めずに済むなら、その生産性は５倍から１０倍にもなるかもしれません。これはいつも起こることではありませんが、往々にして起こることなのです。
1.3 : 僕は自分の管理職の管理にどう対処すべきなのでしょうか？
他からの要求への対処と同じ要領です。可能なときは常に、彼女が自分よりもよく気付いているからこそ、要求すべきことに気付くのだと思うようにしてください。正当な理由なしに彼女と争わないようにすれば、彼女の機嫌はよいでしょう。
1.4 : 僕にはまったく理解できません。戸惑ってます。これについて書かれた本はありますか？
たぶんありません。経営者が従業員を扱う方法について書かれた本はたくさんありますから、そうしたものを読めば、管理職の考えがどこから来てるかよく分かるかもしれません。
2章： 社会性の問 題
2.1 : うちの管理職は我々の企業社会とうまく調和してません。仕事はうまくやっているようなのですが、技術者と反りが合ってないのです。
よくあることです。あなたのとこの管理職は、「スーツ族」と仲良くやれる人間を見つけてないのかもしれません。技術者には、自分達と異なる人間に適合する習性（か社会的技能）を持ち合わせてない人が多いのです。管理職のことを知るための努力をすることを心がけ、彼との違いを受け入れるべきなのです。
2.2 : うちの管理職は服装がヘンなんです。企業において風采にこだわることの無意味さを叩き込む方法はあるでしょうか？
あなたのところの管理職は、おそらくそれを分かっています。理論的には、彼女が何を着ようが変わりはありません。しかし、彼女の仕事には、他の会社の人達と交渉をすることも含まれていて、そうした交渉にはエチケットに関する決まりがあります。あなたのとこの管理職の服装は、例え彼女が他の会社の人間と取り引きをしていない場合でも、彼女があなたのことを重要だと考えていることを示す一手段として選択されているところがあるのです。それはちょうど人を「sir」と呼ぶようなものです。約束事に過ぎませんが、それが真の尊重を意味しないということはではなく、あなたのとこの管理職はちゃんと敬意を払っているのです。
2.3 : うちの管理職は、自分のことを肩書きで呼び、礼儀正しく接するように要求するんです。
管理職の地位は、企業における序列の一面です。つまり、彼の肩書きや、礼儀正しい対し方は、その構造の一部なのです。彼が仕事をしようとするとき、そこには「命令系統」や他の会社組織への意識が含まれます。彼は、あたかもあなたが彼の「下位」にいるような話し方をするかもしれませんし、意思決定権を持つ人間という点では、確かにあなたは彼の下位にいるわけですが、彼があなたのことを自分よりも価値の低い人間であると考えていることを意味するわけではありません。一般的に、人に敬意を示すときは、あなたがそうしたいと思うやり方ではなく、その人がそうされたいと思うやりかたですべきだということを覚えておきましょう。
2.4 : うちの管理職は、僕が同僚の仕事にミスを見つけると文句を言うんです。
あなたのとこの管理職をわきに連れて行き、現在の仕事のおかしいところを詳しいところまで申告するのです。彼女は何もしないで終わるもかもしれませんが、それについて彼女にうるさく言ってはいけません。彼女は他のたくさんの優先事項もやりくりしていて、彼女があなたの不満については何もしない正当な理由があるのかもしれません。可能ならいつでも、文句を言いっぱなしでなく、他の人が問題を解決するのを助ける努力をしましょう。
方向転換をすることのできる優れた技術者はそういないことを覚えておくことです。ちょっと有能なだけの人達がこなせる仕事に甘んじることを学ばなければならないのかもしれません。
3章： 生産性
3.1 : うちの管理職は、僕がゲームでガス抜きする時間を使うことに文句を言うんです。
管理職というものは、仕事を「労働時間」で測るのに慣れているのです。多くの場合、彼らの査定作業には、「浸透」段階や、どうしても予測できない部分が入ってないのです。可能ならば、もう少し益がありそうに見えるガス抜きの方法を見つける努力をすることで、もしくは「バックグラウンドで考える」方法を管理職に説明できないか考えてみることです。
3.2 : うちの管理職は、設計のフェーズの間イライラしてるんです。
管理職は、あなたが直面したことがないであろう、大量の要件に対処しているのです。管理職はビジネスを動かそうとしているのです。彼は製品がどんなもので、いつできあがるかを知りたがります。彼はコストを見積もりたがります。完璧な仕事というのは不可能ですが、あなたのとこの管理職は、できる限りベストを尽くそうとしています。つまり、彼は設計フェーズにどれくらい時間がかかるのか理解しようとしているのです。あなたは、あることにどれくらい時間がかかるかどうやって見積もりますか？
あなたはこれまでかかった時間を量り、推定するでしょう。
残念なことに、これは設計に関してはうまくいきません。それでも、あなたが作業の状態を表現する方法を見つけることができれば、あなたのとこの管理職を助けになります。ホワイトボードにざっと書いてみたり、あなたが取り組んでいる問題点や、釘づけになっている問題点を要約した文書を書いてみたりして、説明作業をすれば、そうした問題点を明確にする助けになるかもしれませんし、例えそうならなくても、あなたのとこの管理職に、どれぐらい作業が進行しているかを示すことになります。
3.3 : うちの管理職は、僕に設計フェーズが必要なことを理解してくれないんです。
それを説明する時間を作ってみましょう。あなたのとこの管理職が持っている「働く」人間の期待像に沿うような方法で問題に取り組めないかどうか考えてみましょう。
3.4 : うちの管理職は、僕が職務記述書に書かれていないことを必要に迫られてやろうとするたびに文句を言うんです。
その仕事が必然的に発生するのに、それをする人が誰もいないということを説明してみましょう。あなたの職務記述書に、「一般的なトラブルシューティング」を付け加えることを提案するのもよいかもしれません。あなたがやっている仕事がいかに有益か文書化してみましょう。例えば、他の従業員に、あなたが彼らのためにやっていることの重要性について証言するようお願いしてみるとか。
3.5 : 僕の仕事は済んだのですが、管理職は僕に忙しそうにしてほしいようなんです。
あなたの仕事が済んだことを説明しましょう。あなたの仕事が、電話サポートなどの、ほどほどに断続的なものなら、あなたがこなすことのできる優先度の低い作業を申し出る…か、それに代わる手段として、その仕事に関してあなたは一種の「保証」であって、いざという時にその仕事をする人を彼等が確保しているのだ、ということを説明してみましょう。
3.6 : 僕は行き詰まっていて、うちの管理職は僕に先に進むようプレッシャーをかけるのを止めようとしないんです。
僕がこれまで聞いた中で最良の解決法は、管理職に鍵をなくしたときに起こることを尋ねることです。鍵を見つけるのにどれくらい時間がかかるでしょうか？
一度考えつくあらゆる場所を探したのに、どうしてそうしたところを何度も何度も何度も探しつづけるのでしょう？
これこそが、大抵の人が経験したことのある、困難な創造的な仕事と最も類似したものです。
3.7 : 僕の仕事は退屈で、やることが何もないんです。
あなたのとこの管理職にもっと面白い仕事を頼むか、別の部署に転属するか、新しい仕事を探しましょう。
3.8 : うちの管理職は、僕に「力のひけらかし」を止めてほしいようなんです。
他の人の感情を損ねることは避けましょう。もし、あなたと一緒に働いている人の仕事がうまくいかなくて、かつ自分がやった方が早く済むなら、密かに管理職のとこに出向き、あなたの考えについて議論しましょう。もし彼女がそれを受け入れろと言うのなら、それに従いなさい。そういう状態が道理に適う場合というのが往々にしてあるものなのです。
3.9 : うちの管理職は、僕にちゃんとオフィスに来るように言い張るんです。
多くの生産的作業が労働時間外に、自分自身の場所でなされ得るとしても、同僚との社会的な相互関係から得る恩恵は大きいものがあります。あなたのとこの管理職が、あなたが他の皆とたまには顔を合わせ、社会的な結びつきを築いていることを確かめようとしているのです。彼はまた、あなたがちゃんと職場に来れば、設計の問題について自発的に会話をすることになり、的確な人材と一緒に仕事をすれば、仕事にかかる時間を数週間節約できることを分かっているのでしょう。全ての会議が生産的というわけではありませんが、あらゆる会議に意味がないということにはならないのです。
4章 : 鼓舞と反 応
4.1 : うちの管理職はいい仕事しています。僕は彼女に感謝すべきなのでしょうか？
そうですね！ 管理職も、他の皆と同じように、仕事をうまくやっていることをしるべきなのです。
4.2 : うちの管理職が僕を困らせるようなことをしたので、僕としては仕返しをしてやりたいところです。
彼をこらしめてはいけません。彼と話をするのです。その行動があなたを困らせた理由を説明し、彼が何故そうしたか、何故それが必要だったかを尋ねるのです。彼の根拠を理解しましょう。それが正当なものであるかもしれません。例えば、「このプロジェクトをすぐに終わらせないと、三月ぐらいで君に給料を支払うお金を使い果たすことになるんだ」というような。
その根拠が正当なものだと分かったら、物分り良くなりましょうね。あなたのとこの管理職に、あなたが納得したことを伝えましょう。もし納得できない場合は、なんとかしてその迷惑を受け入れるようにしましょう。
4.3 : うちの管理職は、僕にマネージメントをやってほしいようです。僕には興味がないのですが、彼女はそれに気を悪くしてるみたいなんです。
あなたのとこの管理職は、ヒエラルキーを昇進していく会社組織の見地から考えているのです。彼女は、あなたが自分のために仕事を楽しんでいて、新たな地位に「昇進」する希望を持って仕事していないことに気付いてないのかもしれません。あなたが楽しめる仕事をやっていることを説明することです。
4.4 : うちの管理職は、僕が彼と同じくらい稼いでいるのだから、僕の給料を上げられないと言うんです。
それはばかげていますが、管理職の権限で修正できる範囲を越えているのかもしれません。代替案を見つけることができれば、追加分の給与をオファーできるかもしれません。どうしてもダメなら、あなたが会社での労働時間外に、フリーのコンサルティングをやり、補助となるお金を手に入れる許可を与えるようかけあってみましょう。
4.5 : 私にはうちの管理職が、給料分の価値があるとは信じられないのです。
一日の間、あなた が 「無意識に」使ったり依存したりしているもの全てを記録しようとしてみてください。あなたはその電話代を支払ったのですか？
誰が支払ったのでしょう？ あなたのとこの管理職が、あなたが起こっていることを意識さえしないようなたくさんのことをこなしているのです。これであなたも重要なことに集中でき、仕事にかかれるでしょう。
5章： それどういう意味 ？
5.1 : うちの管理職は英語を喋りません。少なくとも、私にはそう思えます。
管理職たちは、お互いが効率よく意思疎通ができるように、自分たち独自の言葉を作ってきました。ちょうど技術的ジャーゴンと同じです。残念なことに、そうした言語が伝えたいのは「私はつっかえずに長い単語が言えるぞ」ということなんです。それにしても少し冗長かもしれませんが、あなたが耳にすることのほとんどのものには意味がある可能性が高いのです。
[ 英語があなたのとこの管理職のネイティブな言語でないこともまたありえますし、あなた自身がそうでないかもしれません。自由に適当な言語に置き換えて読んで下さい。]
5.2 : うちの管理職は、私がまだ見定めてないものについての見積もりを要求するんです。
あなたのとこの管理職は、「その給与はどこから出たのか」といった取るに足らない些細なことを見定めようとしているのでしょう。もし給与が規則正しく支払われることになっているなら、その会社の収入も、少なくとも予想できるスケジュールで入ってこなければならず、つまりあなたのとこの管理職は、あなたが何かやるのにどれぐらいかかるか分かっておくべきなのです。
まず見積もってみましょう。それから、思い切って管理職にその見積もりが不正確であることを警告するのです。その理由を説明するのに、「鍵を見つける」例が使えるかもしれません。
5.3 : うちの管理職には、ユーモアのセンスというものがないんです。
あなたの管理職が、メタユーモア、反復、そして曖昧な技術関係の駄洒落について、あなたと同じようにはおもしろさを感じ取れないのでしょう。コミュニケーションや、とどのつまり、技術者でない人達と触れ合う手段としては、技術的なバックグラウンド（さもなくば少なくとも技術者的姿勢）を必要とするジョークに頼らないようにしましょう。
5.4 : うちの管理職は、数を１から数え始めます。
序数（数えるのに使う数字）は常に１から始まります。０からはじめるのは、多くのプログラマーにとっては自明で自然なことかもしれませんが、言語学の見地からは多分間違っています。柔軟になりましょうね。
