They really have no sense of irony , do they ?
Funny , how indifferent they were to millions of missing BushCo emails :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) – A California Republican congressman has called on President Obama to put in place a system that ensures all White House emails be preserved even if official business was done through private e- mail accounts .
Rep. Darrell Issa , the senior Republican on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , made the request in a February 19 letter to White House Counsel Greg Craig .
Issa specifically mentioned the new administration ’s brief use of Gmail accounts after Obama was sworn in last month , as they waited for the official White House e-mail accounts to become active .
“ As you know , any e-mail sent or received by White House officials may be subject to retention under the Presidential Records Act ( PRA ) , ” Issa wrote Craig in the letter .
[...]
A White House spokesman told CNN Thursday that all staff were told to forward any official correspondence to their White House e-mail accounts , and added that private e-mail accounts are no longer being used .

Valentine 's
Day is right around the corner - just about a month or few days away !
Are you still wondering what gifts to pick up for your boyfriend ?
Well , you are not alone .
Some of my women friends find figuring out what men want are tough and to get something for their boyfriend is even tougher .
They are not fussy , just that every woman wants to make their man feel really special and naturally , the Valentine 's gift has to be unique and can help her convey her feelings for him .
I am often approached by friends during this time of the year for advice on a boyfriend 's gift ... Valentine 's
Day is the most romantic day of the year for many lovers , I guess .
Or perhaps , women are comparatively more romantic than men and therefore this special day is more important to women than to men .
Regardless , I always have one thing to share with my friends , that is , although Valentine 's Day is about love and a reminder to celebrate with their sweetheart , it is not the only time to express their love and positive feelings for their boyfriends .
Rather , every day is an opportunity to share presence with their beloved , express their feelings and renew the bond of love they share together .
I do n't encourage splurging on your sweetheart , it is better to spend within your means .
With that in mind , here are some ideas for boyfriend gift on Valentine 's Day :
Personalized boyfriend gifts make good gifts for your special man on Valentine 's Day .
You do n't need to go to the extent of renting a plane and have your boyfriend 's name written and encased in a heart .
Take a moment to brainstorm things your boyfriend usually uses and which you can personalize , for example , you can engrave your boyfriend 's name on a pen .
Just imagine the smile on his face whenever he uses the pen , is n't it sweet having you always on his mind ?
Another creative and unique idea to touch your boyfriend�s heart is to personalize a special scrapbook with both you and his pictures from the day you first met and things you have done together in your daily lives .
You can add some thought and feelings in the scrapbook .
The scrapbook is a symbol of your love and memories that you both shared together .
Is n�t it meaningful ?
Finally , the old saying - the way to your lover�s heart is his stomach .
Food is an expression of affection .
Your boyfriend and you may eat your way to ecstasy with chocolate and oysters which claims to be aphrodisiac .
Try concocting a personalize dish for him or even a simple dish .
It will inevitably melt his heart .
Don�t forget the romantic music as it can enhance the overall ambiance .
The above ideas and suggestions will be a guide to creating a romantic and sweet loving Valentine celebration for you and your boyfriend .
It need not be expensive or luxurious .
It is really the thoughts that count and only your lover will understand .
I hope this article have served its purpose in helping you to decide on a Valentine gift for your boyfriend .
Wishing both of you a wonderful Valentine�s Day !

Step1
Determine what your boyfriend 's gift - related expectations are for Valentine 's Day .
If he loves the hype surrounding the day dedicated to love , think about an elaborate presentation - perhaps design a treasure map or riddle that will lead him to his gift .
If he considers the day just another display of rampant consumerism , present your gift ( preferably handmade ) in a low - key way .
Step2
Choose a gift that wo n't make him panic when he sees it , meaning one box that has an unassuming , nonaggressive size .
If he sees eight regally wrapped boxes stacked one upon the other , he 'll surely become insecure about his one modest gift to you .
Step3
Consider asking what he'd like for Valentine 's Day to give him a hint that you 're planning on giving him something , especially if you 're new to the relationship and are n't exactly sure how the two of you might celebrate the day .
Step4
Plan an unconventional present , say , a singing valentine sent to his workplace or a surprise lunch at that restaurant he 's been dying to try .
Step5
Invite your boyfriend over for Champagne before you celebrate the evening .
Give your present after you toast your love .
Happy valentine 's day !

DETROIT ( Reuters ) -
With bidding stalled on some of the least desirable residences in Detroit ’s collapsing housing market , even the fast - talking auctioneer was feeling the stress .
An auction lawn sign points to a foreclosed property to be auctioned off by Dallas - based Hudson & Marshall along with several hundred other foreclosed homes in Detroit , Michigan March 18 , 2007 .
Job losses in the U.S. industrial heartland have left states like Michigan and Ohio more vulnerable to mortgage defaults , as home finance costs rise amid often moribund real - estate markets .
REUTERS / Rebecca Cook
“ Folks , the ground underneath the house goes with it .
You do know that , right ? ” he offered .
After selling house after house in the Motor City for less than the $ 29,000 it costs to buy the average new car , the auctioneer tried a new line : “ The lumber in the house is worth more than that ! ”
As Detroit reels from job losses in the U.S. auto industry , the depressed city has emerged as a boomtown in one area : foreclosed property .
It also stands as a case study in the economic pain from a housing bust as analysts consider whether a developing crisis in mortgages to high - risk borrowers will trigger a slowdown in the broader U.S. economy .
The rising cost of mortgage financing for Detroit borrowers with weak credit has added to the downdraft from a slumping local economy to send home values plunging faster than many investors anticipated a few months ago .
At a weekend sale of about 300 Detroit - area houses by Texas - based auction firm Hudson & Marshall , the mood was marked more by fear than greed .
“ These people are investors and they know the difficulty of finding financing .
They know the difficulty of finding good tenants .
They ’re cautious , ” said realtor Stanley Wegrzynowicz , who attended the auction .
HOW LOW IS LOW ?
The city , which has lost more than half its population in the past 30 years and struggled with rising crime , failing schools and other social problems , largely missed out on the housing boom that swept much of the country in recent years .
Prices have gained less than 2 percent per year in the five years since 2001 , when the auto industry entered a renewed slump .
Steve Izairi , 32 , who re-financed his own house in suburban Dearborn and sold his restaurant to begin buying rental properties in Detroit two years , was concerned that houses he thought were bargains at $ 70,000 two years ago were now selling for just $ 35,000 .
At least 16 Detroit houses up for sale on Sunday sold for $ 30,000 or less .
A boarded - up bungalow on the city ’s west side brought $ 1,300 .
A four - bedroom house near the original Motown recording studio sold for $ 7,000 .
“ You ca n’t buy a used car for that , ” said Izairi .
“ It ’s a gamble , and you have to wonder how low it ’s going to get . ”
Detroit , where unemployment runs near 14 percent and a third of the population lives in poverty , leads the nation in new foreclosure filings , according to tracking service RealtyTrac .
With large swaths of the city now abandoned , banks are reclaiming and reselling Detroit homes from buyers who can no longer afford payments at seven times the national rate .
Michigan was the only state to see home prices fall in 2006 .
The national average price rose almost 6 percent but prices slipped 0.4 percent here , according to a federal study .
The state ’s jobless rate of 7.1 percent in January was also the second highest in the nation , behind only Mississippi .
HOW MUCH CAN YOU BUY FOR $ 1 MILLION ?
Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was greeted with applause when he announced last week that two condominiums in the city ’s revitalizing downtown sold for over $ 1 million each .
But investors , including some from out of state , proved far more cautious at Sunday ’s auction .
In the most spirited bidding of the day , a sprawling , four - bedroom mansion from Detroit ’s boom days with an ornate stone entrance fetched just $ 135,000 .
Dave Webb , principal at Hudson & Marshall , said Michigan had become a “ heavy volume ” market for his auction firm in recent years , although bigger - money deals were waiting in California , a market he said was ready for the first such auctions of repossessed property in years .
“ These people that are buying have got to look at holding on for five to seven years , ” he said .
“ The key is holding power . ”
Even with the steep discounts on Detroit - area properties , some buyers handed over their deposits with a wince .
“ I ’m not sure it ’s congratulations , ” said Kirk Neal , a 55 - year - old auto body shop worker who bought a ranch in the suburb of Oak Park for $ 34,000 .
“ My wife is going to kill me . ”
Realtor Ron Walraven had a three - bedroom house in the suburb of Bloomfield Hills that had listed for $ 525,000 sell for just $ 130,000 at the auction .
“ Once we ’ve seen the last person leave Michigan , then I think we ’ll be able to say we ’ve seen the bottom , ” he said .
GAZA ( Reuters ) - Recovery teams ventured into battlegrounds of the Gaza Strip on Thursday to gather bodies from the rubble , and Hamas officials said the Palestinian toll in Israel ’s 13 day - old offensive rose to 765 dead .
Local ambulance crews and the Red Crescent , using a time slot coordinated with Israeli forces , said they collected rotting corpses in places that had been too risky to reach since Israeli forces began a ground attack six days ago .
They found four children starving beside the bodies of their mothers , dead many days , and evacuated scores of trapped and injured , the International Committee of the Red Cross said .
Israel lost 3 soldiers in fighting with Islamist militants who hold the Gaza Strip .
Apart from a “ friendly fire ” incident which killed four , this was its heaviest one - day combat toll .
Ten soldiers have so far died in the campaign launched by Israel to crush Hamas forces and halt the firing of missiles from Gaza into Israel .
Israel says it is doing what it can to avoid civilian casualties but accuses Hamas of deliberately placing its forces close to homes and Mosques .
At the United Nations , Western powers and Arab states reached an agreement in principle on a draft Security Council resolution that would call for an immediate ceasefire .
“ In principle there is an agreement , ” Arab League envoy ambassador Yahya Mahmassani told reporters .
It was not clear if they would vote on the resolution later in the day or on Friday .
Rescue work in Gaza was becoming increasingly dangerous .
The U.N. Relief and Works Agency ( UNRWA ) , which feeds half of Gaza ’s 1.5 million people , stopped work after a driver was killed by an Israeli tank .
It had earlier said two drivers died .
Operations would be suspended until the Israeli army could guarantee security .
The Hamas ministry of health said 34 percent of the dead and 35 percent of over 3,000 injured were children .
There was no independent confirmation of the figure .
“ The danger to medical staff and the difficulty of extracting the injured from collapsed buildings makes proper evacuation and estimation of casualties difficult , ” the U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator ’s daily field report said .
“ Civilians , notably children who form 56 percent of Gaza ’s population , are bearing the brunt of the violence .
As one of the most densely populated places in the world , it is clear that many more civilians will be killed if the conflict continues . ”
BROTHERS IN DEATH
Around 20 rockets hit Israel on Thursday , fewer than at the start of the war but not the total halt it wants so that “ quiet will reign supreme , ” as Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said .
Rockets have killed three Israeli civilians since the offensive began .
Olmert said Israel ’s goal had not been achieved and a decision on further military action lay ahead .
Slideshow ( 35 images )
Aside from a 3 - hour ceasefire which Israel ordered for the second day , to let Gaza civilians venture out , there was no let - up in fighting .
Air strikes and ground attacks killed at least nine civilians and three gunmen , medical officials said .
The dead included two brothers aged six and 13 , killed when an Israeli air strike missed a group of Islamic Jihad fighters .
A Ukrainian woman , who could have left , was killed in her home by a tank shell , along with her son .
The father said his wife was sliced in two , his 18 - month - old son only recognizable “ by his teeth . ”
In Washington , the U.S. Senate adopted a bipartisan motion
Slideshow ( 35 images )
“ reaffirming Israel ’s inalienable right to defend against attacks from Gaza , ” said majority leader Harry Reid .
The United States would do the same if “ rockets and mortars coming from Toronto in Canada ” hit Buffalo , New York , he said .
LEBANON FRIGHT
Israel says it accepts the “ principles ” of a ceasefire proposal by Egypt and the European Union , and Washington has urged the Jewish state to study details of the plan .
Hamas , shunned by the West for espousing violence , said it was still considering the ideas .
But the militants say they will never accept Israel , whose establishment in war 60 years ago dispossessed and uprooted Palestinian people .
European governments offered to back the plan with an EU border force to stop Hamas rearming via tunnels from Egypt .
The deal would also address Palestinian calls for an end to Israel ’s economic blockade of the Gaza Strip .
Relations between Israel and the Vatican , never easy , chilled further over Gaza .
The Jewish state condemned an aide to Pope Benedict for calling Gaza “ a big concentration camp , ” the Vatican ’s toughest criticism of Israel since its offensive .
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said Israel was astounded at “ the vocabulary of Hamas propaganda , coming from a member of the College of Cardinals . ”
The ICRC accused Israel of violating the rules of war by delaying ambulance access to the house where its team found children huddled beside corpses , 80 meters ( yards ) from the Israeli army .
The Red Cross said the army must have known of the situation but did not help the wounded , in violation of international law .
Israeli nerves were rattled in the morning when a rocket from southern Lebanon hit an old people ’s home in Nahariya , raising fears that Hezbollah fighters were opening a second front to relieve pressure on Gaza .
Israel fought a 34 - day war with Shi’ite Hezbollah guerrillas in 2006 and is no hurry to engage them now .
It responded with a few artillery rounds and played down the rocket attack .
Migliori siti di car sharing o car pooling dove chiederee trovare passaggi in auto in goni strada d'Italia e dove condividere la macchina e le spese dei viaggi
Aggiornato ilChiedere l'autostop in macchina è sempre insicuro e pericoloso tuttavia in questi ultimi tempi si sta cercando di incentivare questa pratica in ottica di risparmio , sia economico che di impatto ambientale .
Io stesso , detto tra noi , sono piuttosto scettico sul funzionamento di un autostop regolarizzato , forse perchè in Italia siamo un po ' diffidenti e poco abituati a condividere liberamente oggetti propri .
Siti come Pendolari Italia e Road Sharing , offrono servizi gratuiti per far incontrare persone che fanno la stessa strada in macchina perIn questo caso invece vediamo due siti che si propongono i far incontrare persone che devono fare lo stesso percorso automobilistico .
Allora , perchè prendere due macchine e consumare il doppio di benzina ?
Il servizio è una novità in Italia e consiste nella condivisione di automobili private tra un gruppo di persone .
Si tratta praticamente di una community sociale dove , le persone che si registrano , possono cercare l’auto di gruppo da condividere con altre persone per viaggiare lungo gli stessi itinerari o per recarsi negli stessi luoghi , in Italia e in Europa .
Tra gli usi più frequenti di questo tipo di servizio , vi è la condivisione dei percorsi diretti a un evento specifico , un concerto , una manifestazione , una festa , un avvenimento sportivo o culturale .
L'obiettivo proposto dal " road sharing " è molto nobile e si tratta di ridurre i costi del trasporto , non solo dal punto di vista economico , dividendo le spese di viaggio , ma anche dal punto di vista di impatto ambientale consumando meno CO2 .
Sul sitoci si deve registrare e impostare le tratte e i percorsi stradali più frequenti cosi da conoscere , se vi sono , altre persone iscritte che percorrono lo stesso tragitto .
Di fatto , la convenienza è sicuramente nella divisione delle spese di viaggio , nel creare meno traffico in città come Roma o Milano e nel consumare meno benzina .
Il sito , per il car pooling , per cercare e trovare passaggi in auto in ogni strada d'Italia , da autisti raccomandabili e registrati al sito stesso .
Domanda e offerta di posto macchina sono messe in contatto dalla facile interfaccia del sito .
Ci si registra , si indica in che società si lavora e in quale sede , si indica il percorso che si fa per andare a lavoro , date e orari di movimento e se si condivide o si cerca una macchina .
Tutti siti cheper il trasporto tra diverse persone e per creare una " auto di gruppo " .
Questi tre siti sono i migliori che ho trovato come servizi di " Road Sharing " e , nei loro obiettivi , oltre al risparmio ambientale e dei costi di trasporto , si propongono anche come un modo nuovo di fare amicizie e trovare compagnia in macchina .
Rimanendo un po ' scettico sul successo in Italia , almeno a breve termine , di questi servizi online , mi chiedevo quanti di voi conoscevano questi siti e chi li ha provati o si propone di provarli .

JASON ROE is an Irish blogger who noticed what he thought was a bug on Ryanair 's website .
The price of the flights he was trying to book changed when he accidentally went into the voucher section .
Thinking he had found a way to beat the budget airline 's credit - card fee , he duly blogged about it — and in so doing unleashed hell .
The tenth commenter on his blog was " Ryanair Staff # 1 " , who wrote :
jason !
you ’re an idiot and a liar !!
fact is !
you ’ve opened one session then another and requested a page meant for a different session , you are so stupid you dont even know how you did it !
you dont get a free flight , there is no dynamic data to render which is prob why you got 0.00 .
what self respecting developer uses a crappy CMS such as word press anyway AND puts they ’re mobile ph number online , i suppose even a prank call is better than nothing on a lonely sat evening !!
Further on , commenters named " Ryanair Staff # 2 " and " Ryanair Staff # 3 " offered some fairly caustic views of their own .
Who are these unholy threesome , you wonder .
Weirdos with a penchant for strange screen names ?
Well apparently not .
As Travolution , another blog , noted , " We have seen the IP addresses of the commenters and they all trace back to Ryanair HQ " .
It seems Ryanair 's employees are referring to a blogger , on his blog and in their company 's name , as an idiot , a liar and a man with a " pathetic life " .
Travolution followed the matter up with Ryanair and got this confirmation from a spokesman :
Ryanair can confirm that a Ryanair staff member did engage in a blog discussion .
It is Ryanair policy not to waste time and energy corresponding with idiot bloggers and Ryanair can confirm that it wo n't be happening again .
Lunatic bloggers can have the blog sphere all to themselves as our people are far too busy driving down the cost of air travel .
Wow .
Everyone who 's seen the videos of the shooting of Oscar Grant by a BART police officer is rightly outraged .
It was a shooting done in execution style .
17 years ago a different BART officer executed a young black man and the lessons of that killing should not be forgotten today .
When I saw KTVU 's excellent report Saturday night about the BART police officer shooting an unarmed man , all I could think was : I 've been here before .
In 1992 , Officer Fred Carbtree , a 15 - year veteran of the BART police force , shot and killed an unarmed kid named Jerrold Hall in the parking lot of the Hayward station .
That was way before cell phones and ubiquitous video ; there were no pictures of the shooting and few witnesses would come forward .
BART made a monumental effort to cover it up ; I spent an entire month working seven days a week to break through that brick wall .
In the end , I got the story : Crabtree , who was white , had heard a report of an armed robbery on the train , saw Hall , who was black , leaving the station and called him over .
Hall , who had no weapon , argued with the cop and told him he'd done nothing , then turned and started to walk away .
Crabtree racked his shotgun , fired a warning shot over Hall 's head , then fired again , killing him .
There is no police agency in the United States that allows its officers to fire warning shots .
There is no police agency that authorizes an officer to shoot an unarmed suspect who is fleeing the scene .
Jerrold Hall was 19 - years old at the time .
He was a skinny kid , while Crabtree was 200 pounds and had a police dog at his side .
Hall was with his friend , John Henry Owens , at the time of the shooting .
There was no evidence that either of them were guilty of a crime .
What happened next was even worse .
Following this , Owens was apprehended and charged with murder , although it was his friend who had been killed !
He was thrown in jail and a prohibitively high bail was set .
The charge was later changed to felony robbery and , finally , on 25 January , after widespread popular protest , bail was reduced enough to allow his friends and supporters to raise the money to get him released .
At first the BART police claimed that Hall was shot in his chest , rather than the back of the head .
The BART police internal investigation cleared Crabtree of all wrong - doing and called the shooting " justified " .
Gradually , painfully , the true information leaked out .
Hall 's father sued BART , and after years of litigation , he got what he called a " small settlement " .
However , Cornelius
Hall did n't get the most important thing that he asked for - a civilian oversight board .
The structure of the BART police force is a recipe for disaster .
BART 's general manager , ( who is not an elected official and has no expertise in law enforcement ) hires the BART police chief , who then runs a force with some 200 armed officers .
There is no police commission , no police review board , not even a committee of the elected BART board designated to handle complaints against and issues with the BART police .
The BART board holds no regular hearings on police activity or conduct .
There is no public forum where the chief is held to account .
There is no procedure for complaints against BART officers to be heard and adjudicated by anyone except the BART police .
There is , in other words , no civilian oversight or accountability .
This is unacceptable .
The killing of Oscar Grant was n't a " tragic accident " .
It was a preventable disaster caused by the BART Administration that has long refused to fix a dysfunctional police force structure .
One last note : Fred Crabtree hanged himself in 1996 .
Just weeks after Citigroup averted total collapse with a $ 45 billion shot in the arm of taxpayer cash , the bank jetted its former CEO and his family on one of its corporate jets to a posh Mexican resort for New Year ’s , The Post has learned .
Sandy Weill , 75 , hopped aboard the tanking bank ’s Bombardier BD 700 Global Express on Dec. 26 with his wife , Joan , daughter Jessica , her husband and their children .
They flew from Westchester County Airport to the Los Cabos shore region in sunny Baja , according to aviation records and sources familiar with the trip .
The holiday jaunt came the same week that Citigroup – which lost $ 28.2 billion over the last five quarters and cut 75,000 jobs globally in 2008 – agreed to curtail runaway corporate expenses as part of a deal to get the massive influx of federal money .
The new belt - tightening policy went into effect on Dec. 31 , while the jet was parked at the Los Cabos airport .
The family stayed through Jan. 3 at the ultra- expensive One & Only Palmilla in San José del Cabo – where a four - bedroom suite costs $ 12,000 a night .
It ’s the same beachfront resort favored by high - wattage stars like Jennifer Aniston and John Travolta and is where Eli Manning got married in April .
Weill , among the richest men in the country , was Citigroup ’s CEO until 2003 and its chairman until 2006 .
He played a key role in forging the company into the behemoth that toppled under its own weight in the recent credit crisis .
Although he stepped down in 2006 , he remains an adviser to the company and was to keep access to corporate jets until 2016 as part of a blockbuster retirement package he worked out with the bank .
But with the recent collapse , Weill agreed last year to give up most of his perks – including access to company planes – as of April 2009 .
The $ 45 million Bombardier Global Express is part of a company fleet of four jets and one helicopter reserved for use by 12 to 15 Citigroup executives .
A source close to Weill confirmed he and his family used the plane over the holidays .
Weill could have repaid some or all of the plane trip ’s costs .
An SEC filing says Weill has to compensate the company “ based on a cost - per - flight - hour charge developed by a nationally recognized and independent service which reflects the operating costs of the aircraft . ”
“ He paid what he agreed to in the contract , which he strictly adheres to , ” the source said .
News of the taxpayer - aided bank using its corporate aircraft for a deluxe personal getaway comes a week after The Post reported that Citigroup was set to take delivery on a new $ 50 million corporate jet , a French - built Dassault Falcon 7X .
A day later , the bank reluctantly scrapped the purchase under pressure from President Obama and Congress .
Citigroup declined to comment on the trip .
“ For security reasons , we do n’t comment on the use of company aircraft , ” said Shannon Bell , a spokeswoman for the bank in New York .
Industry experts estimate that chartering a plane for such a nine - day trip would cost anywhere from $ 60,000 to $ 80,000 , including fuel , maintenance , insurance and the salaries of a three - person flight crew .
Additionally , Los Cabos ’ plane parking fees for a week would add another $ 2,000 .
Putting up two pilots and a flight attendant in a mid-range Los Cabos - area hotel would cost around $ 300 apiece a night , or $ 7,200 for the week .
Giving each a minimum of $ 50 a day for meals would cost another $ 1,350 .
That would bring the total cost to between $ 70,550 and $ 90,550 .
Despite taking a hit in the recent economic collapse , Weill remains one of the richest men in America with an estimated net worth of $ 1.3 billion in 2008 , according to Forbes magazine .
That ’s down from $ 1.5 billion in 2006 .
In addition to use of the plane , Weill has been receiving roughly $ 3 million in perks from Citigroup since he retired – including consulting fees , health insurance , pension , tax compensation , rental costs for his swanky Midtown office and use of company cars .
Joining Weill on the Los Cabos trip were his millionaire daughter Jessica Bibliowicz , 49 , CEO of National Financial Partners , a money - management firm that caters to the super - rich .
Also aboard was her husband , Natan Bibliowicz , a high - profile Manhattan architect whose company handles multimillion - dollar projects , including the renovation of Carnegie Hall .
The Global Express in which Weill and his family flew is made by Bombardier Aerospace in Canada and retails for about $ 45 million .
It is designed to fly at high speeds and for long distances without refueling .
Seating up to 18 passengers , the interior features a full bar and fine - wine selection , along with “ $ 13,000 carpets , pillows that were made from Hermes scarves , Baccarat Crystal glassware and Cristofle sterling silver flatware , ” said a former crew member .
Weill ’s party departed from an exclusive terminal for private planes at the Westchester County Airport that resembles a five - star hotel lobby , complete with a doorman , grand piano and work stations outfitted with Macintosh computers .
The terminal also has a “ quiet room ” for pilots and a Starbucks .
Richard Gere was spotted there last week , ordering a cappuccino after his private jet landed .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The White House has provided the use of a government airplane to a key Democratic senator in order to ensure the availability of what may prove to be the deciding 60th vote in favor of the $ 787 billion economic stimulus package .
Sen . Sherrod Brown , D - Ohio , has returned to his home state to attend a wake for his 88 - year - old mother , who died February 2 from complications from leukemia .
At the end of the wake , Brown will be flown from Mansfield , Ohio , to Andrews Air Force Base .
After he casts his vote , he will return to Ohio for his mother 's funeral early Saturday .
The plane is being provided by the White House , Brown 's office said , because the vote is considered " official business , " and there are no commercial flights available that would allow him to cast the vote and return to Ohio for his mother 's funeral Saturday morning .
A White House official refused to provide a cost estimate for the military plane , but acknowledged " it will be a higher cost than if he were flying commercial . "
The official said it is a " small government plane . "
" Taking immediate action to save or create 3.5 million jobs and get America 's economy moving again is a top priority for Ohio and the nation , " said the White House official .
" Given that no commercial flights were available that would allow Sen .
Brown to make the vote and to attend services memorializing his mother , the administration provided government transportation to ensure that he could do so . "
While the final Senate vote on the stimulus plan began at 5:30 p.m. ET , senators are expected to be allowed to vote until after 10:30 p.m. , giving Brown enough time to return to the Capitol .

Sexy women in bikinis really do inspire some men to see them as objects , according to a new study of male behavior .
Brain scans revealed that when men are shown pictures of scantily clad women , the region of the brain associated with tool use lights up .
Men were also more likely to associate images of sexualized women with first - person action verbs such as " I push , I grasp , I handle , " said lead researcher Susan Fiske , a psychologist at Princeton University .
And in a " shocking " finding , Fiske noted , some of the men studied showed no activity in the part of the brain that usually responds when a person ponders another 's intentions .
This means that these men see women " as sexually inviting , but they are not thinking about their minds , " Fiske said .
" The lack of activation in this social cognition area is really odd , because it hardly ever happens . "
Dehumanizing
Fiske and colleagues asked 21 heterosexual male volunteers to first take a test that scores people based on different types of sexist attitudes .
The subjects were then shown pictures of both skimpily dressed and fully clothed men and women .
Most of the men best remembered headless photographs of women in bikinis , even if they 'd only seen the image for two - tenths of a second , Fiske reported this weekend in Chicago during the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
And the men who scored higher as " hostile sexists " — those who view women as controlling and invaders of male space — did n't show brain activity that indicates they saw the women in bikinis as humans with thoughts and intentions .
Scientists have seen this absence of activation only once before , in a study where people were shown off - putting photographs of homeless people and drug addicts .
If a similar study were done with women , Fiske told National Geographic News , it would be hard to predict whether a woman shown a scantily clad male body would dehumanize him in the same way .
Evolutionary psychologists have proposed that women tend to look for mates who have wealth and power , so some of Fiske 's colleagues have suggested running a similar test where women are shown pictures of men next to expensive cars or other affluent symbols .

One of the goals of Left 4 Dead 's art direction was to capture the tone and feel of being right in the middle of a horror movie .
This meant making the environments look scary in a specifically cinematic way .
To achieve this , we adopted four distinct " filmic " effects for our art direction : color correction , film grain , vignette and local contrast .
We 'll walk you through all four techniques , with examples , below .
Color Correction
Color correction helps simplify the game 's color palette without sacrificing utility .
In other words , we drained the color out of certain areas of the environment to get a stark , moody tone , but made sure eye - catching and gameplay - specific elements ( like health packs , blood and exit points ) still popped onscreen :
Film Grain
Left 4
Dead is more frightening in a dark and shadowy environment .
We found that applying a film grain technique heightened this feeling , both in helping to make the cinematic experience as gritty and authentic as possible , and in how effectively it implies a greater detail to the surrounding darkness than is actually there .
Thanks to playtesting , we also found that if we applied the film grain effect uniformly , people got tired of it fast .
So we tweaked the technique .
Consequently , in very dark areas with a lot of shadows , there 's a lot of film grain visible .
But the brighter an area gets , the more the grain fades into the background , and disappears entirely in very bright areas .
Vignette
A third film effect we experimented with was vignetting .
This is a lens artifact you 'll often see in lower budget films where cheap cameras were used : specifically , dark edges seeping in around the edges of the screen .
Even still , there 's such a thing as too much .
As you can see , we only applied the effect around all of the top edges of the screen , so a player would n't feel like they were looking through a telescope .
A little goes a long way  as it appears in the game now , playtesters did n't feel like it intruded at all .
It also did a good job of softening the top edges , focusing the gameplay downwards to the center of the screen , where you want a player to look .
Local Contrast
The final technique used in Left 4 Dead was local contrast .
This is a technique borrowed from photo retouching , where the contrast is adjusted specifically on areas of an image that contain a high level of visual detail .
This technique helped make the visuals sharper and more focused .
This ended up being great shorthand for us , as it effectively imitated the feeling of an adrenaline rush or near - death experience .
The effect gives the player a sense of heightened perspective , and was a great subliminal way to let them know a zombie attack was coming .
Visual Cues to Gameplay
Left 4 Dead 's AI Director means that every time you play it you get a unique experience .
Zombie attacks , music cues and even the narrative are generated on the fly based on your health , ammo , and how you 're playing .
Essentially , the AI Director changes your game experience as you play .
Our approach to art direction followed the same path we wanted to ensure a player got a visually unique experience every time he or she played , based on their performance .
Using the four effects we explained above as a foundation , we were able to dynamically blend them to dramatically alter the tone in key areas of the game .
One example of this is the " third strike "  what we call in - game when a player has lost almost all of their health twice , and is on his or her last legs .
We 've increased the level of vignetting to simulate tunnel vision , maxed the color correction to suck the color from the shot , and used local contrast in an inverse manner to soften the edges .

The accumulative effect of all these techniques is to make it look as if the player is bleeding out .
This , again , is a great visual shorthand .
When you see this in the game , you do n't need to be told that you 're pretty close to death .
Pain pills are another example of a visual cue .
In the game , a player can give him or herself a temporary health boost that will slowly drain away over time .
In this instance , we 've maxed out the local contrast , taking what is usually a subtle technique to imply heightened senses , and making it temporarily overt :

That 's all the space we have for now .
In Part 2 , " Stylized Darkness , " we 'll talk about our approach to lighting the dark and murky world of Left 4 Dead , with a focus on playable , stylized dark  namely , finding a balance that gives a player the illusion of darkness without getting frustrating .
It 's no secret Barack Obama is trying to seduce Republicans these days .
But his conservative courting runs much deeper and wider than is publicly known .
Obama tries to seduce Republicans
It 's no secret Barack Obama is trying to seduce Republicans these days .
But his conservative courting runs much deeper and wider than is publicly known .
Obama has had meetings with his former opponent John McCain , GOP congressional leaders and some of the country ’s leading conservative commentators .
He ’s also honoring McCain and Colin Powell in high - profile pre-inaugural dinners , where Obama is expected to toast the Republicans .

Behind the scenes , Obama and his team are working just as hard , courting prominent Republicans and conservatives through frequent phone calls , e-mails and private sit - downs .
The selection of evangelical pastor Rick Warren for the inaugural invocation and Obama ’s dinner with right - of - center writers at George F. Will ’s home drew significant buzz .
But the transition also has quietly reached out to other prominent figures atop the Southern Baptist Church , Charles Colson ’s Prison Fellowship Ministry and the Jewish Orthodox Union .
“ I think he ’s done an extremely good job so far , ” said Sen. Richard Burr ( R - N.C. ) , who received a call from the president - elect last week .
“ On both the quality of his nominees and the contact that he personally or his skeleton staff have had with members on the Hill — I think they ’ve done just an exceptional job at that . ”
Burr , who declined to share what he and Obama spoke about , said it helps to have one of the Senate ’s own now in the White House , a rare thing in the modern presidency .
“ One , you ’ve got to understand that we ’re friends .
Two , the way he interacted with us as a member of the Senate — he has n’t forgot that .
In the early stages now he still has a cell phone and BlackBerry and he ’s using them . ”
Rep. Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) , the House Minority Whip , has met with Obama and is in frequent contact with Rahm Emanuel , the House member turned presidential chief of staff , via cell phone and BlackBerry .
“ I have met with Rahm and spoken with him several times and he said , ‘ Look , you need to understand — working in a bipartisan manner is something the president - elect takes seriously , ’ ” Cantor noted .
“ It has thus far been a very efficient process . ”
Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - S.C. ) , who just got back from the Middle East with Joe Biden , was with McCain and the president - elect in Chicago at the post-election meeting and met again with Obama Wednesday for about 45 minutes .
“ Once the campaign is over , to govern you have to find consensus and I think he understands that , ” said Graham , who will introduce McCain at the tribute dinner Monday .
“ Ronald Reagan understood the value of personal relationships and I think [ Obama ] understands that that model offers the best hope of sustaining momentum from the election and achieving legislative success .
So far , so good . ”
Graham , one of McCain ’s closest friends and a frequent campaign trail companion , said much of the good will from his party stems from a patriotic desire to turn the country around .
“ A lot of people , including Republicans , want us to get back on our feet because we ’re on our knees .
And he ’s the quarterback , he ’s the captain – everybody is pulling for him . ”
According to Obama officials , the president - elect has personally reached out to Senate GOP leaders , Mitch McConnell ( Ky. ) and Jon Kyl ( Ariz . ) , as well as key committee ranking members Charles Grassley ( Iowa ) and Judd Gregg ( N.H. ) and such moderates as Olympia Snowe ( Maine ) .
Kyl , Gregg and Snowe were three of only six Senate Republicans who joined with most Democrats Thursday in opposing a resolution disapproving of Obama ’s request to release the remaining bailout money .
Among Republicans , Obama seems to have made deeper inroads thus far in the more consensus - driven Senate , where he already has personal relationships from his four years there .
“ I think he understands that 41 Republicans can affect what finds its way to his desk , ” said Burr , alluding to the need to get 60 votes in the Senate for most bills to procede to a vote .
But Obama has n’t necessarily shirked the more conservative House GOP minority .
Cantor said a hearing that Republicans held Thursday on the stimulus came after Obama call for more bipartisan cooperation in a meeting with Congressional leadership .
“ He was very clear : he said bring us your ideas , ” Cantor recalled .
“ I take the president - elect at his word that he really does want to change the way Washington works . ”
Cantor said that , following the hearing , he and other House GOP leaders would approach Obama to request a meeting to offer their input on an economic bill that both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue hope to have to the White House by mid-February .
As generous as he was of Obama , who is riding high in the polls , Cantor was not as charitable toward his less popular Democratic colleagues .
“ The battle of ideas is beginning , ” Cantor said , just hours before House Democrats irked their Republican counterparts by unveiling the first draft of a stimulus plan .
“ Capitol Hill Democrats would rather see a return to addressing problems with a very significant amount of government spending . ”
But while partisan clashing between the two parties may be inevitable , Obama is n’t limiting his outreach to the capital .
He and his aides are also courting influential outside conservatives .
“ It has certainly helped the president - elect to get more of a hearing from evangelicals when he invited Rick Warren , ” said Richard Land , a well - known social conservative and chief of the Southern Baptist Convention ’s public policy arm .
“ I do n’t think that would have happened had Hillary Clinton been elected . ”
Land , who said he had been contacted by Obama aides since the election , praised the new president and suggested that he would receive a fresher look from Christian conservatives because of both his approach and his generation .
“ He ’s done a pretty good job making it clear that he does n’t have the knife out , ” said Land .
“ Just because you disagree with him on some issues does n’t mean you ca n’t agree with him on other issues . ”
And Obama , unlike the Clintons and President Bush , is somebody who is neither shaped nor scarred by baby boomer battles , noted Land , 62 , himself a product of the era .
“ There ’s more opportunity for it to be civil , more opportunity for it to be constructive .
We ’ve been going at each other for so long , we just ca n’t help it .
But somebody like Obama comes along – an even though he ’s more liberal than Hillary – he does n’t generate the same heat .
I welcome it . ”
The message , said a transition official involved in the outreach , is simple : “ The door is open . ”
But , this being Washington politics , not all are convinced Obama ’s motives are entirely altruistic .
Said Charles Krauthammer , the longtime conservative columnist who was at Will ’s dinner , on Fox News : “ You see that since his election he has kind of reached out to people that may not be ideological allies , to Rick Warren , the pastor who will be at his inaugural , to John McCain , whom he has treated with a lot of dignity and respect , and to a bunch of right wing columnists last night , in part , because I think he is a guy who is intellectually curious and wants to exchange ideas , but also in part he wants to co-opt the vast right wing conspiracy . ”
As Australia comes to grips with the death of at least 130 people in the deadliest bush fires in its history , officials there say they will take a hard look at the much - vaunted “ Leave Early or Stay and Defend ” policy , which trains homeowners to defend their homes and is being considered for adoption in Europe and some parts of the United States , including California .
Even as firefighters in the state of Victoria struggle to reach stricken communities , authorities say that some people were killed while actively defending their homes , a choice that researchers say has rarely resulted in death .
In addition , authorities expect that a large number of fatalities will have occurred in highway crashes during panicked evacuations , the very scenario the Australian policy seeks to avoid .
Australia adopted the “ stay or go ” approach about a decade ago following the so - called Ash Wednesday fires in 1983 that killed 83 people and injured 2,600 .
Researchers found after those blazes that the most frequent cause of death in wildfires was people being trapped in their cars trying to flee .
They determined that properly trained homeowners would be at less risk if they stayed off the roads and took shelter .
The Australian policy includes extensive training that emphasizes homeowner preparation and calls for measures such as clearing a defensible space , storing water , having fire equipment ready and establishing a fire plan .

Research further demonstrated that during wildfires homes usually burn not in a wall of flames but from small spot fires sparked by embers , often carried miles ahead of the fire front .
Homeowners are instructed to stamp out small fires -- often with mops -- and take shelter in their homes as the fire moves past .
Officials say the “ stay or go ” policy has been demonstrably successful in saving both lives and property in Australia , and is now the most talked - about strategy in the firefighting world .
Australian fire officials travel the globe explaining their ideas to officials who are looking for ways to better deploy fire crews .
In the U.S. , federal , state and local fire officials spent last year examining how the Australian policy would work if adopted in this country .
In January the panel submitted recommendations to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group , a Cabinet - level committee that reports to the president .
More recently officials from fire agencies in seven Southern California counties began discussing a hybrid of the Australian approach : an evacuation policy that makes allowances for people who want to try to save their homes .

Ventura and Orange counties are building the strategy into their firefighting plans , and the unincorporated community of Rancho Santa Fe in San Diego County has had a similar program for a few years .
That policy saved homes while not resulting in any loss of life during the 2007 Witch fire , according to the Rancho Santa Fe Fire Protection District .
In Australia , the policy is well entrenched .
A decade of concerted public safety announcements and community - based education was thought to have nearly blanketed the populace with the details of the program .
However , even fire officials say the proven policy can break down in the face of raw panic .
“ Even if you have been to the lectures and have had somebody of experience tell you what happens , and you rehearse what you are going to do . . . you still do n’t completely understand the ferocity of that fire when it comes , ” said Daryl Wells , for 32 years captain of the fire brigade in Werribee , a suburb of Melbourne .
“ All the information that we provide for the people -- part of the psyche is they think they know better , they think they can do it .
But when they feel the heat , and then noise , as the fire starts to come over the hill , that causes panic .
They say , ‘ Let ’s get in the car . ’
When you get up in the morning and conditions are like that , that ’s when you decide if you stay or go .
By the time the smoke is coming up the hill behind your house , it ’s too late . ”

According to Australian fire researchers , the vast majority of deaths occur when residents race onto smoke - obscured roads , often littered with downed trees , charred wildlife or emergency vehicles .
Reports from over the weekend , when hundreds of fires raced across southeastern Australia fanned by high winds , suggest that in some hard - hit communities residents organized convoys of vehicles that fled one fire only to be consumed by another .
“ What seems to have happened in some cases was people had a perception that a wave of fire was coming over the hill at them and they ran from that , ” said Kevin Tolhurst , a fire researcher at the University of Melbourne .
“ But in fact they may have been surrounded by fires in many directions and taken by surprise .
That complexity is lost to some . ”
Some argue that without the policy and its educational component , things would have been much worse .
“ If those messages were n’t out there , the possibility is we could have lost 200 to 300 by now , ” said Ashley Mills , the officer in charge at the Wangaratta fire brigade .

As happened after the Ash Wednesday fires , the tragedy has triggered official reviews and public reflection .
Victoria ’s coroner declared the burned areas to be crime scenes because arson is suspected as the cause of some of the fires .
In addition , fire officials said a Royal Commission is likely to be convened to examine all aspects of the fires , including emergency response .
Victorian Premier John Brumby said the fire policy will be among those issues up for review .
While firefighters welcome the oversight , they caution that there ’s a limit to what can be done to protect homes in firestorms like those that occurred over the weekend .
“ I feel there will be an overall look at the policy ; you would be stupid not to , ” said David Gillett , brigade captain for the Country Fire Authority in the town of Anakie .
“ But they will find the policy is right because we ’ve proved time and time again that it works . ”
Advertisement
But Gillett said he ’s beginning to see the limitations of convincing homeowners they will always be safe in their homes if properly prepared .
“ The conditions were just too extreme , so ripe , I ’m not sure some of those homes were defendable , ” he said .
“ Maybe we need to tell people , ‘ Yes , you can stay and defend your house , up to certain level .
But once you reach that level , maybe you ’ve got to get out . ’ ”

IT ’S time to get practical over climate change .
A report by the UK’s Institution of Mechanical Engineers will next month call for governments to accept that climate change is now inevitable .
Strategies must be put in place now to protect our infrastructure from its worst effects , alongside existing efforts to reduce emissions , it will argue .
Recommendations include more underground reservoirs to combat increased evaporation during drought , and a subterranean water - distribution system .
Electricity should be produced from a mix of renewable sources .
To reduce the urban heat - island effect – whereby concrete jungles overheat , necessitating energy - hungry air - conditioning – new cities should be …
A group of unknown Taiwan - based notebook manufacturers , hereinafter referred to as " those bastards , " are urging Intel to delay the release of its upcoming Calpella notebook platform in order to allow them to use up stock of existing laptop parts , Digitimes reports .
Intel 's already - delayed Calpella platform promises support for the upcoming laptop Nehalem variants , Clarksfield and Auburndale , and an interesting new design .
Nehalem 's onboard memory controller will allow Intel to fold the Northbridge and Southbridge into one chip , dubbed Ibex Peak - M , which , although it sounds like it 's related to Ubuntu , may yet be pretty sweet .
Also included are Centrino 2 - branded WiFi and WiMax chips .
The package , presumably still branded " Centrino 2 , " was expected to launch this summer .
If those bastards have their way , however , Calpella may be delayed .
Citing lagging laptop sales due to a flagging economy and cannibalization by netbooks , those bastards say stocks of Intel 's Montevina notebook parts are at a high level .
Exacerbating the problem are Intel 's relatively high prices on Montevina parts , part of their own effort to combat the netbook trend 's corrosive effect on margins industry - wide .
Those bastards , Digitimes report , would like a few extra months to ship their remaining Montevina inventory , and have urged Intel to push the Calpella , Clarksfield , and Auburndale launches back to October , in the fourth quarter of 2009 .
It 's not clear why they 're doing this .
Aside from the general oddity of laptop vendors pushing for slower development of laptops , it seems utterly implausible that those bastards would have more than eight months ' worth of chips in stock and on uncancellable orders .
More likely , it would seem , those bastards simply want more months to coast on existing parts without unveiling new designs .
Intel may be surprisingly responsive to such pressure .
Faced with a dire need to keep ASPs up in a crushing semiconductor crisis , and generally unpressured by competition from AMD in the notebook and netbook spaces , Intel may delay the launch , or simply keep Calpella pipelines dry until October in an intentional paper launch .
As recent history has shown , large companies will bow to accommodate each other , as when MS caved to Intel by changing Vista standards to allow 915 chipset inventory to clear out .
If this kind of intentional delay pans out , and proves to be typical of product spaces where Intel faces no competition , AMD 's relatively uncompetitive position could be bad tidings indeed .
Those bastards wo n't be the only ones listening keenly for news of a Calpella delay .

Sure , no one doubts Barack Obama ’s credentials as an intellectual or an innovator , but a portion of what he is expected to do is fairly simple to understand : reverse everything that the Bush administration messed up Indiana jones and the last crusade download .
The New York Times reports that today Obama will sign off on orders to review the detainment of the 245 “ suspected terrorists ” held at Guantánamo Bay , as well as ordering the prison to be closed within a year .
That , in addition banning the CIA from using “ coercive interrogation methods ” ( read : torture ) , will go a long way to removing the hypocrisy that characterized the Bush era and restoring America ’s integrity on the world stage as a leader in Human Rights .
The Times also anticipates that Obama , a man unintimidated by science ( unlike his predecessor ) , will lift the restrictions imposed on human embryonic research as early as next week .
Realistically it may take up to a year to implement his orders , but Obama is , at least so far , showing his commitment to starting a wave of change in this country — that will ripple across the globe — as swiftly as he can .
It 's always interesting to watch what little hooks and schemes the malware industry has cooked up in an attempt to better bait the public and the new Anti-Virus - 1 package does n't disappoint .
AV - 1 is a cute mixture of scareware and malware , and while we 've seen XP Antivirus playing this turf for years , AV - 1 adopts a few new tactics of its own .
Once run , the program installs its particular Trojan of choice ( Zlob and Vundo are apparently popular options ) , then makes certain modifications to the hosts file .
BleepingComputer.com has assembled a list of these changes , a sample of which is included below .
If a user attempts to visit any of the links listed , he or she is directed to a site under the control of the botnet controllers .
a1.review.zdnet.com
www.reviews.download.com
reviews.download.com
reviews.pcadvisor.co.uk
reviews.pcmag.com
Once redirected , users are served up with what appears to be an actual , legitimate review of Anti-Virus - 1 from a reputable source .
These reviews appear to be thinly - veiled rips of what has been written about actual anti-virus scanners — in BleepingComputer 's example image , you can see where the words " Norton Antivirus 2009 " were presumably removed , with " AntiVirus2010 " substituted .
This leads to some odd - looking ad copy — " Win Your Own AntiVirus2010TM2008 " — but the swap does n't stand out nearly as much as we might like .
Attempting to bank off the Symantec name is a calculated risk ; the authors are obviously hoping that viewers might lock on to the brand familiarity without
actually remembering the " Norton " brand .
( I 'd like to date myself by noting that I actually thought Norton Utilities was extremely cool back around version 2.0 .
Yes , people used to like programs with the word " Norton " in them . )
The fake reviews do a fair job of either copying the look / feel of the original sites or , more probably , simply
took the requisite HTML wholesale .
BleepingComputer 's report does n't specify if infected users are actually directed to the false reviews in question or are simply fed them if they happen to visit , but the Trojan serves up an array of false positives and other warnings all aimed at selling a copy of Anti-Virus - 1 ( or AntiVirus2010 ) .
The program is , for all intents and purposes , Antivirus XP in different clothes , and like that program , it pretends to scan the system , detect and remove dangerous software , and regularly update itself .
Both the FTC and Microsoft took steps last year to attack the scareware industry , but it 's unclear whether the problem can be treated as a separate issue or only addressed as part of the wider war on malware .
Meanwhile , the success of Antivirus XP may have attracted additional players to the field , including at least one scheme that targets Mac users .
Scareware 's obvious Achilles ' heel is the fact that money directly changes hands ; consumers who believe they are buying legitimate PC protection are actually paying for infectious software .
In addition , the scareware initiatives we 've typically seen to - date all leverage the brand recognition of legitimate companies .
Microsoft has a direct interest in protecting the " XP " brand , Symantec does not want its name associated with malware , and PC Magazine has built its reputation and reader base by providing factual reviews of products people might actually want to own .
Thus far , Microsoft is the only software vendor that has made a major push against scareware , but that would likely change if other software developers found their own names prominently slapped on a fraudulent product .
Scareware is a problem , but the same characteristics that make it function may also be the seeds of its downfall .

In Africa 's Lake Victoria , researchers believe they 've caught a fish population in the act of splitting into two distinct species .
Researchers say this example of evolution - in- action is remarkable because the two sub-populations of fish are n't geographically isolated and could theoretically interbreed , but adaptations to their vision are causing them to diverge .
Lead researcher Norihiro
Okada and his colleagues had previously shown that cichlid fish in Lake Victoria ’s shallow waters are bathed in bluer light , while the turbid water of the lake predominantly lets redder light filter down to fish living in deeper water .
The researchers showed that the fish ’s eyes have adapted to this difference so that fish that live in deeper water have a pigment in their eyes that is more sensitive to red light , while shallow - water fish have a pigment that ’s sensitive to blue [ Science News ] .
Okada 's new study , published in Nature [ subscription required ] , shows that those eye adaptations have also affected mating patterns .
The researchers brought some fish to their laboratory tanks , and watched to see which mates the female fish would choose .
They found that females that lived in shallow water and had eyes that were sensitive to blue were more likely to spot and mate with males with a slightly bluish tinge , and that deep - water , red- sensitive females picked out the reddish males .
That means that back in the lake , the eye adaptions
gave blue males a mating advantage in shallower water and red ones an edge in deeper parts of the lake because they were more attractive to female fish .
" In short , what you see determines what you get , and with whom you get it on , " Mark Kirkpatrick ... wrote in a Nature commentary [ Reuters ] .
Researchers say that the two diverging populations are rapidly accumulating genetic differences , but also note that worsening pollution in Lake Victoria may disrupt the process of speciation .
In clear waters , the colour that appears brighter shifts from red to blue gradually with depth , and red and blue fish stick to their zones , cementing their genetic differences .
In murky waters , however , the transition from red to blue happens much quicker and blue and red fish sometimes interbreed , destroying species differences [ New Scientist ] .

We web developers have been waiting a long time .
Internet Explorer 6 has all kinds of weird flaws that make our lives miserable .
It does n't understand the box model corectly .
It only supports extremely basic css selectors .
It is keeping the web ugly since it can't handle transparent PNGs .
Web develpers are ready to be done with IE6 .
Some have gone so far as to join the IE Death March , pulling the plug on IE6 support by March .
In our opinion , this is an acceptable decision for web applications , but not for web sites .
We have already dropped IE6 support in our content management software as the benefits far outweighed the disadvantages .
We can produce substantially more bug - free functionality at a much faster rate by simply ignoring IE6 .
While this is a great policy for an application , it is a terrible policy for websites .
A very large portion of the world still uses IE6 .
The graph below shows it best :
Internet Explorer is still in charge of the browser market and IE6 is hanging on .
Even though Microsoft has pushed IE7 as hard as it can , many users still have IE6 .
In corporate environments , where internal applications have been written specifically with IE6 in mind , the upgrade process will be slow .
Even if a website does n't have any interest in corporations , it cannot afford to ignore 20 % of the market , especially when the site 's target market may be browsing at work .
Do n't forget about IE6 - Some Resources
So if you are a web developer ( or having a site developed ! ) , support for IE6 is a must .
If this support is n't a part of the development process you use , it will be much more challenging .
Below are some resources that can be helpful in keeping IE6 support .
Tools for Browser Testing :
VMware Fusion : Run Windows on your Mac
IE6 Standalone : Run IE6 alongside IE7 .
( Handly but has some reliability issues .
It also reports itself as IE7 so browser specific stylesheets can be a challenge . )
Cross Browser Testing : Get 5 minutes free using a virtual instances of the OS and browser of your choice .
Things to Look out for :
Box Model : Specifying a width or heigh on an element along with a padding or border in the same dimension will render differently in IE6 .
Double Margin Float : Just add " display : inline ; " to the floated element
Default Header Sizes :
This varies from browser to browser , use a CSS Reset .
PNG Transparency : Use an alpha loader .
: hover psudoselector :
By default it only works on anchor elements .
How to proceed blindly :
ie7.js : Javascript file that makes IE6 behave like a standards compliant browser .
jQuery , prototype , mooTools : JS libraries that abstract cross - browser incompatibilities
There are certainly many other things that can be done to make developing IE6 easier .
If you know some more that I should include please let me know in the comments .
20th hijacker was tortured , judge says Guantanamo interrogation is judged ' overly aggressive '
In this image reviewed by the U.S. Military , the sun rises behind a sign at Guantanamo detention facility at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , Tuesday , Nov. 18 , 2008 .
The U.S. has used loud music against those held in Guantanamo Bay , Iraq and Afghanistan , and detainees now are n't the only ones complaining : Musicians are banding together to demand the U.S. military stop using their songs as weapons .

At Guantanamo , music treatment was once called common ; the commander says it 's not used now .

The top Bush administration official in charge of deciding whether to bring Guantanamo Bay prisoners to trial has concluded that the U.S. military tortured a Saudi citizen who allegedly planned to participate in the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , interrogating him with techniques that included sustained isolation , sleep deprivation , nudity and prolonged exposure to cold , leaving him in a life - threatening condition .
" We tortured ( Mohammed al - ) Qahtani , " said Susan Crawford , in her first interview since being named convening authority of military commissions by Defense Secretary Robert Gates in February 2007 .
" His treatment met the legal definition of torture .
And that 's why I did not refer the case " for prosecution .
Crawford , a retired judge who was general counsel for the Army during the Reagan administration and as Pentagon inspector general when Dick Cheney was secretary of defense , is the first senior Bush administration official responsible for reviewing practices at Guantanamo to publicly state that a prisoner was tortured .
Crawford , 61 , said the combination of the interrogation techniques , their duration and the impact on al - Qahtani 's health led to her conclusion .
" The techniques they used were all authorized , but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive and too persistent , " she said .
Military prosecutors said in November that they would seek to refile charges against al - Qahtani , 30 , based on subsequent interrogations that did not employ harsh techniques .
But Crawford , who dismissed war crimes charges against him in May 2008 , said she would not allow the prosecution to go forward .
Al - Qahtani was denied entry into the United States a month before the Sept. 11 attacks and was allegedly planning to be the plot 's 20th hijacker .
He was later captured in Afghanistan and transported to Guantanamo in January 2002 .
His interrogation took place over 50 days from November 2002 to January 2003 .
At one point he was threatened with a military working dog named Zeus , according to a military report .
He " was forced to wear a woman 's bra and had a thong placed on his head during the course of his interrogation ... ( and ) was told that his mother and sister were whores . "
With a leash tied to his chains , he was led around the room " and forced to perform a series of dog tricks , " the report shows .
The al - Qahtani case underscores the challenges facing the incoming Obama administration as it seeks to close the controversial prison at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , including the dilemmas posed by individuals considered too dangerous to release but whose legal status is uncertain .
Nearly five months after Lance Armstrong announced with great fanfare that he was returning to cycling and would subject himself to a strict and transparent individual antidoping program , that program has been abandoned without ever beginning .
Don Catlin , the prominent antidoping scientist who was supposed to run Armstrong ’s program , said Wednesday that they had decided earlier in the day to part ways , without Catlin ’s analyzing a single blood or urine sample from Armstrong .
The program was too complex and too costly , Catlin said , and the decision to terminate it was mutual .
“ In the real world , when you try to implement a program as grandiose as what you had in mind , it just becomes so complicated that it ’s better not to try , ” Catlin said , adding that a contract with Armstrong had never been signed .
“ We ’re all disappointed , but it ’s just not going to be possible . ”
Armstrong ’s agent , Bill Stapleton , said that Armstrong would continue to be tested by the internal antidoping program of his professional cycling team , Astana .
That program is run by Rasmus Damsgaard , a Danish antidoping research scientist .
Stapleton said that Damsgaard had tested Armstrong , a seven - time Tour de France winner , about two or three times since December .

In 1957 , the Cleveland police showed up at Dollree Mapp ’s home looking for a bombing suspect .
Ms. Mapp would not let them in without a search warrant , but they entered anyway .
The police did not find the bomber , but they came across a trunk containing “ lewd and lascivious ” books and pictures .
Ms. Mapp was convicted of possessing obscene materials , even though the evidence was taken without a warrant .
She was tried in state court , like the overwhelming majority of criminal defendants .
So it did her no good that federal courts had applied the so - called “ exclusionary rule ” since 1914 to bar the use of illegally seized evidence .
In 1961 , in Mapp v. Ohio , the Supreme Court reversed Ms. Mapp ’s conviction and adopted the exclusionary rule as a national standard .
The court acknowledged that the rule might let some criminals go free , but it underscored that it was more important to compel the nation ’s police forces to obey the law .
The court carved out exceptions over the years , but the basic rule laid down in Mapp has endured for nearly five decades .
Now , Chief Justice John Roberts ’s conservative majority on the Supreme Court is working to undo the exclusionary rule in a more fundamental way .
It ’s been a longstanding interest of Mr. Roberts ’s .
As a young Reagan administration lawyer , he worked on what he described in a memo as a “ campaign to amend or abolish ” the rule .
Rams have lots to build on off of last year 's success
The Chinese - Canadian film star in a racy scandal over photos that showed him in bed with eight of China 's best - known actresses and singers testified against the person accused of accessing his private laptop , which held the images .
The scandal dominated Hong Kong headlines for weeks last year , and the Chinese government censured the country 's top internet search engine for allegedly helping spread the photos of the stars apparently performing sex acts or in sexually suggestive poses .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Edison Chen , the Vancouver - born star who moved to China as a teenager , testified in a British Columbia courtroom for the trial of Ho Chun Sze , which is taking place in Hong Kong .
Sze faces three counts of obtaining access to a computer with illegal intent .
Chen refused to return to Hong Kong for the case but he agreed to a deposition in Canada .
Hong Kong Chief Magistrate Tong Man flew to Vancouver to hear the evidence .
Canadian Department of Justice lawyer Kerry Swift said the testimony will become part of the case in Hong Kong .
The Hong Kong judiciary is allowed to take testimony under a mutual legal assistance treaty and Chen 's testimony will be presented in the Hong Kong case as a deposition .
" I 'm quite a private person .
I enjoy my privacy .
I need my privacy , " said Chen , star of a popular series of Hong Kong action films .
" This was never meant for anyone else to see . "
Police say the images were illegally copied from the laptop of Chen , who left show business after apologising for the scandal .
Some of the pages hosting the photos at the time received more than 25 million hits , and the celebrity feeding frenzy crashed the web in Hong Kong .
Chen said the images were released in spurts .
" It was more of an attack , a well - planned attack in the way these images were released , " he said .
Chen told the judges he would not answer questions about the women .
" I am determined to protect their innocence , " he said .
" They have suffered enough . "
A reluctant Chen was ordered by the Canadian judge to confirm the identities of some women in the pictures .
They are actress Cecilia Pak - Chi Cheung , actor - singer Gillian Yan -Tung Chung , former actress Bobo Man - Yu Chan and model - actress Rachel Sze - Wing Ngan .

The series of photographs showing Chen in bed with eight of the country 's best - known actresses and singers surfaced on the internet in January 2008 .
Chen said that the computer was taken for repairs in the summer of 2006 .
He said he thought he had deleted the images from the computer .
" That strongly led me to believe that there was some foul play in this computer store , " he said .
Chen also testified that he noticed that a second laptop went missing when he was moving last year , but told the judge he did not disclose his password to anyone .
Then on 29 January 2008 , he said his friends started contacting him about the images circulating on the internet .
" This was a very huge shock to me , " Chen told the court .
A month later , a police inspector showed him a compact disk of photographs .
" Of course , I had seen these pictures .
I took these pictures .
They were in my personal computer , " he said .
Chen called the theft of the photos an " invasion of privacy . "
" Everything was consensual , " he said .
Chen , a rap singer and star of a popular series of Hong Kong action films , apologised last year for the scandal and left the entertainment business , recently returning to his childhood home of British Columbia .
Dozens of Chinese - language and English - language photographers and media gathered at the Canadian court for Chen 's appearance .
Natalie Dylan Virginity For Sale , Current Bid $ 3.7 Million ( Photos , Video )
Natalie Dylan appeared on The Tyra Banks Show in December 2008 .
The 22 year old San Diego resident has gone public with her quest to auction off her virginity to the highest bidder .
At the time of this broadcast the bidding was slightly over $ 1 million .
Reports today indicate the auction bidding has reached $ 3.7 million .
Prostitution is illegal so the savvy young woman contacted Dennis Hof , owner of the Moonlite Bunny Ranch , a Nevada brothel located 6 miles from Carson City .
The less than deluxe accommodations consist of a set of connected trailers .
Hof has allowed Dylan to post her virginity auction on his website and will host Dylan and her one night stand when the transaction is completed .
What 's in it for Hof ?
He will take one - half of the winning bid .
Dylan , who has agreed to a medical examination to prove her claim that she is a virgin , told Tyra that she reserves the right to reject the highest bidder if someone with a lesser bid strikes her fancy .
Natalie is a women 's studies alumni of Sacramento State .
She plans to use her windfall to finance graduate school .

Organizing atheists is often likened to herding cats .
Because atheism refers to nothing more than a lack of acceptance of the theistic belief claim ( i.e. , that some sort of god or gods exist ) , atheists appear to have little in common besides what they do not believe .
And yet , there do appear to be a few issues on which most atheists , secular humanists , and freethinkers agree and can be united ( e.g. , opposition to theocracy , a preference not to be constantly bombarded with pro-religion messages , disgust over anti-atheist bigotry , etc. ) .
However difficult organizing atheists may be , this does not mean that it is impossible or that it would not be advantageous to do so .
Imagine that you are a local politician , perhaps a member of your city council , school board , or similar body .
Someone brings a complaint to you about a local ordinance , expenditure , or policy .
While listening to the complainant , you realize that you agree with them .
They have made a strong case for their position , and you think they are correct to request the change they are requesting .
You attempt to make the change through your vote , an order , a public statement , or whatever means would be appropriate in your situation .
At this point , you are approached by 30 - 40 citizens opposing your decision and wanting you to reverse it .
You listen to their arguments carefully but disagree , finding their case irrational and counterproductive .
Now consider your dilemma .
A change was suggested to you , and you agreed that it was an important one to make .
However , you are now receiving considerable public pressure to ignore what you think is right and do something with which you do not agree .
Odds are , you end up setting aside what you think is right , bowing to public pressure , and opting for that the majority position with which you disagree .
After all , you are a politician who wants to retain your office .
Without improved organization , we atheists , secular humanists , and / or freethinkers are never going to have much of a voice .
Unless we can find common ground - even if it is little more than temporary alliances focused on particular issues - we are doomed to being barely audible voices of reason in a sea of superstition and irrationality .
A noble position ?
Perhaps , but would n't it be nice to win a few too ?
What we need is a grassroots secular activist organization along the lines of MoveOn.org .
Regardless of what you think of their politics , you have to admire some aspects of the system they have created .
Picture an Internet - based alliance of atheists , agnostics , secular humanists , and freethinkers where the members would have a voice in setting the goals of the organization and where the organization would use websites , e-mail , text messages , etc. to mobilize members to make our voices heard .
By making it easy for us to contact our elected officials to express ourselves on church - state issues , it would be more likely that they would hear from us .
Yes , I am aware that there are already a handful of organizations attempting to do something like this for the secular community .
They are a step in the right direction and worth supporting , but none come close to what we need .
They are n't big enough or well - organized enough .
They are weakened by their division , do a lousy job of recruiting new members or providing a sense of community to current members , and some do not seem to do much more than collect money and distribute print newsletters .
We can do better .
I know we can do better .
There are atheists all over the world who are ready to come forward and be a part of a movement .
It saddens me to see this resource being wasted .

The advertising regulator has received almost 150 complaints that an atheist ad campaign , proclaiming " There is probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life " , is offensive to Christians and other religions that believe in a single God .
Stephen Green , the national director of Christian Voice , is among those who have complained to the Advertising Standards Authority , arguing that the atheist campaign broke the advertising code on the grounds of substantiation and truthfulness .
The ASA has received 141 complaints about the Atheist Bus Campaign which launched earlier this week on buses throughout England , Scotland and Wales , as well as the London underground .
However , 39 of the complaints are regarding newspaper and online articles about the campaign , which the ASA has no power to deal with .
The complainants claim the ad campaign is offensive to Christians and those of other monotheistic religions .
Green said : " It is given as a statement of fact and that means it must be capable of substantiation if it is not to break the rules .
" There is plenty of evidence for God , from people 's personal experience , to the complexity , interdependence , beauty and design of the natural world .
" But there is scant evidence on the other side , so I think the advertisers are really going to struggle to show their claim is not an exaggeration or inaccurate , as the ASA code puts it . "
The regulator has not yet decided if the complaints warrant a formal investigation to see if the campaign has broken the advertising code .
Hanne Stinson , the chief executive of the British Humanist Association , which launched the campaign , said she " pitied the ASA if they are going to be expected to rule on the probability of god 's existence .
However , if they do investigate we will be very happy to respond " .
The campaign uses quotes from famous public figures – such as Albert Einstein , Douglas Adams , Emily Dickinson and Katharine Hepburn – who have either endorsed atheism or expressed scepticism about the concept of God .
Writer Ariane Sherine first suggested the idea in a Guardian Comment is Free blog last June , saying an atheist bus campaign would provide a reassuring counter - message to religious slogans threatening non-Christians with hell and damnation .

JAKARTA , Feb 12 ( Reuters ) - Indonesia issued a tsunami warning after an earthquake struck near the Talaud Islands north of Sulawesi island , the country ’s meteorology agency said on Thursday .
An official at the agency said the quake was at a shallow depth of 10 km ( 6.2 miles ) and was felt strongly in the Talaud Islands .
The U.S. Geographical Survey said the 7.5 magnitude quake had struck in the Talaud Islands , 323.5 km ( 201 miles ) south - southeast of General Santos , on the Philippine island of Mindanao .
It put the quake at a depth of 33 km ( 20 miles ) .
The U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said no destructive widespread tsunami threat existed .
But the agency added that earthquakes of this size sometimes generate local tsunamis that could be destructive along coasts located within 100 km of the quake epicentre .
It said Japan ’s meteorological agency might issue tsunami messages for countries in the northwest Pacific and South China Sea , and if the information was conflicting , the more conservative information should be used for safety .

To truly fix the medical system in the United States , the nation must take another look at the problem itself .
Brown v. Board of Education — Miranda v. Arizona — Roe v. Wade .
These United States Supreme Court cases left a lasting mark on segregation in schools ( 1954 ) , police arrest procedure and due process of law ( 1966 ) , and abortion ( 1973 ) .
All three changed America forever .
On June 28 , 2012 , National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius seemed destined to enter the elite ranks of game - changing rulings .
This was the day the highest court in the land decided the fate of the controversial Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA ) — better known as universal healthcare or , more simply , “ Obamacare . ”

As the nation awaited the ruling on President Barack Obama ’s signature legislation , a sea of protesters surrounded the Supreme Court building .
The polarized audience spoke volumes about the debate : some homemade posters stated “ Stand Up for Religious Freedom , ” and others “ Hands Off My Medicare ” — women in lab coats waved “ Protect the Law ” signs — strips of red duct tape , with “ LIFE ” scrawled on it , covered mouths of anti-abortion advocates — and still others hollered “ 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 , healthcare is what we ’re fighting for . ”
Finally , the verdict was in .
PPACA emerged relatively unscathed with only one significant change — it was now a tax .
Democratic lawmakers viewed the decision as “ a victory for people all over this country whose lives will be more secure ” and “ a breakthrough of sunshine in a long dark night of …assaults on the American middle and working class . ”
One prominent leader even stated , “ Our supreme court has spoken … the matter is settled . ”
Yet it was far from settled .
The excitement and energy exhibited by PPACA supporters was matched by the disdain and discontent exhibited by opponents upon learning the court ’s decision .
Multiple national polls show a majority of Americans view PPACA unfavorably .
Many feel the law will “ do serious harm to American families ” and is “ a profound attack on our liberties . ”
U.S. business owners speak of passing on costs to employees , slashing work hours , or terminating jobs altogether .
Opposition has also emerged outside of the U.S. , with the Vatican openly opposing a portion of the law ’s provisions .
Catholic leaders objected to the “ use of federal funds to pay for elective abortions ” and the failure of the act to help “ those most in need . ”
With all the bickering , though , both sides generally agree on one thing : America ’s healthcare system is in crisis .
Exploding costs are hindering patients ’ abilities to afford medical treatment .

Consider .
In 1980 , healthcare expenditures were $ 256 billion , according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services .
In 2010 , U.S. taxpayers paid nearly $ 2.6 trillion for healthcare services .
This represents a tenfold increase in a single generation !
A reported 60 percent of bankruptcies in the U.S. are due to expensive medical bills .
In effect , as Dr. Steffie Woolhandler told CNN , “ Unless you ’re a Warren Buffet or Bill Gates , you ’re one illness away from financial ruin in this country . ”
So - called Obamacare ( at first derogatively named after its primary champion then later embraced by Mr. Obama who stated he does care ) is an intended solution to the problem .
Its aim is to reduce the number of uninsured and fix flaws within existing insurance programs .
Yet , three years after PPACA was passed with provisions to be phased in through the year 2020 , the law has been unable to shake the controversy attached to it .
Politicians , economists , pundits and those in the medical field have spent years attempting to justify , clarify or attack the nearly 1,000 - page document that is the new healthcare law .
Everyone wants to be healthy .
These same people , however , cannot agree on how this should be achieved .
Clearly healthcare in this country is broken and America is deeply divided on how to fix it .
Yet the bridge between the two sides is agreement that something must be done .
The blizzard of controversy over PPACA , however , hides the actual problem .
Healthcare Overhaul ?
By and large , U.S. healthcare can be summed up in one word : insurance .
It is intended to protect individuals and families against the possibility of a devastating financial loss .
Many believe this system is the only way to avoid bankruptcy and the trauma that accompanies an expensive medical bill they cannot afford to pay — in multiple lifetimes .
Yet , even with insurance , a serious illness can lead to financial ruin .
In 2008 , a hardworking , middle - class family of three in New Jersey learned this the hard way .
The daughter described the day her mother developed a headache as one that “ would change everything , ” according to The Star - Ledger .
It turned out that the woman had a brain aneurism .
In a matter of months , the family went from being a financially secure , two - income couple who owned their own house and had a daughter in college to being bankrupt and having a house in foreclosure .
The debilitating injury plunged the couple into $ 650,000 of debt — and this was after insurance !
Their daughter was forced to drop out of college a year from graduation to get a job and help pay bills .
Doing all he could to work two jobs and be there for his incapacitated spouse , the husband lamented , “ I wake up every day and hope I can make it through . ”
The mother , paralyzed and confined to a nursing home told the newspaper , “ I will miss my family . ”
The lives of this woman , her spouse , and daughter will never be the same .
Paying for such medical hardships has become the strategy in the battle to resolve the healthcare crisis with insurance as the weapon of choice .
The individual mandate of the PPACA , which requires the majority of Americans to have insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty , is seen by many as a game changer in the conflict .
The original idea of a mandate is said to be the invention of conservative economists .
It was proposed at the time to counter liberals ’ call for a single - payer healthcare system similar to the one in Canada .
The idea behind the mandate is twofold : ( 1 ) to discourage free - riders who do not carry health insurance coverage and therefore rely on the emergency room for medical treatment , which increases costs for those with coverage , and ( 2 ) to partially fund the new healthcare law .
The Washington Post summarized the debate over the legality of the individual mandate as follows : “ The legal question on the individual mandate centers on whether such a regulation is permissible under the Commerce Clause , which allows the federal government to regulate interstate activity .
Health reform opponents contend that the decision not to do something — namely , not buy health insurance — is economic inactivity , rather than activity , and therefore not a behavior the federal government can regulate .
Health reform supporters argue that the decision to not purchase health insurance has an economic effect . ”
PPACA attempts to take it one step further and increase access to what is called preventive care .
Preventive options include screening for all types of cancer , vitamin deficiencies in pregnant women , high cholesterol and blood pressure , sexually transmitted diseases , and obesity .
The law also has provisions to provide wellness programs as well as counsel for those who are depressed , obese or smoke cigarettes .
All of these services have their merits .
Doctors are trained to diagnose .
Yet there is a problem and it speaks to the heart of the healthcare crisis .
Even before PPACA was introduced , the medical industry has been largely focused on treating patients after they are sick .
Almost every preventive care option includes looking for a disease or malady .
Usually , if a condition is found , it is already too late .
If a doctor finds throat cancer — you already have throat cancer .
If results show you have chlamydia — you already have chlamydia .
If you find you have high cholesterol — you already have high cholesterol .
( Granted , these can all be found and more easily treated in early stages , but they can mostly be avoided altogether by maintaining a healthful lifestyle . )
Healthcare in America is predicated on the notion that the overall medical system is fine .
Yet even though healthcare went through a massive overhaul , all that really changed was access and affordability to current medical services .
This glaring inefficiency has nothing to do with Mr. Obama ’s healthcare plan ; it has always been this way .
For centuries , healthcare has really been sickcare — addressing health issues after symptoms have presented themselves .
Wrong Focus
Who is to blame for this sickcare mindset ?
Why does the system spring to life after a problem has surfaced ?
Some blame experts , going as far as to say that pharmaceutical companies want people to remain sick because that is how they make money .
In their minds , profit drives the medical industry to be reactive in its approach .
Others blame the general populace with claims that the average person only thinks about his health when he loses it .
They argue that people would rather focus on fixing a problem once it has occurred rather than taking the more challenging approach of preventing it in the first place .
What can not be debated is that modern medicine is more advanced than at any time in human history and America is at the forefront of the field .
According to SelectUSA , an advocacy group that promotes the U.S. as a premier location for business and investment , “ The United States is a world leader in healthcare services and an innovator in cutting edge diagnostics and treatments . ”
America ’s medical system does what it was designed to do : identify and treat illnesses after symptoms present themselves .
This thinking is not new .
The field of medicine has been treating already sick people for thousands of years .
The ancient Greeks , under the leadership of Hippocrates , ambiguously made the connection between sickness and “ natural causes . ”
Upon this discovery , disease was no longer seen exclusively as “ unpredictable and striking unsuspecting victims . ”
This discovery did lead to some improvements in health .
For example , in the 17th century , doctors found that simply washing their hands prior to assisting with childbirth largely prevented puerperal fever — a disease that took the lives of an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 mothers .
While most historians claim “ modern ” medicine started with the Greeks , the main framework for healthcare began millennia earlier in ancient Egypt .
In describing ancient Egypt ’s medical prowess , Homer wrote in The Odyssey : “ In Egypt , the men are more skilled in medicine than any of human kind . ”
Egyptian physicians , for example , had a remarkable understanding of human anatomy as evidenced by their skills in mummification .
Specialists for eyes , feet , intestines , etc. , abounded during this time , just as they do today .
Records also show these ancient doctors even prescribed potions and compounds as treatment for maladies .
Surgery was also commonplace through the use of knives , hooks , drills , forceps , pincers , scales , spoons and saws .
Archeologists have even discovered the relics of prosthetic limbs .
Encyclopaedia Britannica states , “ The search for information on ancient medicine leads naturally from the papyri of Egypt to Hebrew literature .
Though the Bible contains little on the medical practices of ancient Israel , it is a mine of information on social and personal hygiene .
The Jews were indeed pioneers in matters of public health . ”
In the Old Testament , many health laws cover sanitation , waste management , disease quarantine , food guidelines , and much more .
And while the Bible does not record much on specific medical practices , it does offer overarching guidelines on how to approach health .
One such basic principle is that of cause and effect .
The way of life outlined in the Bible is based upon this law .
This Book contains hundreds of principles , with each carrying the power of cause and effect for those who keep — or break — them !
Prevention Is Key
Many balk at the idea that the Bible contains principles for a successful life .
Yet think on cause and effect for a moment .
Failure to put gasoline in a vehicle can leave a driver stranded on the side of the road .
Failure to change the oil can result in a blown engine and an expensive repair .
The average person works to make sure they do not find themselves in either of these predicaments .
Oddly , this clear correlation seems to vanish when it comes to giving the body the fuel it needs to function properly .
People expect their bodies to keep running without the proper intake of water , vitamins and minerals — and seem at a loss why they are constantly sick .
This idea is apparent in the lingo associated with ill health .
How often have you heard others say they “ caught ” a flu bug ?
Were the “ victim ” of a stroke ?
Or have “ fallen ” ill ?
Such terms imply that suffering the illness was inevitable and that the sufferer had no choice .
Once sick , most people instinctively scurry to the doctor to diagnose and treat the condition .
But the effectiveness of pills and potions offered by those in modern medicine , limited as it may be , has blinded many to the benefits of being proactive in the prevention of illness .
They erroneously cling to the pre-Hippocratic belief that acquiring a disease is outside of their control .
Realize that physicians cannot heal .
Pills or treatments only synthetically enhance or suppress a natural bodily function in an attempt to speed the recovery process .
The artificial environment created in the body by these medicines , however , often leads to an extensive list of harmful side effects associated with a so - called “ cure . ”
This all comes back to cause and effect .
Most sickness is unnecessary .
If you participate in high - risk behaviors such as sexual promiscuity , illicit drug use , eating only junk food — the causes — you will be more prone to sexually transmitted diseases , HIV and obesity - related illnesses — the effects .
The opposite is also true .
If you eat nutritious foods and make sure to have appropriate balances of vitamins and minerals — the causes — you can avoid many unnecessary illnesses and overall have more energy and vibrancy — the effects .
A healthy human body is able to naturally fight off many viruses and bacteria .
If a person does contract an illness , a strong immune system will often mean the symptoms are very slight .
Benefits of a healthy diet include a reduction in the risk of stroke , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , certain cancers , and coronary artery disease .
These five maladies alone account for 74 percent of the total fatalities attributable to the U.S. ’s top 10 “ leading causes of death ” ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) .
While proper diet will not address 100 percent of all ailments , it is a core component of disease prevention .
It allows each individual to achieve true healthcare by dealing with the cause of illness not just the effects .
A proper understanding of cause and effect is the key to solving the healthcare crisis .
What Scriptures Reveal
A towering example of the effects of good diet can be found in the Old Testament .
The biblical text identifies Daniel as a young man “ skillful in all wisdom , and cunning in knowledge , and understanding science ” ( Dan. 1:4 ) .
As an Israelite , Daniel was no doubt trained on the effects of proper diet .
( A list of proper foods to eat can be found in Genesis 2:9 and Leviticus 11 . )
Daniel ’s background led to him being recruited and brought into the palace of the king of Babylon to be taught a new language and culture .
As a part of his immersion into this environment , Daniel was offered a diet referred to as the “ king ’s meat . ”
History shows the diet of royalty was typically heavy in meats and alcohol , with few vegetables .
( Note that gout , a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by a high - protein , high - fat diet , has long been referred to as “ the disease of kings . ” )
The context of the story implies this offer was an act of generosity , with the king thinking that Daniel would benefit from food typically available only to royalty .
Conscious of the impact this unbalanced diet would have on his health ( 1:8 ) , Daniel requested to be served only “ pulse ” ( food that was sown or vegetables ) and water for 10 days .
Daniel knew the benefits of eating natural food .
After the time expired , Daniel was seen to be in better health than those who ate the rich foods originally offered ( 1:15 ) .
The young man successfully implemented the knowledge he had been taught concerning nutrition and gave his body the “ raw materials ” needed to function at its peak .
Daniel properly made the clear connection between the cause of a good diet and the effect of good health .
The connection is no different today .
Those interested in truly resolving the healthcare dilemma must realize that implementing an entire system that is proactive — based in part on properly equipping the body to function — and not reactive — depending solely on medical science for a cure — is vital to solving the crisis once and for all .
This is the factor that has been woefully missing from the healthcare equation !

Right now , Twitter is the talk of the Web among marketers .
Use of the elegantly simple social - media site has rocketed unlike anything in recent memory — and it 's businesses that are leaping onto the Twitter bandwagon .
The New York Times calls Twitter " one of the fastest growing phenomena on the Internet . "
A recent study ( pdf ) determined that at least five million people are using the service and new members are signing up at a clip of 10,000 per day .
And unlike other " here today , gone tomorrow " services , Twitter seems to have staying power .
As companies tighten their ad spending , inexpensive social media is clearly the next marketing frontier .
As with any new craze , there are enormous opportunities — and large pitfalls that must be avoided .
For this article , I spoke to some marketing professionals who 've been exploring the Twitter terrain for a while .
My quest was to identify the Twitter landmines so you can fast - track your adventure into this vast new frontier .
But , first , a short story to convey the power of Twitter .
The Shot Seen Around the World
Remember the downed plane floating on the Hudson river ?
How could anyone forget the picture of people crowded on the wing as the plane gently floated in the frigid January waters .
Janis Krums was nearby as US Air flight 1549 fell from the sky that day .
Just moments after the crash , while onboard an approaching ferry , Janis snapped a picture with his iPhone and posted the following on Twitter :
There 's a plane in the Hudson .
I'm on the ferry going to pick up the people .
Crazy .
The few hundred people following Janis began spreading the word to their Twitter followers .
Janis could n't have imagined what was about to happen .
Within 30 minutes he was live on MSNBC and CNN .
Good Morning America invited him into its studio .
Then the BBC , 20 / 20 , ABC and Inside Edition followed .
The morning after the crash , his picture was on the front page of major newspapers across the planet and his email inbox had more than 4,000 emails .
A few days after the shot , he posted this comment on his blog , " To say that the last couple of days have been crazy / intense or what ever adjective you want to use is an understatement .
It was sheer madness for a while . "
Clearly Twitter can be a rapid catalyst for good news .
And now for the dark side of Twitter ...
Be Careful What You Say : The FedEx Story
" Everything you tweet is searchable on the web .
This can be good and bad .
Good if you 're strategically using key words for which you want to be found ; and bad if you are n't mindful that if you 're not nice , it can come back to bite you ! " said blogging expert Denise Wakeman .
And that bite came back hard recently for PR agency Ketchum .
An employee working for the firm landed in Memphis to deliver a presentation to more than 150 people at FedEx .
On arrival , he wrote the following on Twitter , " True confession , but I 'm in one of those towns where I scratch my head and say , ' I would die if I had to live here ! ' "
It just so happened that a FedEx staffer saw the message and forwarded it to numerous company executives .
FedEx drafted a response to the Ketchum employee .
The last line of the letter says it all , " True confession : many of my peers and I do n't see much relevance between your presentation this morning and the work we do . "
The story rapidly quickly spread across Twitter and the Internet .
This hard lesson is also a wake - up call for many businesses .
Twitter is a public communication medium .
Everything said is permanently etched in Twitter 's digital fabric .
" While Twitter can be effective as a marketing tool , if you are not careful , it can become a viral tool for negative press .
Anything typed in Twitter is ' ON THE RECORD , ' " said Steven Talbott , Sr. , vice - president of business development at Caveo Learning & Performance .
" Treat all your conversations like your grandmother was listening , " social - media consultant Josh Peters suggests ,
" Your company should be clear in its expectations on your employees ' Twitter communication , " added Kim Kobza , president of Neighborhood America .
Twitter Crack : Yes ,
It 's Addictive
With the slowing economy , people with a little time on their hands are finding Twitter a great discovery tool — and a great big addiction .
Marketing consultant Rickey Gold explained : " I spent way too much time exploring and tweeting .
I was becoming addicted to Twitter and not focusing on what I needed to do .
I got behind on client projects ; something I never do and something no business owner should ever do ! "
" One of the big hurdles when using Twitter is not to let it invade your life , " said international marketing expert Cindy King .
Ann Handley of MarketingProfs said , " It is a time - sink .
It 's easy to get sucked into spending too much time on it , because it definitely has an addictive quality . "
Here are some tips to ensure that Twitter does not consume you :
Do n't read it all : " You do not have to read every single tweet .
Twitter is a stream you dip into for a while , wade around , and then get back on the banks , " suggested social - media consultant Connie Reece .
Invest regular daily chunks of time : Many people allocate preplanned blocks of time to tweet and use tools like TweetLater.com to schedule broadcasts that can post automatically throughout the day .
Use Twitter during your non-productive time : Ann Handley explained : " I am often on Twitter while reading news , surfing blog posts , answering quick emails or doing other ' short attention ' work .
I 'm also on Twitter in waiting rooms , in traffic , waiting for a lunch date , or when I 'm someplace with nothing but my iPhone and time on my hands . "
Filter your Twitter traffic : TweetDeck allows you to set up groups and filter conversations .
For example , if you 're following hundreds or thousands of people , you can set up filter groups for people such as analysts , publishers , and influencers — and choose to look at their tweets at your leisure .
Trolls and Squatters
There are bad apples in every bunch .
Twitter is no exception .
Listen to the nightmare faced by Facebook guru Mari Smith .
" I 've had a troll stalking me for a while — wacky guy who ' brandjacked ' me with several fake Twitter accounts last summer .
He used my avatar and shadowed my every tweet , twisting the words with malicious intent , " said Mari .
" At the time this first began , I was horrified .
And I tweeted out to everyone that this was some creep attempting to rile me and that they should block him .
But then , I quickly realized this only added fuel to the fire — I was giving him the attention he wanted . "
Another challenge is folks ' claiming your name .
Believe it or not , there 's a rush to reserve major brand names on Twitter .
Buzz - marketing expert Paul Dunay has identified a list of brands that have been snatched up by squatters looking to sell them to the highest bidder .
If you 're not already on Twitter , it might be wise to reserve your name or brand .
Some Tips for Twitter Newbies
For businesses seeking to grow using Twitter , here are a few tips ...
" One of the first things you 'll notice is that no - one on Twitter wants to be ' sold to ' or ' marketed to . '
They are there to build relationships and you do n't build a relationship by being overly aggressive with your marketing efforts , " said Pam O'Neil , VP of marketing at Breaking Point .
Cindy King suggests thinking of Twitter like a great big cocktail party .
" Twitter friendships are just as limited as acquaintances you meet at a cocktail party .
You need to take the conversation to the next level . "
" Twitter is about engaging , connecting and building real relationships .
The businesses it works best for are the ones that have a deep understanding of the people they serve , " said Internet - marketing adviser Jenn Givler .

Hoping to buy his first home this year , Ralph Bustamante paid off his credit cards and cleared dings on his credit report to ensure that he ’d be able to get a loan .
Bustamante had hoped to pull his FICO scores , used by most lenders as a standard of creditworthiness , from the three major credit bureaus so he could negotiate the best possible mortgage rate .
Make that two credit bureaus .
One of the companies , Experian Group Ltd. , will stop selling FICO scores to individual consumers Saturday .
Instead , it will sell FICO scores only to commercial customers such as lenders .
That could put home buyers such as Bustamante at a disadvantage , consumer advocates say .
That ’s because a lender will have access to his Experian FICO score , but he wo n’t .

“ If the lender pulls the Experian number , it might end up being an unexpected deal breaker , ” said Bustamante , 28 , of Las Cruces , N.M.
“ And all my hard work would go to naught . ”
Experian Executive Vice President Peg Smith downplayed any disadvantage to consumers , saying Experian will still offer individual customers its own credit rating scoring system .
Most lenders , however , use the FICO scoring system developed by the Minneapolis - based Fair Isaac Corp. , which rates an individual ’s creditworthiness on a scale of 300 to 850 , noted Ken Lin , chief executive of Credit Karma , a free score - tracking service .
Experian clearly hopes to establish a rival to the famed FICO score , Lin said .

“ FICO is the branded , premium credit score , the Kleenex to the hundreds of other tissues , ” Lin said .
“ This is Experian getting a leg up on that . ”
Experian , which is based in Ireland and has U.S. headquarters in Costa Mesa , sells its own proprietary PLUS credit score .
It also sells a VantageScore ratings system that it developed with the other two credit bureaus , TransUnion and Equifax Inc .
Consumers are entitled to one free credit report each year from each of the credit bureaus at annualcreditreport.com .
This report includes such information as bank account balances and any late payments on credit card debts .
The FICO score costs extra .
It will remain available from both Equifax and TransUnion for $ 15.95 from the myFICO.com website .
Today is the last day all three scores can be bought at that site .

Most personal finance experts recommend having the FICO score , saying that information makes it easier to negotiate the best rate on a loan .
With loans harder to get , consumers need to match their financial data as closely as possible with the data being used by lenders , said Emily Peters , a personal finance expert for consumer website Credit.com .
Shon Dellinger , vice president of myFICO.com , said some people might apply for loans just to see their Experian FICO rating .
But he warned that doing so could lower their scores , since repeated requests for a credit report is considered one sign of shaky finances .
“ Consumers are strapped , so to remove a very valuable tool for them could n’t have come at a worse time , ” Dellinger said .

Stuart Reeves , a 60 - year - old biochemist from Cedar Rapids , Iowa , says he wants to know what each of the credit bureaus is saying about his creditworthiness .
“ Now I ’m bereft of a third of the terribly important information I need to make all my financial decisions , ” he said .

The latest ESRB list just hit the wires and it seems that SEGA has a few new games in store for PlayStation 3 fans .
Well , by new we mean new releases of classic games , all three of which have also happened to have already hit Xbox Live Arcade , but more content is always welcome .
Streets of Rage 2 , Golden Axe and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 are on their way to the PSN , sometime soon if things go as per they usually do ( ESRB ratings usually coincide with imminent releases ) .
It 's also worth noting that Sony does n't keep a predefined release schedule like Microsoft does for Xbox Live , so as soon as these games are ready and SEGA wants to release them , Sony will make them available to us .
In other words , we should expect these much sooner than later .
TOKYO , Feb. 4 ( UPI ) -- Japanese scientists say they have made the world 's first discovery of genes , in jigsaw - like pieces , taken from an archaean living in a hot spring .
The Keio University researchers led by Professor Akio Kanai said their findings are expected to lead to an explanation of the origin and evolution of genes since archaeans , unicellular organisms , are one of the earliest forms of life on Earth .

The researchers said they discovered combinations of 3 individual RNAs produced from separate genes can generate transfer RNA that are essential for decoding the genomic information during protein biosynthesis .
The scientists said they also discovered , through computational analysis and experimental verification , different tRNA genes are produced by various combinations of split tRNA .
" It is hard to believe that long functional genes existed from the early time of ancient life .
It may be possible that , as in the tRNA genes we 've found , long genes may have evolved from the combination of short genes through trial and error , " said graduate student Kosuke Fujishima , the first author of the research .
The scientists said their discovery represents a very rare phenomenon found in the deep - branching archaean and suggests that in ancient life , short genes could have been used in multiple combinations .
The study is reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science .
The influence of Futurism is evident in Fritz Lang 's 1926 cult film Metropolis
By Lawrence Pollard
BBC arts correspondent
It called for the demolition of museums and libraries , contempt for women and the glorification of war , " the world 's only hygiene " .
It promoted " the beautiful ideas which kill " and claimed that beauty exists only in struggle - so why is the art world celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Futurist Manifesto ?
10 FUTURIST VALUES
Love of danger Energy and fearlessness Courage , audacity and revolt Aggressive action Love of speed Splendour and generosity
The beauty of struggle
The glory of war Scorn for women Destruction of museums and libraries Because when it appeared , on 20 February 1909 , it was the first art manifesto of the 20th Century , paving the way for Vorticists , Surrealists , Dada-ists , and Situationists , as well as more recent cultural agitators like the Stuckists .
But first , the Futurists and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti .
A millionaire Italian poet with a passion for fast cars , he created an artistic movement out of nothing .
He sat down and created his " - ism " , Futurism , and then went about recruiting Futurist artists .
It was an early exercise in cultural branding .
Marinetti took over the front page of newspapers across Europe and had his manifesto printed - a sort of advertorial for speed , youth , newness and the destruction of the old order .
And he had set the template for the manifesto - shock tactics , declamation , bullet points , such as : " A racing car is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothace " , " Poetry must be a violent assault ... " and " We glorify War ... "
It had 11 bullet points because 11 was his favourite number .
Dr Roberta Cremoncini of London 's Estorick Collection of Italian
Art says Marinetti sounds a bit mad , but was serious .
" He was a self - publicist , but wanted to change Italian culture too , to update it and break in a very clear way with the past .
This is why the manifesto dictates burning museums , a cleansing war , to shake Italy . "
Manifestos multiply Within a few years , Italy and Europe were indeed shaken , by world war .
And that inevitably colours our view of Marinetti's invocation of conflict , according to art critic William Feaver .
" Futurism came at a very good moment for getting excited about the 20th Century .
Bang at the beginning , just avoiding the start of the war .
The manifesto was about publicity , he published to become famous .
And they became famous . "
Futurist Luigi Russolo with his art of noise machine .
" Noise triumphs and reigns supreme over the sensibilities of men , " he declared in 1913 .

And soon everyone wanted a manifesto , to shout their claim to be new , to be best .
The British Vorticists published BLAST in 1914 - again , unfortunate timing - with a 10 - point manifesto beginning " Beyond Action and Reaction we would establish ourselves " and going on to register disapproval of the London suburb of Putney and approval of hairdressers .
Two years later , the Dada manifesto was recited by Hugo Ball at a cabaret in Zurich , and then rewritten in 1918 by Tristan Tzara who summed up manifesto writing succinctly : " To put out a manifesto you must want A B C and fulminate against 1 2 3 . "
The year 1930 saw the Concrete Art manifesto ( " Art is Universal " ) , the Manifesto of Mural Painting followed in 1933 , and let 's not forget Andre Breton 's two Surrealist Manifestos , from 1924 ( " Surrealism will usher you into death " ) and 1929 ( " Run down the street pistol in hand , firing blindly as fast as you can , into the crowd . " )
We could go on , through the White manifesto of 1946 , the Spatialist manifesto of 1952 , offerings from the Situationists ( 1960 ) Chelsea Hotel ( 1962 ) Fluxus ( 1963 ) SCUM ( 1967 ) Body Art ( 1975 ) Cheap Art ( 1984 ) and many many more - but let 's get up to date with the Stuckist Manifesto .
' Stuck , stuck , stuck '
To protest against what they saw as the dominance of conceptual art and the Young British Artists , at the expense of figurative painting , Billy Childish and Charles Thomson unleashed the Stuckist Manifesto in 1999 , taking their name from Tracey Emin 's reported criticism that their figurative work was " Stuck !
Stuck !
Stuck ! "
A single woman in London is never more than 6 " away from the nearest rat , by Charles Thomson
It s a 20 - point manifesto , " against conceptualism , hedonism and the cult of the ego artist . "
" Art that has to be a gallery to be art , is n't art , " it proclaimed .
" Stuckism is anti-ism . "
So why a manifesto ?
" You can put across in a very simple and striking way , your basic beliefs , " says Mr Thomson .
" It s a bit like poetry .
It compresses feelings and thoughts in a memorable form .
You have to strike a chord with supporters , and make those who dont agree with you as angry as possible .
We managed that quite well , especially with the statement , ' Artists who dont paint are n't artists . ' "
Where Marinetti had to buy space in newspapers , the Stuckists have spread with the internet .
There are now 187 groups in 45 countries , the latest being the Tehran Stuckists , but it 's not like joining a cult , says Mr Thomson .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" We encourage people to write their own version of the manifesto , If you want to be a Stuckist you have to do it yourself , and the only way to leave is to throw yourself out of your own group .
Which they sometimes do . "
And what was the future for the father of the art manifesto , Marinetti ?
He spent the rest of his life writing hundreds of futurist manifestos , on painting , film , music , noise , women , men 's clothing , lust , the future reconstruction of the universe and even food , where he called for the abolition of pasta .
Futurism was overtaken by the future , ended up identifying with Fascism and died with Marinetti in 1944 .
But the manifestos were great .
Here is a selection of your comments : Manifesto of Unitary Tribalism A .
We believe that the basic rights of man are achieved only through the balance of individual and perceived group points of view .
B . Therefore , mankind collectively lives to the optimum potential only when microcosm ( individual , familial , tribal ) requirements are fulfilled as macrocosm ( state , national , and international ) requirements are simultaneously fulfilled .
C. In accordance , the respect of individual liberty , including what others might view as taboo , deviate , or immoral views and practices must be treated with the utmost respect as the greater societal needs are being administered so long as these taboos , deviate behavior , and immoral views are not violent or infringe upon universally agreed upon principles .
1 . We oppose the decay of individual liberty at the expense of the " greater good " ; however , we simultaenously oppose the decay of the bonding of macrocosmic societal constructs at the expense of excessive and immoral individual liberty .
2 . We oppose the disruption of balance between the unlimited growth of individual liberty and the unlimited expansion of relations between macrocosmic human constructs .
3 . As it becomes clear that the expansion of either individual liberty OR global brotherhood becomes threatened , it becomes necessary to resist this threat through peaceful means .
André Balthazar , New York City , NY , USA 1 .
Art can not exist solely in one 's mind or in a vacuum ( the same thing ) .
2 . If it does n't communicate on some level , it 's not art .
3 . Burning a painting produces ashes , not art .
4 . Process is art in music and dance .
5 . Product is art in painting , printing and sculpture .
6 . A piece of work may shock but if that 's all it does , it 's not art .
7 . If I can't show it to my children and grandchildren , it 's history , not art .
Howie , Kensington , USA
Art without aesthetics is just noise .
Aesthetics without expression is commercial .
Art for the sake of individualism is easy .
Art for the sake of innovation is backwards .
Rabindra Hayashi , San Francisco , United States 1 .
The spoken word eventually progresses toward silence .
2 . Art is a repression of man 's liberty and must be obscured .
3 . Art has no rivals only enemies .
4 . Complex reality has no order but is composed of chance , unconscious and internal impulses and spontaneity .
5 . Art revels in shifting focus , is intentionally negative , ephemeral , illogical and inconclusive .
6 . Art is not a protest but an avocation of protest .
7 . Art already exists therefore is .
8 . Reality is the process of becoming therefore will never be .
9 . Art analysis is a dangerous illness .
10 . Disrupted syntax , if undetected may lead to onomatopoeia .
Tom Henvey , Hog Jaw , Arkansas USA Manifestism A . We believe the manifesto is the most succint way to express our artistic endeavors .
B . Therefore , manifestos are also great ways to express our other endeavors .
C. We shall thusly strive to incorporate the use of manifestos , the action of which we proclaim to be manifestism , in our daily lives .
1 . We oppose disorganization unless it is an entrpic means to a new form of order .
2 . We therefore oppose disorganized thoughts and disorganized action .
3 . We also oppose limits to our efforts to organize and manifest ans shall stop at nothing to profess our love for manifestism .
Example Manifesism Manifesto : A. I like apples .
B. I shall therefore retrieve some from the grocery store .
C. Posessing apples will make me happy .
1 . I oppose the limitation of access to apples .
2 . I oppose paying for apples .
3 . I oppose the efforts by the Man to prevent me from having apples and will endeavor in the face of tyranny to posess them by whatever means neccessary .
Steve Dombrowski , Seattle , Washington , USA THE GENERATION X NOSTALGIC MEDIA MANIFESTO : 1 . Morality shall be secular , not religious .
2 . Television should be a cultural storyteller .
Modern American television , for one , fails as the U.S. 's cultural storyteller .
Instead of building our culture by projecting its highest possibilities , duties and zeniths , American television deliberately presents the pathologies and nadirs .
We reject this .
3 . Digital technology is best - used for storage and duplication .
Analog technology is better for inspiration , imagination and creation .
Music , for one , should always be created and recorded using analog technology .
The sounds can then be stored , duplicated and disseminated using digital technology .
To reverse the two is creatively disastrous .
4 . The Campbellian hero's journey of the Generation X - er is to remember , honor , archive , preserve the analog era and to reboot and restimulate today 's creatively stagnant digital era using its archives .
5 . Gratuitous nudity and profanity blunt the culture .
Out of a concern for imagination rather than for morality , such excess must be immediately curbed back .
6 . Culture evolves in cycles .
We have reached the limit of amoral culture .
It is natural and acceptable that a contraction must occur , in order to purify and restimulate the soil of the culture , and prepare it for another cycle of expanse and amorality .
7 . Any organization , ethos or individual that attempts to oppose the natural cyclic order of matters is doomed and will fail .
8 . Any organization , ethos or individual aware of and adhering to the natural cyclic order of matters is destined for at least some success .
9 . The Generation X - er will overtake the Baby Boomers as the next masters of cultural destiny .
We will accomplish this by using nostalgia to reboot the culture .
10 .
The Sixties and Seventies were far better than the times of today , and an amalgamation of both decades , bedizened with space imagery and Sixties " space " iconography , will dominate and define the ethos of the approaching new culture .
Heather Ferreira , New York , USA Become the art you wish to see in the world .
I call for the elevation of kitsch and the worship of false idols with a grain of truth inside .
Your list of 25 random things is not random at all .
What are the 1000 things you left out ?
They 're no more random - unless EVERYTHING is random , and if that were the case , * nothing * would be predictable .
Predictability is a tool of science , but it 's the proof of order .
Can there be order without mind ?
discuss amongst yourselves .
Alana Guy Dill , Alameda , CA , USA Kandinskij said : " The form is the outer expression of the inner content .
One should not make a deity of form .
And one should fight for the form only insofar as it can serve as a means of expression of the inner resonance .
Ultimately one should not seek salvation in one form . "
Contemporary art seem to have forgotten this .
In Art product does n't matter .
Only the human value of the artist and his struggle do .
Beatrice , Rome , Italy
If your art cannot communicate without a long verbal explanation , then surely you have failed in your art .
It 's about expressing what can not be expressed with words .
Good luck with your verbal props .

These self - styled " artists " amuse the rest of us .
The defining necessity for a " manifesto " is power , and this is just what these effete individuals lack , and resent the lack of .
ART ( capitalised for effect ) is whatever the viewer perceives to be art , whether it fits into a dogmatic notion of art or not .
Visit an art museum and see what the public stands in front of .
That 's art .

Maybe you do n’t realize this , but DEVO is awesome .
They always have been and always will be .
I will continue to hammer this point home every as often as possible until you bow before their might .
To kick off this effort , I want to draw your attention to their amazing performance of Jocko Homo that was performed on Saturday Night Live on October 14 , 1978 .
Fred Willard was the host , but Devo stole the show .
I really like how they use the original intro from the Jocko Homo music video , it works really well .
Watching this the first time was electrifying .
It is apocalyptic , artsy and punk rock all at the same time .
The pre-recorded intro , the jumpsuits , the stripping , the mechanical choreography all just help to add an air of other - worldliness to their music .
Do n’t take my word for it , watch it for yourself .
Watch Online ( video keeps getting removed everywhere and is not embeddable )
“ Jocko Homo ” was original released as the B - side to Devo ’s first single , “ Mongoloid . ”
This was released in 1977 on Devo ’s own record label , Booji Boy Records .
It would later get a release in the United Kingdom on Stiff Records .
The song is famous for its call - and - response , “ Are we not men ? ” / “ We are Devo ! ” This is based on a chant from the 1932 cult classic , Island of Lost Souls .
When Devo recorded their first studio album Q : Are We Not Men ?
A : We Are Devo! on Warner Bros .
Records in 1978 , the song was re-recorded for inclusion .
While the song did n’t chart in the United States , the original version peaked at No. 62 on the UK Singles Chart .

Music may be the analgesic of the art world .
A recent study done at Glasgow Caledonian University found that people who were listening to their favourite music felt less pain and could stand pain for a longer period .
Pain researcher Laura Mitchell has measured how people respond to pain with various forms of distractions , including relaxing music , listening to humorous audio tapes , doing math puzzles and looking at art .
As she told CBC's Q cultural affairs show , music is the stimulus that most seems to keep people 's minds off the pain .
" Favourite music has come out consistently , even to an extent that 's really surprised me in designing these studies , as being extremely effective in how people can tolerate the pain and in actually reducing how much pain they feel , " Mitchell said .
But not just any music — it 's not the relaxing jazz playing in the dentist 's office or the classical piped into the clinic waiting room that does people good , but their own personal favourite .
" I 've done this now with about … 400 people and there does n't seem to be anything in common between the pieces that they bring , " Mitchell said .
" I 've had Smashing Pumpkins to Kylie Minogue to Destiny 's Child right through pop , old - fashioned rock right to techno - dance music that most people would find actually quite painful themselves . "
In January , Mitchell published a study in the journal Psychology of Aesthetics , Creativity , and the Arts , showing the significant effects of music on pain .
She used a test that involves asking people to dunk their hand , up to the wrist , in frigid water , and keep it there as long as they can stand it .
The test is only done on healthy people and there is an upper limit on the amount of time they keep their hand in the cold bath .
" We were looking to see whether music would have an effect on people 's tolerance of pain — to how long they could tolerate some kind of painful stimulus and also whether it would reduce the actual feeling , their actual pain perception for them and whether it would reduce the anxiety of human pain and whether it would help them feel a bit of control over pain they 're going through , " she said .
People reported their ability to distract themselves from pain more than doubled if they were listening to their favourite music , while their perception of the amount of pain they felt fell significantly .
Mitchell , who 's been studying art and pain management for eight years , believes it 's the emotional associations of music that lessen human perception of pain .
" It 's the distraction of music that you love and you have a relationship with .
And you 're so emotionally tied to it , you 're so emotionally engaged , that it can actually take the pain away , " she said .
One of her studies compared the effects of music to the effects of looking at a favourite work of art — test subjects were invited to choose a painting to look at from among 15 of the world 's most popular artworks .
The art helped , when compared to looking at a blank wall , but listening to music was far more effective , she said .
Mitchell believes her research will make a difference in many medical situations — for example in dealing with chronic pain or for people facing painful medical tests .
" We want to give clinicians and health care professionals a means to make it more comfortable for patients .
To take their minds off the scariness of being in hospital and the noise and people rushing about that can make you feel worse , " she said .
Pain management has only recently been given the importance it deserves , Mitchell said .
" It 's something that really , just in the last five years , become really really important , " she said .
" In Europe now about one in five people suffer from chronic pain and they have it on average for seven years and two - thirds of them feel their medication just is n't enough to really give them the relief that they need . "

I know there are a lot of phobias out there , but this one is so unreasonable that there is n't even a name for it .
Watch as this woman makes a fool of herself when she 's surprised by a man covered in cotton balls .
Ooh , scary !
Developers trying to benefit from the success of others on the App Store is nothing new .
The most common method thus far has been to use the names of some of the more popular apps in the description of a different app , so when an individual searches for the more popular app , the seedy developer 's application comes up as well .
To date , Apple has n't done anything about this tactic .
Chances are that if you have browsed the iTunes Store or watched prime time television , you have at least seen the popular eBook reader Classics at least in passing .
Apple has featured it in one of its iPhone application advertisements and the UI has drawn some critical acclaim from end users .
As a result , the application has been doing well ; well enough that it has essentially been copied , right down to its images .
Brought to our attention by a reader , we bring you Classics : Jane Austen by Diego Dominguez Ferrera of Ubiklabs .
The application is a collection of ebooks by Jane Austen bundled together in a $ 2.99 package .
Look familiar ?
It should , as the visual styling is very similar to Classics as seen in these two screenshots :
The visual styles are too similar to be coincidence .
Let 's take a look at the wood rendering side by side without any of the books or shelves , torn from the .ipa of each application :
See the difference ?
We do n't either .
That 's because they are exactly the same ; the files only differ in their size because the ripoff has been compressed a bit more than the original .
Mr. Ferrera might deny it 's the same image and perhaps even claim they were both pulled from the same royalty free service ( we were unable to contact Ferrera , so we are merely speculating about his answers to these questions ) .
However , the file name for this and other files are mirrored from Classics , which seems to point to a direct rip .
UPDATE : The developers of Classics contacted Ars to clarify that all of the art , including the bookshelf , UI , book spines , and more were created specifically for Classics by designer David Lanham .
This does n't end with graphics either ; the all out copying extends to the page flip sounds and even the app 's feature list .
Even the bio snippet of Jane Austen in the app's description was lifted word - for - word from the Wikipedia entry on the author .
Needless to say , the copied version of the app is only trying to benefit from the success of the original , which the developers of Classics have told Ars was done without their permission .
" The guy stole our art , our lines , even our name , and I think it 's obvious he 's trying to piggy back on our success , riding on top of our stolen assets , " Phill Ryu told Ars .
" We feel violated , and we 're a little worried this will continue happening as more apps flood the store . "
While the question of why someone would do this is pretty easily answered , how did this application get past Apple 's review process ?
We suppose there are probably multiple people reviewing applications , and that one might have not been familiar with another application — there are thousands of them — but Apple featured Classics in one of its commercials and in the iTunes Store itself .
So far , Apple has n't responded to inquiries into the situation .
One thing is for sure : Apple needs to figure out some sort of solution , because incidents like this make the App Store look a bit like amateur hour .
UPDATE 2 : Since publishing the Classics : Jane Austin application has been removed from the iTunes Store , but it is unclear as to who is responsible at this time .
The developer , however , still has several other applications available that according to a Classics developer make use of stolen graphics .
Phill Ryu has told us that as of this time he has no plans to pursue legal action as long as the graphics and sounds are taken from the offending applications .
One lucky writer over at OXM got his hands on a working Warthog -- yes , of Halo fame -- and he was good enough to snap some pics for us , even though we suspect that he 's actually rubbing 'em in our faces .
Because seriously , this is one helluva ride .
And seriously , we 're like totally jealous .
Based on a Nissan Patrol 4x4 truck platform and built for Peter Jackson 's abandoned Halo film , this is not a prop -- rather , its a fully working beast .
The six - cylinder , diesel , automatic bad boy sports full four - wheel drive , a custom chassis , and for the lucky driver they do have a set or two of United Nations Space Command Marine armor available .
This vehicle is currently billeted in New Zealand , so if you 're in the area stop in and ask for a ride .
What could it hurt ?
And tell 'em Engadget sent you .

With annual economic output running at £ 1,400bn , 20 pc would equate to £ 280 bn .
However , it has since emerged that the Treasury is preparing to ring - fence about £ 400bn of " toxic " bank debt – or 29 pc of GDP – to draw a line under the financial crisis .
Royal Bank of Scotland is said to want to use the scheme for £ 200 bn alone .
Peanut execs wo n't say if they eat their own products David Edwards
Published : Wednesday February 11 , 2009
Print This Email This Peanut Co. owner urged shipping tainted products Executives for Peanut Corporation of America refused to testify before a Congressional panel today .
Rep. Greg Walden , R - Oregon , asked owner Stewart Parnell if he would be willing to eat his own products .
" This container is full of products that less than a month ago , people were consuming thinking it was fine to eat , " asked Walden while holding up a container of Peanut Corporation products .
" And one of the things I 'm going to do today is ask Mr. Parnell from Peanut Corporation of America if he'd like to open this and sample some of the products that he did n't think were a problem to send out to the rest of us to eat . "
Parnell refused to testify , invoking his right not to incriminate himself .
The Congressional Panel also reviewed emails showing Parnell urged workers to ship peanut products even after test results indicated salmonella contamination .
The emails suggested that Parnell was more concerned about sales revenue .
" The company e-mails obtained by a House committee show Peanut Corp. of America owner Stewart Parnell ordered the shipments tainted with the bacteria because he was worried about lost sales , " the AP reports .

Transporter 3 makes me want to buy an Audi December 21 , 2008
Cor , what a movie !
Sure , it probably wo n’t win an Oscar , but it ’s full of action scenes and definitely is a mans movie .
Such a great flick .
I ’ve been watching a lot of movies lately , i’ve seen Zack And Miri Make A Porno , which is pretty funny in places , terribly rude , but a good watch , although not Seth Rogen ’s best .
I watched Lakeview Terrace the other day , which is surprisingly remarkable .
I wo n’t give away what happens but its worth a watch .
Another film i’ve seen recently is The Day The Earth Stood Still , which , despite some good acting from Keanu Reeves , who deserves a big movie every once in a while , nothing much happened and it was quite disappointing in that respect .
Anyway , it ’s almost christmas again !
Merry Christmas Everyone and a Happy New Year !

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
A suicide car bombing in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul killed four American soldiers and an interpreter Monday , the U.S. military said .
The military said three soldiers were killed when the bomb exploded near their vehicle .
Another soldier died later of wounds .
An interpreter injured in the strike died later as well .
Violence has been dropping in Iraq , but the Mosul area remains one of the more volatile regions because of ethnic tensions and the presence of the al Qaeda in Iraq militant group .
Twenty - two American military personnel have been killed in the war this year , 14 of them in nonhostile circumstances .
The number of troops to die in the nearly 6 - year - old war stands at 4,242 .

Federal officials have released a tidal wave of fresh recalls in the past 24 hours as they connect the dots in the supply chain of tainted peanut - related products .
The latest recalls by 25 companies listing dozens of items include Walgreen 's chocolate candy with peanuts , Best Brands peanut butter cookie dough and Hain Celestial 's frozen pad Thai dinners , including one made for Trader Joe's .
On Saturday , Harry and David of Medford joined the recall , pulling Olympia Delight Trail Mix products , and Berkeley , Ca. - based Clif Bar and Co. pulled eight more of its protein bars .
The recall has reached a fever pitch since it was expanded to include all products - from roasted peanuts to peanut butter -- from Peanut Corporation of America 's plant at Blakely , Ga. , where Food and Drug Administration investigators found two strains of salmonella and evidence that on 12 occasions in 2007 and 2008 the company sold food even after it had tested positive for salmonella .
In a startling revelation on Saturday , the Atlanta Journal Constitution said the president of Peanut Corp. , Stewart Parnell , serves on an industry advisory board that helps the U.S. Department of Agriculture set quality standards for peanuts .
Parnell has expressed dismay at the outbreak , saying his Lynchburg , Va. - based company is cooperating fully with federal investigators .
Although Peanut Corp. sold items to about 77 companies in the U.S. , many of them in turn resold shipments , reaching about 1,000 distributors and manufacturers all together .
As the drumbeat of recalls continues , health departments across the country have confirmed new cases of salmonella poisoning .
More than 530 people have been sickened , with nearly 30 new cases popping up in the past week .
In Oregon , 11 people have been sickened , with about half of those cases in January .
The deaths of eight people - all over 59 - are linked to the outbreak .

One team has made tiny transistors -- the building block of computer processors -- a fraction of the size of those used on advanced silicon chips .
Another has made a film material capable of storing data from 250 DVDs onto a surface the size of a coin .
Both advances , published on Thursday in the journal Science , use nanotechnology -- the design and manipulation of materials thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair .
Nanotechnology has been hailed as a way to make strong , lightweight materials , better cosmetics and even tastier food .
“ We have demonstrated that we can make important technologies that are significantly smaller than existing devices , ” Jeremy Levy of the University of Pittsburgh said in a statement .
Levy ’s team created its nanotech transistors using two ceramic crystal materials known as lanthanum aluminate and strontium titanate .
When sandwiched together , these natural insulators conduct electricity as a positive charge is passed across them .
Using the tip of an atomic force microscope , Levy ’s team applied voltage to etch a tiny conducting wire between the two materials , which can later be erased by reversing the charge , much like a child ’s Etch A Sketch drawing toy .
“ The transistor we made is arguably the smallest one that has ever been produced in a deterministic and reliable fashion .
And we did it using an instrument that can be miniaturized down to the size of a wristwatch , ” Levy said in an e-mail .
He said the same materials can be used to make atom - sized transistors for computers , memory devices and sensors .
“ In terms of simplicity , it ’s striking , ” Alexander Bratkovsky , a scientist for Hewlett - Packard Co who is familiar with the work , said in a statement .
THIN FILM
Meanwhile , a team from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the University of California Berkeley said they had found a faster , more efficient way of making a thin semiconductor film that they think could dramatically improve data storage .
Many teams have tried to use polymers to create sheets of semiconductor films but the material often lost its structure when spread over large surfaces .
To overcome this , the team lead by Thomas Russell of the University of Massachusetts heated sapphire crystals to create a specific pattern of ridges on the surface .
This served as a guide for the semiconductor film .
“ We applied a simple concept to solve several problems at once , and it really worked out , ” Russell said in a statement .
He said the technology could make nearly perfect arrays of semiconductor material that are about 15 times denser than anything achieved previously .
“ With the densities we describe you could store 250 DVDs on a surface the size of a quarter , ” Russell said in an e-mail .
Seeking escape
In March 2007 , the BBC broadcast in the UK a three - part documentary called The Trap[i ] , by the controversial British film maker , Adam Curtis .
Its message was that " a simplistic model of human beings as self - seeking , almost robotic , creatures " plus an overriding belief in human selfishness have created " a cage " for human beings in modern society .
The documentary argued that this predicament is in part the result of a long process by which social and personal values have become dominated by reductionist thinking .
The Trap was pessimistic in tone and did not offer any clear solution .
The question it left open , which this paper addresses , is whether it is possible to reverse this process by establishing a basis for values that would not be reductionistic , and that would offer a way out of the present trap .
Reductionism and human identity
The root of the problem is that our picture of human beings has been gradually reshaped by the dominance of one particular mode of thinking — reductionism — as a means of generating knowledge .
What this has caused us to believe and value about ourselves in turn shapes how we behave towards each other .
If our picture is somehow inadequate or incomplete , our behaviour will also fall short of its natural potential and serious social and other problems may develop .
This can easily happen without our noticing it and is not easy to detect or correct .
Reductionism is essentially the procedure of reducing things to their component parts .
The idea of taking things apart as a means of finding out more about them has been an extremely powerful way of building scientific knowledge .
Early scientists began by looking at easily visible internal structures , and then developed instruments such as microscopes for looking at parts at smaller and smaller size scales .
This led to the modern theory of the atom , and beyond that to sub-atomic physics , and to the paradoxes of the quantum realm .
What we lost sight of in the process is that knowing what things are made of does not necessarily help us to value them appropriately .
The basic assumption of reductionism is that a thing really is simply the sum of its parts .
Each part is made of something smaller , right down to the basic building blocks of material reality , the sub-atomic particles .
In this view , everything is a material construct .
The properties of multi-particle things are seen as outcomes of system interactions , and thanks to computer simulations we now know these can be surprising and unpredictable .
The features that appear as things get more elaborate are referred to as " emergent " properties of complex systems .
We see everyday objects around us that have internal structure and are built up from smaller parts , and this does apparently explain how their properties arise .
This can be seen very clearly with simple machines .
If we take a bicycle apart we are left with a collection of mechanical components and we can see exactly how they come together to form the bicycle .
The fact that this approach works so well with machines made it easy to think that it could be applied to living organisms without raising any new issues .
Simple reductionism sees the properties of the whole as fully determined by properties observed in the parts when separate .
Complex systems theory refines that by saying that although the parts of complex systems determine emergent behaviors , these new properties must be studied at a higher level .
In both cases , parts are seen as primal and causal , reflecting a bias that the parts somehow exist first and then come together to form the whole .
If we ask how a living system is different from a bicycle , a somewhat deeper answer is that the parts are themselves altered by the dynamic interaction among the parts in a way that does not happen in a bicycle .
When the parts are in the living system they are literally different than when they are not — we call the latter state " dead . "
This answer is still framed in terms of parts , in keeping with the general thrust of scientific explanation .
But it suggests a holistic reality in which parts and wholes are interdependent , so that in biological systems the whole can dynamically reshape the parts .
An analogy would be the creative activity of engineering design , in which the parts are shaped as a means of accomplishing the concept of the whole .
Nevertheless , in reductionist biology the explanatory arrow goes from parts to wholes .
Biological organisms clearly have complex internal structure , and do consist of parts , although these parts are bound together in a much more intimate way than the parts of a bicycle , as anyone who has attempted a dissection will know .
Dissection — and sometimes vivisection — of living creatures enabled the knowledge base of biology to be built up , leading eventually to molecular biology , in which the operative parts are not bones , muscles , and nerves but the far smaller nucleic acids , proteins , and enzymes .
It was quickly obvious that the internal structure of human beings is very similar to that of animals , so similar that we often talk colloquially about " the human animal . "
This similarity , and the effectiveness of reductionism , led to the modernist understanding of a human being .
We asked ourselves , what is a human being ?
And we answered by saying , human beings are advanced animals .
And what are animals ?
They are systems of life processes .
And what are these life processes ?
Well , they are dynamic systems of atoms and molecules .
And so , in a few simple steps we reduced our idea of a human being to a set of material , atomic , phenomena .
The largely unseen problem is that when we apply reductionism to living creatures , and most significantly to human beings , we inadvertently perform not one but two reductions .
The obvious one is that we reduce the living creature to its material components .
The other , overlooked one is that we also reduce our appreciation of its qualities as a living being .
In place of an appreciation of distinctive human qualities we are left with a perception of material qualities only .
We have reduced our understanding of human beings to the same level as our understanding of material things .
There are several qualities of being human that are devalued or even lost when this happens .
As humans , we are self - aware , able to choose , and the holistic experience of being human is our unique existential identity .
These qualities cannot be found in the parts that make up a human , or in material constructs such as bicycles , but can only be appreciated from the standpoint of actually being human .
To be able to put appropriate value on these qualities , we must use the holistic experience of being human as our frame of reference and basis of analysis .
Instead , our modernist belief in the power of reductionism to develop knowledge led us to think that the successive steps of the reductionist definition are a disclosure of the truth about being human .
We consequently came to regard the material aspect of human beings as more real or more fundamental , and therefore more important and more valuable than other qualities .
But the more we see ourselves as material constructs , the more we will begin to treat each other as if this is what we value most about each other .
There are many signs that this has happened , and has become one of the distinguishing marks of modernity .
We say that nothing other than materiality exists , and that this is self - evidently true .
We deny non-material aspects of ourselves , dissociating ourselves from our own nature .
We no longer see uniquely human qualities because we do not take them seriously any more .
We do not treat them as real in themselves , or as representing primary value ; we say that they only exist as a by - product of material processes .
And as we become dead to various human qualities in ourselves , and in others , our society begins to be less and less accommodating to certain aspects of being human .
This is the predicament described in The Trap .
We are living in a predominantly modernist culture that admires material and mechanistic qualities more than human ones .
It places great value on the qualities of machines — their speed , precision and efficiency — and we often see these as better than human attributes .
In many contexts we aspire to be as much like machines as possible , and sometimes we actually wish to be machines , devising robotic implants and dreaming that we will be able to upload our consciousness to silicon and defy death .
The shift to this outlook has been gradual , and largely without our noticing we have ceased to appreciate fully what it is to be human , so much so that this assertion itself may seem questionable , in spite of our uneasy awareness that it does carry some kind of meaning that we cannot quite pin down .
The changes , these reductions in the way we see ourselves , have crept up on us gradually .
We did not see them coming and we do not notice how they alter the way we see the world and how we behave towards each other .
But we do see that there are social problems we do not know how to fix , and perhaps we sense that the full depth of experiencing life has somehow been diminished .
Reductionism and the problem of the whole
Reductionism has not only had an unintended social impact , but it also limits our ability to find solutions to the problem of technological impact on the natural environment .
It also helped create this problem in the first place .
The effectiveness of reductionism in generating practical knowledge enabled us to develop advanced technologies , which have been a major force behind the exponential growth of industrialization and the spread of modernity .
We used our knowledge almost exclusively to create disrelated instances of applied technology , such as consumer products and infrastructure projects , which we put into the world without any special thought for their impact on the whole context , the larger natural and social environment .
For most of the industrial period the larger environmental context was simply not an issue .
When industrialization began , it was a small development in a vast world that was patterned in ways far beyond human influence or understanding .
We simply took for granted the pre-existing structures and processes that organized the world .
Even as we poured technology into the world , we thought the pattern of the whole would simply take care of itself .
This was true up to a point , while the scale of industrial activity compared to the rest of the world remained small , but from sometime in the 1970s onwards the relentless growth of the industrial economy began to overtake the scale of the biosphere itself .
After the 1970s , according to the World Wildlife Fund , we began to consume renewable natural resources faster than the global capacity to regenerate them .
Having reached this vast scale , the total collection of technologies that had been deployed began to disrupt the pre-existing pattern of the whole .
The problem with reductionism is that it generates knowledge capable of disrupting the whole , but this knowledge does not work the other way to help us to bring order to the whole .
As a way of thinking , it is biased towards the parts rather than the whole .
This gives us detailed knowledge of the parts , but little insight into how we might fix the disruption that is caused by the bias in our focus .
To address the " problem of the whole " we need find a way of appreciating the value of wholes as wholes .
Until we can rebalance the value we put on the whole versus the parts we will not be able to heal the pathology caused by the entire system of human socio- technical organization — the disruption of the whole .
Reductionism and sustainability
These two problems , our picture of human beings as material constructs , and the pathology of the whole , come together as a problem of sustainability .
Disruption to the pattern of the whole is a direct threat to the sustainability of present - day human society .
This means reductionist thinking is a key underlying source of unsustainability in the world today .
This link between reductionism and sustainability should not be surprising .
There is a connection between our understanding of what it is to be human and our ability to sustain our lives .
If there is a distortion in our picture of ourselves , our sense of our needs will also be distorted , and this will affect our ability to sustain ourselves .
This happens through the way we make choices to meet our needs .
One of the attributes of being human is our ability to choose .
Most of us , most of the time , choose to sustain our lives , to keep them going .
If our lives are in danger , we will do our best to save ourselves .
On a day - to - day basis we choose to sustain ourselves by making sure our needs are met .
Our ability to do this of course depends on our being able to accurately identify and value our various needs .
Because in the modernist worldview we consider the material or physical level of description to be the most real , we value our needs at this level more highly than our needs at other levels .
Since we naturally make the most effort to meet the needs we value most , we then tend to neglect or ignore the remaining needs .
If we consistently and systematically fail to meet our full range of needs as human beings we are indirectly threatening our ability to sustain ourselves .
This unsustainability may not be obvious immediately , because it mostly involves our non-material needs , whereas a lack of basic material needs causes obvious problems faster .
Nevertheless our shift from a holistic appreciation of human needs to a reduced appreciation is an underlying cause of the wider problem of systemic unsustainability .
An antidote to reductionism
Is there an antidote to our bias towards valuing the parts more highly than the whole ?
How can we restore our sense of the qualities of the whole , and bring ourselves back to a fuller appreciation of what it is to be human ?
Is there an alternative to reductionist thinking that would achieve this ?
Suppose we throw the sequence of reduction into reverse .
Instead of working down the sequence of levels of description and ending up with material parts as the answer to our questions about the whole , we could work our way upwards towards the whole , integrating into our understanding of the whole the properties we find at each level , and crucially , giving equal value to each of the levels .
To demonstrate this approach we could take the human being as the paradigm , not least because it has more levels of qualitative reduction than any other whole system we know .
We would first set out and describe each of the levels of reduction .
We would then see various human qualities revealed at each level .
Our aim would be to achieve the sustainability of the whole , and to heal the pathology of the whole , and we have seen how that depends on valuing all our needs equally .
We would therefore look for the needs we have at each level when our reality or our identity is considered at that level .
This procedure would result in several groups of needs that are qualitatively distinct .
We would then bring these sets of needs together into an integrated whole picture , giving equal value to each set .
This process would put all the steps of the reduction back together and build back up to a much more fully described sense of what it means to be human .
The result would be a holistic sense of being human , with a balanced sense of all the needs we as humans value being able to meet .
This integrated picture would provide a holistic sense of human value .
Human needs and the levels of reduction
Here is how this process would look in practice .
We start by setting out the steps of the reductionist description of a human being :
( Level 0 ) The starting point : we experience ourselves as human beings .
We ask : what is a human being ?
( Level - 1 ) We answer by saying : human beings are advanced animals .
We ask next : what are animals ?
( Level - 2 ) We answer by saying : animals are systems of life processes .
We ask next : what are life processes ?
( Level - 3 ) We answer by saying : they are dynamic systems of atoms and molecules .
This gives us four levels of description , starting at the top level with the whole human being , and ending at the bottom level with material components .
Next , we build back up from the lowest level , observing the human qualities and needs that exist at each level in turn .
At the third most reduced level ( - 3 above ) , we see the human being as an assembly of atoms .
At this level our corresponding needs are defined as ones met at this level , by assemblies of atoms and material constructs .
These include basic material requirements such as tools , clothes , and infrastructure for functions such as transport and shelter .
At this level of human identity the highest meaning of things arises from their relation to our physical needs .
At the second most reduced level ( - 2 above ) , we see the human being as a set of systems of life processes .
At this level our corresponding needs are defined as ones met at this level , by systems of life processes .
These include a viable biosphere to provide ongoing life support , and food composed of complex organic compounds .
At this level of human identity the highest meaning of things arises from their relation to our biological needs .
At the first most reduced level ( - 1 above ) , we see the human as being essentially an advanced animal .
At this level our corresponding needs are defined as ones met at this level , as common to animals .
These include social contact , social organization , social reciprocity , membership of family groups , and emotional relationships .
At this level of human identity the highest meaning of things arises from their relation to our social needs .
At the non-reduced or whole level , ( 0 ) above , we see the human being as uniquely itself , unlike anything else we can compare it with .
At this level our corresponding needs are defined as ones met at this level , and unique to humans .
Our uniquely human qualities and attributes include reflexive awareness , abstract knowledge , and the potential for impartial judgment .
Our needs include education and justice , intellectual development , and aesthetic satisfaction .
At this level of human identity the highest meaning of things arises from their relation to our uniquely human needs , what might be called our " cultural " or " civilisational " needs .
We can go further and add one level beyond or " above " our experience as human beings .
We could call this level ( +1 ) .
This level relates to a question about our ultimate identity , about the meaning of being human .
We are not able to answer this question definitively , since we cannot fathom the source of our own identity .
But perhaps the best answer available to us is that we appear to be creative beings who develop an innate and open - ended individual potentiality and who therefore need to be free or unconstrained in this by other human beings .
Our needs at this level are therefore for freedom of self - realization and self - actualization , in free response to the mystery of creation .
At this level we might say , although it is hard to pin down an exact definition of the word , that the highest meaning of everything in human experience arises from its relation to our " spiritual " needs .
This ( +1 ) is not a level of reduction , since it cannot be found when reducing the system we are dealing with to a description of its parts .
Rather than being a reduction , it is at a level of integration higher than the whole we are examining , which is why it is referred to as " plus 1 . "
However paradoxical this may be , it is important to include it because it acknowledges something further about human beings .
We are not only aware of ourselves as wholes with unique attributes , but we are also ( at least from time to time ) aware that there is something about us that goes beyond our everyday experience of life .
At the very least we are reminded of this because we are repeatedly haunted by questions about our own identity .
This ( +1 ) level provides a way to accommodate the idea of the " spiritual " and allow for religious needs , without attempting to precisely define it .
The listing of needs at each level given here is intended to be indicative or illustrative , not exhaustive .
Further exploration and questioning will no doubt clarify the general or common human needs at each level , and in addition there will be many specific needs existing in particular situations , locations and times .
Reintegrating a holistic valuation of human needs
If we now take all these groups of needs and bring them together , we can approximate a holistic [ ii ] picture of human needs .
Putting together just the needs listed above , the picture looks like this :
As human beings our needs include : material requirements such as tools , clothes , and infrastructure for functions such as transport and shelter ; a viable biosphere to provide ongoing life support , and food composed of complex organic compounds ; social contact , social organization , social reciprocity , membership of family groups , and emotional relationships ; education and justice , intellectual development , and aesthetic satisfaction ; and freedom of self - realization and self - actualization , in free response to the mystery of creation .
In bringing together this holistic picture we are no longer trying to define or value these needs in terms of each other .
In particular we are not trying to explain the higher ones in terms of the lower ones .
Our aim is not to explain , but to harmonize functioning wholes , which requires appreciation of the qualities of the functioning whole and the needs related to them .
This means developing the ability to perceive and value all the attributes .
The quality of being fully human will only be possible if all the qualities of being human are recognized , and the needs related to them are valued equally and fully met .
We now have the necessary starting point for achieving whole system sustainability , a procedure for identifying and valuing our full range of needs as human beings .
The next step is to consider how we might make use of this to meet those needs in the practical context of the world , bearing in mind that the existing pattern of the whole is increasingly disrupted , as described earlier .
A more precise definition of the disruption would be that the world as a whole is no longer able to self - regulate in a manner that will meet human needs indefinitely .
We are overshooting planetary limits , and the risk for us is that if we push the overshoot too far , the biospheric system may crash or instead self - regulate by sweeping us out of the picture – this is the " revenge of Gaia " scenario[ iii ] .
What we are looking for therefore is a process that enables human beings to relate to the whole system of the world in such a way that it can self - regulate and indefinitely meet ( or allow us to provide for ) human needs as it does so .
Toward a comprehensive design process for sustainability
As individual human beings , we look to our surroundings to meet many of our needs .
Our need for clean air is met by the functioning of the biosphere , while our need for human contact is met through our association with other human beings .
At an earlier stage of human history our needs were directly met through the natural functioning of the larger ecosystem in which we live , just as with animals living in their natural habitat .
As human societies developed , we created increasingly specialised economic and technological systems for meeting our needs — and the needs of some at the expense of others — and these operated inside and depended on the global set of natural ecosystems .
These human technology - based sub-systems , which could be classed as " ecostructures , " along with beavers ' dams and spiders ' webs[iv ] , were developed without special thought about the functioning of the natural global ecosystem , because , as already discussed , in the early stages of industrial growth this kind of thinking simply was n't necessary .
At our current stage , however , industry has grown to span the planet , and involves physical flows of material that are as large as the flows of material within the natural global ecosystem .
It is now essential that we do address the impact we have on the whole context within which we operate – the natural global ecosystem or what is technically termed the planetary biogeochemical system .
The " pathology of the whole " is a disturbance of the entire biosphere , as well as being the social issue described in The Trap .
Life of some kind will no doubt survive the present period despite our environmental depredations , but we as a species are far more fragile than life in general .
Our practical concern as human beings is that the planet remains habitable for us , and for the highly developed ecosystems that support us , and that something close to our current civilization can continue .
It is certainly not in our interest for the planetary eco-climatic conditions to break down .
If Gaia " strikes back " by moving beyond the range we can tolerate , we will be in serious trouble .
In principle , continuity should be possible , for several reasons .
One is that we can now make adequate material provision for everyone because our technological capability allows us to overcome the material scarcity that existed before .
Basic resources are still unequally accessible only because social belief and politics are lagging behind our actual capability .
The social and psychological work of overcoming our outdated and now dangerous belief in fundamental scarcity is one of the most important tasks of the present century .
The brunt of this task is now to master collectively the emotions of fear and greed that are fed by the belief in scarcity and that drive much dysfunctional political and corporate decision - making .
A second reason is that we now have a great deal of scientific knowledge about how the world works and how our own technological activities have an impact .
If we design ingeniously , it is entirely within our ability to configure our applied technologies to coexist respectfully with the natural processes of the biosphere .
To keep the planet habitable we must now aim not only for our own human well - being but also the well - being of the whole system of which we are a part .
This aim will mean finding ways of meeting our needs that are in line with three principles : first , that the meeting of any one need does not compromise the meeting of any other need ; second , that the meeting of any one person 's needs does not compromise the meeting of any other person 's needs ; and third ( implied by the first ) that the meeting of human needs in general does not compromise any of the attributes of the world — such as a functioning biosphere — that enable our needs to be met .
A further reason is that the world actually or potentially contains everything we need .
The reason we are able to meet our needs at all is because there are matching attributes in the world around us .
If we recognize our needs fully and place an equal value on meeting them all , we will be obliged to look after all the corresponding aspects of the world as a whole .
If we can avoid putting all our stress on one set of needs — as we have been doing — we should be able to develop processes for meeting our needs that will also bring the world into balance .
The steps in doing this are first that we develop a holistic sense of our own needs , and second that we design integrated systems that meet our needs and at the same time form part of the balance and functioning of the whole .
This is essentially how the natural ecosystem as a whole is already organized , so we could say that we are looking for an ecosystemic form of organization for human life within the planetary ecosystem .
By analogy with computer operating systems , we could think of this as an " ecosystemic operating system . "
Ecosystems in general are systems that meet the needs of their participants ( of whatever species ) through mutual interaction and reciprocity .
The first part of the word " ecosystem " is derived from the Greek word for household , oikos .
The idea behind the word is of a system whereby the household runs .
So , without going too far from its biological sense , we could think of the word " ecosystem " as representing a " home - locality needs - meeting system . "
The various human needs - meeting subsystems could then be thought of as subsidiary ecosystems within the natural global ecosystem .
Using the word " ecosystem " signifies that these systems can meet needs and also interact cooperatively with the overall global ecosystem .
The process of designing these ecosystems would start with an appraisal of human needs in a given location .
The same basic needs exist everywhere , but the specifics differ in each locality and community , and for each organization in meeting the needs of its members and those it serves .
Every group , community or organization applying this approach would need to carry out its own detailed needs inventory at its own scale of operation and at each need level ( as described earlier ) .
The process would consist of a subjective appraisal of needs by a group of participating co-designers .
It would need to be open and participatory , to ensure the input of everyone involved , both in terms of perspective and local knowledge .
Examples of comparable protocols would be participatory rural appraisal ( PRA ) , " consensus design " in architecture as developed by Christopher Day[v ] , and the emerging " science of qualities " being pioneered by the biologist Brian Goodwin[vi ] .
A locally - relevant needs - meeting system — a local ecosystem — would then be designed and developed for meeting each group of needs ( the rationale for a local focus is discussed below ) .
Material - level needs ( level - 3 ) would be met by an industrial ecosystem [ vii ] ; life - support needs ( level - 2 ) by a bio-agricultural ecosystem ; social needs ( level - 1 ) by a social reciprocity ecosystem ; and human - level needs ( level 0 ) by a human development ecosystem .
( The ability to pursue needs at the more elusive +1 level would be assured by constitutional freedom of individual religious and spiritual inquiry and practice , always operating within the criteria of non-interference with the meeting of other human needs . )
The design of each ecosystem would require expertise relevant to that need area .
Because of the diversity of knowledge required — including economics , engineering , ecology , agriculture , social science , governance and law — there would have to be a specialized ecosystem design team working at each need level .
The design of these ecosystems would use and synthesize the existing range of human knowledge .
They would mesh with each other so that the functioning of one ecosystem would not compromise the functioning of any other ( through an emphasis on design ingenuity rather than trade - off ) .
They would also mesh with the larger surrounding or adjacent ecosystems of each type .
And they would mesh with the local and larger - scale natural ecosystems by having features that would sustain and restore natural ecosystems rather than merely exploiting or degrading them .
Protocols such as The Natural Step , a Swedish sustainability method , would provide the design criteria for eco-compatibility .
The combination or meshing of the four types of ecosystem would be achieved by a design synthesis of industrial ecosystems , bio-agricultural ecosystems , social reciprocity ecosystems , and human development ecosystems , coming together into a general socio-economic and governance system that is itself nested in and compatible with local and global natural ecosystems .
These combined ecosystems could then be called " general ecosystems . "
General ecosystems would be defined as integrated systems that provide the essential needs of a human group , community or organization in a locally comprehensive , autonomously - directed , and ecologically sound way .
The focus on localness does not imply that everything would be restricted to local scale , merely that locally - scaled general ecosystems would be the basic building bricks or " cells " of the larger system .
The economy and society as a whole would be structured as a mosaic of these cellular sub-systems , which would be the primary units of organization .
These cells would be communities organized to meet the full range of human needs locally , not in a quest for self - sufficiency , but simply to ensure that all the needs are indeed met , an important distinction .
An element of self - sufficiency would be needed for this , but most cells would also specialize in activities or production that could be exported to other cells , while importing other specialized offerings­ — somewhat like the role of organs in the body .
Successful general ecosystem cells would not simply grow in size by " scaling " like growing businesses .
As cellular sub-systems they would spread by replication , not by gigantism , through independent re-creation of the entire ecosystemic cell .
If a particular general ecosystem design proved successful , other communities could reproduce it .
Expansion by whole system replication while keeping the cell size small would be vital to preserve the essential feature of the general ecosystem — its ability to meet the full range of human needs by organizing locally .
At larger size scales — eco-regional , national and supra-national — the society and economy would be a patchwork of similar and dissimilar but complementary ecosystemic cells linked by mutual trade .
Part of the rationale for the primacy of local scale is that a variety of factors and trends indicate that future economic and social relocalization might be both desirable and feasible .
This can be seen on a variety of fronts .
Socially , relatively small groups form the primary unit of structure .
For example , cross-cultural studies in sociology and anthropology indicate that the maximum size of a genuine social network such as a village is about 150 members , and is known as the " Rule of 150 " or Dunbar 's Number .
This number may be related to the average human ability to recognize people and keep track of emotional information about all members of a group .
Agriculturally , if basic foods are grown locally they are fresh and seasonal , with corresponding ecological and health benefits .
Industrially , in spite of the well - known economy of scale concept , recent thinking about flexible demand - led " lean " manufacturing leads to smaller plants close to consumers , rather than huge centralized plants at a distance .
Technological developments are also leaning in this direction , as production equipment becomes smaller and more flexible .
Various economies of scale still exist , but the viable scale of manufacturing is progressively reducing in size as technology advances .
In economics , the success of industrial clusters also emphasizes the value of local scale .
Politically too , the smooth functioning of democratic systems depends on the vitality of local political engagement .
The exact size or scale implied by " local " is suggested by these factors but not precisely defined .
A balance would need to be struck between a scale small enough for certain kinds of human interrelatedness , and large enough for certain activities to have a minimum viable size .
A working definition of local could be expressed in , say , numbers of people , geographic area , or travel time , but these factors all interrelate and change over time .
Historical analysis of human settlements shows that their average radius has been roughly equal to the distance that could be traveled in half an hour by the prevailing transport technology .
As transport speed has increased , so has the population size of towns and cities , so they no longer offer a good social definition of local .
Their ecological footprint has also vastly expanded .
This scale problem inspired the " new urbanism movement , " an urban planning initiative that designs village - like urban layouts clustered round rapid transit stations .
The concept of general ecosystems goes beyond this , potentially being something like a localized integration of village - like urban form , economically independent production clusters , closed - loop recycling , ecologically balanced food production , intimate social scale , and civic self - governance .
The ultimate benchmark for the scale of locally - focused socio- economic organization is the individual 's experience of how human needs are met .
Imagine a child growing up in a community organized as a general ecosystem .
Because the system would meet all the fundamental needs of the people in the community , the child would experience a high quality of life .
He or she would be able to see directly , as part of everyday experience , how the entire system worked and was operated by people belonging to the community .
Much of the child 's education would involve witnessing how all the important parts of the system were designed , created , interrelated and maintained .
This would be much more likely to foster a feeling of personal involvement and responsibility , ecological awareness , economic autonomy , local political self - determination , and give a comprehensive insight into the way the world works .
In these terms , local might be both justified and defined as whatever scale of general ecosystem allowed a child to have this kind of experience growing up .
In pre-industrial times , most children grew up on farms or in small towns and villages , where they would directly witness how things were made , how food was grown , how social order emerges among animals , and what distinguishes humans .
However , they may not have experienced a high level of social justice and mobility , or the freedom to develop themselves .
The modern era has made great headway toward these things , but at the cost for most people of any comprehensive sense of how the world as a whole works , and with a loss of any real sense of participation and responsibility .
Some form of general ecosystemic organization might therefore be the key characteristic of a future " trans - modern era " that would combine the benefits of modernity with a restored sense of direct personal participation and the security of belonging to a coherent community .
These speculative thoughts about general ecosystems are intended as an exploration of future possibilities rather than a prediction of the future .
Building on a way of revalidating the full range of human needs , the general ecosystem concept is a possible framework for organizing society to meet human needs in full .
In conclusion
We live in a world in which most needs of most people in most places are not fully met .
The forces of modernity that shaped our world have given us unrivalled power to meet human needs , yet the shortfall persists and the general situation becomes steadily more chaotic .
We try to solve our increasingly complex problems by throwing more money at them to deploy more physical resources .
Our over - emphasis on the physical often actually crowds out and reduces our ability to meet other needs .
Ever more money is soaked up and the problems remain .
Despite our vastly increased technological capabilities we have a growing " problem of the whole " that we do not know how to address .
Before the industrial era we did not have to worry about this .
The " pattern of the whole " was simply inherited from the historical past .
Social and economic relationships , and the relationship of humans to their natural environment , were not things that anyone consciously thought out .
The roots of these things had arisen in the immemorial past , and most people regarded them as God - given , along with nature itself .
In the modern period , scientific knowledge and technology expanded into the old unconsciously shaped world and progressively cut away its moorings .
We now urgently need to respond to the growing chaos of the whole with a consciously determined repatterning , but we have no obvious pattern to follow .
We have a greatly expanded view of human agency , and a repertoire of sophisticated and powerful tools .
But we lack an organizing pattern that combines our scientific knowledge with wisdom about our place in the whole .
In order to resolve this impasse , it is useful to heed the admonition attributed to Albert Einstein : " We can not solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them . "
The mode of thinking primarily responsible for creating our current predicament is the application of reductionism as a means of generating knowledge .
Although successful in many ways , it has had the unwanted effect of gradually reducing our picture of human beings , changing how we value ourselves and others .
The corrective response suggested here centers on a revaluation of human beings and a corresponding reintegration of human needs .
It builds on this to propose a simple but comprehensive pattern of organization that has the potential to provide a new fundamental framework for achieving socio-economic continuity and ecological sustainability .
The pattern of the whole for which we search is the same as the pattern of ourselves .
Once we recognize our needs fully and place an equal value on meeting them all , we will be obliged to look after all the corresponding aspects of the world as a whole , which actually or potentially contains everything we need .
The message of The Trap was that our reductionist model of human beings has created a cage for human beings in modern society .
Our release now depends on rediscovering a way to value the wholeness of being human and learning to apply it in our relationship with the world .

It would be more appropriate to refer to this as " holonocentric , " a word coined by systems theorist Richard Bawden , after Arthur Koestler 's concept of the " holon . "
Holons are systems nested within larger systems .
Each holon is both a whole and a part of a whole .
Holistic implies " whole centred " whereas " holonocentric " implies " centred on wholes that are part of larger wholes , " which is more apt .

A few weeks ago , Chris Dillow warned of some of the nasty social side - effects of the recession .
He noted that “ the main effect of recession is not to cause poverty , but insecurity .
And when people are insecure and anxious , they care less for others . ”
In short , fear makes us all more selfish .
On one level , what ’s transpired in Immingham over the last few days has been the opposite of that stark prediction .
The unofficial walk - out by employees at an oil refinery – protesting their company ’s decision to employ foreign labour – was an act of solidarity , not selfishness .
Whilst many fear their own jobs are at risk in the future ( at the moment , who is n’t afraid of that ? ) , this protest was n’t driven by self - interest , but by concern for the skilled workers who could ’ve been spared a winter of unemployment if the company had decided to ‘ buy British ’ .
In the current instability , it might ’ve been more sensible to keep their heads down and grumble in private , but they felt strongly enough to withdraw their labour , and their actions resonated so much that they were joined by workers from other sites , swelling the number of protesters to over 800 .
In this sense , the bonds of class solidarity remain as strong as they were at the height of the trade union movement .
But at another , much darker level , what this incident shows is the extent to which the recession is fostering nationalism & division .
Whilst Baroness Vadera expressed optimism about the ‘ green shoots ‘ of recovery , in Immingham and towns right across the country , the only ‘ green shoots ’ are of a resentment which is increasingly being trained on foreign workers .
Outside the refinery , one protester used a mantra uttered by both nationalists and one Labour Prime Minister : “ British jobs for British workers ” .
It ’s not as if they were loved in the past , but now is not a good time to be an economic migrant .
With elections around the corner , this climate of anxiety , decay and resentment is the perfect breeding ground for new recruits to the BNP .
This time around , their line of attack will be more compelling than ever : “ they ’ve given all your money to rich bankers , they ’ve sold all the jobs to foreigners and what do you get in return ?
Months stewing in James Purnell ’s new Job Centres .
Vote for us and we ’ll put YOU first ” .
This time around , those who ’re tirelessly trying to stem the BNP ’s advance will find it especially tough ; when mainstream politics carries such a the stench of failure , just what are we meant to say to them ?
So I do n’t begrudge Lindsey Oil Refinery for awarding a contract to a foreign company , I do n’t begrudge the employees for protesting against the use of foreign labour and I do n’t begrudge the Italians for going where the work is .
No , right now the only people whose actions I begrude are swanning around some souped - up ski resort in Switzerland .
I begrudge the complacency , the colossal mistakes , and the effect that those mistakes are having on the society the rest of us have to live in .
Ultimately , Dillow was right , and I ’ve never wished for anyone to be more wrong .
The Nintendo DSi is on the horizon , but the millions and millions of original DS and DS Lite owners may be asking themselves whether picking up a new version of their favorite portable is necessary .
The DSi is not just an excuse for Nintendo to make a quick buck ; it 's loaded with new features .
If these five new fun additions do n't have you trading in your old portable at GameStop , nothing will .
1. Music !
The DSi has a pretty snazzy audio player and recorder that has some bells and whistles your MP3 player probably does n't .
You can alter the pitch and speed ( the latter of which makes lengthy podcasts a bit speedier ) , as well as add a bunch of neat effects like echoes , reverse play , instrumental only , and 8 - bit tunes .
You have n't heard " Any Way You Want It " until it 's sounded like an NES game .
And if you want to just listen to music , the DSi's good for that too .
If you 're listening to music when you close the DSi , it 'll keep playing as long as you 've got headphones attached .
2. Photos !
If you 've ever messed around with the iPhoto program on a Macbook , you 'll probably dig what Nintendo 's doing with the DSi's dual cameras .
You can stretch a photo , much like Mario 's face in Super Mario 64 , as well as play with a bunch of cool picture modes like color mode , wherein you take a black and white picture and reveal colors by tapping on different parts of the pic .
Mischief mode adds things like moustaches and glasses to your picture .
Merge allows you to morph two different headshots , while frames lets you create custom image templates .
One bizarre one was someone else 's head with the eyes cut out so we could insert our own peepers !
Creepy .
And if you 've got a weird pic to send to a nearby friend , you can do it over local wireless !
3. Downloads !
With Wi-Fi and a dedicated memory slot , Nintendo is finally allowing the DSi to enter the wonderful world of downloadable games .
We got to try three tiny but tremendous downloadable games that will hopefully head stateside .
Puro was based off an old Wario Ware microgame .
In Puro , you control a small bird who has to eat falling beans before they hit the ground .
Speaking of Wario Ware , that series had its own DSiWare iteration , wherein you have to strike wacky poses .
And finally , there 's Decode , which is bar none the best math game ever .
All you have to do is switch and flip numbers ( for example , a 2 into a 5 ) until you line up a bunch that add up to ten .
It 's more difficult -- and fun -- than you 'd think .
Yeah !
A very good new !
Anyway .. what IS rekonq ??
Rekonq is a ( hopefully ) lightweight KDE browser based on Webkit .
Its code was initially based on Nokia QtDemoBrowser , just like Arora .
Anyway its implementation is going to embrace KDE technologies to have a full - featured KDE web browser .
Ah , ok .
So it ’s a browser .
And you ’re actually porting code to KDE ..
Yes !
I started changing ‘ Q ’ with ‘ K ’ ( not so far from truth ; ) ) and I ’m doing one release a month to let see changes and features coming .
For now rekonq ..
shares konqueror bookmarks
steals icons from KDE project 🙂
seems a browser ( read , has a lot of bugs )
Of course , I ’m having a lot of fun playing with it .
And now that it is at least acceptable , I ’m starting to talk about it .
In case you have 5 minutes and you are really free , you can try it downloading code tarball from kde - apps or taking a look at the code from gitorious .
Have fun !

So I guess it 's inauguration day today , which means that right now as you read this President Bush is probably frantically running from room to room of the White House , panicked that he accidentally packed up and shipped his car keys to Texas .
There is also the possibility he is playing in a large cardboard box .
And that 's it for the Bush jokes folks .
I 've actually been pretty good about avoiding them I think , and I wo n't miss their tediousness in the world of political humor .
But there 's just something about the image of a grown man tumbling down a staircase in a cardboard box , smashing into portraits of better presidents , you know ?
And just as the sun sets on Bush - jokes , the sun starts to shine on jokes about insane Obama - fandom .
From the handsome and sturdy example on your right , to the 18 others I 've selected below , there 's a whole host of lunatic things lunatic - people have made to celebrate their love of Barack Obama .
Let 's cast a mature and not - at - all petty eye on some of it , shall we ?
Obama Clothespin Doll
This one 's actually pretty cute , and compared to some of the other obaminations to come , pretty true to form .
The limitations of the clothespin framing device do render the president as being pretty in need of a bathroom break though .

HONG KONG ( MarketWatch ) -- Singapore 's economy contracted at an annualized 16.4 % in the October - to - December quarter -- its sharpest pace of contraction in 33 years , according to revised figures released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry Thursday .
For the whole of 2008 , the economy grew 1.1 % , after expanding 7.8 % in the preceding year , the ministry said Thursday in the 169 - page Economic Survey of Singapore report .
The manufacturing sector declined 10.7 % in the fourth quarter year - over - year , while the services sector was down 1.3 % .
Initial estimates published in January were for a 16.9 % annualized contraction in the fourth quarter .
" It may be the country in Asia whose economy will contract the most this year , " said Dariusz Kowalczyk , chief investment strategist with SJS Seymour in Hong Kong .
Singapore 's main share Straits Times Index was down 0.2 % to 1,614.26 in midsession trade Thursday .
The share - measure is down 2.3 % during the past three months and off 47 % from its level a year earlier .
Singapore 's trade ministry forecasts the economy will shrink between 2 % to 5 % in 2009 .
A contraction at the upper end of estimates would outpace an expected 4 % decline in gross domestic product in Japan as the biggest among industrialized countries in Asia this year .
" Singapore 's GDP growth prospects appear weak in 2009 on account of the pessimistic global economic outlook , " the trade ministry said in the report .
The downturn is exacerbated by Singapore 's open economy and an industrial policy that sought to set manufacturing as a key pillar of the economy .
" The government of Singapore has tried to diversify their economy away from trade , " said Kowalczyk , noting the government has set out to promote the electronics , pharmaceutical and chemical sectors .
Still , the structure of Singapore 's economy would see it among the first to suffer on the downside , but be among the first to recover when global trade picks up , Kowalczyk said .
Credit Suisse forecast the ongoing slump could result in a massive exodus of foreign workers , leading to an overall drop in population of 160,000 this year .
Singapore 's population will shrink to 4.68 million , according to Credit Suisse estimates .
" The potential drop in employment and population would have far reaching implications for the economy , " Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a research note .
The broker advised investors to stay away from shares of property , banking and consumer companies .
SJS Seymour 's Kowalczyk said the residential and commercial real estate markets were particularly vulnerable as the recession deepens .
" Pretty much on all fronts except government spending , the economy will be facing severe headwinds , " Kowalczyk said .
To be “ philosophical ” about something , in common parlance , is to face it calmly , without irrational anxiety .
And the paradigm of a thing to be philosophical about is death .
Here Socrates is held to be the model .
Sentenced to die by an Athenian court on the charge of impiety , he serenely drank the fatal cup of hemlock .
Death , he told his friends , might be annihilation , in which case it is like a long , dreamless slumber ; or it might be a migration of the soul from one place to another .
Either way , it is nothing to be feared .
Cicero said that to philosophize is to learn how to die — a pithy statement , but a misleading one .
There is more to philosophizing than that .
Broadly speaking , philosophy has three concerns : how the world hangs together , how our beliefs can be justified , and how to live .
Arguably , learning how to die fits under the third of these .
If you wanted to get rhetorically elastic about it , you might even say that by learning how to die we learn how to live .
That thought is more or less the inspiration behind Simon Critchley ’s Book of Dead Philosophers ( Vintage , paper , $ 15.95 ) .
What defines bourgeois life in the West today is our pervasive dread of death — so claims Critchley , a philosophy professor at the New School in New York .
( He wrote this book , he tells us more than once , on a hill overlooking Los Angeles — which , because of “ its peculiar terror of annihilation , ” is “ surely a candidate city for the world capital of death . ” )
As long as we are afraid of death , Critchley thinks , we can not really be happy .
And one way to overcome this fear is by looking to the example of philosophers .
“ I want to defend the ideal of the philosophical death , ” Critchley writes .
So he takes us on a breezy and often entertaining tour through the history of philosophy , looking at how 190 or so philosophers from ancient times to the present lived and died .
Not all of the deaths recounted are as edifying as Socrates ’ .
Plato , for example , may have died of a lice infestation .
The Enlightenment thinker La Mettrie seemed to have expired after eating a quantity of truffle pâté .
Several deaths are precipitated by collisions : Montaigne ’s brother was killed by a tennis ball ; Rousseau died of cerebral bleeding , possibly as a result of being knocked down by a galloping Great Dane ; and Roland Barthes was blindsided by a dry- cleaning truck .
The American pragmatist John Dewey , who lived into his 90s , came to the most banal end of all : he broke his hip and then succumbed to pneumonia .
The government could be planning to up the ante when it comes to material it does n't approve of - it may become illegal to even look at images , not merely possess them .
Some odd , ambiguous remarks by Keir Starmer , Director of Public Prosecutions , raise this gruesome possibility .
Evidence for it emerged from an elliptical exchange between Starmer and Jenny Willott , Lib Dem MP for Cardiff Central during the committee stage of the Coroners and Justice Bill .
Miss Willott has clearly done her homework .
She noted that whilst the Internet Watch Foundation focuses on images that can be downloaded – the traditional web route – images accessed through other means , such as streaming , are not within its remit .
She asked Mr Starmer : " If someone is watching streaming images online , there would be no actual copy on their computer , so they would not technically be in possession . "
He replied : " It would be for the courts to interpret the meaning of possession .
We would proceed on the basis that there should be no such loophole . "
Mr Starmer ’s reply can be interpreted in two ways : streaming is not a loophole , either because the government is not interested in going after it ; or because they intend – or hope – that in time the courts will extend the definition of " possession " to the simple act of watching something unfold on a screen .
We asked the Crown Prosecution Service to expand on this statement , but they were equally Delphic in their pronouncements .
A spokesman said : " The Director has given an answer to the committee …
We are not in a position to expand upon it .
" It is clear from the fuller exchange that the Director is saying that he does n’t think that there is a loophole , and we would proceed on that basis . "
So there you have it .
Or possibly not .
Mr Starmer ducked other questions raised by the Committee .
Conservative MP
Henry Bellingham raised the fear expressed by many fans of cartoon art that the Bill had been drawn too widely and could catch material that was wholly innocent .
This is the fear raised by , amongst others , the Comic Book Alliance , who point out that at the consultation stage for this law , no significant producers of legitimate comic book material were consulted : the government appear to have proceeded on the basis that adult cartoons were at best pornographic , at worst abusive , and to have ignored any input from those involved with the subject .
Mr Starmer expressed the view that there will be no issues in respect of artistic works , because , he argued , this law will be aligned very closely with the existing law relating to indecent images of children .
Still one more class - action lawsuit is claiming that the iPhone not only fails to live up to 3G speeds , but that it also prematurely develops hairline cracks in its outer casing .
Texas residents Alyce R. Payne , William French , Karen Michaels , and Lorna Harris filed the lengthy 23 - page complaint in an Eastern Texas court yesterday on their own behalf as well as all customers who are not satisfied with their iPhone 3G purchase , claiming that Apple has committed breaches of contract and warranty , violating Texas business and commerce codes , and other infractions .
The suit is the second to be filed this week ( among many others over the past several months ) claiming the iPhone 3G performs poorly when connected via 3G because it " demand (s ) too much power from the 3G bandwidths . "
The plaintiffs also blame AT&T 's infrastructure and name the exclusive carrier of the Apple - built smartphone as a co-defendant , claiming AT&T 's system can't cope with the " overwhelming 3G signal " of the sheer number of iPhones sold .
They cite an Associated Press article on tests by Swedish engineering weekly Ny Teknik that concluded some handsets are n't sensitive enough to 3G signals and boost their signals to compensate , creating the network conflict .
Subsequent tests , however , showed no hardware issue and instead suggested it was a network congestion issue .
Unusually , the suit cites as proof of poor 3G performance the August 2008 ruling in the United Kingdom requiring Apple to stop advertising the iPhone 's ability to access " all parts of the Internet . "
However , that ruling did not consider 3G speeds , dealing instead with the iPhone 's lack of Java and Flash support .
Nonetheless , the UK court 's decision is cited as an example of the iPhone not functioning properly " on the 3G network . "
A Wired blog post is also part of the plaintiffs ' evidence , quoting AT&T spokesman Brad Mays as saying iPhones were " performing great " even at the height of reported slowdowns and connection drops .
However , besides these typical claims , the suit is rare in alleging faulty manufacturing of the exterior plastic case .
" The iPhones have had well - known and documented issues regarding the premature ' wear - and - tear ' of the iPhones ' housing , " the complaint says , " including the formation of hairline cracks in the iPhones ' casing . "
Although these issues were n't an issue with the original iPhone , which came with an aluminum backing , the iPhone 3G comes with a black or white hard plastic back that , just after launch , had triggered multiple complaints of stress around key points of the handsets .
According to the lawsuit , cracks form " around the camera , near the volume rocker , " and in other areas reported by users .
The company is believed to have knowingly shipped phones with the flaw even after it became an apparent problem .
The suit spends several pages reproducing anonymous comments from Apple 's forums and various other websites to show when the complaints first surfaced .
" I should 've stuck to my old iPhone , the one with the aluminum back that probably wont crack , " an Engadget reader comments .
" I 've never doubted the build quality of Apple products before but now I 'm beginning to question it heavily . "
Moreover , hardware defects are n't the only problems mentioned in the complaint .
The plaintiffs list a raft of problems caused by the iPhone 2.0 software update and the subsequent 2.1 update , which they claim did not fix the original problems of " crashes , ' bricked ' handsets , slower applications , a lag in the virtual keyboard , internet connection issues , and spotty call reception . "
And while Apple itself positioned iPhone 2.1 as a fix for these key problems , the individuals filing the suit point to reports where many of the problems either were n't immediately fixed or had even " gotten worse " after the update .
i Phone 2.2 has since appeared .
One of AppleInsider 's own August 2008 reports is also presented as evidence that Apple was aware it had released a tarnished product .
A personal email to a customer from Apple chief executive Steve Jobs acknowledged a bug and that a fix was enroute .
Col Nagl , an Iraq veteran who helped devise the successful strategy there under the aegis of Gen David Petraeus , told The Daily Telegraph that the gains made by the Taliban over the past two years need to be reversed by the end of the traditional fighting season in Afghanistan , around late September or early October , or else the Taliban will establish a durable base that would make a sustained Western military presence futile .

Level 3 of Consciousness
You are reading about something that most people do n’t even know exists .
If you told them , they would n’t just not believe you — they would have no clue what you were talking about .
That ’s why I wrote this little essay : so that I could show it to someone when they had no idea what I was talking about and , if they were persistent and open - minded , make some progress in their thinking .
And meanwhile I could get on with my other projects .
1 . In the beginning , there was attraction .
Things attract each other because they like to be closer to some things than other things .
This is the root of all change in the whole universe .
Sometimes like attracts like and sometimes opposite attracts opposite .
When opposites attract , you ’ve got a pair , a couple .
That pair is now another unit and you can start the whole process over again .
The pair , the new unit , can attract an opposite or a like or just drift along .
When like attracts like , it can end there , like an oxygen molecule made up of two oxygen atoms , or it can continue to attract like , like a Carbon atom .
When things continue to attract like , something big gets created .
2. Sometimes a thing will attract just the right stuff to it that the new stuff turns into another copy of the thing .
That is self - replication .
Self - replication is the most powerful force in the universe .
One becomes two , two become four , four become eight , and soon the universe is full of things .
Sometimes a self - replicating thing makes a copy of itself with a mistake in it .
The thing with a mistake will either be better , worse , or the same at making copies of itself .
If it ’s better , there will soon be more copies of the new thing than the old thing in the universe .
The only way for new things to get created is by a complex series of mistakes that turn out to be better after all .
3 . We are self - replicating things .
We are the result of a billion years worth of mistakes that turned out to be better after all .
4 . One big mistake that turned out to be better after all was that , of all the animals , we alone can communicate complicated ideas .
We can tell stories .
We can share recipes .
We can make complicated plans .
Even dolphins and whales can’t do these things , we think .
5 . These ideas that we communicate are called memes .
Memes are a kind of thing .
Memes live in our minds .
6 . Like all things , memes fit better with some things than others .
Some memes naturally fit better in people ’s minds .
Some memes naturally fit better with other memes .
When a group of memes fit well together and pull the strings of someone ’s mouth and vocal cords so that they pass them on to others , a new , self - replicating thing gets created .
The new thing is called a memeplex .
Self - replication is the most powerful force in the universe .
One person tells two , two tell four , four tell eight , and pretty soon the whole universe is full of people sharing the memeplex .
Sometimes a self - replicating memeplex makes a mistake in copying itself .
The memeplex with a mistake in it will either be better , worse , or the same at making copies of itself .
If it ’s better soon there will be more copies of the new memeplex than the old in the universe .
The only way for a new idea to gain acceptance is by a series of copying mistakes that turn out to be better after all .
7 . All our belief systems , religions , and governments are the result of a series of mistakes that turned out to be better at making copies of themselves after all .
8 . Every new idea we think of immediately becomes transformed by copying mistakes that change it into something that is better at making copies of itself after all .
A key part of the idea may be sacrificed to something better for copying .
The only control we have over the spread of our ideas is in making them as resistant to copying mistakes as possible .
9 . When we are born , our mind is courted by meme after meme after meme , all the result of thousands of years of practice at getting themselves copied into fresh new minds .
This is Level 1 .
We have our instincts , born of millions of years of the genes our body carries striving to make copies of themselves .
Soon our minds become filled with memes and eventually we may develop a map of life that mostly makes sense .
We speak a language that we believe expresses anything we want to say .
We use geometric and physical concepts that we believe explain anything we encounter .
We know stories and myths that we believe relate to all of life ’s trials and tribulations .
This is Level 2 .
We have our roadmap , born of thousands of years of the memes our mind carries striving to make copies of themselves .
10 . Each of us has a purpose here .
When the memes are quiet , it is possible to feel when we are on purpose and when we are off purpose .
11 . Once we realize that there are millions of memes battling inside our mind , there arises the possibility of influencing the outcome of that battle .
Until we realize it , there is no possibility .
The battle can be influenced in three ways .
First , by noticing the memes .
Second , by detaching from them .
Third , by obtaining clarity of purpose .
When these three steps are achieved , we can begin to select our memes consciously .
We select memes that keep us on purpose .
This is Level 3 .
12 . A purpose is not a goal .
A purpose does not feel like guilt , shame , or vengeance .
Guilt , shame , and vengeance are emotions used by memes to gain mastery over your life .
By choosing memes consciously , we can eliminate the control that memes have over those emotions .
A purpose feels fulfilling , satisfying , joyful , and powerful .
13 . A purpose has to do with other people .
A purpose is fulfilled by spreading memes .
Every time we speak , write , create , or act we are spreading memes .
To fulfill our purpose we must be conscious of which memes we are spreading .
Life is largely composed of conversations .
Conversations are composed of memes .
In Level 1 we are unaware of this .
In Level 2 we see the world as a solid , understandable body to be interacted with .
In Level 3 we see the world as a canvas to be painted , an instrument to be played , or a block of marble to be sculpted by us for our purpose .
We choose to do this for good or for evil .
If we choose good , good is returned to us in unexpected ways .
If we choose evil , evil is returned .
Either way , it looks like the way we choose is the way of the world .
14 . In Level 1 , we do not understand the world and consequently fear it .
In Level 2 , we replace the fear with understanding .
The price of understanding is limits .
Our approximate models of the universe are never completely accurate , never useful in all situations .
In Level 3 , we start with a vision of what we want to create .
From there we choose our models .
Sometimes a chosen model may seem insane to the other inhabitants of the little patch of space - time we happen to occupy .
No matter .
Men with a vision of goodwill have often looked insane in times of mistrust and scarcity .
But in Level 3 , we realize that the universe is not a maze to be navigated ; it is a baby to be brought up .
When we give it love , clarity , and opportunity , we raise a child to be a joyful , giving , successful adult .
This is the opportunity we have to farm our little patch of space - time .

Ann Coulter 's latest appearance on Matt Lauer to promote a book she wrote ( something about liberals being traitors / baby killers etc ) was quite worrying to watch .
The gaunt blond screeched , fidgeted and blathered all over the place while looking distinctly like a heroin addict itching for a fix .
Is Ann Coulter having a break down ?
Perhaps the decades of venemous bile stored deep in her psyche is finally manifesting itself in a serious psychological disorder .
I do n't know whether to hate her or feel sorry for her - decide for yourself :

The National Labor Council 's investigation into the working conditions at the Meitai keyboard factory in Dongguan City is just ghastly , a stinging indictment of the South China economic miracle .
The workers are underpaid , cheated out of their wages , forced into overtime , subjected to brainwashing , and subjected to unsafe working conditions and denied medical assistance when they 're injured .
Meitai makes keyboards for Lenovo , Microsoft , HP and others .
Big Brother Is Watching

In the other feature article in this issue , we looked back at last year , examining the drug policy high and lows .
Here , we look forward , and not surprisingly , see some of the same issues .
With a prohibitionist drug policy firmly entrenched , many issues are perennial -- and will remain issues until they are resolved .
gazing into the future of drug policy reform ' 09 ( picture from wikimedia.org )
Of course , America 's drug war does not end at our borders , so while there is much attention paid to domestic drug policy issues , our drug policies also have an important impact on our foreign policy .
In fact , Afghanistan , which is arguably our most serious foreign policy crisis , is inextricably intertwined with our drug wars , while our drug policies in this hemisphere are also engendering crisis on our southern border and alienation and loss of influence in South America .
Medical Marijuana in the States
In November , Michigan voters made it the 13th medical marijuana state and the first in the Midwest .
Now , nearly a quarter of the US population resides in medical marijuana states , and it is likely that number will increase this year .
Legislative efforts are underway in Kansas , Illinois , Minnesota , New Jersey , and New York , among others , and chances are one or more of them will join the club this year .
Interest in medical marijuana is also emerging in some unlikely places , such as Idaho , where one legislator has vowed to introduce a bill this year , and South Dakota , where activists who were defeated at the polls in 2006 are trying to get a bill in the legislature this month .
California 's Grand Experiment with Medical Marijuana
As with so many other things , when it comes to medical marijuana , California is a different world .
With its broadly written law allowing virtually anyone with $ 150 for a doctor 's visit to seek certification as a a registered medical marijuana patient , and with its thriving system of co-ops , collectives , and dispensaries , the Golden State has created a situation of very low risk for consumers and significant protections even for growers and sellers .
With tax revenue streams from the dispensaries now pouring into the state 's cash - starved coffers , medical marijuana is also creating political facts on the ground .
The state of California is not going to move against a valuable revenue generator .
And if President - Elect Obama keeps his word , the DEA will soon butt out , too .
But even if he doesn't , and the raids against dispensaries continue , it seems extremely unlikely that the feds can put the genie back in the bottle .
The Bush administration tried for eight years and managed to shut down only a small fraction of operators , most of whom were replaced by competitors anyway .
The state 's dispensary system , while currently a patch - work with some areas well - served with stores and other whole counties without any , is also a real world model of what regulated marijuana sales can look like .
Despite the wailing and gnashing of teeth by pot foes , the dispensaries have , for the most part , operated non-problematically and as good commercial and community neighbors .
California 's medical marijuana regime continues to evolve as the state comes to grips with the reality the voters created more than a decade ago .
We will continue to watch and report as -- perhaps -- California leads the way to taxed and regulated marijuana sales , and not just for patients .
What Will Obama Do ?
It will be a new era in Washington , DC , when President - Elect Obama becomes President Obama in less than three weeks .
While the president cannot pass laws , he can provide leadership to the Congress and use his executive powers to make some changes , such as calling off the DEA in California , which he has promised to do .
The one thing we know he will not do is try to legalize marijuana .
In response to publicly generated questions about marijuana legalization , his team has replied succinctly : No .
What will President Obama do ?
One early indicator of Obama 's proclivities will be his selection of a replacement for John Walters , the head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy .
While there has been speculation about some possible candidates , none of them very exciting for drug policy reformers , no candidate has yet been named .
President Obama will also submit budgets to Congress .
Those documents will provide very clear indications of his priorities on matters of interest to the reform community , from the controversial program of grants to fund anti-drug law enforcement task forces to spending levels for drug prevention and treatment , as well as funding for America 's foreign drug war adventures .
The conventional wisdom is that Obama is not going to expend political capital trying to undo decades of drug war policies , but perhaps the budget axe will do the talking .
Goodness knows , we do n't have any money to waste in the federal budget these days .
What Will the Congress Do ?
Democrats now control not only the White House , but both houses of Congress .
One area we will be watching closely is the progress , if any , of federal sentencing reform .
There are now more than 100,000 federal drug war prisoners , too many of them low - level crack offenders serving draconian sentences thanks to the efforts of people like Vice President elect Joe Biden , a long - time congressional drug warrior .
Several different crack - powder cocaine sentencing disparity bills have been introduced .
The best was authored by Biden himself , a sign of changing times , if only slowly changing .
It is past time for one of these bills , hopefully a good one , to pass into law .
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) introduced a federal marijuana decriminalization bill last year .
The best prediction is that it will go nowhere , but we could always stand to be pleasantly surprised .
Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , head of the House Judiciary Committee , has emerged as a strong critic of federal interference in state medical marijuana programs .
Conyers could use his position to highlight that issue , and possibly , to introduce legislation designed to address the problem of federal interference .
One area where the Congress , including the Democratic leadership , has proven vulnerable to the politics of tough on crime is the federal funding of those anti-drug task forces .
In a rare fit of fiscal sanity , the Bush administration has been trying for years to zero out those grants , but the Congress keeps trying to get them back in the budget -- and then some .
We will be watching those funding battles this year to see if anything has changed .
Coca Museum , La Paz , Bolivia
With the death toll from prohibition - related violence topping 5,000 last year , Mexico is in the midst of a multi- sided war that is not going to end in the foreseeable future , especially given America 's insatiable appetite for the forbidden substances that are making Mexican drug trafficking organizations obscenely wealthy .
With the $ 1.4 billion anti-drug military and police assistance known as Plan Merida approved last year by the Bush administration and the Congress , the US is now investing heavily in escalating the violence .
The National Drug Information Center has identified Mexican drug trafficking organizations as the nation 's number one criminal threat , and chances are the violence south of the border will begin to ooze across the line .
That will only add to the pressure among law enforcement and political figures to " do something . "
But given the current mindset among policymakers , just about anything they may be inclined to do to " help " is unlikely to be helpful .
The cartel wars in Mexico are also having an impact on Mexican domestic politics , with President Felipe Calderón 's popularity suffering a significant decline .
The angst over the escalating violence has already provided an opening for talk about drug policy reform in Mexico , with the opposition PRD saying that legalization has to be on the table , and Calderón himself announcing he wants to decriminalize drug possession ( although how that would have any noticeable impact on the traffic or the violence remains unclear ) .
Look for the violence to continue , and watch to see if the resulting political pressure results in any actual policy changes .
Drug War Chronicle will likely be heading down to Tijuana before too long for some on - scene reporting .
The Andean Drug War
... is not going well .
Despite pouring billions of dollars into Plan Colombia , coca production there is at roughly the same level as a decade ago .
Cocaine exports continue seemingly immune to all efforts to suppress them , although more appears to be heading for Europe these days .
During the Bush administration , the US war on drugs in Colombia has morphed into openly supporting the Colombian government 's counterinsurgency war against the leftist FARC rebels , who have been weakened , but , flush with dollars from the trade , are not going away .
Neither are the rightist paramilitary organizations , who also benefit from the trade .
Will an Obama administration try something new ?
Meanwhile , Bolivia and Venezuela , the only countries singled out by the Bush administration as failing to comply with US drug policy objectives , have become allies in an emerging leftist bloc that seeks to challenge US hegemony in the region .
Both countries have thrown out the DEA -- Venezuela in 2005 , Bolivia last fall -- and are cooperating to expand markets for Bolivia 's nascent coca industry .
Bolivian President Evo Morales acknowledged this week that some coca production is being diverted to cocaine traffickers , but said that he does not need US help in dealing with it .
And in Peru , where President Alan García has sent out the army to eradicate coca crops in line with US policy , unrest is mounting in coca growing regions , coca farmers are pushing into indigenous territories , causing more problems , and the Shining Path insurgency , once thought decisively defeated , has reemerged , although apparently minus its Maoist ideology , as a criminal trafficking organization and protector of coca farmers .
The Peruvian government blames the Shining Path for killing 25 soldiers , police , and anti-drug workers in ambushes last year .
Look for that toll to increase this year .
Afghan opium
More than seven years after the US invaded to overthrow the Taliban and destroy Al Qaeda , Afghanistan is the world 's largest opium producer , and has been each year since the Taliban were driven from power .
While US drug war imperatives remain strong , they are in conflict with the broader objectives of the counterinsurgency there , and any efforts to suppress poppy planting or the opium trade will not only have a huge impact on the national economy , but are likely to drive Afghan farmers into the waiting arms of the resurgent Taliban , which is estimated to make hundreds of millions of dollars a year off taxing and protecting the trade .
That buys a lot of guns to point at Afghan , American and NATO troops .
President elect Obama has vowed to reinvigorate the US war in Afghanistan by sending 20,000 additional troops , and NATO has reluctantly agreed to attack the drug trade by going after traffickers linked to the Taliban or various warlords -- but not those linked to the government in Kabul .
Last year was the bloodiest year yet for coalition forces in Afghanistan ; look for this year to top it .

At a gun show in San Francisco ’s Cow Palace , between a table of switchblades and a rack of Enfield rifles , David McBride sat glumly under a “ Ron Paul for President ” banner .
The shy , 28 - year - old software tester had driven in from Silicon Valley and was n’t sure how to chat up nra members chewing elk jerky — or , for that matter , the dozen - or - so Paul supporters he ’d come to know via Meetup.com but had never met in the flesh .
So he pulled out his iPhone and began searching for the latest Paul headlines .
Instantly , the geeks gathered : Was the phone ’s camera 2.0 megapixels ?
Was Paul gaining in the Iowa Republican straw poll ?
“ I ’m waiting until they come out with the one that has ActiveSync , ” a ponytailed computer consultant said .
The group nodded knowingly .
Their candidate , a 72 - year - old obstetrician from Lake Jackson , Texas — land of duck hunters , ranchers , and oilmen — has improbably become an Internet sensation .
He counts more Facebook and MySpace supporters than any Republican ; more Google searches , YouTube subscribers , and website hits than any presidential candidate ; and more Meetup members than the front - runners of both parties combined .
In recent months he was sought out on the blog search engine Technorati more often than anyone except a Puerto Rican singer with a sex tape on the loose ; his November 5 Internet “ Money Bomb ” event pulled in $ 4 million from more than 35,000 individual donors , a single - day online - fundraising record in a primary .
( The previous best was $ 3 million , by John Kerry . )
“ The campaign calls itself the Ron Paul Revolution , ” notes Republican Internet consultant David All .
“ And I do n’t think that ’s a far stretch . ”
Indeed , Paul ’s literature is dominated by the word “ revolution , ” though with the middle letters inverted to make “ love ” — a hippie touch that would be countenanced by few Republicans other than the congressman , who has been elected 10 times on the GOP ticket ( and who also ran as a Libertarian in the 1988 presidential election ) .
The truth is , Paul ’s revolution is a conservative one , by his own account — and thus all the more noteworthy for Democrats , who until now comfortably assumed that progressive bloggers , YouTubers , and ex-Deaniacs would give them , and only them , an edge online .
As it turns out , nobody has more Internet buzz than a pro-gun , pro-life , antitax , and antiwar Republican .
In the Cow Palace , the buzz came mostly from a table of 100,000 - volt stun guns ; McBride ’s table was just a sideshow .
“ I do n’t know anything about him , ” said the guy selling Jungle Survivor knives a few tables down the aisle .
The national media has mostly ignored Paul , who garners no more than 6 percent of the gop electorate in phone surveys , and Democrats liken his surprising victories on Internet straw polls to the Sanjaya effect :
The web loves weirdos .
But maybe the offline world just has n’t seen the right YouTube clips .
McBride had downloaded them onto dvd s , intending to bring the Net into meatspace .
He steeled himself , pocketed the iPhone , and corralled Brian Timpanaro , who was walking by in a bulging stp Oil shirt .
“ Here ’s some of Ron Paul ’s stances , ” he said , quickly ticking off Paul ’s position against drug prosecutions , gun control , and the Iraq War .
Timpanaro shot back with a cranky denunciation of peace protesters , but walked off clutching a dvd .
McBride stacked the remaining discs on his table and called it a day .
“ I ’m one of the more introverted activists you will find , ” he explained .
And yet McBride is also part of a surprisingly powerful political phenomenon — a shock troop of volunteers who ’ve been working long hours , often within the autonomous confines of their living rooms , to make Paul ’s online machine the envy of Washington .
“ You might not know it , but when I ’m not eating , sleeping , at work , or taking care of my daughter , ” McBride told me , “ I ’m working to get Ron Paul elected . ”
Paul , a popular doctor who maintained the only ob - gyn practice in his county , was first elected to Congress in 1976 .
He voted with clinical precision against almost every government - spending bill to cross his desk , even when it meant that his constituents lost out on farm subsidies or money for hurricane protection , earning him the nickname “ Dr. No . ” Politically , his forebears are Senator Robert Taft and Rep. Howard Buffett — the Old Right , pre-National Review .
“ They understood that war was a big - government program , ” says Paul ’s former chief of staff , Lew Rockwell , whose website is one of the most popular libertarian destinations on the Net .
By and large , Paul ’s acolytes are not the kinds of people you ’ll find in a Republican campaign — or any campaign .
Having , in many cases , never even voted , they are driven by an unalloyed certitude that Americans will be won over to Paul by the sheer force of his antigovernment ideas ( and judicious use of social - networking tools ) .
You could call them techno- publicans .
And while their success does n’t readily translate to the offline world , their passion and organization have made them a force to reckon with .
Once Paul is knocked out of the gop contest , will they dissipate , gravitate toward someone else , or reemerge with a third - party bid ?
( Libertarians have been spoilers for the gop before ; in Montana ’s close 2006 Senate race , a Libertarian drew more votes than the entire Democratic margin of victory . )
Whichever way the Paulites go , other candidates would be smart to study their movement ’s trajectory .
It , not Paul , is the real revolution .
Growing up in Pinetop , a conservative town of 3,000 in the White Mountains of Arizona , McBride learned to cherish freedom and blast clay pigeons with the family ’s 10 - gun arsenal .
Then , for three glorious months in 1992 , he found a Marvel Comics chat room and legions of fellow X - Men fans .
When his parents looked at the phone bill — and realized that connecting to aol meant a long - distance call — 14 - year - old David went back to target practice .
In 1994 , McBride ’s father , a physician , was disabled in a car accident .
His mother died a year later of a prescription mix - up .
The family fell into debt .
“ That ’s when I came to the realization that life is n’t fair , ” says McBride , whose shaved head , goatee , and coiled physique contrast with a soft voice and gentle demeanor .
At 16 he took a job bagging groceries ; unlike his older siblings , he ’d have to pay for community college himself .
In 1999 McBride dropped out of school and drifted from a job as a used - car - lot manager in Tucson to a seasonal gig supporting the Intuit software MacInTax .
Three years later Intuit brought him to Silicon Valley as an application tester .
Now there were no limits to his surfing ; for hours each night he sat glued to his iMac , sating a growing Apple obsession on sites such as daringfireball.net .
“ Everything on a Mac makes sense , ” he says , “ when you are coming from a Windows world . ”
Outside his operating system , the world seemed ever more inscrutable .
He read on Google News about the Patriot Act , Guantanamo , and the profiling of Muslim Americans .
Through his brother in Tucson , he discovered LewRockwell.com , which convinced him that the U.S. government had brought on 9/11 with its policies in the Middle East .
McBride had never gotten much help from the government ; now he felt downright threatened by it .
He was , in other words , becoming part of the 15 or so percent of Americans who consider themselves libertarians .
This group has historically voted Republican — enthusiastically for Goldwater in 1964 and Reagan in 1980 — but by 2004 many of them broke from the gop .
McBride was outraged by the invasion of Iraq , registered to vote for the first time in his life , and cast a ballot for Senator John Kerry , even though he disagreed with his economic policies .
“ I just thought he would be less dangerous than Bush , ” he said .
“ Thousands of people were dying for no good reason . ”
The next year , after Hurricane Katrina struck , McBride seized on the pressing question on LewRockwell.com :
Why had fema blocked Wal - Mart from bringing in supplies ?
“ They understand the environment better , the people better ; they know what ’s needed , ” he thought .
It became clear to McBride that private entities such as the Gates Foundation were more likely to end poverty than the government , that Toyota was best equipped to stop global warming , and that Intuit knew more about taxes than the feds did .
By 2006 , McBride was so disgusted with the federal government that he sat out the election , and the new Congress ’ failure to extricate America from Iraq wiped out his last bit of allegiance to the system .
He told himself he ’d never vote again .
Why bother ?
Nobody who was against big government , the war , and the Patriot Act could ever win .
During the second Republican primary debate , held on the campus of the University of South Carolina in mid-May , Ron Paul stood at a lectern at the far end of the stage .
He ’d seldom be allowed to speak that evening , but a rare chance came when Fox ’s Wendell Goler asked why he wanted the gop nomination given that he opposed the war .
Paul said terrorists had attacked the United States because of its entanglements in the Middle East .
Murmurs filled the hall .
“ Are you suggesting we invited the 9/11 attack , sir ? ” Goler inquired .
“ I ’m suggesting that we listen to the people who attacked us and the reasons they did it , ” Paul replied .
When the bell cut him off a few seconds later , Rudy Giuliani jumped in .
“ That ’s an extraordinary statement , ” he seethed .
“ I do n’t think I ’ve ever heard that before , and I ’ve heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11 . ”
Egged on by the audience ’s cheers , Giuliani demanded that Paul withdraw the comment .
Goler swiveled in his chair .
“ Congressman ? ”
What Paul said next would stream from YouTube more than half a million times , and inspire McBride like no other moment in his young political existence .
“ I believe very sincerely that the cia is correct when they teach and talk about blowback , ” Paul said .
“ [ Terrorists ] do n’t come here to attack us because we ’re rich and we ’re free .
They come and they attack us because we ’re over there .
I mean , what would we think if other foreign countries were doing that to us ? ”
Straw polls on abc and msnbc showed Paul as the debate ’s resounding winner , and even on Fox ’s own text - message poll , he nearly tied Mitt Romney for first .
For McBride , “ It was enough to get me to jump on the bandwagon and say , ‘ Maybe this guy does have a shot . ' ”
In the following months , the San Francisco Ron Paul Meetup group grew more than thirtyfold ; nationwide , more than 60,000 people have signed up for Paul Meetups .
Many listed Paul ’s stance on Iraq as a top reason for their support .
While antiwar Democrats such as Dennis Kucinich want to pull out the troops as they are replaced by international peacekeepers , Paul would have them “ just come home ” no matter what — and , immediately thereafter , kill off the entire military industrial complex along with the “ medical industrial complex ” and the “ educational industrial complex ” and the personal income tax .
“ We ca n’t cut anything until we change our philosophy about what government should do , ” Paul said in the debate .
On that night , he politicized a new generation of libertarians .
Paul fever soon spread to the popular , tech - oriented news aggregator Digg , where McBride and other enthusiasts began to search , post , and comment on everything Paul , to the point where the candidate now consistently dominates the top 10 election stories on Digg ’s front page .
Paul continues to win major Internet polls with the help of emails and chat - site notes exhorting his troops to vote .
His victories have often been such routs — 87 percent of the vote in the abc post - debate poll , for example — that some media outlets have spiked the polls or removed his name , and bloggers have wondered if his supporters were unleashing malicious web bots .
The true answer is probably far simpler :
At the core of the Ron Paul juggernaut are thousands of obsessive techies for whom online organizing is not a special effort , but second nature .
The Venn of Paul : As befits a movement with mainstream aspirations , libertarians have taken a big - tent approach to ideological purity .
A pro-life , anti-immigration conservative like Ron Paul is welcome , as is a free - love prophet like the late Robert A. Heinlein — and , of course , libertarian thought overlaps with segments of both left and right .
— J.H .
In July , Paul flew to Silicon Valley to speak at the Mountain View headquarters of Google .
He spun through the Googleplex , past the life - size Tyrannosaurus rex and the corporate organic garden and into an auditorium overflowing with workers balancing laptops on their knees .
Hillary Clinton , John Edwards , and John McCain had appeared here , but none had drawn a comparable crowd , nor as many questions — or manifestos — emailed in advance from Google staffers .
“ When John McCain and Hillary Clinton were standing up ready to stamp their approval on the Patriot Act , you ’re one of the people in Congress who said , ‘ No , absolutely not , ' ” a worker who ’d flown from Seattle told Paul during the Q&A .
“ And that really impressed me . ”
There was a webcast , and a rockumentary ; Bill Dumas , Paul ’s official videographer and a member of the band Blonde Furniture , provided the soundtrack ’s chant , “ If you Google Ron Paul… , ” an homage to the idea that all you need to know about Paul is on the Internet .
A few weeks later YouTubers produced a Ron Paul rap ( “ Yeah we know our Homeland Security and FEMA / Just look at how they protected us from Hurricane Katrina ” ) , and then a Ron Paul folk ballad , a synth - pop track , and a riff on the Scarecrow ’s “ If I only had a brain . ”
By then , roughly 10 percent of Paul ’s donations over $ 200 were coming from tech workers .
No business sector has raised more for Paul ; in Google ’s hometown , Paul logs more contributions than all the Republican front - runners combined .
He has garnered links to his donation page from a broad array of websites — troublingly broad , in fact :
In November , he refused to return a contribution from avowed white supremacist Don Black , or to block the donation link from Black ’s website .
McBride ’s favorite , dailypaul.com , has more daily viewers than the official John Edwards website ( albeit according to the notoriously skewed Alexa ratings ) .
This is all the more remarkable because , though tech wealth has historically supported libertarian causes , the industry ’s money in recent years has shifted to buying political firepower in the major parties .
For example , since the 1990s , McBride ’s libertarian - inclined boss , Intuit founder Scott Cook , has more than doubled his donations to Republicans and Democrats , giving the maximum last year to mainstream politicians such as Mitt Romney and Harry Reid .
Still , the romance of libertarianism endures for Silicon Valley ’s rank and file .
Scott Loughmiller , a partner in a six - man dot - com startup in San Carlos , says he has converted all his coworkers to the Paul credo .
“ You can argue all you want , and they did for a month , ” he said , “ but eventually they caved , because you have to give in to logic . ”
Paul ’s name shows up hand - stamped on dollar bills , emblazoned on freeway banners , and on roads across the valley via a big white delivery truck known as the Liberty Van .
In August McBride changed his voter registration from “ Decline to State ” to “ Republican ” so he could vote for Paul in the primary .
In the techie brain , self - interested antigovernment leanings — many Valley libertarians are furious about the investor - protection rules of the Sarbanes - Oxley Act , a law they blame for driving Wall Street IPOs to London — cross - pollinate with the yearning for a reassuringly Cartesian political philosophy .
“ Techies think of life as like code , ” says Peter Leyden , a Democratic strategist and former editor of the Valley ’s original libertarian - leaning tech bible , Wired , “ so you just find where the bug is and fix it . ”
Capitalism and democracy are seen as self - regulating systems that bureaucrats can only screw up .
And Paul is the only candidate who understands these killer apps .
“ What the other candidates say is n’t backed by rational thoughts or facts , ” McBride contends .
Libertarian Theology Libertarianism might be a simple ideology , an aversion to big government in all its forms , but do n’t tell that to libertarians : “ Like any movement of any size , ” says Nick Gillespie , editor of the libertarian magazine Reason , “ it is an endless operation of trying to figure out more and more ways in which people who agree on 99.9 percent of everything can really hate each other ’s guts . ”
Anarcho - Capitalists :
The most radical of the lot , they want to abolish government entirely ( though , unlike regular anarchists , they do support private property rights ) .
“ The state acts like a band of thieves and killers , ” explains Lew Rockwell , the best - known exponent of this strain .
“ The private sector does n’t do that . ”
Minarchists : Archrivals to the anarcho - capitalists , they support a minimalist version of government :
Let the state handle roads , policing , and defense — but nothing more .
Many , including Ron Paul , view the Constitution as the ultimate minarchist document .
Cosmopolitan Libertarians :
Term used by the minarchist editors of Reason to describe their embrace of world citizenship and deride rivals as hayseeds Economic Libertarians : Worship free - market absolutists like Milton Friedman Hippie Libertarians : Worship freedom - loving freaks like Larry Flynt Religious Libertarians : Worship deities of their choosing , care about politics primarily as it affects religious freedom .
In 17th - century England they were Puritan Roundheads .
In 21st - century America they ’re Mormons .
Gold Bugs : Advocate a return to the gold standard , or some equivalent , as a way to diminish the fiscal powers of the state ; dismiss foes as “ inflationists ”
Objectivists : Followers of philosopher Ayn Rand who love morality tales , hate anarchy , and endorse a scorched - earth foreign policy .
If “ flattening Fallujah to end the Iraqi insurgency will save American lives , ” Ayn Rand Institute director Yaron Brook has written , “ to refrain from [ doing so ] is morally evil . ”
Neolibertarians : Libertarian neocons ; big supporters of the Iraq War Paleolibertarians :
Old - schoolers who despise the neolibertarians for selling out to the system .
Also think atheism is overrated .
Technolibertarians : Extropians , transhumanists , sci-fi-fans , they strive to transcend humanity ’s meat - puppet limitations and take self - determination to the final frontier .
South Park Conservatives :
Find their politics articulated in a show created by two avowed libertarians ; a seminal episode follows a race for school mascot between a giant douche and a turd sandwich .
Which , says Reason ‘s Gillespie , “ pretty much sums up how most libertarians approach politics . ”
Paultards : Blogosphere dis for those who annoy the online masses by relentlessly shilling for their man in comment threads , polls , and social networking sites
— J.H .
In fact , McBride believes Paul ’s reasoning is so ineluctable , written words are n’t sufficient to convey its force .
His dvd s , culled from clips such as the Google talk and handed out door to door around the Valley , capture Paul in all of his charismatic equipoise .
“ He just does n’t get emotionally charged , ” McBride says .
“ He ’s very rational .
And you ca n’t always pick that up in an article you are reading .
So I think hearing him speak , seeing him speak , can be more influential , more powerful .
And people do n’t like to read anyways . ”
Chants filtered through the second - floor windows of a San Francisco hotel where Paul was giving a speech on fiscal policy at a fundraising breakfast last summer .
An hour later the candidate hit the street with an entourage of video bloggers .
“ The whole city is out here , ” a woman pronounced .
Paul shook McBride ’s hand before disappearing into a thicket of placards .
It was the first time McBride had met his idol , and for several minutes he remained frozen on the curb , fumbling to buckle his camera case .
“ That was a rock - star arrival , ” a stubbly hipster in a golf cap remarked .
“ Oh , bigger than that for me , ” McBride gushed .
Paul ambled with a slight hunch across the trolley tracks of Market Street and through the Financial District towing a block - long tail of supporters displaying irony mustaches , man purses , and antiwar banners .
“ Google Ron Paul ! ” someone shouted .
McBride offered passersby copies of his dvd .
( “ If you ’d told me six months ago that anything would have motivated me to do something like this , I would have told you you were out of your mind , ” he later emailed me . )
At the Palio d’Asti restaurant on Sacramento Street , McBride , wearing a ringer T and no jacket , flashed a $ 500 ticket and walked into Paul ’s fundraising lunch .
He picked a mostly empty table at the back and pulled out his iPhone , replying to emails from fellow Meetup members who sat at the next table .
Then he switched to camera mode , walked over to Lew Rockwell ’s table , and wordlessly snapped a photo .
“ There are a lot of iPhones here , ” he told Chris Nelson , a squeaky - voiced computer programmer at our table .
“ I ’ve been keeping an eye out for them , ” Nelson said .
“ Yeah , ” McBride confided , “ I noticed Lew Rockwell was taking photos with his . ”
When the chef brought out plates of Texas wild boar ( a Ron Paul special ) , talk turned from tech to politics .
“ Is n’t there a whole lot of hope here ? ” Nelson asked .
Paul had a lot of “ mainstream support , ” agreed McBride .
Then the two got in an argument over whether government ever had a role to play — Nelson thought it might be needed to stop global warming , but McBride believed a strict interpretation of private property rights ( you ca n’t pollute my land ) would be more effective .
“ Money is the root of all evil , ” McBride said , “ but it ’s also the solution to everything — economics rules everything .
It ’s a macro science . ”
Just then Paul stood up to speak .
His voice was faint .
He began by describing himself as the mere servant of a grassroots revolution .
He claimed to lack the moral and legal authority to govern , which was why he would abolish most of the federal government .
“ Some people will say this wo n’t work , ” he said .
“ They say we need government ; if we did n’t have it , it would be total chaos .
But it would be the opposite :
In some places , we would have more government , but it would be self - government .
People would have the responsibility of taking care of their own lives . ”
The crowd heartily applauded , though what Paul meant by self - government was n’t exactly clear .
McBride lingered as Paul disappeared for a radio interview ; when he reemerged , McBride snapped photos for other Meetup members who ’d been unable to afford the entry fee but were now politely queuing up to greet Paul .
There , in line , was Nanette LaVogue , a professional “ hauntress ” with blue hair , and a delegation of medicinal - marijuana advocates who wanted to give Paul an abalone shell .
( “ It ’s still legal tender in Norway ! ” )
But eventually McBride moved in to chat .
“ Nice to see …meet you , ” Paul said , and McBride delivered the statement he ’d composed earlier that day , in all its haiku purity : “ I just want to thank you for your hard work and courage . ”
Then he backed away with a beatific smile .
Later McBride explained why he had n’t tried to talk further :
He already knew what his hero would say on just about any topic .
Libertarianism , he glowed , “ is the only place where the answers to all questions have actually been resolved . ”
Scientists Given Go-Ahead for Ocean Fertilization Scheme
January 28th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Scientists from Germany ’s Alfred Wegener Institute have been given approval to proceed with a controversial plan to dump several tons of iron into the Southern Ocean .
A recent study from the University of Southampton has shown that seeding the ocean with iron can lock carbon away from the atmosphere permanently , but many environmentalists are concerned about the scheme ’s long - term effects .
The University of Southampton study showed that a natural source of iron at the northern boundary of the Southern Ocean tripled the growth of phytoplankton in the area .
When marine algae and phytoplankton die , they take vast quantities of CO2 with them to the bottom of the ocean , leading to permanent carbon sequestration .
Results from previous ocean fertilization studies , however , are often contradictory , and researchers do not have data on the long - term effectiveness of iron - dumping .
At this point , we ’ll only find out the impact of ocean fertilization on local ecology after Alfred Wegener ’s scientists complete their experiment .

Andrew Dice Clay Was Putty in Donald Trumps Hands
Outspoken comedianwill be one of the " stars " to appear on this season of Celebrity Apprentice with .
Is the boardroom big enough for both of their egos ?
Donald apparently asked the celebrities who they thought was the most famous person in the boardroom and of course got what he was looking for , major kissing up by all the the celebrities , including Clay who said , " You are , sir .
You are the biggest star in the room . "
Clay has changed his tune and is now referring to Trump as " Donald Chump " , which seems fitting to us .
While talking smack to his friends , he said , " One hundred years from now , when people are looking back , you think people will think Trump or Dice ?
I get crazy from that ( bleep ) . "
Behind the scenes sources report , " Dice can say what he wants , but Donald really roughed the guy up .
Clay was like a trained little puppy when Donald got through with him . "
The show will premiere on March 1st .
Other celebrities appearing this season include Joan Rivers , Dennis Rodman , Jesse James , Brian McKnight , Khloe Kardashian , Clint Black , Tom Green , Herschel Walker , Scott Hamilton and Brande Roderick .
UPS
( UPS ) - Get Report
says the economy is bad and getting worse , at least during the current quarter .
" We 're going to presume the economy keeps getting worse , " said CEO Scott Davis , on an earnings conference call .
" Frankly , I think you will see the biggest drop in the first quarter of ' 09 .
The second quarter will be negative , but not quite as bad . "
CFO Kurt Kuehn said conditions worsened from October to November , then stabilized during the pre-Christmas season when volume was close to flat .
But in the first quarter , he said , " we do think trends will turn back closer to October and November than ( to ) what we had in December . "
Once viewed as a leading indicator , UPS has become a proxy for the economy in real time , with 6 % of the U.S. GDP and 2 % of the world 's GDP in its system at any given moment .
As for bright spots , UPS has a viable business , $ 1 billion in cash , strong cash flow , reduced fuel surcharges , plans to reduce costs and a potential benefit from the shutdown of DHL 's domestic operation .
It will continue to buy back shares this year , albeit at a slower pace , and will look for acquisitions at distressed prices .
Also , so far , the company has seen little of the benefits from efforts to consolidate operating districts , reduce flights , eliminate some package - handling operations , freeze management salaries and suspend its 401 ( k ) match .
" The first quarter will be weak with slight improvements later in the year as initiatives take hold , " Kuehn said .
UPS shares traded Tuesday morning at $ 45.45 , up $ 3.03 or about 7 % .
Because of limited visibility , the company offered guidance for the first quarter only , forecasting per-share earnings of 52 cents to 68 cents .
Analysts had estimated 65 cents .
In the fourth quarter , excluding items , UPS earned $ 829 million , or 83 cents a share .
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had estimated 85 cents .
A year earlier , UPS earned $ 1.13 billion , or $ 1.07 a share .
Revenue was $ 12.7 billion , down 5 % , and short of the estimated $ 13.2 billion .
UPS earned 25 cents a share including items , principally a $ 575 million noncash impairment charge related to the decline in value of its freight business .
During the quarter , average daily package volume was 17.7 million units , down 3.7 % .
A decline in fuel costs " was more than offset by the effects of economic deceleration around the world , " UPS said .
Domestically , volume fell 4.4 % , and growth in revenue per item was constrained by a lower average weight per package and a continuing shift from premium products .
Internationally , export volume increased 1.6 % , but revenue and revenue per piece fell 8 % , primarily due to a shift away from premium products , general economic conditions and a stronger dollar .
Meanwhile , operating margin in the supply chain and freight division fell by 23.9 % , revenue dropped 6.5 % , and the adjusted profit margin slid 35 % , largely reflecting declines in less - than - truckload hauling .
Competitor
FedEx
, in its quarter ending Nov. 30 , reported net income increased 3 % , largely due to lower fuel prices .
But the package - shipper offered an exceedingly glum near - term outlook .
For the current quarter , which ends Feb. 28 , analysts expect earnings to decline by 52 % , and revenue by 7 % .

[ As Quake Live debuts to massive demand , Gamasutra sits down with Id 's John Carmack and Marty Stratton to discuss its conception , technical specifics , and iPhone plans . ]
id Software 's just - debuted browser - based FPS Quake Live is a very interesting proposition .
It allows id to enter the uncharted territory ( for the developer ) of free - to - play , ad - supported browser gaming , and it reinvigorates a classic PC game -- Quake 3 -- that was a titan in its time .
Here , John Carmack discusses , along with Marty Stratton , executive producer of the project , exactly what the inspiration for this project is , the challenges that id faced in bringing the project from conception to reality , and its hopes to contribute to the continued success of the PC platform .
Carmack and Stratton also discuss how they expect to see the product evolve down the road -- giving a roadmap to how one of the top developers on the platform sees the market evolving over the next several months , at the very least .
It 's been an interesting experience taking this game that so many people were familiar with nearly a decade ago and have it , essentially , be current again .
John Carmack :
It 's really heartening to see how many hours a lot of people are logging on the game now , and that shores up my confidence that it really is a good solid core gameplay mechanic that we 've polished and tuned a little bit .
The whole point of the project was just to make it easier to access that core mechanic .
I joined a game early on , and there were two guys in a duel who each had kill counts in the 400s -- they must have been there for hours .
They were just bantering back and forth casually , while pulling off amazing stunts .
It was funny to see .
JC : Yeah , it 's also really interesting how broad the user base is on our beta list , and Marty is saying that he thinks we 're actually going to be running more servers in Europe than domestically on our launch , or ramp - up to the public beta .
Just looking at all the leaderboards seeing all the huge diversity of country flags up there is kind of cool .
You 're going into an open beta now , right ?
Marty Stratton : Yes .
We 'll have opened up to the public on Tuesday evening .
We anticipate being in beta for a little while , completely open to the public , and going from there .
How much have you worked out your final " release " schedule , so to speak ?
Are you playing it by ear ?
MS : I would consider this the full , official launch .
Because it is a website and is a built - in , unified experience all on this web portal , we 're taking more of an attitude of it being web development , so we 're launching to the public .
We 're letting everybody play .
We do n't expect to have to do anything like wiping stats or anything major like that .
We expect that once we launch it , we 're going to leave the beta tag on it until we 're sure that we 're not going to have major outages or different things like that .
JC : The beta tag is certainly an admission that we never launched an online web service like this before , and we 've already run into lots of things that we did n't know we needed to know .
And I 'm sure we 're going to run into a lot more as we open up to the public .
So , some of that is just : bear with us , there are probably going to be some issues here , but we are going to work through them .
MS : We have used Google 's model a bit , in terms of launching new features .
I think Gmail is actually still in beta , so I hope we 're not in beta quite as long as that , but it's that kind of philosophy .
We have a full - featured product , but we 'll probably be adding some functionality , some features , and hammering out some issues as large numbers of people begin to use the service .
Can you speak to any of those factors that forced you to reconsider elements of your strategy or prolong development ?
JC : The gameplay side of things went really pretty much as we expected .
The plan was to take the old codebase , and modernize it a little bit .
There have been so many people who have played the game for nine years or so and have tried out lots of things in the different mods .
While you 'll never have a complete consensus , with some improvements , it [ comes close ] .
So we did integrate a lot of the changes that people almost universally agreed on -- some things with item placement , weapon balance , and tuning the different parts of the game .
All of the levels are cleaned up visually .
We added some things with the in - game advertising , but also took the opportunity to tighten up the visual presentation on everything and improve the lighting .
All that went pretty much the way we expected .
That did n't go massively over time budget or anything .
What really hurt us was the initial thought of putting a web interface on it .
Some things surrounding the game were certainly overly trivialized by us .
That 's easy to do when you say , " Oh , we 're hotshot game developers .
This web stuff can't be too hard because so many people do it . "
There 's a little bit of a humbling lesson there in how much work we did have to do with all the things on browser compatibility and backend database integration and optimization .
Things like that that really had taken a couple times longer than we expected them to .
But on the other hand , the entire product package is a lot slicker than I envisioned in my mind 's eye when I threw out the napkin design for this a year and a half ago .
What prompted that design ?
Why not a more straightforward method like a small executable ?
JC : Well , we really wanted it to be something where people go in and out of the website .
The core concept here is that one of the major things that PCs do much better than consoles is the web browsing experience -- looking at lots of data and navigating around , finding different things , refining queries in different ways .
PCs are still just plain better than consoles at that .
A lot of this project was about doing something that the PC was going to be better at than the consoles .
Our modern triple - A stuff has to be somewhat more console - centric , with the PC as a peer , while this is an opportunity to do something where the PC will really stand alone .
The browser experience was a major part of that .
We want to be doing things with the social networking , the communications and friends lists and inviting friends , ranking all the different things , drilling down through all the different games played and all the leaderboards .
These are things that certainly appear to some degree or another on the consoles , but are just a lot more fleshed - out and have more depth with what we can do here .
It 'll be interesting to see if hardcore people play full - screen still .
You can go full - screen and focus on the game -- keep all your attention on there .
But I suspect that probably there will be a lot more people , as our user base grows , who are playing it just in the browser window .
They may be never even having to learn or care to switch to full - screen because they want to get all the notifications when their friends are signing on and doing different things , or they have other windows open with other things going on there .
I 'm curious to see how that actually plays out in the end -- how many people look at it as a serious gaming experience and just use the portal to get there , versus the people for whom the portal is a large chunk of the experience .
For years , I 've often thought about the fact that a lot of people spend vastly more time on websites and forums about the games that they 're playing than they actually spend playing the games themselves .
We hope to have some aspect of that here .
On the social note , do you plan to do integration with sites like Facebook , where you have an actual app that will run the game and tie the accounts together ?
MS : Definitely .
Actually , our PR agency has a woman that specializes in those types of things and hooking up us with developers if we need that assistance .
I 'm looking at hiring an intern , honestly , who 's done that stuff through college , for a few months to investigate .
We already have some people who , even on their own in the beta , have created forum signatures that you can transport to other forums that dynamically pull information from our stack and show which character you are , your win-loss record , and what your favorite arena is .
Cool integration like that is already being followed up , even through people in our beta community .
Going back to the people who run full - screen versus those who run in a window , that probably to some extent reflects a more or less hardcore attitude .
Do you have any idea as to the ratio of the people have that decade of experience , and the people who are newer to the game ?
Is it trending in either direction ?
JC : Since it 's been a closed beta and we seeded it with just the hardcore community that were still playing the game from its original release , we 're definitely skewed pretty hard towards the serious players right now .
And that 's actually made it a little bit of a challenge to get some of the automatic skill - ranking stuff looking right .
Even a big influx of brand - new users we probably wo n't even see on the opening day , because it 's going to be mostly people that already are familiar and aware of this .
It 's going to be real interesting , a few months down the road , when it 's percolated out towards people that were n't necessarily in the Quake or id or even FPS community .
MS : Or that were eight when Quake III came out .
Yeah . [ laughs ]
MS : Honestly !
When Quake III came out , 18 - year - olds were eight years old at that time .
There really is , I think , a pretty fertile ground for guys in college who've heard about Quake and know id and Doom , to then hear , " Hey , here 's a free game that 's a first person shooter .
It 's totally what you 'd expect to get in a retail package , and it 's free at this website . "
There 's a lot of potential there .
JC : And certainly , for the business model to work out , we have to wind up getting many more people playing than ever played the original game .
And presumably , those guys in college can play it on a laptop with an integrated graphics card .
JC : Yeah .
I mean , that 's one of the great things about it -- it 's an older technology that was well - written at the time and was used as a major benchmark in testing , et cetera , over the last decade , and is still on the list of making sure that no modern video card drivers regress over anything .
They still test Quake III Arena on all that .
That has some really great benefits of meaning that it is really rock - solid .
It 's not like a modern game , where going to the 0.107 driver causes some problem in the middle of things .
It just works , and it just works really fast , on any computer .
It turns out that you 're more limited by the browser support for the technologies that we get than for the graphics - acceleration support for the game itself .
Somebody at id just recently got one of the little netbooks -- I can't remember the manufacturer .
It 's literally a $ 300 laptop that does n't have a DVD drive or anything , and it runs the game .
MS : It runs the game at 50 to 80 frames per second in full screen .
So it 's pretty cool .
The other thing that I think particularly Quake players , but PC gamers in general , are used to , and that this does do better , is keeping the game up to date .
On the Xbox , you pop your disc in and it says , " Oh , there 's an update for this game . "
You download it , and you 're off and playing .
PC gamers have sometimes been kind of run through the wringer , to have to go out and install the latest patch , or check if there 's a new map pack out .
Only recently have games on the PC really started to handle updating themselves very well .
But , because of the way we built this , any time you go to quakelive.com , wherever you are , it automatically checks to see what you have and downloads what you need .
So you 're always up to date .
You 're never out of date .
You 'll have a bit of a download because it pulls the game data in chunks to your system , but you can start playing while it 's kind of downloading in the background as well .
Basically , anywhere you go , your friends list , your statistics , your personalized settings , your customized views of the game browser , of filters , or of leaderboards , all of that follows you .
So it really is a fairly portable -- not only from a laptop perspective , but as a portable experience in that once you 've downloaded the game at a friend 's house or at home , or wherever , there are no install discs , no patching , no nothing .
You just log in , it updates it , you have the latest version , and you can play with all of your settings right there .
I think that 's actually going to be pretty darn cool , the fact that you can sit down at a hotel business center and just have exactly the game experience that you have been playing at home , or at work .
Back in the Quake III release days , there was a whole class of player at a certain level of play who would turn every graphical option down as far as it could go , to get that baseline type of experience where they can just push as many frames as possible and strip the game down to its basics .
Do you find it interesting that , even now , with modern machines , some people still do that on Quake Live ?
JC : Yeah .
There 's not nearly as much of that , though .
A lot of the people did it , really , for the right reasons of wanting to get improved frame rates .
There 's still a slight sense , for some people , that blurring things out gives more contrast and can be a slight edge for making things stand out .
But for the most part , it 's great to see the game running at , really , two - million - pixel resolution .
In fact , it 's really neat to see how cool a lot of the stuff really looks on there .
A lot of the shots in the website , the glamour shots that are all still in - game , look pretty damn good .
And the polish path the level designers went , to go line up all the textures and improve the lighting , without having changed any of the rendering code at all , has added a nice little extra layer of gloss to it .
In many ways , it 's almost hard to say this , coming from a graphics programmer , but for what the game is and what it does , it really looks plenty good enough .
On that note , with regard to the graphical design mentality , Quake III is a very clean , very readable game .
And the gameplay design is extremely elegant , in that it 's very game - like and based on pure dynamics , as opposed to trying to model more realistic systems , which is a more modern design ethic .
I 'm curious what you think the place for that kind of game design and visual design is today ?
There are very few triple - A games being made with that mentality .
JC : Yeah .
That 's a really worthwhile thing to explore .
If we look back into history on that , inside id , we would go back and forth between different people having different primary drives on that .
And Quake III was my game .
I am all about the elegant , simple , minimalist design .
And we thought it was a good thing for what it is .
But it was n't as successful as either Quake II or Doom 3 , the games that bracketed it -- although it was plenty successful to be worthwhile .
But it has become clear , over the years since then , that what people expect from a current triple - A title is everything and the kitchen sink .
Especially in an established genre like first - person shooters , you have to have everything nowadays .
And it 's a tall order to go ahead and do all of that .
People expect a lot for their $ 50 or $ 60 that they 're plunking down .
That 's all well and good , and it's led to some really fabulous titles coming out , but there is still a lot to be said for that minimalist , simple game design .
When we 're not trying to claw $ 60 out of somebody 's back pocket , I think there is a place for things that are simple .
And I think that there 's a possibility that we can actually attract many more players to this than to the big games with the really high barrier to entry .
That highlights an interesting dichotomy in that the game itself is so classically streamlined in the hardcore sense , and yet the whole presentation layer surrounding it -- being in the browser , being a two - minute download , having automated matchmaking -- is actually incredibly inviting .
JC : Yeah .
We 've certainly , over the years , seen a lot of cases , especially in the early days before everything got hyper - competitive online , where people just had the magic of wandering around in the world and taking a shot at somebody else wandering around the same world with them .
There are still millions and millions of people who are open for that experience .
But , we do need to segregate them into the shallow end of the pool , because it's all too easy to have a shark swimming around in those waters making it no fun for anybody .
But with a large enough body of players there and good automatic skill - ranking , you should be able to get people who do n't know how to play the game very well go in , wander around , and find that it looks neat , it sounds neat , and interesting things are going on .
They just need to build up a little base level of skill to start achieving those incremental advances and personal rewards of playing the game .
Speaking of matchmaking , you said it 's been tough getting that system tuned due to the current skewed player base .
How do you deal with that , especially now that newer players will be coming in ?
JC : There 's a training map to kind of assess the skills .
And it 's kind of interesting how Marty was just talking about the changes that have been made in there .
Originally , they just asked people for an assessment of their skill .
And we were finding that all sorts of people would go , " I 'm an expert . " [ laughs ]
And they were n't anywhere close to that in the global scheme of things .
So it changed over to more of a challenge exercise , where they have to do certain skill - based things to get into the right pool , aside from the interaction with the bot .
I think that helps a lot , where you 're going to find people who can't even jump from a pedestal to pedestal at the very beginning if they 're not coordinated with the mouse - keyboard combination .
They 'll be in the beginner pool .
Then you get people that can rocket jump and do strafe - jumping and wall - climbing stuff -- really , only the true experts and masters of the game can kind of get into that pool .
And that 's as it should be .
It will be interesting to see how the community goes as more people get on , how many people go in just to grief other players in different ways .
I think that we have some advantage in this , having accounts -- the complete anonymity of a typical PC game did make it easy for some people to just be spoilers .
There was very little you could do to censure them in different ways .
But with the account - based system , at least it could take some 15 minutes to go make a new account .
They do n't do it 100 times if they keep getting kicked .
I hope that has some benefit there .
But we are going to learn a lot in the coming months .
What 's involved on the rendering side of this ?
I mean , did you have to rewrite a renderer , or was it just an issue of plugging in to existing APIs ?
JC : In the core rendering system , hardly anything at all changed .
It 's interesting , because I am kind of poking through the Quake III codebase on the iPhone right now , for some after - hours work a couple of us are doing , and I 'm going to have to go in and make some serious renderer changes to get that up to the performance that I want .
But for Quake Live , the game rendering code did n't change at all .
For the framework around it , about making sure that you 've got the right context and the right PC and the right rendering going , there 's a little bit of work , especially dealing with all the different browser versions .
Between the different browser types and versions , a lot of tweaking has to be done to make it work right , to switch quickly between full - screen and the browser .
But all of that is on the fringes .
When I look back at the original codebase , the data points that it was designed around , it was a good design point for just before GPUs started doing vertex acceleration .
All of Quake III was built around minimizing state changes and crunching up broken drivers , because this was back in the days when we had 15 different video card companies and 13 of them did n't have a clue how to do what they were supposed to be doing .
So it was a very defensively programmed renderer .
I look at it now , and compiled vertex arrays are completely archaic .
Everything should be in vertex buffer objects .
But for Quake Live , it does n't make a damn bit of difference .
There 's a part of me that wants to go in and do the optimal point design for any given thing .
But the smarter part of me just looks back and says , " It works just fine right now .
It 's been tested to death by all the remaining video - card vendors .
Do n't touch that .
Let it go .
It 's doing a good job . "
It 's funny that you bring that up , having also mentioned iPhone in the same breath , because you 've spoken a good deal over the last few years about the enjoyability and challenge of going to lower - spec systems and trying to tweak everything for maximum optimization on that spec .
Does that not exist here , simply because modern PC hardware is already so capable ?
JC : The tough part of it really becomes the decision about whether [ it 's worth it ] .
I love to go fight at the hardware level .
I really enjoy doing that type of work .
But projects like these have to be done more , unfortunately , on business - case decisions .
If we say , " Oh , if we want to do the best possible in - browser game , " well , we could spend $ 30 million doing the best possible browser game , and you could never make a business case close on it .
So it becomes , " How much can we afford to spend on this ? "
And then , given that amount of resources , how do you want to allocate it ?
What 's going to go to rendering ?
What 's going to go to modeling ?
What 's going to go to level design ?
What 's going to go to web and database development and all of that ?
It 's clearly not the best thing we could do in a world without resource constraints , but it 's a matter of figuring out what 's the best we can do and still hope to have the business case close at the end of the day .
So , are you putting Quake III on iPhone , then ?
Is that part of the plan ?
JC : It 's not tied in directly with this .
I could go on for a long time , again , just about the iPhone stuff .
We 've got a couple things going on on that , and some things have not gone great with our working with outside companies on it .
But there are several of us that are poking around in our somewhat after - hours and discretionary time on things .
It 's kind of exciting to look at that .
We 're working with a more vanilla Quake III codebase .
But now that I 'm thinking about all this stuff , if we turned this into a product , even if it 's not part of the Quake Live framework , we 'll probably go in and pick up all the tweaks and changes to the core gameplay and the levels that have been developed for Quake Live .
With regard to the business model , is it purely ad - supported ?
MS : Yes .
At launch , we 'll be ad - supported completely , and probably for a couple months after that .
One of the big features that our player base is asking for is the ability to run private servers .
Right now , we control all of the game servers , so all of the game instances that are happening are public games .
There 's really no ability to say , " I want to run my own game and only have the people playing that I want to be playing , " primarily because it 's free and we 're paying for all that infrastructure anyway .
There are huge benefits for us controlling the physical hardware that the game is running on .
So , in the couple months after launch , we will be putting together , more or less , a subscription option that allows players , for a very nominal fee -- something around like the $ 4.99 price point -- to also probably do other things , but the core functionality will be to allow players to , through the very elegant interface they have on the website , run their own game servers .
You say , " I want to play this game at this location .
I want it to be configured this way , " and then tie that into our friends list and the social aspect of it .
" I want to invite this player , this player , this player , this player , this player .
Start the match . "
Or even have that match recurring , on a calendar basis -- " Every day at six o'clock , I want to play a match against John , and I want the system to invite us both to the match , start the game for us automatically . "
We 'll be introducing that .
The traditional model for that is publishers or developers working with a game server provider , or GSP , to provide game server rental .
That 's usually done around a price point of $ 1 , $ 1.50 , sometimes a little less , per slot .
So you 've got players who end up paying $ 25 to $ 30 to " rent " the game server , and it 's always in the same location .
It 's a very static transaction , and it 's pretty costly .
Because of the way we handle game servers , we can be much more flexible with it and offer it at a much lower price .
If I want to run my own game , it 's only going to cost me five bucks a month or so , and I can set that game up any time I want , invite whatever friends I want .
It 'll spin it up , and then as soon as I 'm done , it spins it back down .
Then , next time , if I want to start one in another location , I 'm not tied to a specific physical box .
I think players will really respond to that favorably .
It 's something that they wanted .
And we 'll tie a bunch of other features , more specific to running private games , to that model as well -- being able to call time - out in a game , blocking teams , and having referees .
It 's more of a competitive feature set .
We 'll tie to those private games , because we obviously can't run those features on a public game .
It frustrates too many people .
That will be something that , shortly after we go open beta , we 'll start talking about , and people will see it fairly quickly .
So I presume -- I hope -- that we 'll add another component to the business model outside the advertising revenue .
Are you looking tie that into official clan support , where you could set up clan servers and events and groups ?
MS : Yeah .
That 's one step beyond .
That 's a lot of web interface .
Right now , we allow players to enter their clan tag , but that 's kind of the extent of the clan support .
I 'd actually like to extend our friends system to support clans .
So , not only would you have your friends list , but you could have a separate list , effectively , that 's your clan .
I see clan support , in general , as being able to join a clan and have that as part of your social management .
I would n't throw that into the category of needing to pay .
The pay service is really more about an extra service , this ability to run a server that we are paying for .
The other obvious comparison to what you guys are doing is InstantAction.com .
They 're , coincidentally I imagine , also opening up to a broader audience the same day .
I just spoke to them yesterday , and they mentioned you had early on discussed possibly collaborating .
MS : If those conversations happened , they were so short that I do n't remember them .
It may have been an email exchange that was , " Hey , what do you think about this ? "
" No , we 're doing our own thing . "
Honestly , I do n't know .
We had one person who , a while ago , was on the InstantAction beta , and we kind of stood over his shoulder while he played a couple things .
But that 's really been the most interaction we 've had .
I checked out how their web statistics trend on some of the different web-statistic sites and different things like that .
But no , we really have n't talked to them at all , and this has really -- from the initial seed from John -- been a totally - id project .
JC : And really , Quake Live does have that .
It has this entire thing wrapped around itself .
It 's not an à la carte product .
And it 's not something where we 're going to be adding in additional games decided on here , or have you fit your game inside this framework .
Everything really has been tuned around the Quake Arena experience .
If things are successful here , we may try to go ahead and build another version , like maybe with the Wolfenstein multiplayer things , but it would be a really significant redesign .
And we think that there 's enough of an experience on here .
Let 's face it , most of the web games are about giving you some mediocre - ish content , but it is free and there 's a lot of it , so be happy about it and maybe pay a little fee on there .
And we do think that this is much more of a top - notch experience that people are getting , and we really do n't want to have it kind of petered next to a bunch of other stuff .
Is there any possibility at any point of mod support ?
Or do you start , at that point , to worry about security issues or fracturing the player base ?
JC : That 's certainly been the biggest thing , since the very beginning , that we 've been asked about .
We are pretty firm on this , that we control everything with the Quake Live project , and that is going to be the way it stays .
We 've tried to integrate specific features that people have liked from a lot of the mods through our work , and to take the things that people universally agree on .
But we definitely do n't have the broad array of really quirky , different things that people could get from mods on here .
We probably will add additional game types and modes of play as time goes on , but it will be coming from a centralized point .
But the upside is that Quake III is out there .
It 's open source .
People can hack anything they want on the code .
And I would expect that the success of Quake Live should be a great invigorator for any mod communities out there because , if we go ahead and get millions of new people playing this , that 's going to lead towards many thousands of people that are willing to go off and do something fringe -- like downloading a completely recompiled executable or hunting down original assets for the game and so on .
We did not think that there was a reasonable way for us to have the complete , free - for - all , do - anything - the - heck - that - you - want mod community that we had with the commercial game in this project .
We 're going to see how that goes .
If anybody else does another project and proves us incorrect on that , it 'll be a data point .
But we certainly still hope to have good communications and relations with everybody that 's sticking with the original Quake Arena codebase .
And , again , I think it will be a positive thing for it .
id Software 's Rage
What do you actually spend most of your time on these days ?
Rage , Doom 4 , Quake Live ?
JC : Almost all of my time is on Rage .
I take a couple days every six months or so to work on various mobile things that I 'm hacking around on .
I have had almost no direct work on the Quake Live project since it was set in motion with my , " Here 's the plan , " a year and a half ago .
All the things that I had thought through pretty much came out just fine .
And it was the things that I was blind - spotted on , the things that I just was n't aware of the challenges of , that have turned out to be where more development time and effort have been required .
So it 's been a learning experience for all of us .
How big is the team for Quake Live ?
MS : We 've had a full team on it for just over a year .
JC : Yeah .
The first beta went open on February , one year ago .
MS : Actually , January .
So , 13 months ago , we added I think 100 people into the beta .
And one of these days , I 'm going to do a forum post or something with a lineage of the Quake Live beta site and the looks that it 's gone through and its functionality , because it 's striking .
Just over a year ago , we hired our web designer , and about a year ago , we had the level designer who has done a lot of the new content .
So we 've had a full team on it for over a year .
JC : And at that point , a year ago , we were looking like , " OK .
This all pretty much works in the game .
Let 's tidy up the web stuff and get it out the door . " [ laughs ]
It has n't quite worked out that way .

Google has rolled out an alpha preview of the next major revision for its Chrome web browser .
Those undaunted by the current alpha status of 2.0 can get an early taste of what ’s to come in Chrome .
The 2.0 preview has a number of new features , including an updated version of the WebKit rendering engine which boasts speed improvements as well as some additional CSS support .
Other new features include bells and whistles missing from the current shipping version , such as form auto - complete , full page zooming , auto - scrolling , better profile support and very experimental support for Greasemonkey scripts .
The Chrome 2.0 alpha also has some big news for for Mac and Linux users who ’d like to try Chrome : Chrome 2.0 uses its own HTTP network library rather than the WinHTTP library on Windows .
The Windows - only HTTP library was one of the main stumbling blocks to cross-platform support and now that it ’s gone the Mac and Linux versions should see some significant progress in the near future .
Chrome is unique among the current field of browsers in that there are three ways to run it — the default , which is simply the latest stable release ( currently 1.0 ) , the beta channel , which offers monthly updates and could have bugs here and there , and the developer channel , which will give you the latest bleeding edge builds and is almost guaranteed to have bugs .
[ For the sake of clarity , what 's unique about Chrome is that you can run the various builds from within the same container app ; whereas , something like Firefox requires separate downloads for each version .
Chrome 's " channels " model , makes it somewhat easier to experiment with with the non-stable versions of the app . ]
The latest Chrome 2.0 preview falls in the developer category and is not recommended for the average user , though if you enable it and it causes problems , it is n’t hard to switch back to the stable version .
If you ’d like to enjoy the auto - complete feature or enable your favorite Greasemonkey scripts , make sure you have Chrome installed and then download the Chrome Channel Changer ( . exe link ) ; run that app and select the developer channel .
Then open Chrome , click the wrench menu and choose “ About Google Chrome ” where you ’ll need to click “ Update Now ” to install the current channel ’s release .
After that you ’ll need to restart Chrome .
If the 2.0 alpha does n’t live up to your stability expectations , just reverse the instructions to get the stable version back .
And remember , Chrome is an open project so you can track the progress of Chrome for Mac and Chrome for Linux .

First on the Obama administration 's to - do list : a stimulus package , bailouts , and ... abortion ?
Given the imperatives of the economic crisis , picking an abortion fight early on would seem highly unlikely .
But the Roman Catholic Church is coordinating a national postcard campaign next month to oppose the Freedom of Choice Act ( FOCA ) .
Abortion opponents fear the new Democratic majority in Washington could succeed in passing the decades - old bill and Barack Obama would make good on what he told Planned Parenthood in July : " The first thing I 'd do as president is sign the Freedom of Choice Act . "
The bill could wipe out federal and state restrictions on abortion such as parental notification and informed consent laws .
Some say FOCA is so broad it would also imperil " conscience clauses " that protect hospitals and doctors who refuse to perform abortions because of their convictions .
That 's led some Catholic leaders to threaten to close their hospitals if FOCA forced them to provide abortions .
Rhetoric aside , it 's not certain that FOCA will move in Congress , much less get passed in its current form .
Scholars are divided on whether the current bill actually jeopardizes conscience clauses – though they agree it is too vague .
" Congress should darn well clarify this , because if we do n't , we will be back where we were when Roe came down and everyone was thrown into a tailspin , " says Robin Wilson , an expert on conscience clauses at Washington and Lee University in Lexington , Va. ( Editor 's note : The original text misstated Ms. Wilson 's affiliation . )
When the Supreme Court legalized abortion , lawsuits began to fly over whether doctors and hospitals could refuse to provide the procedure .
Legislators settled the question by passing conscience clauses in 47 states .
These seek to balance an individual 's or institution 's freedom of conscience with patients ' access to healthcare .
If FOCA undermines conscience clauses – Ms. Wilson says she 's not sure it would – " the floodgates would be opened " for litigation against hospitals and doctors refusing procedures .
Current iterations of FOCA do n't mention conscience clauses , but in 1993 , the last time there was a push on it , the bill was amended to protect the clauses but ultimately failed .
" It was acknowledged by all sides this was [ a danger ] of the FOCA .
And , in fact , the current FOCA is even broader than that one , " says Douglas Johnson , legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee .
The current bill states that " a government may not deny or interfere with a woman 's right to choose " nor " discriminate against the exercise " of that right .
The words " interfere " and " discriminate " jeopardize conscience clauses for Mr. Johnson .
Conscience clauses tend to protect decisions made by doctors and hospitals , not the state .
That leads some experts such as Nancy Berlinger of the Hasting Center , a bioethics research institution , to doubt that FOCA would apply since it is specifically directed at government action .
Lynn Wardle , a law professor at Brigham Young University , sees that argument in principle , not practice .
" I 'm torn about this because I think good , solid legal analysis would say , no , that 's not government action , " he says .
" But I 'm pro-life and that 's the way I view it , and this law [ would be ] enacted by and enforced by people who view any restriction as an interference . "
Many faiths oppose abortion , but few of them are so involved in providing healthcare as the Catholic Church .
One out of every 6 Americans hospitalized in the US receive care at a Catholic facility .
At a gathering of US Catholic bishops last month , Bishop Thomas Paprocki told the Chicago Tribune : " If Catholic hospitals were required by federal law to perform abortions , we'd have to close our hospitals . "
That could leave a hole in the safety net for inner cities and the poor .
But the United States Conference for Catholic Bishops ( USCCB ) is not backing off from its threat .
" I hope it would not come to that , but Catholic hospitals cannot give up their identity , " says Deirdre McQuade , a USCCB spokesperson .
The Catholic Health Association , which represents Catholic hospitals , says it plans to fight against FOCA but wo n't close up shop if it loses .
" In many communities , we are the only health facility .
We in Catholic health care are not going to dismantle that , " said Sr. Carol Keehan , president of the CHA , in a press release .
Both Mr. Obama and the bishops are just playing to an audience , says the Rev. John Paris , a Catholic bioethics expert at Boston College .
" [ A ]ll this rhetoric is so overblown as to be silly , " he says .
" No political office is going to strike down conscience clauses .
That 's been in our laws since 1673 , " when Rhode Island protected wartime objectors .
Underlying that history is the protection of religious freedoms , a principle that would come into play under any interpretation of FOCA invalidating conscience clauses , says Doug Kmiec , a law professor at Pepperdine University .
That 's one reason why Mr. Kmiec , an abortion rights opponent who controversially endorsed Obama , does n't think FOCA is a clear threat to conscience clauses .
" [ Obama 's ] approach is to give emphasis to reducing the incidents of abortion , " says Kmiec .
" My conversations with his [ advisers ] tell me he's not going to push anything in his legislative agenda that 's going to distract him from the economic recovery , certainly for the first year .
Beyond that , nobody is saying anything . "

A video containing the new audio message appeared on the internet A new audio message purported to be from Osama Bin Laden has urged Muslims to launch a holy war to stop the Israeli offensive on the Gaza Strip .
The message also said Israel 's assault was a desperate attempt to benefit from the last days of President George Bush .
It also accused Arab leaders of colluding with the Jewish state .
The US has dismissed the tape , saying it shows the al - Qaeda leader 's isolation , and looks like an attempt to raise money .
" It appears this tape demonstrates his isolation and continued attempts to remain relevant at a time when al Qaeda 's ideology , mission and agenda are being questioned and challenged throughout the world , " White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
" This also looks to be an effort to raise money as part of their ongoing propaganda campaign , " he said .
The FBI meanwhile said it saw " no specific or credible threat " in the message to the inauguration of President - elect Barack Obama .
Up - to - date message
The 22 - minute audio message entitled " A call for jihad to stop the aggression on Gaza " appeared on Islamist websites on Wednesday .
Our brothers in Palestine , you have suffered a lot .... the Muslims sympathise with you in what they see and hear
Osama Bin Laden audio message
If verified , it will be the first audio tape issued by the Saudi - born militant since May 2008 , and comes three weeks after Israel launched its military offensive against Hamas .
Palestinian medical officials said on Wednesday that the number of Palestinians killed in the current fighting with Israel had passed 1,000 .
Thirteen Israelis , including 10 soldiers , have so far been killed .
" Our brothers in Palestine , you have suffered a lot .... the Muslims sympathise with you in what they see and hear .
We , the mujahideen , sympathise with you also , " the new message said .
" We are with you and we will not let you down .
Our fate is tied to yours in fighting the Crusader - Zionist coalition , in fighting until victory or martyrdom . "
There was " only one strong way to bring the return of al - Aqsa and Palestine , and that is jihad in the path of God " , referring to the al - Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem , one of the holiest sites in Islam .
The speaker also warned Muslims not to rely on Arab leaders , the majority of whom he said were " allied with the Crusader - Zionist coalition " .
Israel launched its campaign against militants in Gaza on 27 December
There was also an appeal for donations to finance the fight - " tithes from any of the great Muslim or Arab traders " would be enough " for jihad on all fronts " .
President Bush , the message said , was leaving his successor with a " heavy inheritance " and he doubted that the US could continue fighting al - Qaeda for decades .
" If he withdraws from the war , it is a military defeat .
If he continues , he drowns in economic crisis . "
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says the voice is the same , if sounding a little tired , but the message from the world 's number - one fugitive is right up to date .
Western counter - terrorism officials had been starting to wonder if he might quietly fade away , handing over to his deputy , Ayman al - Zawahiri , our correspondent says .
Probably the last thing the outgoing President Bush wanted to hear in his final week in office was the man behind the 9/11 attacks and a reminder that he has never been caught , he adds .
Bin Laden has a multi-million dollar bounty on his head .
Our correspondent says that wherever he is hiding , be it in Afghanistan or Pakistan , his close followers are clearly intensely loyal .

There was a recent question on Haskell - cafe about how to parallelize a simple “ rule engine ” .
I spent a while investigating it , and the solution is both pretty and fast .
And my response on haskell - cafe is really messy because gmail is silly .
So here is my response , cleaned up , in literate Haskell :
> {-# LANGUAGE RankNTypes #-} > > import qualified Data .
MemoCombinators as Memo > import qualified Data .
Set as Set > import Control .
Parallel ( par ) > import qualified Control .
Parallel .
Strategies as Par > import Data .
Monoid ( Monoid ( .. ) ) > import Control .
Monad .
State > import qualified Data .
DList as DList >
First , I want to capture the idea of a generative set like you ’re doing .
GenSet is like a set , with the constructor “ genset x xs ” which says “ if x is in the set , then so are xs ” .
I ’ll represent it as a stateful computation of the list of things in the set , threading the set of things we ’ve seen so far .
It ’s redundant information , but sets ca n’t be consumed lazily , thus the list ( the set will follow along lazily :-) .
Remember that State s a is just the function ( s -> ( s , a ) ) .
So we ’re taking the set of things we ’ve seen so far , and returning the new elements added and the set unioned with those elements .
> newtype GenSet a > = GenSet ( State ( Set .
Set a ) ( DList .
DList a ) ) > > genset :: ( Ord a ) => a -> GenSet a -> GenSet a > genset x ( GenSet f ) = GenSet $ do > seen <- gets ( x ` Set . member ` ) > if seen > then return mempty > else fmap ( DList .
cons x ) $ > modify ( Set . insert x ) >> f > > toList :: GenSet a -> [ a ] > toList ( GenSet f ) = DList .
toList $ evalState f Set .
empty
GenSet is a monoid , where mappend is just union .
> instance ( Ord a ) =>
Monoid ( GenSet a ) where > mempty = GenSet ( return mempty ) > mappend ( GenSet a ) ( GenSet b ) = > GenSet ( lift M2 mappend a b )
Okay , so that ’s how we avoid exponential behavior when traversing the tree .
We can now just toss around GenSets like they ’re sets and everything will be peachy .
Here ’s the heart of the algorithm : the reduce function .
To avoid recomputation of rules , we could just memoize the rule function .
But we ’ll do something a little more clever .
The function we ’ll memoize ( “ parf ” ) first sparks a thread computing its * last * child .
Because the search is depth - first , it will typically be a while until we get to the last one , so we benefit from the spark ( you do n’t want to spark a thread computing something you ’re about to compute anyway ) .
> reduce :: ( Ord a ) =>
Memo .
Memo a -> ( a -> [ a ] ) -> a -> [ a ] > reduce memo f x = toList ( makeSet x ) > where > makeSet x = genset x .
mconcat . map makeSet . f ' $ x > f ' = memo parf > parf a = let ch = f a in > ch `seq` ( f ' ( last ch ) `par` ch )
The ch `seq` is there so that the evaluation of ch and last ch are n’t competing with each other .
Your example had a few problems .
You said the rule was supposed to be expensive , but yours was cheap .
Also , [ x - 1 , x - 2 , x - 3 ] are all very near each other , so it ’s hard to go do unrelated stuff .
I made a fake expensive function before computing the neighbors , and tossed around some prime numbers to scatter the space more .
> rule :: Int -> [
Int ] > rule n = expensive `seq` > [ next 311 4 , next 109 577 , next 919 353 ] > where > next x y = ( x * n + y ) `mod` 5000 > expensive = sum [ 1 .. 50 * n ] > > main :: IO ( ) > main = do > let r = reduce Memo .
integral rule 1 > print ( length r )
The results are quite promising :
% ghc -- make - O2 rules2 - threaded % time ./ rules2 5000 ./ rules2 13.25s user 0.08s system 99 % cpu 13.396 total % time ./rules2 +RTS - N2 5000 ./rules2 +RTS - N2 12.52s user 0.30s system 159 % cpu 8.015 total
That ’s 40 % decrease in running time !
Woot !
I ’d love to see what it does on a machine with more than 2 cores .
The Morien Institute has kept a close watch on developments since 1999 , and has been just as excited about the many new batches of underwater photographs that have emerged of the Yonaguni structures ( yes ! there are more than one ) , as we have been dismayed by the many citings of the structure 's existence as somehow representing ' the final proof ' of the existence of Atlantis and / or Lemuria .
We have consistently taken the simple view that , following the dramatic series of rises in sea-levels that marked the ending of the last Ice Age , it is inevitable that more and more evidence of ancient civilisation will be discovered on the continental shelves and shallow seas , and even further out in the oceans everywhere around the world .
Peoples in ancient times were not much different from those of today .
They had a preference for building their settlements near to the sea for exactly the same reasons as we do - ports for the ships conducting foreign trade , and nearby urban developments for those involved with sea - borne trade , with fishing , as well as a simple liking for living near the seaside on coastal plains
But most of the coastal plains of the last Ice Age have long since been underwater , and The Morien Institute can confidently predict that the future for marine archaeology certainly looks very bright indeed ... " Underwater Japanese Pyramid ' Manmade '
say Scientists "
On May 19 2001 a report on Whitley Strieber 's Unknown Country website that is no longer archived brought news that Frank Joseph , editor of " Ancient American Magazine " , would speak that night on " Dreamland " about a conference he recently attended in Japan at which Japanese geologists and archaeologists argued that the sunken pyramid structure off the coast of the island of Yonaguni near Okinawa , Japan , has been found to be man-made .
It reported that : " The structure was found by dive tour operator Kihachiro Aratake in 1985 and has been a source of controversy ever since .
It appears to be a construction made of wide terraces , ramps and large steps .
However , American geologists have contended that the structure is not manmade , but a natural formation .
According to the report , Japanese scientists have documented marks on the stones that indicate that they were hewn .
Not only that , the tools used in this process have been found in the area , and carvings have been discovered .
A small stairway carved into the rocks appears to render the theory that this is a natural formation implausible . "
Copyright 1999 Dr. Robert M. Schoch .
The report that this enigmatic underwater structure has shown more evidence of being man-made , also offered the opinion that ' American geologists ' have claimed that the structure is not man-made , and is a natural formation .
But this contention was itself out - of - focus : " It appears to be a construction made of wide terraces , ramps and large steps .
However , American geologists have contended that the structure is not manmade , but a natural formation . "
Presumably , they were referring to Dr. Robert M. Schoch , a geologist who has dived on the structure for inspection a number of times since 1997 , and whose comments seem to have been misunderstood by some academics , while being dismissed totally by increasingly desperate Atlantis - seekers .
Dr Schoch has made it clear that he feels the structure was primarily a natural structure that people in ancient times had carved out of the ' living bedrock ' and enhanced to suit their purposes .
His actual comments in 1999 were : " We should also consider the possibility that the Yonaguni Monument is fundamentally a natural structure that was utilized , enhanced , and modified by humans in ancient times . "
This type of activity seems to have been widely used in ancient times all over the archaic world , and has become known as ' terra - forming ' - nature suggests a shape , and human hands go to work to modify it as they want or need it to look .
This could have been done for ritual purposes , or for purely practical ones .
No - one can yet say for sure .
According to the report of the 2001 conference in Japan , there have been a number of discoveries recently that add a great deal of weight to the theory that the structure was certainly ' terra - formed ' at least by ancient people : " Japanese scientists have documented marks on the stones that indicate that they were hewn .
Not only that , the tools used in this process have been found in the area , and carvings have been discovered .
A small stairway carved into the rocks appears to render the theory that this is a natural formation implausible .
The problem with all of this for western scientists is that it implies that an unknown eastern culture had developed a high degree of organization thousands of years before the earliest western civilizations .
Geologically , the Yonaguni pyramid sank into the ocean at the end of the last ice age , around ten thousand years ago .
Some western geologists have theorized that , if it is manmade , it must have risen from the sea in more recent times , and been carved then .
However , the discovery of other , similar structures beneath the sea of Japan was also announced at the conference .
If these prove to be similar to the Yonaguni pyramid they may rewrite the history of early man . "
Studies of the structures , such as that conducted over the past ten years or so by Professor Masaaki Kimura , a marine geologist at the Department of Physics and Earth Sciences at the University of the Ryukyus , Okinawa , were responsible for initiating the debate that currently rages about the Yonaguni ' monument ' .
In September 1997 Dr Schoch dived on the structure for the first time .
He had been invited there by Graham Hancock , who was at the time researching " Heaven 's Mirror " , filming a series of TV programmes , and presumably laying the groundwork for his recent book " Underworld " .
Prof. Kimura & Dr. Schoch on Yonaguni Island 1999
Whilst there , Dr Schoch debated the structure , and the local geology of nearby Yonaguni Island , with Professor Masaaki Kimura , whose work on the underwater structures in that area had come to the attention of Graham Hancock some time earlier , and had featured in his books and on the television programmes that he presented .
The controversy that had developed over the next few years was covered in The Japan Times on July 19 2000 , which also reported on the ancient myths and legends of the Okinawa region : " In Okinawan folklore , there are tales of traditional gods and a land of the gods called Nirai - Kanai , an unknown faraway land from where happiness is brought .
Kimura said the Yonaguni Monument may have been built to serve a similar deity . "
In order to progress the debate further , and to get more information and access to more images of the structures found underwater off the coast of Yonaguni - jima , The Morien Institute contacted Professor Kimura in July 2002 , and in a series of emails over the next few months conducted an interview with him about his work on the Yonaguni structures , and similar discoveries in the same geographical area .
Below you can access the exclusive Morien Institute interview with Professor Kimura completed in October 2002 , and also take a closer look at the opinions of Dr. Robert M. Schoch in his own words .

No doubt we will be hearing a lot more from the Yonaguni area in the near future , as structures have been recently discovered underwater off other Japanese islands such as Chatan and Kerama , and we are reliably informed that walls , and possibly ancient roads , have been discovered in the Straits of Taiwan , about 20 - 30 feet underwater between the island of Taiwan and mainland China .
History 's Mysteries " Do undersea relics near Okinawa offer proof of a sophisticated civilization during the last ice age ?
Archeologists have long believed that civilization as they define it -- intelligent , tool - making , monument building , social humans -- began about 5,000 years ago .
But submerged beneath the waves near the Japanese island of Yonaguni is evidence that may well overturn that long - held theory .
A small but persuasive number of scholars and scientists have long thought that " advanced " societies may have existed as long as 10,000 years ago .
Their theories , however well reasoned and defended , have been hamstrung by a lack of evidence .
But recent discoveries of man-made artifacts on the Pacific seafloor may well prove to be the smoking gun that will propel this alternative view of civilization to prominence " .

The winner of the best in show prize at the 2009 Westminster Dog Show was chosen yesterday .
He was a Sussex Spaniel named Stump who was 10 years old , the equivalent of 70 in human years .
Way to go old fella .
You beat out seven youngins for the premier prize at the country 's oldest dog show .
Final contestants included a Scottish deerhound named Tiger Woods , a Puli known for its dreadlocks and a nervous Scottish terrier .
A couple years ago , my coworker and I were discussing our bucket lists , you know , the list of things you want to accomplish or see before you die .
He mentioned his dad ’s biggest wish was to go to the Super Bowl , and we got on the topic of buying Super Bowl tickets .
All we knew about buying Super Bowl tickets was that it is very expensive , and it helps to know someone .
So we looked it up for fun .
We learned that it is surprisingly easy to buy Super Bowl tickets – if you have the money to buy them on the second hand market !
Otherwise , you need to know someone , or have the luck of the Irish !
How to Buy Super Bowl Tickets
The first thing you need to know is how the NFL distributes Super Bowl tickets .
The distribution of Super Bowl tickets goes to a mixture of players , coaches and NFL personnel , season ticket holders , corporate sponsors , and the general public .
Here is the Super bowl ticket distribution from Super Bowl XLII :
AFC Champion — 17.5 percent
NFC Champion — 17.5 percent
Host Team — 5.0 percent
Other 29 Teams — 34.8 percent
NFL — 25.2 percent
75 % of all tickets go to the NFL teams , with each team in the game receiving a total of 35 % , the host team receiving 5 % , and the rest of the teams receiving just over 1 % each .
The tickets allotted to the NFL are used for corporate sponsors , the broadcast network , affiliated companies , charities , fans , and more .
NFL Random Drawing for Super Bowl Tickets
The only method the NFL has to distribute tickets to the public is through a random drawing ; there is no other way for the general public to purchase tickets from the NFL .
The NFL also does not sell tickets to travel or ticket agents .
The lottery system is free to enter and those selected have the opportunity to purchase up to two tickets at face value .
Unfortunately , there is a very limited number of available tickets , some sources stating only 500 tickets are sold to the general public in any given year .
Entries for the random drawing are accepted between Feb. 1 and June 1 of the year preceding the game and winners are notified by mail in October or November .
All ticket requests must be sent via certified or registered mail .
To enter into the random Super Bowl Ticket drawing , send a letter to :
Super Bowl Random Drawing
P.O. Box 49140
Strongsville , OH 44149-0140
Please note that only one request per address is accepted and duplicate requests will be disregarded .
Buying Super Bowl Tickets from Players and Season Ticket Holders
Most teams give a set number of Super Bowl tickets to their players and personnel , then hold a random drawing for their season ticket holders to distribute the remaining tickets .
This can create a secondary market for the tickets .
Many of the tickets that end up in the hands of ticket agencies ( see below ) were purchased from season ticket holders and team personnel .
Players and coaches are not permitted to resell their tickets for more than face value , but it happens under the table .
Super Bowl Ticket Trivia :
The NFL ’s anti-scalping policy was brought to the nation ’s attention in 2005 when Vikings head coach Mike Tice was caught scalping his Super Bowl tickets .
He was fined $ 100,000 by the NFL and let go by the Vikings the following season .
Buy from a Ticket Agency
Every major ticket agency will have Super Bowl tickets .
Check out RazorGator , TickCo , StubHub , Ticketmaster .
These are reputable companies and offer a guarantee , which is something you wo n’t get if you are buying them over Ebay , Craigslist , or from a ticket scalper .
If you are going purchase Super Bowl tickets online , get them from a reputable agency .
How much do Super Bowl Tickets cost ?
The rate varies depending on several factors , including seat location , hype for the game , who is playing , venue , etc .
Buy from a Scalper
Caution , caution , caution !
Before going this route , be sure you know the laws of the land .
Scalping is not legal in every state , so you want to ensure you remain on the right side of the law .
Additionally , there may be specific laws against scalping within certain cities or even on the premises of the sporting event itself .
Next , recognize that you are dealing with people you do n’t know and a lot of cash ( try finding a scalper who will accept anything other than cash ) .
Do your research to find out as much as you can about the current street price of the tickets , and be wary of any seats being sold below the current rate .
In short , be prepared to shell out some serious cash .
You also want to do as much research as you can regarding the actual tickets .
Find out what some of the security features are .
Ask the scalper to see the tickets .
If they do n’t have them available at the moment then ask when you can meet up to see the tickets .
( This is common because scalpers often work in teams and do n’t want to have thousands of dollars worth of tickets on them all the time ) .
You may wish to see several sets of tickets before you are comfortable you are receiving a legitimate ticket .
I ’ve heard that some venues and teams offer broker zones , so look into this .
Above all , be cautious .
Be careful carrying large sums of cash ( arrange to meet the ticket scalper at a predetermined time and place if necessary ) , and remember that with scalpers , all sales are final .

Before you venture into Ciudad Juarez , brace yourself to hear Texans tell you that you 're crazy .
Visiting friends in neighboring El Paso a few days before Christmas , I was immediately warned , " Do n't even think about going into Juarez . "
Just across the shallow creek known as the Rio Grande from El Paso , one of the safest cities of its size in the nation , Juarez is a city under siege , the worst victim of Mexico 's growing wars between drug cartels .
The tragedy is etched in daily news headlines .
The same day I arrived , two Mexican police offers were ambushed , shot to death while sitting in their patrol car .
Just another bloody day in Juarez .
Hardly a day goes by without a new Juarez horror story in the El Paso Times :
" Man found dead with hands severed . "
" Prominent Juarez lawyer , son , among four found dead Tuesday . "
" Man found shot to death in trash drum . "
" El Paso charities afraid to cross border . "
" Juarez area slayings top 20 in new year . "
Murders across Mexico more than doubled last year to more than 5,600 .
That 's more than the total Americans lost so far in the Iraq war .
Most of those murders have been happening in border towns .
More than 1,600 were killed in Juarez , Mexico 's fourth largest city , with a population of 1.7 million .
The bloodbath of unspeakable brutality includes kidnappings and decapitated bodies left in public places as a grisly form of advertising .
" There have already been 20 murders in Juarez this year , " Beto O'Rourke , a member of El Paso 's city council , told me in a telephone interview this week as President - elect Barack Obama met with Mexico 's President Felipe Calderon Monday .
" That does n't include the kidnappings and extortions .
Ciudad Juarez is essentially a failed city at this point .
They can't guarantee your safety . "
The situation is deteriorating so fast that " Mexico is on the edge of abyss , " retired four - star Gen .
Barry McCaffrey , a drug czar under President Clinton , said .
" It could become a narco - state in the coming decade , " he wrote in a recent report , and the result could be a " surge of millions of refugees " crossing the U.S. border to escape .
Something drastic needed to be done , O'Rourke , a fourth - generation El Paso resident , decided .
A proposed city council resolution called for more federal action on both sides of the border to reduce the flow of guns and drugs .
But it was n't strong enough .
O'Rourke pushed things further by adding 12 words : " supporting an honest , open , national debate on ending the prohibition on narcotics . "
The council passed it unanimously .
Yet even a bid to talk about drug legalization was too much for Mayor John Cook .
He vetoed the bill , at least partly out of concern that Washington might not take the measure seriously with the drug legalization line in it .
Nevertheless , the controversy brought what has been rare American media attention to Mexico 's crisis by turning it into radio and cable TV talk fodder .
That 's a start .
Obama promised more American help to Calderon in a meeting that focused on trade , immigration and the drug war .
President Bush successfully pushed the Merida initiative , a $ 1.4 billion security package to help Mexico with high - tech equipment and anti-drug training .
The first $ 400 million , approved by Congress last year , has begun to flow .
But the rest of the funds could be slowed by the many other financial pressures this country and the incoming Obama administration faces .
And Calderon faces mounting pressures on his two - year - old campaign against drug and gun smuggling .
The campaign that actually touched off much of the fighting between the cartels .
It has also exposed corruption that reached the highest levels of his government .
Even a member of his security team has been arrested for allegedly feeding information to the cartels in exchange for money .
When you step back and take a broad look at Mexico 's growing carnage , it 's easy to see why El Paso 's city leaders think legalization does n't look so bad .
Mexico 's drug problem is not the drugs .
It is the illegality of the drugs .
Legalization is not the perfect solution .
But treating currently illegal drugs in the way we treat liquor and other legal addictive substances would provide regulation , tax revenue and funds for rehabilitation programs .
Most satisfying , it would wipe a lot of smiles off the current drug lords ' faces .
D'oh !
Bart Simpson actress angers TV bosses by using his voice to promote Scientology event
Aye carumba !
Scientologist Nancy Cartwright - the voice behind Bart Simpson - used his voice in an advert for the religion
She 's famous for being the voice of perennially naughty cartoon character Bart Simpson .
But it seems actress Nancy Cartwright could be in a spot of trouble for a ' prank call ' of her own .
The actress used her character 's world - famous voice to promote an upcoming Scientology event .
Executives at 20th Century
Fox are reported to be fuming after Cartwright recorded a voicemail message using her ' Bart ' voice to boost turn - out for the event at the organisation 's Hollywood centre .
The message begins with Cartwright introducing herself as Bart in the character 's voice .
She says : ' Hey , what ’s happening man , this is Bart Simpson ! ' - and laughs using Bart ’s trademark chuckle .
The actress - who is a Scientologist - then reveals her true identity , saying : ' Just kidding , do n't hang up , this is Nancy Cartwright .
This is a very special phone call to you .'
During the 59 - second message she switches between her voice and Bart's , ending several sentences with the word ' man ' .
' It 's gonna be a blast man ! ' she says in Bart 's voice , chuckling before describing what she will be speaking about at the event in Los Angeles on January 31 .
Blogger Perez Hilton posted the audio on the internet on Wednesday but it was quickly removed due to a copyright claim by 20th Century Fox when the story made headlines , according to The Times .
Simpson 's executive producer Al Jean said : ' This is not authorised by us .
'' The Simpsons ' does not , and never has , endorsed any religion , philosophy or system of beliefs any more profound than Butterfinger bars , ' according to TV gossip website The Live Feed .
Cartwright , has voiced Bart for more than 20 years - and took part in a 1998 episode which poked fun at her religion .
The episode called ' The Joy of Sect , ' sees the Simpson family join a cult called the Movementarians , based in part on Scientology .
The 52 - year - old became a Scientologist in 1989 and has donated thousands of dollars to the Church founded by L. Ron Hubbard .
The actress credits the celebrity - infested religion for much of what she has achieved .
Other celebrity Scientology followers include Tom Cruise , John Travolta and pop star Beck .
Joe the Copywriter ( whose identity we ’re not revealing yet ) was fired less than 24 hours after we posted an article with him railing on his incompetent bosses at the Yellow Pages company .
He gloated that these Just - For - Men - highlight - wearing - morons were too clueless to fire him .
But he spoke too soon .
It seems there is something those execs are very good at : running a Gestapo - style espionage operation against their employees .

The way Ron Paul tells it , his more than 30 years of speaking and writing about money , inflation , and the Federal Reserve System attracted only limited interest outside libertarian and constitutionalist circles .
The subject , and Paul as its spokesman , were scarcely to be found in the media , even — or perhaps especially — on the business networks .
But Paul ’s 2008 presidential bid changed that .
Suddenly the Fed was on the table for discussion for the first time since Congress established it in 1913 .
With Paul making the evils of central banking and fiat money a theme of his campaign , the issue took on a vigor that few expected .
Even calling for the Fed ’s outright abolition was longer unheard of on the television news networks .
When Paul first raised the issue in his campaign , he had no idea what he was tapping into .
“ I did n’t realize people your age knew so much about money and inflation , ” he told a rally at the University of Pittsburgh last year .
“ But it gets the largest applause at college campuses .
I figured the first time it happened [ at the University of Southern California ] it was an accident . …
But then at the University of Michigan , they started to burn Federal Reserve Notes . ”
To Paul ’s surprise , some of his loudest applause lines involved salvos against the Fed .
Chants of “ End the Fed ! ” greeted his denunciations of the economic damage the central bank was unleashing .
An underappreciated reason for Paul ’s fundraising prowess was his outspoken opposition to the Fed , a subject that had long been off limits in American politics .
Eventually , a national organization called End the Fed , with local chapters around the country , gave institutional expression to the issue , sponsoring a series of demonstrations against the central bank in 39 cities last November .

The Best of Tom Woods

Newsbeat reporter
Men in their 20s are increasingly becoming victims of abuse Men in their early 20s are just as likely to be abused by their partners as women , according to the latest government figures seen by Newsbeat .
6.4 % of men in England and Wales between the ages of 20 and 24 say they were victims over the last year , compared with 5.4 % of women .
The official definition of partner abuse includes non-physical forms like emotional bullying .
It also means more serious behaviour like threats and severe force .
' Women more likely '
Overall women are more likely to be abused in general and to be the victims of stronger physical violence .
Across all age ranges , one in four women have been abused compared with one in six men .
But analysis of the latest figures from the Home Office shows the problem is more evenly spread between the sexes in the early stages of a young relationship Mark Brooks from the men's health charity Mankind reckons the issue of male domestic abuse is often ignored by the government , social services and the police .
More and more men will come forward when they realise they are not the only ones being abused
Kevin Edgar from Masa
" In the UK as a whole there are 500 refuges for female victims and that is probably not enough , " he told Newsbeat .
" There are only 12 for male victims .
Overall services for men are 35 years behind those available for women and that 's simply not good enough . "
Women are still more likely to be repeatedly abused in the home than men and to be physically harmed .
The latest Home Office figures for 2007 / 8 show 2.2 % of women of any age said their partner used minor or severe force against them over the last year .
The figure for men was slightly lower at 2.0 % .
Have you been the victim of male domestic abuse ?
Kevin Edgar from Masa , which operates a helpline for abused men , says blokes can be slow to come forward and recognise the problem .
" Often there are children involved and they do n't want to leave them with a violent partner .
They do feel a sense of shame in what 's happened even though that 's illogical .
" More and more men will come forward when they realise they are not the only ones being abused . "
Scotland and Northern Ireland In Northern Ireland 8 % of men said they had experienced domestic violence in 2007 / 8 compared with 15 % of women .
The figures for the region show more 16 to 29 - year - olds said they are victims than 30 to 59 - year - olds .
Estimating the level of male domestic abuse in Scotland is more difficult as statistics are obtained from police reports instead of an anonymous survey .
Official figures from the Scottish government show a 2 % rise in overall domestic abuse in 2007 / 8. 12 % of all recorded incidents involved a male victim and female perpetrator up from 8 % in 2000 / 1 although campaigners say that figure underestimates the scale of the problem as men are less likely to file an official police report than women .
Read :
One man 's story A Home Office spokesman said : " The government is committed to working with our partners to reach across communities to victims and potential victims .
" Our national domestic violence delivery plan ensures perpetrators are brought to justice whilst providing the best possible help for victims and their children " We continue to make significant progress in our drive to tackle domestic violence by , for example , the expansion of specialist domestic violence courts , multi-agency risk assessment conferences and independent domestic violence advisers , in addition to funding a matrix of national helplines , including the national 24 - hour freephone Domestic Violence Helpline and the Men's Advice Line . "
On Tuesday Home Secretary Jacqui Smith announced a £ 3.5 m package to help victims of domestic abuse .
The money will be used to safeguard the future of helplines and provide leaflets which will help families and friends of victims to identify and support them .

Scott Horton praises the Anchorage Daily News :
[ ADN ] shows what a local paper with limited resources and reach can do , not only for its immediate readership , but for the country as a whole .
In the 2008 presidential campaign , no local paper made a stronger contribution to our understanding of the presidential campaign .
In fact I am tempted to put the Anchorage Daily News in head - on competition with industry leaders such as The New York Times , Washington Post , and Wall Street Journal .
The ADN took advantage of its position as the principal newspaper of Alaska and offered Americans a deep glance into the problems and scandals that affect the state ’s politics .
It was prepared to expose the sores that a less rigorously professional paper would happily have covered up in the interests of parochialism .
And it was unflinching but also rigorously fair in its coverage of and editorializing on Alaska ’s native daughter , Sarah Palin .
The business leaders gathered at a golf club in Ham Lake seemed a perfect audience for a conservative Republican seeking reelection and respite from two weeks of turmoil .
Then came the stories .
A sod farmer , a caterer , an electrical contractor and others told Rep. Michele Bachmann that business was down .
" I'm a frustrated Republican , " said Bill Nelson , 72 , who works in real estate .
" My own kids wo n't vote Republican this year .
We 're not seeing the leadership in Washington . "
The scene played out as Bachmann and Democrat Elwyn Tinklenberg hustled for votes late this week in Minnesota 's Sixth Congressional District , a once reliably Republican area shaken up by economic woes and controversial remarks by the incumbent .
The race , which has gained national attention , is now considered a tossup , and both sides were reinforcing their ground campaign this weekend with more TV ads financed by a flood of money from partisans around the country .
In a series of stops , Bachmann moved to shift the conversation away from her televised comment that Barack Obama may have anti-American views and onto safer topics such as her call for cutting taxes .
She found some support .
At the Ham Lake City Hall , she asked Council Member Julie Braastad , " What are you hearing from residents ? "
Braastad , 46 , replied , " Do n't raise taxes . "
But Tinklenberg did his best in a debate and campaign stops to keep the controversy alive .
He did n't have to try hard .
" El , Michele Bachmann is making your life easy for you , " Barbara Schweiger , 61 , told him as he stopped at her table in a bar in Anoka .
Tagging along with both candidates were reporters from the BBC , drawn by the flap over Bachmann 's comments and viewing the close contest as symptomatic of Republican troubles in 2008 .
On the trail , Bachmann delivers a simple message :
She 's against abortion , against raising taxes on anyone , and against the $ 700 billion financial Wall Street rescue package .
Tinklenberg 's message is more nuanced .
He supports abortion rights .
He favors tax cuts for the middle class but is open to raising taxes on the wealthy .
He saw the Wall Street rescue package as a necessary evil to avert a worse crisis .
He reminded voters that as state transportation commissioner he pushed for a commuter rail system that is about to open in the district , where increased population has led to traffic snarls .
Bachmann on the road
She repeated her call to open restricted areas for more oil drilling to bring down gas prices , and suggested that she had something to do with the recent price decline , which economists attribute to slackened demand .
" That was one of my goals , to see us get back to $ 2 a gallon , and we 're almost there , " she told sod farmer John Hogdal , 58 , who has been hurt by high prices for oil - based fertilizer .
" I love Sarah Palin for drill and drill everywhere , " he replied .
Bachmann 's comments about Obama and Congress have sparked angry e-mails and calls to her campaign , but the owner of an engineering firm told her , " I admire your being able to stand up to the majority " in the U.S. House .
Touring small businesses , Bachmann chatted with people sanding , drilling and soldering metal at one firm , telling one worker she used to solder things when she was young on a relative 's farm .
She asked another if he liked working a 10 - hour shift four days a week .
" Love them , " he said .
Tinklenberg 's travels
In swings through Andover and Anoka , Tinklenberg reached out to voters upset with the economy and Bachmann .
At a coffee shop in Andover , Luke McLain , 33 , told Tinklenberg he'd vote for him .
McLain called himself " conservative overall , but not extreme . "
He said he had voted for Bachmann in 2006 but he was bothered by her remark that Obama " may have anti-American views " and her stance on social issues .
At another coffee shop , Daniel Stein , 43 , told Tinklenberg he has multiple sclerosis and complained about high drug prices .
Tinklenberg said he favored lifting a ban on the government negotiating drug prices for the disabled and elderly .
You 're an unfunny person if you say " That 's what she said ! " all the time .

Yes , say hello to the " That 's What She Said " iPhone app .
It 's pretty straightforward : it 's a big red button that says TWSS .

I 'd say at least it 's free , but really , you should get paid for using such a horrible app .

Feb 10 , 2009 ( CIDRAP News ) – News reports that Panasonic Corp. has asked some of its overseas employees to send their families home to Japan because of the threat of pandemic influenza fueled puzzlement and speculation today about the global H5N1 risk and whether other companies might follow suit .
Bloomberg News reported that in December 2008 Panasonic asked employees in some of its Asian offices ( excluding Singapore ) , Africa , Eastern Europe , and South America to send their families back to Japan by September .
Akira Kadota , a Panasonic spokesman , told Bloomberg that the request to employees is an element of its pandemic planning .
" We chose areas after considering the prevalence of bird flu and the capability of medical facilities and access to them , " he said .
Earlier this month , Panasonic announced that it was cutting 15,000 jobs and anticipated a loss this year .
However , Kadota told Bloomberg that bringing the employee families home from certain areas was n't a cost - cutting measure .
China and Egypt have recently reported human H5N1 cases , a typical pattern during cooler seasons , but avian flu experts have not reported any mutations that would make the virus more transmissible among humans , and global health officials have not raised the H5N1 alert level .
Gregory Hartl , a spokesman for the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , told CIDRAP
News that there has been no change in the perceived pandemic threat level that might explain Panasonic 's action .
" We are still at pandemic phase 3 , " Hartl commented by e-mail .
" The behavior of the virus remains the same now as in past years : an upturn in cases in the northern hemisphere winter months , but with the epidemiology remaining the same ( little if any human to human transmission , and no sustained human to human transmission within the community ) .
There is no public health justification for acting differently now from in previous years . "
A senior US government official who asked to remain anonymous told CIDRAP News today that though the pandemic threat persists and the need for preparations is critical , officials see no increased threat that would prompt any revisions of their pandemic advice or warning messages to Americans living abroad .
Michael T. Osterholm , PhD , MPH , director of the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy , publisher of CIDRAP News and the CIDRAP Business Source , said he fielded a number of calls today from people in several business sectors who were worried about the significance of Panasonic 's move .
" They wanted to know if this is for real , " he said .
Penny Turnbull , PhD , senior director for crisis management and business continuity planning for Marriott International , Inc. , said she was surprised and perplexed by Panasonic 's decision , given that there has been no significant change in the number , location , or transmission of avian flu infections in humans .
She said the implications for other companies are n't clear .
" Companies might wonder on what intelligence Panasonic based this decision , but I find it hard to believe that any will be following suit in the near future , though they might start monitoring the news more closely for some time to come , " said Turnbull , who is also an editorial board member of the CIDRAP Business Source .
Osterholm said heightened concern over the Panasonic news is a reminder that a company 's decisions can have far - reaching unintended consequences and that in the early days a pandemic is likely to generate hysteria , not factual or science - based information .
He also said that Panasonic 's decision is n't a breaking news story , because the company reportedly issued the new policy in December .
" If this was a real pandemic concern , companies would have minutes to hours , not weeks to months , to prepare for this , " he said .
Panasonic 's decision to repatriate the families of employees in some of its locations raises more questions about the company 's motives or if its risk assessment is seriously flawed , Osterholm added .
" This tells me how ill prepared some of these companies are , " he said .
Bloomberg News published its initial story on Panasonic 's request to its foreign employees last night , citing a Nikkei news story that did not quote any Panasonic sources .
That prompted a handful of editors from prominent pandemic flu blogs , such as Avian Flu Diary and A Pandemic Chronicle , to swing into action , said Sharon Sanders , editor - in - chief of FluTrackers , a well - known Web message board that focuses on avian flu developments .
The editors met online late last night to coordinate their coverage of the story and ask their contributors to translate foreign - language information on the Panasonic development , Sanders told CIDRAP News .
She said she connected with Panasonic 's spokesman in Japan last night to flesh out some of the facts , which Bloomberg obtained and reported in today 's updates of its stories .
A newly deceased Englishman , stands at the pearly gates .
St. Peter tells him that he cannot go to heaven right away because he cheated on his income taxes .
The only way he might get into heaven would be to sleep with a stupid , ugly woman for the next five years and enjoy it .
The Englishman , decides that this is a small price to pay for an eternity in heaven .
So off he goes with this woman , pretending to be happy .
As he walks along , he sees his friend the Scotsman , up ahead – with an even uglier woman .
When he asks what ’s going on , the Scotsman replies “ I cheated on my income taxes and scammed the government out of a lot of money . ”
They both shake their heads in understanding and figure that they might as well hang out together to help pass the time .
Now the Englishman , and Scotsman , and their two ugly women are walking along , minding their own business when they see someone who looks like their old friend the Irishman up ahead .
This man is with an absolutely gorgeous blonde supermodel .
Stunned , the Englishman , and Scotsman approach the man and discover it is their friend the Irishman .
They ask him how it is he ’s with this unbelievable goddess , while they ’re stuck with these god-awful women .
The Irishman replies “ I have no idea , but I ’m definitely not complaining .
This has been absolutely the best time of my life , and I have five years of the best sex any man could hope for to look forward to .
There is only one thing that I can’t seem to understand .
Everytime we finish having sex , she rolls over and murmurs to herself “ Fucking income tax ”

Abstract
The key idea behind active learning is that a machine learning algorithm can perform better with less training if it is allowed to choose the data from which it learns .
An active learner may pose " queries , " usually in the form of unlabeled data instances to be labeled by an " oracle " ( e.g. , a human annotator ) that already understands the nature of the problem .
This sort of approach is well - motivated in many modern machine learning and data mining applications , where unlabeled data may be abundant or easy to come by , but training labels are difficult , time - consuming , or expensive to obtain .
This book is a general introduction to active learning .
It outlines several scenarios in which queries might be formulated , and details many query selection algorithms which have been organized into four broad categories , or " query selection frameworks . "
We also touch on some of the theoretical foundations of active learning , and conclude with an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches in practice , including a summary of ongoing work to address these open challenges and opportunities .

The Government was ordered today to release the minutes of Cabinet meetings where the invasion of Iraq was discussed .
The Information Tribunal upheld a decision by the Information Commissioner that details of the sessions on 13 and 17 March 2003 should be disclosed .
The meetings considered the highly controversial issue of whether the invasion was allowed under international law .
In its ruling , the Tribunal said : " We have decided that the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the formal minutes of two Cabinet meetings at which ministers decided to commit forces to military action in Iraq did not ... outweigh the public interest in disclosure . "
The arguments in favour of keeping the formulation of Government policy secret and preserving the principle of collective responsibility were defeated in this " exceptional case " , the ruling said .
The Tribunal said its decision had been " difficult " and carried by a majority rather than unanimously .
The ruling opens up the prospect of one of the most controversial Government decisions of recent years being laid bare - although the Tribunal stressed that disclosure would not necessarily set a precedent .
The Tribunal said : " The decision to commit the nation 's armed forces to the invasion of another country is momentous in its own right , and ... its seriousness is increased by the criticisms that have been made ( particularly in the Butler Report ) of the general decision - making processes in the Cabinet at the time .
" There has also been criticism of the Attorney General 's legal advice and of the particular way in which the March 17 opinion was made available to the Cabinet only at the last moment and the March 7 opinion was not disclosed to it at all . "
Information Commissioner Richard Thomas said : " I am pleased that the Tribunal has upheld my decision that the public interest in disclosing the official Cabinet minutes in this particular case outweighs the public interest in withholding the information .
" Disclosing the minutes will allow the public to more fully understand this particular decision . "
The Cabinet Office now has 28 days to decide whether to appeal to the High Court against the ruling .
Downing Street said : " The Information Commissioner has just made an announcement on this and we are considering our response . "
The Tribunal said : " The approach adopted during the Cabinet meetings by those who were aware of the March 7 opinion , as well as those who were not , is of crucial significance to an understanding of a hugely important step in the nation 's recent history and the accountability of those who caused it to be taken . "
The public interest in favour of disclosure had not been " significantly reduced " by the fact that inquiries had already been carried out into the invasion .
" In the view of the majority the questions and concerns that remain about the quite exceptional circumstances of the two relevant meetings create a very strong case in favour of the formal records being disclosed , " the ruling stated .
The majority of the three - man panel concluded that the public should be allowed to " make up its own mind " on the discussions .
The " very unusual " nature of the situation " reduced the risk " that releasing the details would set a precedent .
While it accepted the case for releasing formal minutes taken by civil servants , the Tribunal said informal minutes would not " contribute materially to public knowledge or understanding " .
There will also be redactions from the minutes to protect the UK 's international relations .
Shadow foreign secretary William Hague said : " Rather than have items of evidence dragged into the public domain piece by piece the Government should set up a fullscale Privy Council inquiry into the origins and conduct of the Iraq war .
" The sooner we can learn the lessons of the war the sooner we can apply them .
It is imperative to begin an inquiry before memories have faded , emails have been deleted and documents have disappeared . "
That did not mean minutes should only be made public in " extreme circumstances " , but each case would have to be considered on its merits , the ruling added .
Liberal Democrat MP
Sir Menzies Campbell said : " This is a major step forward in explaining the supine attitude of members of the Cabinet towards military action and is clearly in the public interest .
" The Government only have themselves to blame for this .
By procrastinating over an inquiry into the political events before the Iraq war they have left themselves wide open . "
Former Cabinet minister Clare Short , who resigned over Britain 's involvement in Iraq , said today : " I think people will be disappointed about how little the minutes will say .
" For example , they never attribute different points to different people .
They are always in very generalised terms .
" So I think it 's very interesting indeed that the Information Commissioner has said they must be revealed , but I think they will disappoint people . "
Ms Short said there was " very little proper discussion " in the Cabinet , adding : " Cabinet meetings were limited and the minutes are very generalised and limited . "
Asked why the Government did not want the public to see the minutes , she said : " One , it will be revealed what a weak instrument the Cabinet was .
" But secondly , will it go further ?
For example , there are two civil servants , one for home affairs and one for foreign affairs , who take a complete note of everything that 's said .
" Would the courts go on to demand that that was revealed ?
Or the Cabinet Secretary ... takes a full , very complete manuscript note himself .
" Now if those came out , we would really be getting towards a record of what was said . "

ST . CHARLES , Mo. , Jan. 30 ( UPI ) --
A woman in Missouri alleges she got a BLT sandwich from Jack in the Box with blood on the wrapper .
The St. Louis Post - Dispatch reported Friday that Crystal Swiecicki says she found blood on the wrapper of the sandwich she had just eaten .

Swiecicki said blood was on the wrapper , inside the bag and on her pants .
She called the restaurant to see if one of the workers had cut themselves .
She told the newspaper the manager told her he had had a bloody nose while he was working the drive - through window .
Swiecicki said she then called St. Charles police .
Lt. Donovan Kenton said St. Charles police went to the restaurant , but they found no criminal wrongdoing .
Swiecicki , who said she doubts she consumed any of the man 's blood , but said she is upset and looking for a lawyer .
" I 'm freaked out about it , " she said .
" I 'm afraid to eat .
I will not eat at a fast - food restaurant .
I hope to God and pray that I did not get any of it in my mouth . "
US - Latin American relations fell to record lows during the George Bush years , and there have been hopes – both north and south of the border – that President Barack Obama will bring a fresh approach .
So far , however , most signals are pointing to continuity rather than change .
Obama started off with an unprovoked verbal assault on Venezuela .
In an interview broadcast by the Spanish - language television station Univision on the Sunday before his inauguration , he accused Hugo Chávez of having " impeded progress in the region " and " exporting terrorist activities " .
These remarks were unusually hostile and threatening even by the previous administration 's standards .
They are also untrue and diametrically opposed to the way the rest of the region sees Venezuela .
The charge that Venezuela is " exporting terrorism " would not pass the laugh test among almost any government in Latin America .
José Miguel Insulza , the Chilean president of the Organisation of American States , was speaking for almost all the countries in the hemisphere when he told the US Congress last year that " there is no evidence " and that no member country , including the US , had offered " any such proof " that Venezuela supported terrorist groups .
Nor do the other Latin American democracies see Venezuela as an obstacle to progress in the region .
On the contrary , President Lula da Silva of Brazil , along with several other presidents in South America , has repeatedly defended Chávez and his role in the region .
Just a few days after Obama denounced Venezuela , Lula was in Venezuela 's southern state of Zulia , where he emphasised his strategic partnership with Chávez and their common efforts at regional economic integration .
Obama 's statement was no accident .
Whoever fed him these lines very likely intended to send a message to the Venezuelan electorate before last Sunday 's referendum that Venezuela wo n't have decent relations with the US so long as Chávez is their elected president .
( Voters decided to remove term limits for elected officials , paving the way for Chávez to run again in 2013 . )
There is definitely at least a faction of the Obama administration that wants to continue the Bush policies .
James Steinberg , number two to Hillary Clinton in the state department , took a gratuitous swipe at Bolivia and Venezuela during his confirmation process , saying that the US should provide a " counterweight to governments like those currently in power in Venezuela and Bolivia which pursue policies which do not serve the interests of their people or the region . "
Another sign of continuity is that Obama has not yet replaced Bush 's top state department official for the western hemisphere , Thomas Shannon .
The US media plays the role of enabler in this situation .
Thus the Associated Press ignores the attacks from Washington and portrays Chávez 's response as nothing more than an electoral ploy on his part .
In fact , Chávez had been uncharacteristically restrained .
He did not respond to attacks throughout the long US presidential campaign , even when Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden called him a " dictator " or Obama described him as " despotic " – labels that no serious political scientist anywhere would accept for a democratically elected president of a country where the opposition dominates the media .
He wrote it off as the influence of South Florida on US presidential elections .
But there are few if any presidents in the world that would take repeated verbal abuse from another government without responding .
Obama 's advisers know that no matter what this administration does to Venezuela , the press will portray Chávez as the aggressor .
So it 's an easy , if cynical , political calculation for them to poison relations from the outset .
What they have not yet realised is that by doing so they are alienating the majority of the region .
There is still hope for change in US foreign policy toward Latin America , which has become thoroughly discredited on everything from the war on drugs to the Cuba embargo to trade policy .
But as during the Bush years , we will need relentless pressure from the south .
Last September the Union of South American Nations strongly backed Bolivia 's government against opposition violence and destabilisation .
This was very successful in countering Washington 's tacit support for the more extremist elements of Bolivia 's opposition .
It showed the Bush administration that the region was not going to tolerate any attempts to legitimise an extra-legal opposition in Bolivia or to grant it special rights outside of the democratic political process .
Several presidents , including Lula , have called upon Obama to lift the embargo on Cuba , as they congratulated him on his victory .
Lula also asked Obama to meet with Chávez .
Hopefully these governments will continue to assert – repeatedly , publicly and with one voice – that Washington 's problems with Cuba , Bolivia and Venezuela are Washington 's problems , and not the result of anything that those governments have done .
When the Obama team is convinced that a " divide and conquer " approach to the region will fail just as miserably for this administration as it did for the previous one , then we may see the beginnings of a new policy toward Latin America .

Science - based medicine is more than a website .
It is a philosophy of medicine that is actively vying with other philosophies for dominance in the world of medicine .
We believe that medicine should be based upon the best science available , according to a single universal standard of rigorous methodology and valid logic and reason .
Others desire a double - standard , so that they can be free to practice or market whatever they wish without having to meet strict scientific standards .
Still others have a non-scientific ideological world - view and want public policy to accord to , or at least admit , their personal beliefs .
I therefore expect that we will be attacked by proponents of unscientific medicine in all its forms .
Yesterday , however , we were attacked on the Evolution News & Views website of the Discovery Institute by creationist neurosurgeon , Michael Egnor .
This may seem incongruous at first , but honestly I suspected that just such an attack was inevitable .
Many science bloggers , David Gorski and me prominent among them , have taken on both the DI and Dr. Egnor specifically over many anti-scientific arguments he has put forward over the last couple of years .
We have sparred mostly about evolution in medicine , neuroscience and consciousness , and the materialist underpinnings of modern science .
Dr Egnor ’s day job , however , is that of a ( from what I can tell ) respected neurosurgeon , so I always wondered what he thought of his sparring partners ’ writings about science - based medicine .
His entry yesterday ends any speculation – he wrote an incoherent , logical fallacy - ridden screed that would make any snake - oil peddler proud .
This reinforces a point I have made in other contexts – all anti-scientific philosophies have science as a common enemy , and will tend to band together in an “ unholy alliance ” against those advocating for scientific rigor or defending science from ideological attack .
That is why a website that is ostensibly about the “ misreporting of the evolution issue ” would post a blog attacking science - based medicine as an “ arrogant medical priesthood . ”
The Straw Man , False Dichotomy , Non Sequitur
The core of Dr. Egnor ’s claim is a trifecta of logical fallacies .
He writes :
I am not a supporter of “ alternative medicine , ” and I objected when an effort was made some years ago to expand alternative medicine here at Stony Brook .
Alternative medicine , like traditional medicine , must be subjected to strict standards of evidence for safety and efficacy .
Most types of alternative medicine fail to meet those standards , and therefore should not be endorsed by the medical profession .
Yet there is an irony in the efforts of “ defenders of science ” to protect the public from treatments and theories that are outside of the mainstream of medical practice .
The greatest iatrogenic danger to patients is n’t chiropractors or homeopaths or vaccine “ deniers . ”
It ’s the doctors , nurses , and other medical personnel working in the traditional medical paradigm .
Dr. Egnor has clearly not read enough of our writings , or has not made an effort to fairly understand them , to accurately summarize them .
He has earned a reputation as a sloppy thinker and poor scholar for this behavior .
Note that he must agree with what we actually do – advocate for “ strict standards of evidence for safety and efficacy . ”
But he wants to find some way to criticize his ideological foes , so the logical fallacies begin .
First he constructs a straw man – that our goal is to protect the public from “ treatments and theories that are outside of the mainstream of medical practice . ”
He develops this theme further when he writes :
I believe that much of the motivation for the “ pro-science ” priesthood is n’t patient safety or a genuine respect for scientific method but ideological hegemony .
What bothers materialist ideologues like Novella and Orac is that there are people who challenge their materialist scientific worldview .
Any honest reading of Science - Based Medicine , NeuroLogica , or Respectful Insolence gives lie to this claim , which is no different than the accusations we have heard from homeopaths , energy healers , and charlatans of all stripes .
We have clearly written that our purpose is to promote rigorous scientific methodology in medicine .
We talk about method , and the targets of our criticism misinterpret this ( deliberately or otherwise ) as closed - minded “ ideological hegemony . ”
But all we are really saying is that a specific claim does not meet the standards of science and evidence , and that we feel a single science - based standard of care should apply .
Dr. Egnor ’s straw man is well known to us because we have heard it from proponents of unscientific medicine for years .
We might argue , for example , that a particular acupuncture study is unblinded and therefore cannot exclude the placebo effect as solely responsible for the outcome .
We may also challenge that proponents of acupuncture have yet to propose of scientifically plausible mechanism for their claims .
Defenders of acupuncture often counter with the non sequitur that we are biased against acupuncture because it is outside the mainstream and challenges our “ materialism . ”
This does not address our criticisms , however .
Such rejoinders are meant as a diversion – to draw attention away from the fact that a particular claim lacks evidence or plausibility .
Proponents of unscientific medicine also rely upon a false dichotomy – that between “ mainstream ” and “ alternative ” medicine .
The purpose of the double standard is to deflect criticism while simultaneously carving out a double standard for claims that do n’t meet the usual standard .
We have also been very clear that our goal is to return to a single standard of care in medicine based upon good science .
What ’s interesting is that Dr. Egnor can commit the same non sequitur right on the heels of admitting that what we actually do is legitimate .
The cognitive dissonance must be deafening .
Tu Quoque
To defend his self - contradictory position Dr. Egnor must create a fiction that he can then criticize – that we aim our criticism outside of mainstream medicine but not within it .
The harm done by traditional practitioners of medicine is one of the leading causes of death in the United States .
Where is the introspection by “ skeptics ” and “ science defenders ” like Drs. Novella and Orac about the enormous harm done to patients by themselves — traditional medical practitioners ?
What hypocrites .
This again is based upon a false dichotomy that we are trying to dispel , not promote .
We apply the scientific standards we advocate to all of medicine , not just those “ outside the mainstream . ”
It is a point we hammer home over and over , to the point where one must be willfully ignorant to miss it .
“ Where is the introspection ” – one does not have to look far to find it , and so clearly Dr. Egnor did not do his homework ( again , true to his reputation ) .
Just last week I wrote about the abuse of the term “ syndrome ” in medicine .
I did not discriminate according to any false dichotomy about what is inside our outside accepted medicine .
I discussed , for example , heavy leg syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome , both diagnoses accepted within “ mainstream ” medicine .
I have discussed the use of off - label medications , how to interpret the clinical literature , conflict of interest in the medical literature , and the debate about anti-depressant efficacy .
David Gorski has written about transparency in clinical trials , barriers to practicing science - based surgery , and when the popularity of new surgical procedures outpaces the evidence .
Mark Crislip has sharply criticized our own profession for the acceptance of pharmaceutical company lunches and other perks .
The claim by Dr. Egnor that we do not address issues of science or quality control within our own profession is not only a false dichotomy and a non sequitur , it is patently false .
But of course we do spend the majority of our attention dealing with the most anti-scientific challenges to modern medicine .
It only stands to reason that proponents of science - based medicine would spend the majority of their energy attacking the most outrageous unscientific medicine that has managed to infiltrate health care .
Our focus also stems from the fact that this is a niche that we perceive is empty .
We are pointing out that the emperor has no clothes because no one else is .
The institutions of academia and medicine have been cowed by false notions of political correctness .
The AMA was cowed by a successful restraint of trade lawsuit by chiropractors .
The mainstream media are worse than useless – they are abetting the spread of pseudoscience .
Promoting universal standards of science in medicine and directing our efforts at the worst abusers is our chosen mission .
It is a mindless non sequitur ( one that we are also familiar with from the proponents of unscientific medicine ) to argue that we should be doing something else .
Risk vs Benefit
Which brings me to Dr. Egnor ’s other claim – that “ mainstream ” medicine causes more harm than so - called “ alternative ” medicine .
Dr. Egnor would have done well to first read Harriet ’s excellent commentary on this claim .
She points out the fallacy of focusing only on harm and not on benefit .
Medicine ( as any respectable clinician should know ) is about risk vs benefit .
Focusing on just risk gives a very distorted view of reality .
Of course medical mistakes harm more people than so - called alternative medicine – because mainstream medicine is orders of magnitude larger than alternative practice , and often deals with much more acutely ill patients .
Dr. Egnor focuses on hand washing and medical errors .
Why , he wonders , are we not taking on these issues .
As stated above , we do in that we advocate for science - based practices across the board .
But also , reducing medical mistakes , while very important , is simply not our chosen focus .
There are already institutions and systems in place that are working diligently on these problems .
In fact , most physicians in academia will serve in some capacity in such efforts as part of their administrative duties .
I sit on a credentialing committee that deals with these issues .
Mark Crislip tells me he has spent most of his career directly involved in exactly these quality control issues .
So Dr. Egnor ’s core claim is just another non sequitur and false premise .
He might as well say we are hypocrites for not taking on insurance fraud .
Do n’t we care about tax payer money being lost due to physicians committing Medicare fraud ?
What about our colleagues who sexually abuse their patients ?
Of course we care – it ’s simply not the mission of science - based medicine .
I also think that Dr. Egnor misses the boat on these quality control issues .
He casually blames arrogance ( because it is an easy accusation to throw around ) .
I will admit that there may be a kernel of truth to the notion that personal physician arrogance contributes to poor compliance and medical mistakes .
I have never argued that as a profession we are beyond reproach .
In fact I often go out of my way to point out that there is much to criticize in mainstream medicine and there are individual physicians who lack compassion , ethics , competence , or all three .
( None of which , of course , justifies any particular unscientific claim . )
But the solution to quality control issues is not to rail against arrogance , it is to focus on systems .
Those who are actually engaged directly in quality control issues in medicine have learned that you cannot just preach to health care providers about hand washing and diligence .
You do need to do this – but the best results occur when systems are put into place that make compliance easy and automatic .
Simply placing hand washing gel dispensers outside every patient room did more to raise hand washing compliance than nagging ever could .
These issues are being effectively addressed within medicine .
One of the barriers to efforts to deal with these concerns have been unscientific thinking among our own colleagues .
This is not an insurmountable barrier – but we do encounter poor logic and faulty reasoning everywhere .
In fact I have argued that making a study of the worst examples of pseudoscience helps me recognize more subtle manifestations of sloppy thinking .
Studying pseudoscience makes one a better scientist .
Be Nice
Dr. Egnor ’s blog entry also includes this gem :
We are beset by an arrogant medical and scientific priestcraft , eager to call ordinary people “ idiots ” or “ anti- science ” or “ deniers ” because they hold viewpoints with which these particular scientists and physicians disagree .
This is similar to the “ Attack on Mommies ” gambit that RFK Jr. used to defend his anti-vaccine claims .
Again , Dr. Egnor is simply not paying attention , or he does n’t care .
I have written specifically about how to talk to patients who have unscientific ideas .
This is an issue about which we are very thoughtful , as it cuts to the heart of what we do .
We in fact have made a specific point not to attack patients or “ ordinary people ” for holding unscientific views .
We have even likened this to “ blaming the victim ” – we see a scientifically illiterate public as a victim of poor education , a credulous media , and anti-scientific propaganda .
We do , however , sharply criticize those who publicly defend or promote pseudoscience or attack science or scientific medicine .
We try , in fact , to focus our criticism on their claims and methods and avoid ad hominem attacks .
If you enter the public debate on a topic by writing about it , speaking about it , and actively promoting a point of view – then you open yourself and your views up to criticism .
You cannot then whine about being criticized by those who disagree with your point of view .
That ’s the whole point of public discourse .
Public criticism is also part of the culture of science .
Science ’s chief strength as a self - corrective system depends largely on open criticism .
Scientific discourse , while it can be polite and professional , is also a take - no - prisoners meat grinder .
Anyone who has ever attended a scientific conference has likely seen this first hand .
Bad ideas are excoriated , as they should be .
Conclusion
This latest entry by Dr. Egnor , true to his form , is an incoherent hodge podge of logical fallacies and contradiction .
It is also based on a gross and unfair misrepresentation of the proponents of science - based medicine , as can clearly be demonstrated by what we have actually written on this site over the past year .
It is further evidence that those who seek to undermine the integrity of science in order to promote their personal ideology will find common cause , despite even vast internal ideological differences .
That is why Dr. Egnor can agree with our actual position with regard to unscientific medicine , but be so motivated to find something to criticize that he ends up making the same dubious arguments as the proponents of unscientific medicine he claims to oppose .
This is why an attack on the defenders of science - based medicine can be found on a creationist website .
Palestinians sit in a makeshift shelter near their house destroyed during Israel 's offensive , in Gaza City February 8 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Suhaib Salem
GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israeli fire killed a Palestinian militant who was on a mission on Monday to attack an Israeli patrol along the border with the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip , the Islamic Jihad group said .
Israel ’s military , revising an earlier statement , said its forces killed a gunman who tried to infiltrate through its Gaza border fence .
Islamic Jihad identified him as a member of its armed wing and said he was killed near the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun while trying to attack Israeli troops along the frontier .
Earlier , Israel launched air strikes against what the military described as Hamas outposts in Gaza , saying this was a response to a Palestinian rocket salvo on Sunday .
Palestinians said at least one Israeli missile hit a building used by Hamas police .
There were no casualties .
A fragile cease - fire has been in place since Israel ended a 22 - day military offensive in Gaza on January 18 that was designed to punish the Islamist Hamas group for cross - border rocket and mortar bomb attacks .
Egypt is trying to secure a lasting cease - fire between Hamas and Israel , which holds a parliamentary election on Tuesday .
Diplomats said the Egyptian proposal includes a prisoner exchange and the initial opening of at least two of the enclave ’s border crossings .
With his opinion poll lead narrowing ahead of the election , right - winger Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to end Hamas rule in the Gaza Strip and proposed focussing peace talks with the Palestinians on economic issues .
His main opponent , the centrist Kadima party leader Tzipi Livni , Israel ’s foreign minister , said she would continue U.S. - sponsored land - for - peace talks , an outcome favoured by the new Obama administration in Washington .
LONDON , Feb 15 ( Reuters ) -
The whistleblower whose revelations about British bank HBOS led to the resignation of a top regulatory official said he had more evidence proving that the bank took excessive risks , a newspaper reported on Sunday .
Paul Moore , who said he was fired as HBOS risk officer after raising concerns over the bank ’s lack of caution , also called for Prime Minister Gordon Brown to resign over his handling of the economy while he was finance minister .
HBOS was taken over by Lloyds Banking Group PLC LLOY.L last month after its share price was hammered by a loss of confidence in its ability to survive the credit crunch .
The government waived competition rules to enable the takeover to go ahead speedily , and took a 43 percent stake in the enlarged group as part of a banking sector rescue package .
Moore told the Independent on Sunday he intended to send parliament ’s Treasury committee a dossier of 30 documents to prove his case .
Evidence Moore gave to the committee ’s bank sector hearing last week led James Crosby to quit his role as deputy chairman of the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) , which regulates British banks .
Crosby was chief executive of HBOS while Moore was the bank ’s risk officer .
Moore also said Brown should resign .
“ Brown must go .
He can not remain in office .
He has presided over the biggest boom in the history of the country as well as one of the biggest busts .
But he promised no more boom and bust .
He must be held accountable for his failure to oversee the stability of the country , ” Moore told the newspaper .
“ Brown swaggers around holding himself out as the economic saviour of the world with a level of hubris that defies belief .
But does he ever acknowledge that it was he , as Chancellor of the Exchequer , who presided functionally over the economic strategy that got us into this mess in the first place ? ”
Lloyds said on Friday that its HBOS unit made a pretax loss of 8.5 billion pounds ( $ 12.3 billion ) last year due to a bigger than expected rise in bad loans .
The news wiped a third off Lloyds ’ share price and raised concern it might need additional state help .
Moore said he had compiled a “ meticulous record ” of his time at the bank , and disputed the accuracy of an audit carried out to check his claims .
Crosby has rejected Moore ’s allegation that he sacked him as a result of his warnings .
He told the Sunday Telegraph that he planned to issue a “ a full and detailed rebuttal on the basis of my best recollections of what took place at HBOS during the relevant period ” .

So Nicole Scherzinger from the Pussycat Dolls let her big brown nipple out for some air because I guess it was suffocating under her dress , or maybe because the shit stain is so fucking big it ’s almost impossible to keep it covered up and letting the world see it is a small trade off for the cleavage that sells her records ….
I am not one of those people who hates on brown nipples or even brown vaginas , I only find that shit disgusting on white chicks , because you gotta do some serious damage to get a brown pussy , like using a log of frozen dog feces as a dildo or someshit .
Either way , this Scherzinger whore ’s good to go , unfortunately it ’s not as funny as a massive clit slip , but I ’d settle for massive nipple slip , because ultimately , I do n’t care and I ’m just posting this for you .
Here ’s the video of the performance last week … .

The appearance of a " sprite " ( about 30 miles high by 30 miles wide ) , flashing above a distant thunderstorm .
The " sprite " is about 175 - 250 miles away from the camera .
MysteriousUFO sightings may go hand in hand with a puzzling natural phenomenon known assprites — flashes high in the atmosphere triggered by thunderstorms .
Thedancing lights have appeared above most thunderstorms throughout history , but researchersdid not start studying them until one accidentally recorded a sighting oncamera in 1989 .
" Lightningfrom the thunderstorm excites the electric field above , producing a flash oflight calleda sprite , " said Colin Price , a geophysicist at Tel Aviv University inIsrael .
" We now understand that only a specific type of lightning is thetrigger that initiates sprites aloft . "
Researchers have detected the flashes between35 and 80 miles ( 56 -129 km ) from the ground , far above the 7 to 10 miles ( 11 - 16 km ) where usual lightning occurs .
Sprites can take the form of fast - paced ballsof electricity , although previous footage has suggested streaks ortendrils .
Thecause or function of the flashes remains murky , but Price suggested that theycould explain some of the UFO reports which have cropped up over the years .
Thatmight provide some solace for UFO enthusiasts disappointed by human - causedhoaxes in the past .
Bothjetliner pilots and astronauts have previouslyreported sightings of sprites , along with a different but equallymysterious phenomenon known as blue jets .
Priceand his colleagues have focused on " winter sprites " which appear onlyin the northern hemisphere 's winter months .
Their remote - controlledroof - mounted cameras can spot thunderstorms producing sprites far out over the Mediterranean Sea .
Triangulationtechniques have also allowed the researchers to calculate the dimensions of thesprites .
" Thecandles in the sprites are up to 15 miles high , with the cluster of candles 45 miles wide — it looks like a huge birthday celebration ! "
Price said .
Spritesmay have some effect on the Earth 's ozone layer , but researchers suspect thatthe global impact is small .
( CNN ) -- A United Nations aid agency whose supply lines have been cut off could n't help Gaza residents seeking humanitarian assistance Saturday , U.N. spokesman Chris Gunness said .
Palestinians ride past the closed doors of a United Nations relief agency facility Saturday in Gaza City .
Because of rocket attacks and other clashes , Israel sealed its border with Gaza on November 5 , rendering the U.N. Relief and Works Agency unable to replenish storage facilities .
They ran out on Friday .
" We have run out of food .
Our warehouses are empty , " UNRWA Director John Ging told CNN on Friday .
It was not immediately clear how many people were turned away Saturday .
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said the Israeli government considers the rocket attacks from Gaza " a fundamental and blunt violation of the understandings that led to the calm , " according to a written statement on Friday .
Mark Regev , Israeli spokesman for the prime minister 's office , said Hamas is directly responsible for renewed fighting .
Israel is committed to providing assistance needed to avoid a humanitarian crisis in Gaza , he said .
Watch what the border closing means on both sides »
" As soon as there is a period of calm , we need to get as many resources in as possible , " the U.N. 's Gunness said Saturday .
Israel temporarily opened border crossings on Monday and Tuesday to deliver 600,000 liters ( 159,000 gallons ) of diesel fuel to Gaza , Israeli spokesman Peter Lerner said .
He said security threats disrupted Israeli plans to reopen the crossings on Thursday , but said authorities are considering a reopening on Sunday .
The Israeli government has denied that its actions have interfered with UNRWA 's ability to provide assistance to some 80 percent of Gaza 's 1.5 million people .
But U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon called on Israel " to allow urgently , the steady and sufficient supply of fuel and humanitarian assistance , " according to a statement from the U.N. chief 's spokesman .
" ( Ban ) also calls on Israel to resume facilitating the activities of ( UNRWA ) ... and all humanitarian agencies , including through unimpeded access for U.N. officials and humanitarian workers , " the spokesman 's statement said .
Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are scheduled to meet on Monday to discuss a potential cease - fire .
The Israeli military carried out an airstrike on a suspected militant rocket - launching site in northern Gaza early Friday , an Israel Defense Forces spokesman said .
Five militants were wounded , Palestinian security forces said .
CNN 's Kevin Flower and Paul Colsey contributed to this report .

A blue - footed boobie is perched on a rock on the Galapagos Islands , where British naturalist Charles Darwin conceived his theory of evolution .
Charles Darwin would no doubt be surprised to learn that , 127 years after his death , people around the world will be celebrating his 200th birthday on Thursday .
Biology 's " reluctant revolutionary , " as English historian James Moore calls him , was a quiet man and frequently ill .
But there will be nothing low - key about " Darwin Day , " the anniversary of the English naturalist 's Feb. 12 , 1809 , birth .
The official celebration website ( darwinday.org ) lists 281 events in 31 nations , including more than 170 in the USA .
Events range from " Evolutionpalooza ! " at the San Francisco Main Branch Public Library to an all - day reading of Darwin 's
On the Origin of Species ( its 150th anniversary year ) at Lawrence University in Appleton , Wis .
" Darwin was it , " says paleontologist Robert Carroll of McGill University in Montreal , who is giving a public talk at the university 's Redpath Museum .
Modern biology begins with Darwin , who died in 1882 at 73 , and his recognition that every living species evolved from a shared single - cell ancestor formed in Earth 's earliest days , Carroll says .
" Particularly because of the anti-evolution reactions going on despite the science , we have to celebrate this anniversary . "
So , part birthday bash , part thumb - in - the - eye to creationists , part opportunity for publishers rolling out Darwin books like sausages — who and what are evolution 's fans celebrating ?
" Certainly without Darwin , we would have had ( discoveries about ) evolution , but we would n't have had natural selection , " says science historian Peter Bowler of Queen 's University Belfast in Northern Ireland .
Darwin proposed in 1859 that natural selection — " preservation of favorable individual differences and variations , and the destruction of those which are injurious , " in his words — was the inherited mechanism of evolution , how living things endured by hanging onto the traits that helped them survive and eventually losing those that did n't .
Upending the widespread belief among biologists that all species arose separately , Darwin 's central argument in his landmark 1859 book On the Origin of Species was this : " It inevitably follows , that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural selection , others will become rarer and rarer , and finally extinct . "
The talented Mr. Darwin Darwin did n't make these pronouncements on a whim .
At 22 , he set out as a gentleman explorer aboard HMS Beagle , chartered to survey the coasts of South American and Pacific isles on a planned two - year voyage that lasted almost five years .
Famously , the trip took Darwin to the Galapagos Islands , where he noted the differences between birds and tortoises on the islands .
On returning , Darwin made his name as a geologist in the Victorian scientific establishment .
His observations of how Earth 's changing geological past is shown in rocks , a revelation of the era , helped make clear to him the changing environmental conditions that might push species to evolve .
Publication in 1839 of his account of his travels , The Voyage of the Beagle , made Darwin famous at age 29 .
In that year , Darwin first privately drew his now - familiar " tree of life " diagram , showing the ancestral links between 24 living and four extinct species groups .
" No one had previously seen ( species ) relationships as treelike and therefore explicitly genealogical , " writes the science historian Keith Thomson in The Young Charles Darwin ( Yale University Press , $ 28 ) , out Thursday .
For two decades , Darwin pondered the differences between the island species and continental ones in the specimens packed away and described in his notes , as he quietly raised a family of 10 children ( three died in childhood ) .
He bred birds to test his view of natural selection .
The religious climate of Darwin 's day favored " special creation , " the belief that all species , from mayflies to manatees to mankind , were created separately by a higher power .
Historians agree that Darwin feared the controversy that would attach to his name with the public release of this idea ( " It is like confessing a murder , " he wrote to the botanist John Dalton Hooker . )
What finally prodded him to publish his heretical ideas was his 1858 reception of a manuscript from the naturalist Alfred Wallace , who had come to the same conclusions about natural selection .
Both scientists ' ideas were unveiled to a scientific gathering in London , with Darwin expanding on his findings a year later in On the Origin of Species .
Darwin's ideas are often presented as adversarial to the concepts of creationism — the belief that life began exactly as is described in the Bible — and intelligent design , the belief that life 's evolution is the design of a higher power .
Often forgotten , in the 1800s and now , is that " Darwinism " is simply the idea of a common ancestor for all living things , with natural selection thrown in as a driver of evolution , says science philosopher Michael Ruse of Florida State University .
The controversial Mr. Darwin Origin quickly sold out , sparking an 1860 debate at England 's Oxford University that presaged many of the arguments over evolution heard today .
At that debate , the Bishop of Oxford Samuel Wilberforce supposedly asked one of Darwin 's supporters , the biologist Thomas Huxley , whether his grandmother or grandfather 's side of his family was descended from monkeys
In the USA , the debate turned similarly acrimonious with the 1927 " Scopes Monkey Trial , " in which Tennessee prosecuted schoolteacher John Scopes for teaching evolution .
Scopes lost , but the scorn on the creationist prosecutor , Williams Jennings Bryan , by pundits such as The Baltimore Sun's H.L. Mencken , remained the wider public image of the case , immortalized in the 1960 film Inherit the Wind .
Public debate over evolution has bounced from the statehouse to the schoolhouse to the courthouse since the Scopes trial .
A CBS News poll last year found 56 % of respondents would favor " teaching creationism along with evolution in public schools , " with 36 % opposed .
Courts in 1968 , 1987 and 2005 have found efforts to teach creationism and intelligent design to be an unconstitutional breach of the separation between church and state .
Public debates over the teaching of evolution surfaced in January in Texas and Louisiana ; bills critical of teaching evolution were introduced this month in the Iowa and New Mexico legislatures .
" We 're not out to bash Darwin , he was n't a God - hater out to destroy Christianity , " says Tommy Mitchell of the Creation Museum in Petersburg , Ky. , who will speak there on Darwin 's life Thursday .
" We would argue his observations hang on a bad starting point .
He just never had a biblical worldview and that led him to his conclusions . "
On the other hand , Catholic theologian John Haught of Georgetown University , author of God After Darwin : A Theory of Evolution , notes that the Vatican accepts evolution .
Evolution fits comfortably with religious belief , he says , unless you view the Bible as a " literal source of scientific or technical information . "
" Evolution is really kind of an anomaly in terms of the public view of science in the United States , " says political scientist Jon Miller of Michigan State University in East Lansing .
Surveys show the public supports science broadly , " and even the notion of animals evolving gets people less upset .
It is really the notion of people evolving that triggers a negative reaction . "
Miller and colleagues published a 2006 survey in Science , for example , finding that 62 % of U.S. respondents agreed : " Human beings were created by God as whole persons and did not evolve from earlier forms of life . "
The prodigious Mr. Darwin " Today we live in a second golden age of evolution , " says University of Wisconsin biologist Sean Carroll , author of Remarkable Creatures : Epic Adventures in the Search for the Origin of Species , also out Thursday .
The 1953 explanation of how DNA encodes the genes inside our cells has led to an explosion of discoveries in evolution today , such as : • " Horizontal " gene swapping among microbes and through viruses into larger creatures and plants .
• Intact " tool kits " of genes , such as the basic animal body plan from millions of years ago .
• The guiding role of gene expression , how often genes are turned on and off , in shaping the growth of living things .
Understanding DNA and genomes ( genetic maps ) means scientists will one day " understand the full scope of the evolutionary process at its deepest fundamental level , " Carroll says .

1. Bad Brew :
This could be a poorly constructed potion , a batch of food made with ingredients that just happen to be bad or merely past their expiration date , or an innocent substitution that has dire consequences ( like a can of old dog food used to make a casserole – botulism alert ! )
It could also be an invention that the character is experimenting with that blows up in his / her face despite any number of tests or re-checking .
Could be an error in the math , a misplaced part , you name it .
People make mistakes , and as we ’ve seen over and over again with accidents like the sinking of the Titanic or the detonation of the Challenger , sometimes those accidents can have deadly consequences .
2. A Really bad trip :
Somehow , a character begins to hallucinate .
( Maybe the food was drugged , maybe he / she took something willingly , or perhaps it ’s a spell or a side - effect from some covert sci - fi weapon . )
The hallucinations are very vivid and very real , and the character should be subtly encouraged to follow them .
( Maybe a talking cat says he ’ll lead the character to a pot of gold , or a gorgeous butterfly flutters away , always just out of reach , etc . )
End it with the character suddenly tripping and falling down a deep well , or diving off a wall onto a spear , or maybe just waking up in the feeding pit of some horrible , horrible beast so you can savor the look on the player ’s face when his / her character gets munched .
3. A Bizarre Disease :
Somewhere along the way , the offending character picks up an infection ( There are a ton of possible vectors to choose from– spider bite , blood spray from felled foes / innocents , bad hookers , polluted food / water , unsterile transfusions , exposure to exotic radiation , unfamiliar bacteria , etc. ) and it goes unnoticed and untreated ( or is untreatable / pretends remission ) until it gets totally out of hand .
There are a lot of fun things you can do with this – think flesh - eating viruses , wasting diseases , AIDS , cholera , the plague , or any of the weirder biological threats you ’ve seen in shows like Star Trek or Doctor Who .
Heck , maybe it ’s a nanogenic pathogen , like Grey Death ( Deus Ex ) or the nanoprobes used by the Borg .
There are a ton of ways to play with this idea .
4. The Stranger :
This one ’s great for teaching players to exercise some discretion , and get them to do things that are a little more sane or reasonable than murdering or harassing ( or doing worse to ) everything they see .
Make the encounter happen somewhere isolated , where the character will be more inclined to act on his or her baser impulses .
A man walks past the party , simply wishing to be left alone , but if any of the characters do anything offensive to him , ZAP !
They ’ve been hit by a bolt of lightning , or turned into a baby hippopotamus , or been given an extra set of genitalia somewhere obvious and hard to cover .
Of course , the stranger could just zork the offending character for somewhere in the neighborhood of 5d20 points of damage right off the bat and then move along , leaving the other characters shocked and confused next to the pile of ashes that had once been their compatriot .
5 . The Pyrrhus Way :
While the roof - tile thrown by an old - lady did n’t kill the once - famous conqueror Pyrrhus exactly , its impact was enough to stun him and give a local soldier the chance to shank him .
This is great for characters who run into towns all gungho– let them take on and take down the whole town , let them have their way for a little while , and then throw a miffed old lady in their path who ’s a crackshot with something humiliatingly common , like a cobblestone , a roof tile , or a plate .
Watch as the bigshot warrior goes down , knocked out cold ( or killed outright ) by granny and her flying frying pan .
There are a lot of fun things you can do with this one too .
6 . The Old Standby :
You ’ve done it or seen it done before .
A character gets out of hand , and BAM !
The “ hand of God ” tosses a flaming chunk of meteor their way , fifty tons of rock collapse above the character and crush them to death , or they become another victim to Bluebolt , etc .
It ’s the freak accident .
It ’s the airplane that loses control and crashes into your sailboat , the sudden heart attack , the blown seal on your starship or submarine that suddenly and violently depressurizes the cabin , etc .
When all else fails or you just do n’t feel like being too creative about disposing of that problem character , use the old standby and get rid of that problem in a way that ’s quick , easy , and refreshingly decisive .
Profile : Sir Fred Goodwin
The government has asked the former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland , Sir Fred Goodwin , to forgo some of his pension .
Chancellor Alistair Darling told the BBC of the government 's approach after it emerged that Sir Fred is drawing a pension of £ 650,000 a year .
Although he is only 50 , he is entitled to the payment for life , with a pension pot worth £ 16 m .
" You cannot justify these excesses , " Mr Darling told the BBC's Today programme .
Failure should not be rewarded .
Practices are coming to light that have got to be dealt with
Prime Minister Gordon Brown
" We 've got the lawyers looking at this , but I do think that on a voluntary basis , actually , Sir Fred could resolve this problem and he could do it quite quickly . "
Sir Fred stepped down in October last year as part of the government 's rescue of the faltering bank .
The controversy over his pension intensified as RBS announced that its 2008 loss totalled £ 24.1 bn ( $ 34.2 bn ) - the biggest annual loss in UK corporate history .
Sir Fred 's strategy and decision to buy ABN Amro is widely seen as making the bank more vulnerable to the credit crunch and having to be bailed out .
Huge ' failure ' Mr Darling told the BBC : " At my request , my ministerial colleague , Lord Myners , spoke to Sir Fred [ on Wednesday ] and put it to him quite simply : look , in the circumstances in which this bank is now in , do you not think it right that you should forgo this ? "
The chancellor said the government had not yet received a reply to the request .
Whichever way one looks at it , this obscene pension is unacceptable and the government is on the hook
Shadow chancellor George Osborne " Obviously we will look at what we can do in relation to legal remedies , but I do think that , it 's not just this case , but you cannot justify these excesses - especially when you 've got such a failure of this magnitude .
" Prime Minister Gordon Brown echoed Mr Darling 's comments , saying : " Failure should not be rewarded .
Practices are coming to light that have got to be dealt with .
" Of course this is in the end a legal action matter and we 'll have to wait for the outcome of that , if that is to take place .
" Nobody can support very extensive pension arrangements at a time when the bank is both losing jobs of its employees and at the same time reporting major losses . "

Treasury Minister Stephen Timms had said earlier that UK Financial Investments , which manages the government 's shareholding , had been working with the new RBS chairman and board with a view to " clawing back " some of the pension .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne said Sir Fred " should in all decency renounce his pension " but questioned the government 's assertions that it had only recently learned of the deal .
" Whichever way one looks at it , this obscene pension is unacceptable and the government is on the hook .
Either they did know and failed to act , or did n't know and failed to ask the right questions , " he said .
The Liberal Democrats ' economy spokesman , Vince Cable , described the pension arrangement as " an absolute disgrace " , adding : " There may be an issue about whether the government should just stop it , and leave him to sue if he wants it . "
For its part , the City watchdog , the Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) , published a new draft code on remuneration policies on Wednesday , saying that firms should make sure their policies did not expose them to excessive risk .
' Eye - watering ' pension
The Treasury select committee is conducting its own inquiry into the banking crisis .
Its chairman , John McFall , said : " I think it is a scandal .
[ Sir Fred ] is leaving not with a good pension , but one that is eye - watering . "
The disclosure that he 's set up very nicely for life will spark some controversy
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert Peston 's blog RBS reports record corporate loss
When giving evidence to the Treasury Committee on 10 February , Sir Fred said : " My pension is the same as everyone else in the bank who is in a defined benefit pension scheme .
It is determined in the same way as anyone else . "
But few other employees of RBS are understood to be able to draw their pension at the age of 50 , although BBC business editor Robert Peston says that his entitlement to a pension at 50 if he was asked to leave the bank , was put in place some years ago and was applied to other directors .
RBS also issued a statement , saying : " The company is taking further legal advice in respect of certain aspects of Sir Fred Goodwin 's contractual arrangements and continues to discuss the position with UKFI . "

J. Preston Bezos -- Destroyer of Worlds and Befuddled Pajero -- Versus Jon Stewart , Darling Man
This :
Plus this : Equals this : Clever , clever , clever .
" Use my device one - handed and fuck yourself with the other .
My device is both portal and phallus : fuck and be fucked .
" Interesting news : looks like Amazon has dropped the price on Kindle books to ten bucks flat , or perhaps that is merely an average calculated by a Hawkman slave .
J.P. Bezos has 8.2 billion dollars : so much wealth that he knows for certain by now that money is not real .
Do you really think he is selling the Kindle ?
Do you not understand that this unhinged Onanist wants to replace and rebuild all of publishing in order to control and capitalize on a failing , insecure medium that no longer believes in itself ?
He is not selling Kindles : he is buying the future of literature .
Every Kindle sold rechannels the flow of power from artists ( and failed artists ) to his store full of successful merchants and engineers .
You could buy forty books for the price of one Kindle .
You could buy four hundred paperbacks : a decade 's worth of reading material .
No one still seems to have the public cunt to stand up to this smug jerk - off , not even East Coast America 's precious Jon Stewart .
Books are n't slick , slim , sexy , machines -- like rock stars or supermodels .
Books are ugly , fat , grotesque ganglia of organic power .
Dreams .
Hells .
Mistakes .
Wisdom .
I hate this man Jeff Bezos and his little ambitions .
I admit that ebooks are an exciting prospect to help get books and stories into the hands of the poor .
But before anyone can build a permanent conduit between sick , impoverished readers and sick , impoverished writers , J.P. Bezos will buy out all of publishing by appealing to the greed and fear of grey , imagination - dead middle - management .
Some writers will thrive and prosper .
But others ( most ) will be utterly crushed , and the world of fiction will be smothered like a retarded Nazi baby if it is run by an autocratic catalog company .
Car dealers roll out incentives ECONOMY

The 2008 Chevrolet Suburban is a lot of vehicle , perhaps more ideally suited for the U.S. Border Patrol than for the average Bay Area commuter .
But Kent Carl , of Carl Chevrolet in San Jose , would like to think it 's too good of a deal to pass up .
The manufacturer 's suggested retail price for the muscular and loaded V8 with three rows of seats is $ 39,280 .
But Carl , the general manager at the dealership , has it priced at $ 25,988 .
That 's a savings of stacked - up incentives totaling $ 13,292 .
" We 've had some activity on it , " said Carl , meaning noses have been pressed against the windows of the Suburban parked conspicuously in front of the Carl family business on Capitol Expressway Auto Mall .
MBA BY THE BAY : See how an MBA could change your life with SFGATE 's interactive directory of Bay Area programs .
" Sale Sale Sale " signs are aflutter there and at dealerships across the country as auto dealers scramble for scarce customers amid the severity of the financial market crisis .
Still , dealers are offering considerable quality - there 's pretty much a consensus that vehicles are more efficient these days - at attractive prices laced with incentives .
It 's an uphill climb , of course .
The economy is bogged down and the unemployment rate is climbing .
Consumer confidence is in a rut .
Consumers are n't going to make major purchases , as clouds of uncertainty gather and anxiety mounts about real and feared - for job loss .
The GMC dealership across the street from Carl Chevrolet has gone out of business .
In fact , 125 auto dealerships shut in California in 2008 , compared with 20 in 2007 , according to the California New Car Dealers Association .
The association said registrations of new cars and light trucks declined 23 percent in 2008 .
They were down 39 percent in the fourth quarter , compared with 2007 .
" Incentives have not brought in droves of people , " said John M. McDonald , a spokesman for General Motors in Detroit .
" In the last 60 to 90 days we have seen demand in the marketplace that is historically low .
I 'm talking about a level of U.S. car sales not seen since 1958 .
It is breathtaking . "
Still , dealers would be loath to stick their heads in the sand .
At Carl Chevrolet - it was the first building among apple orchards when it opened in 1967 - Carl knocked down the price on the Suburban to move it off the lot .
He shaved $ 7,000 in " customer cash , " a discount on the price of the truck , and another $ 3,000 in " loyalty bonus cash , " available to people who own or lease a 1999 or newer model year GM vehicle .
The dealership discounted the remaining $ 3,292 .
In good times - in particular , the days following the Sept. 11 attacks when General Motors launched the " Keep America Rolling " campaign that bolstered sales - Carl Chevrolet sold more than 200 vehicles a month .
The volume is now slightly less than half that , and in September and October , when credit tightened , it shrank to 50 to 60 per month .
" We started cost - cutting early on " last year , said Carl , 36 .
" We cut back on advertising , we shed about 30 percent of the workforce .
It was significant .
Cutting jobs is always something you do not want to do , the most difficult thing , but we needed to do it to survive . "
In a perfect world , Carl will rehire some of those workers as sales pick up - and he is optimistic they will .
The Suburban is the last of 10 he had on hand , and all 15 Chevrolet Tahoe models in the inventory were sold .
There has been an increase of 57 percent in car sales from late December to late January .
" It 's getting back to almost the time to start advertising again , " said Carl .
Dodge is advertising aggressively nationally with a campaign called " Driving America , " offering as an incentive zero - percent financing .
A reduced annual percentage rate is one of the core industry incentives customers are seeing .
So is the " pull - ahead lease . "
That is incentive money customers can use to pay off leases before they expire .
GM , for example , will pay up to two months of a GM lease for a customer planning to lease another vehicle .
The loyalty bonus cash at GM , which ranges from $ 1,000 to $ 3,000 , depending on the model , has attracted customers at Carl Chevrolet which , because it has been in business for 42 years , has a considerable amount of repeat and referral customers , said Carl .
The " customer cash " incentive is at the core , too .
For Chevrolet , the most cash - $ 7,250 - is being offered for the TrailBlazer , because it is being dropped .
The truck - based SUV is being replaced by a car - based crossover .
There are many more incentives and they vary around the nation and regionally .
On GM and other carmaker Web sites , enter your ZIP code to get incentives near you .
For one , $ 1,000 rebates have been offered for the Toyota Prius , the hybrid for which in 2004 there was a waiting list lasting several months at Bay Area dealers .
Here 's an intriguing incentive : University Dodge in Davie , Fla. , got attention recently for a two - for - one sale .
Buy a 2008 Ram Quad Cab , from $ 32,000 to $ 50,000 , and get a barebones two - door Ram truck free .
Hyundai has an ad booked for the Super Bowl on NBC today saying that if you buy a new Hyundai and within a year lose your income , you may return the car and in many cases walk away from the debt .
In Burlingame , E. James Hannay , the president of Rector Motor Car Co. , purveyor of Porsche and Audi , wants it known that financing is available , no matter all the pessimistic talk .
He has Audi rates as low as 0.9 percent , down from 6 percent six months ago .
The Porsche 48 - month financing is 5.5 percent , down from 7 two years ago .
Hannay created a provocative radio ad in which he implores people who are able to spend money , to stimulate the economy .
People tell him regularly how much they like hearing the message .
It says in part :
" Much of the media would have you believe our economy is doomed , that you should hoard your money , but that is the worst thing we can do .
That will be a self - fulfilling prophecy .
...
So if you can , go out and buy , if not from Rector , then from someone else , and let 's get this great country moving again . "

The measure , announced Jan. 13 by U.S. Trade Representative Susan C. Schwab as she headed out the door , was designed as retaliation for a European Union ban on imports of U.S. beef containing hormones .

This is a story I want to tell ALL athletes who think that what they do , how they act , the little kindnesses they give or withhold from fans do n't matter .
It 'll take only a minute .
My wife , Cynthia , was adopted .
At 36 , she found half her biological family on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Montana .
Turns out she had four half brothers , one named Lil Bob , who was as big as a tree .
Lil Bob , a bar owner , could pick a man up with one hand and throw him out the front door .
He was gregarious and funny and always seemed to have his son , Jake , hanging onto one of his huge legs .
Unfortunately , he was also a full - blown alcoholic .
Many were the days that started and ended with a quart of Jack Daniel 's , although you could never tell .
In size and in heart , Lil Bob was one of Montana 's biggest Broncos fans .
His hero was John Elway .
He joked that he wanted to be buried in an Elway jersey , with pallbearers in Elway jerseys , and an Elway football in his huge hand .
His one regret was dropping out of school in eighth grade , ending his football career .
His one dream was to take Jake to a Broncos game .
Sometimes on the reservation , the dreams come small .
Last March , Lil Bob 's liver failed .
One awful hospital day , Jake , now 13 , walked up to the bed , took his dad 's head in his hands , put his mouth to his forehead and told him he could n't go yet .
Told him he needed him to stay and take him to a Broncos game .
Stay and watch him grow up and play for the Broncos .
Lil Bob 's death , a few days later , seemed to send Jake into that shapeless , black sinkhole where boys go when their best friend is gone for reasons they can't understand .
" I tried to talk to him , but he was closed to it , " says Jake 's mom , Lona Burns .
" He started doing bad in school .
Kids picked on him .
Every day I fought him just to go .
His grades dropped .
He did n't even care about going to football practice , did n't want to play . "
We use our crock pot all the time .
Rarely does a week go by when we do n't use it at least twice .
It enables us to simply put some ingredients in the crock pot in the morning , turn it on " low , " leave it for the day , then enjoy a home - cooked supper with our family at dinner .
Often , we 've got enough food left over that it serves as a solid lunch for me and my wife the next day ( or the day after that ) .
A long time ago , I wrote an " introductory " post about crock pots entitled The Art of the Slow Cooker .
In it , I mention the following :
Do n’t have any idea what to cook ?
I ’d recommend starting off with one of the spice packets sold in the grocery store , usually near the soup mixes .
McCormick ’s slow cooker packets are quite good for what you pay for , and the recipes usually involve dumping in the packet and four or five ingredients , turning it on low , and walking away for eight or nine hours .
If you need to be away longer than that , add a quarter cup of additional water to the mix .
What 's amazing is how easy it is to create a truly tasty meal with minimal ingredients .
Even if you do n't choose to pick up a spice packet at the grocery store , you can still create a wide array of great recipes with just a few ingredients in the crock pot .
In fact , my wife and I often strive to come up with great crock pot meals that require only five ingredients .
With such a small list of ingredients , it takes only a minute or so to pull the crock pot out of the cupboard , toss in the ingredients , turn it on " low , " and leave for the day , only to come home to a deliciously prepared home - cooked meal .
Here 's one such recipe from The Art of the Slow Cooker :
here ’s the simplest really tasty recipe I know of for a slow cooker .
1 can condensed cream of chicken soup ( chicken & herbs if you can find it )
1 small can mushroom pieces ( a 4 ounce can , drain off the water first )
1/2 chopped red onion
1 1/2 pounds skinless , boneless chicken breasts ( cut into strips if you ’d like )
1/4 cup white wine ( optional )
Put them all in the crock pot .
Turn it on low .
Walk away for four hours .
For every additional two hours it will cook , add a quarter cup of water .
This makes for a delicious little chicken dish that I like to call " creamy chicken casserole . "
It takes about two minutes to prepare in the morning and fills your belly right at night .
Like that one ?
Here are five more recipes , all of which we 've eaten in the last few months .
The directions for each are easy :
Combine all of this into a crock pot .
Add salt and pepper to taste .
Turn it on low and walk away for eight hours .
Add a quarter of a cup of water for every additional two hours you intend to cook it .
Got that ?
That 's all you have to do for each one .
Here are the ingredients .
Crock Pot Chili
1 large can tomato sauce
1 pound lean ground beef
2 cans beans ( kidney beans are fine , but you can use whatever you like )
2 tablespoons chili powder
1/4 cup diced onion ( or onion salt )
Simple Pot Roast
1 2 to 2.5 lb. roast
2 cups chopped carrots
2 cups chopped potatoes
1 cup chopped celery
3 cups beef broth or beef stock
Ham and Potato Casserole
4 red potatoes , sliced
2 red onions , finely chopped
1 1/2 pounds cubed ham
1 can condensed cream of celery soup , diluted according to can directions
2 tablespoons flour
( This one is very good with cheese on top just before you serve it . )
Shredded Beef Sandwiches
2 pounds beef brisket
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 1/2 cups beef broth or beef stock
2 cloves minced garlic
1 chopped red onion
( Serve this on buns - magnificent ! )
Breakfast Apple Cobbler
4 medium - sized apples , peeled and sliced ( try Honey Crisps )
1/4 cup honey
1 teaspoon cinnamon
2 tablespoons melted butter
2 cups granola cereal
( Start this one at 10 or 11 PM - ready for breakfast ! )
It takes only five ingredients and a few minutes to come home to ( or wake up to ) a delicious home - cooked meal that does n't cost you very much money at all .

Make money as a VoIP wholesale provider
As a VoIP wholesale provider , you can easily make money buy just selling VoIP goods and services to VoIP resellers .
The market is rapidly growing but not everyone has the knowledge to gain profit from such a fast moving industry .
Be competitive
In order to make more money than other VoIP wholesale providers , you need to be as aggressive and competitive as possible .
Say goodbye to lazy days and hello to a more vigilant and alert business system .
Be on the lookout for VoIP device makers like Netgear , D - Link , and Linksys because they reportedly make more money than service providers .
Take your cue from those who have already succeeded in the industry and add a little of your own genius to try and surpass the current trend .
VoIP may sound like a highly technical and intimidating trade at first ; but if you ’re really bent on making it in this business and educate yourself with the basics and constantly get updates on newest trends , then earning a hefty profit should be a piece of cake .
Basic concepts you should know first
There is a great need for VoIP services all over the world , thus you must be familiar with the different markets for them and their forecasted demand .
In order to make as much money as a VoIP wholesaler , you first need to know what motivates customers to switch providers .
You should also find out the reasons why many VoIP wholesale startups fail .
Decide which is more important for your business — price or quality .
If you give VoIP services at a low price , then the chances of customers being attracted would be higher .
But , bear in mind that not all customers go for a cheap price at all times ; they also want the best quality there is to satisfy their VoIP needs .
Providers offer different kinds of products , so it is recommended to compare them first before deciding which you will choose to partner with .
Be in the know with the things that other successful VoIP wholesaler start - ups do to overcome the lack of brand recognition , then decide whether you should recruit marketing partners or not .
Knowing how your clients or customers respond to different services and promotions can play a great role in procuring additional clients .
You should also find out how to assign the right price to maximize your profits and optimize your time .
Once you have created a system that is almost automatic , you will have more time and energy to devote to your R&D and marketing efforts .
Most of us should never have to pay an ATM fee .
With the proliferation of credit card processing systems into almost every retail store , there are very few situations when we should actually need paper cash .
Many of us do n’t even carry cash anymore , which is n’t the worst thing in the world , but it does put us in a bit of a conundrum in the event that we need to pay for something without a check or a credit / debit card .
In this situation , we often get stuck using an anytime teller machine ( ATM ) to get cash from our accounts .
If it ’s an ATM that ’s owned by your bank , it ’s not that big of a deal , it ’s just like writing a check to yourself .
If it ’s an ATM that ’s owned by a bank or a payment processing network , chances are you ’re going to be dinged with a hefty transaction fee , which could now be as high as $ 5.00 for individuals who are n’t customers of the Bank who owns the ATM , or even up to $ 10.00 at some Las Vegas Casinos .
A few years ago , we might expect to pay around $ 1.50 or $ 2.00 per transaction , but times are changing and ATM fees are going through the roof .
Bankrate.com does an annual survey of ATM charges , and they ’ve found that the average price of an ATM charge was up by 13 % between 2007 and 2008 to just under $ 3.50 per transaction .
That ’s an increase of almost 45 cents per transaction in just one year ’s time .
We should never , ever , get stuck with an ATM , especially since there are a lot of other ways to get cash for free , including using your debit card at a grocery store , or by using an ATM that ’s affiliate with your bank ’s network of ATM machines .
Alternatively , you could sign up with one of many internet - based checking accounts which will refund any ATM fees that you incur .
These banks typically do not have ATM networks of their own , but instead simply refund their customers ATM fees as a cost of doing business .
There are a lot of ways for us to get cash from our accounts without paying a fee , but the best way to do it is to take out a certain dollar amount from your checking account on the first of every month and put it in your wallet .
You can use that money for any transactions that require you to pay with cash and can continue to pay with your debit or credit card for everything else .
It ’s a matter of planning and discipline .
We should have a pretty good idea of what our expenses are and whether or not there ’s a possibility of us needing to pay with cash , and if there is , simply take the money out ahead of time and have it ready for when you need it .
As Marc Lacey reported in The Times , Mexico has been struck this week by “ a wave of demonstrations protesting the presence of army troops ” in towns near the border with the United States , where the authorities have been involved in often heavy fighting with drug traffickers from the powerful Gulf Cartel .
Mexican authorities say that these protests , which temporarily shut down border crossings into Texas from several Mexican towns , were sponsored by the drug cartel .
While it is certainly possible that these crowds were rented , watching just two minutes of a dramatic video in a report that ran on Mexican television this week , makes it easy to imagine that civilians living in these towns might be upset by the Mexican government ’s decision to militarize the conflict with the drug cartel and put more than 40,000 soldiers on their streets .
To put the size of that force in perspective , there are currently 36,000 American troops in all of Afghanistan .
The Spanish - language video report , ( which includes graphic images of dead bodies ) can be seen on the Web site of the broadcaster Mexicanal and begins with footage of a reporter , Miguel Turriza , describing the gun battle between government forces and the drug traffickers which took place on Tuesday , in broad daylight in the middle of the border town of Reynosa , just across the Rio Grande from south Texas .
Later scenes show heavily armed Mexican troops on the town ’s streets , and the bodies of several suspected members of the cartel who were killed by the soldiers .
Mexicanal ’s footage was also edited into a longer report embedded in an article on the Web site of El Universal , scored with dramatic music and titled , “ Reynosa : Zona de Guerra . ”
El Universal also has a special section on Mexico ’s shooting war on drugs , with more Spanish - language articles and video reports .

The Houston Chronicle ’s Lynn Brezosky reported from Reynosa that it was hard to pin down the number of people killed in the fighting on Tuesday which lasted more than an hour :
Pedro Sosa , a chief of the Tamaulipas state police , said one of the dead was a civilian named Jose Alejandro Rivera , who apparently was caught in a crossfire .
Sosa said seven gunmen were detained but did not have further details .
On Tuesday , reports of injuries and deaths varied widely , with some reporters on the scene saying that as many as 12 people were killed , including five soldiers .
The Mexican Defense Department later denied that any soldier had been killed .
The firefights occurred in six different sections of the city across the Rio Grande from McAllen , and were attributed to Gulf Cartel struggles to maintain control of a key cocaine trafficking route into South Texas .
Just across the border in McAllen , Tex. , Jeremy Roebuck reported in The Monitor that a leader of the Gulf Cartel may have been among the dead in Reynosa :
A top Gulf Cartel leader is believed to be among those killed during violence that broke out across the city Tuesday , U.S. officials said .
Mexican federal authorities shot Héctor Manuel Sauceda Gamboa during a firefight at his home on Reynosa ’s southwest side .
Their raid on the alleged kingpin ’s residence triggered the fighting between military forces and cartel gunmen that left at least five dead across the city ’s southwest sector , officials said .
More footage of the shooting on Reynosa ’s streets Tuesday , and of Mexican troops in the town , has been posted on YouTube .
Anxiety over the matter escalated last week after President Obama told an audience in Elkhart , Ind. , that companies “ ca n’t go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayer ’s dime . ”
The remark was taken by many here as an attack .

“ The mayor heard the words ‘ Las Vegas ’  he did n’t hear any other city  and people are telling me that they ’re not coming to Las Vegas because the president does n’t want them to , ” said Mayor Oscar B. Goodman , who at first demanded a White House apology but later in the week said he just wanted a clarification .
“ There ’s an impression out there , ” Mr. Goodman said , “ that somehow if you come to Las Vegas , it ’s going to reflect on your business culture , and that ’s a bunch of hooey . ”
The White House has not commented directly on the matter .
But the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid , Democrat of Nevada , said on the Senate floor Wednesday that Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , had told him that “ the president ’s criticism was aimed at the potential use of taxpayer funds for junkets and in no way reflects his thoughts about any one particular city . ”
Mr. Goodman and local meeting planners insist that they have heard from companies who said Mr. Obama ’s remarks scared them away , but Ms. Jones , the Harrah ’s executive , said no company had made that connection while talking to her .
The cancellation that has particularly rankled Las Vegas was the one by Goldman Sachs , which received $ 10 billion in bailout money .
The company issued a statement saying the decision was “ based on our best efforts to operate according to the requirements of the new landscape of our industry , ” but a $ 600,000 cancellation fee charged by the hotel has led some to question that explanation .
“ I think it was a public relations move , ” Ms. Jones said .
“ Why would you pay a cancellation fee and go to a city that ’s more expensive to get there and where the cost of food is more expensive because you do n’t have as many options ?
SEOUL , South Korea ( CNN ) --
One could say she has the determination ... but lacks the drive .
Driving agency estimates woman has spent more than $ 2,888 in exam fees .
A 68 - year - old South Korean woman this week signed up to take her driving test once again -- after failing to earn a license the first 771 times .
The woman , identified only as Cha , first took the written portion of the exam in April 2005 , said Choi Young - cheol of the Driver 's License Agency in the southwestern city of Jeonju .
At the time , she made her living selling goods door - to - door and figured she would need a car to help her get around , Choi told CNN .
She failed the test .
She retook the test the next day and failed again .
And again .
And again .
" You have to get at least 60 points to pass the written part , " said Kim Rahn , who wrote about the unflappable woman in the Korea Times , an English - language daily .
" She usually gets under 50 . "
In the beginning , Cha went to the license office almost every day .
Now , she no longer works but still turns up once a week , Choi said .
The office estimates she has spent more than 4 million won ( $ 2,888 ) in exam fees .
Cha 's last failed attempt was Monday .
She tries for the 772nd time either Thursday or Friday .

The report referenced in this article was released by the Educational Policy Institute Canada , not EPI .
EPI Canada is a for - profit , non-partisan subsidiary of the non-profit Educational Policy Institute .
Dramatic tuition hikes must be part of a recession survival plan for Canada 's ivory tower , warns an education thinktank .
Colleges and universities must consider charging more , despite a middle - class backlash , if they hope to avoid diluting the quality of education during the economic crisis , says the report by the non-profit Educational Policy Institute .
The report predicts fee hikes of up to 25 per cent in the next couple of years – in line with increases during the last recession – which would generate $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion for recession - hit campuses .
Caught between the surge in enrolment that happens in every recession , and the looming slowdown in government grants and private donations , Canada 's colleges and universities must consider hiking fees , boosting student aid and cutting the ranks of big - ticket senior staff , said the report .
The good news , say the authors , is that many Canadians can afford to pay more .
" The average net tuition a student pays in Canada , once you factor in inflation and tax credits , has gone up less than $ 90 in the past 10 years – to $ 4,066 from $ 3,985 – while family incomes have increased a lot , " said analyst Alex Usher , co-author of the report by the institute , based in Toronto , Virginia and Australia .
" Also , there is a smaller percentage of students borrowing to pay their tuition , because so many have been able to find work , " said Usher , whose report states bluntly , " The question in Canada is not whether families can contribute more ( to tuition ) : on average , they can . "
John Milloy , Ontario 's minister of training , colleges and universities , said he was not willing to " get into a numbers game " yet because the province 's 5 per cent cap on yearly tuition hikes for most programs does n't end until September 2010 .
" But obviously we 're in a tough economy and it's no secret our resources are limited .
However this government has said we do not want finances to ever be a barrier to a qualified student having access to post - secondary education . "
In fact , any fee hikes during a recession are " an absolutely absurd proposal , " said Shelley Melanson , chair of the Canadian Federation of Students ' Ontario branch .
" It 's fascinating that while every government in the world is saying we can't raise taxes , to increase what is really a flat tax on students – tuition – completely ignores the reality of the economy . "
The federation is urging Queen 's Park to actually roll back tuitions once the cap is lifted , to 2004 levels , and then cut it each year after that .
The University of Toronto , which , like most universities , is grappling with dwindling endowment payouts , is " doing a lot of math right now to see how much ( increase in tuition ) would be responsible without freezing out huge numbers of students , " said Rob Steiner , the university 's assistant vice - president of communications .
" Double - digit increases each year are probably a bigger jump than people are thinking of – now is not the time for massive sticker shock – but chances are the current framework ( of 5 per cent hikes ) will not be enough .
" We need to make sure we have enough ( tuition dollars ) to protect the quality of education and enough student support to make sure people can afford to come . "
The report notes that unlike in earlier recessions , universities can't turn to endowments to bail them out this time , because they were the first to be hit .
This has caught universities and colleges in what the report calls a " double whammy " – cuts to both donations and government grants .
In 2007 , Canadian universities reported $ 10 billion in endowments ; nearly one - quarter of this at the University of Toronto ; about half shared by four universities .
While no one knows exactly how much these are down , the report suggests a drop of $ 2 billion – about 20 per cent – is likely so far .
The other part of the double whammy – government funding cuts – may not hit right away , given the current focus on " stimulus , " suggests the report .
But once the recession passes and governments work to eliminate their deficits , continued grant increases of 6 to 9 per cent seem unlikely .

" The bigger threat to Canadian institutions , therefore , lies in the budget cycles for 2011 , 2012 and beyond :
As recovery takes hold and the economy improves , budgets will be pared back and cuts to institutional funding will be hard to avoid . "
The report also suggests government give colleges and universities the money to offer senior , highly paid staff a one - time buyout to " reduce the salary base . "
Usher said he is n't " talking about eroding the ranks of tenured professors – the younger , cheaper faculty could well be tenure - track professors , " but suggested universities might want to consider more teaching - only professors who do n't have research responsibilities .
Lawmakers have several ideas for how to get us out of this financial mess : buy only ‘ American , ’ borrow more from other countries , and , of course , throw more money into the economy with a $ 800 billion stimulus package that ’s supposed to create new jobs and help us see some debt relief .
However , none of these solutions , we ’re told , will be a quick fix .
America is hurting , and President Obama says , this pain will be long - term .
True , it will take years for us to see any real change but there are three things we can do in the short - term that may have an immediate effect on our personal finances :
1 . Pay down credit card debt .
The background : Pulling out the plastic to buy anything and everything we want is part of the overspending that got us into this mess .
Credit card debt is such a problem that eight out of 10 Americans polled by CreditCards.com do n’t want to openly discuss just how much they owe .
Some debt relief companies report clients who have upwards of $ 100,000 in credit card debt and as many as 10 credit cards .
How to do it :
Make a list of all your debts from the highest interest card to the lowest interest one .
Pay more than the minimum each month on the one with the highest interest until it ’s paid off .
Then tackle the next card on your list and repeat this debt reduction process until all of your cards are paid off .
If the fix is n’t that simple , seek out the help of a professional counseling service , get on a debt management plan , or consider consolidating your debt .
2 . Adopt a cash - only mentality .
The background : Paying with cash used to be the norm that our parents and grandparents grew up with .
Their homes may have looked straight out of “ That 70s Show ” and not like the modern updated homes we ’re used to seeing on HGTV , but everything in the house was typically paid in full , sometimes over a period of several months until it could come out of layaway .
How to do it : Leave your credit cards at home and carry cash instead .
Before you head to the store , determine how much you ’re going to spend and take that amount out of the ATM .
This will also help you stick to a budget .
It ’s important to only buy things that you can afford and if you do n’t have enough money to buy something right away , get it the old - fashioned way and save up until you can buy it outright .
3 . Adjust the terms of your mortgage .
The background : Buying a house meant so much to some of us that we agreed to buy more house than we could truly afford .
We were so eager to sign on the dotted line and move in that we did n’t pay attention to key phrases in our contract signaling that our mortgage terms were less than homeowner friendly , including “ pre-payment penalty , ” “ adjustable rate mortgage , ” and “ interest - only ” payments .
How to do it :
Talk to your lender if you ’re among the 61,347 Bay Area homeowners who are currently in default on their homes .
Lenders may be willing to negotiate with you rather than risk losing thousands more on the home once the property enters foreclosure .
Bay area home values , pummeled by rising foreclosures and the effects of the recession , lost $ 202 billion in value in 2008 , according to Zillow.com .
With lenders standing to lose more money , your lender may be willing to offer you debt consolidation , a deferred payment plan , or a loan modification .
The fog may creep in on little cat feet , but the dawn often arrives more like this .

FRANKFURT 
Here at the Städel Museum “ The Master of Flémalle and Rogier van der Weyden ” is an old - fashioned whodunit .
Almost exhaustingly erudite , it mixes up very great Netherlandish paintings of the 15th century with a few not so great ones to unravel perennial questions from galaxy academe about which artist painted what .
Why should we care ?
For the same reason film buffs debate if Howard Hawks was the real director behind “ The Thing From Another World , ” the sci - fi classic from 1951 he produced , rather than Christian Nyby , the credited director , or whether the 1943 thriller “ Journey Into Fear , ” for which Norman Foster is listed as director , was taken over by Orson Welles , who played a Turkish police detective in it and whose other movies it partly resembles .
We should care because , commerce and the usual scholarly nitpicking aside , the debate is itself an excuse for looking closer , and because piecing together any great artist ’s legacy is a bit like composing a novel , every chapter part of the artist ’s grand narrative , without all of which the story is incomplete .
And , well , also because good mysteries beg to be solved .
With 500 - year - old Netherlandish paintings , their solution boils down to connoisseurship , an unfashionable term in universities for years , an art of human frailty that science and history now often miraculously supplement but still ca n’t replace .
Like all forms of art , connoisseurship contrives its own logic to provide answers to questions about who did what , but it ultimately accepts doubt and ambiguity in the bargain , qualities which likewise separate theater from agitprop , “ The Rules of the Game ” from “ Deuce Bigalow : European Gigolo , ” literature from bank statements or grocery lists .
Not coincidentally , writers like Tolstoy , Baudelaire and Zola used to love to write about art .
The Goncourt brothers embraced Watteau , Proust took up Chardin .
This exhibition virtually calls for a Borges or a Pirandello  or a Welles .
Jochen Sander is its curator .
On a recent afternoon he was standing before the “ Crucified Thief , ” attributed to the Master of Flémalle , a picture that is at once opulent and fairly revolting .
Against a gold backdrop , two figures attend the badly mangled victim .
In a corner of the picture a receding landscape abuts the backdrop , like a stage set running into the proscenium curtain , realism clashing with artifice .
Kissinger 's praise
Henry Kissinger , who made a rare endorsement of John McCain in the run-up to last year 's New Hampshire primary , had kind words for Obama in Munich , where he was receiving an award for " outstanding leadership in the cause of peace , " according to my colleague David Cloud 's pool report :
In his remarks Kissinger said , " we are meeting in a period of seeming crisis , " but the beginning of a new administration … gives an opportunity to review the basic premises on which we operate , and the reaction we have received all over the world [ to Obama 's election ] give me hope that we can overcome .

The sane maxim that the government does n't control reality , or even the economy , is actually a slight overstatement .
The government can prevent market forces from operating by channeling resources into artificial channels .
Broad intervention — for example , flooding the market with public funds while adding new and onerous restrictions on firms — is , like pressing down on a car 's accelerator and brake pedals simultaneously , and is guaranteed to make the economy stall .
So the answer to everyone 's question , how long is this downturn going to last ?
remains within the control of the government , although not in the sense intended by Keynesian theorists .
President Obama is constitutionally empowered to say " no " at any point along this precipitous decline .
Recently , a series of econometric criteria have been suggested as standards for the success of the bailouts and spending programs .
But it would be more realistic , in light of the history of interventionism , to set criteria marking failure : gauges of the level of pain inflicted on the body politic that would act as a tripwire for the reevaluation — and reversal — of economic policy .
Indeed , by any reasonably compassionate standard , that threshold has long since been reached .
Yet Mr. Obama is throwing away his chance to reverse the Bush era's policy of " war consumerism " and is continuing down the same well - trodden road , when instead he should be executing a 180 degree turn and implementing a " new economic policy . "
NEP ?
If the phrase " new economic policy " has a familiar ring to it , that is because it was coined nearly ninety years ago in the aftermath of World War I and the Bolshevik revolution .
This New Economic Policy ( hereafter , NEP ) was Lenin 's response to the disasters ensuing from war communism .
After the period of outright requisitioning and collectivization carried out by the Bolsheviks during and after the First World War , private property in land and small enterprises was recognized after March 21 , 1921 .
This saved the Soviet Union by allowing the GNP to stabilize so that the Soviets could staunch the flight of manpower and resources out of Russia and fend off internal and external enemies .
Just how liberal the Soviet Union got during that decade is a subject of ongoing debate .
While I propose no novel insights on the period as a historical subject , I do find the contrast between the policy options that were open to the Bolsheviks and those that are presently being exercised by the American government illustrative of the failure of government to foresee , let alone make a prudent response to , the ineluctable outcome of events
Postbellum Blues
In certain regards , the United States is as socialized today as Russia was at the end of WWI , albeit this has occurred through analogous , rather than identical , historical causes .
War always wreaks havoc with the distribution of economic resources , making an end run around the supply and demand functions of civil society .
But whereas Russia entered the 1920s under the banner of " war communism , " what might be termed America 's " war consumerism " has grown insidiously and without fanfare for the last two decades under both Democratic and Republican administrations .
An opportunity was lost to return to the status quo ante bellum at the end of the Cold War , when President Clinton failed to curb military Keynesianism , and the Republican Congress failed to curb civil Keynesianism .
This process accelerated under the Bush administration , and Obama shows no inclination to brake its inertial velocity .
However , Lenin , in his audacity , resembled Obama the candidate more than what we have seen so far of Obama the president .
Surrounded by collectivist dreamers , some of them almost as dangerous as he was , Lenin embarked on what was , for the times , a rather ambitious program to restore free markets .
In this he was motivated not by any insight into the connection between private property and human dignity , but by political expediency , yet this motive was sufficient to spare the lives and fortunes of millions — at least until the NEP was revoked by Stalin in 1928 .
Considering the fact that the Bolshevik party platform was to the left of the Mensheviks , and the Mensheviks were roughly equivalent to the far left wing of the US Democratic party , Lenin 's NEP was a bold stroke indeed .
This is not to say that Lenin had any intention of restoring capitalism .
As Nikolay Nenovsky , working within the framework of Austrian monetary theory has noted , the reforms were so partial that they ultimately thwarted the evolution of true market institutions .
Nonetheless , the system of commodity payments was abolished and prices were established for agricultural commodities , while private property , that is , property outside of medium and large firms , was tolerated .
Most surprising of all , in the hindsight of post–New Deal economic history , hard currency was introduced and continued to circulate up until the eve of the Second World War .
In fact , as Nenovsky explains , currencies were allowed to compete for a short period during the early NEP .
This period saw the introduction of the chervonetz , a gold coin originally left to rise to its own value against other media , and later established ( to its detriment ) as an official state currency .
In other words , the NEP was , at its monetary core , the kind of policy experiment that only the most radical advocates of the free market would urge on the American government today .
It would seem that the cynical Marxists surrounding Lenin could boldly rush in where the angels ( fallen or otherwise ) of the Obama administration fear to tread .
One can only wonder at the source of this policy rigidity among purported advocates of a mixed economy .
At least the Russian Bolsheviks were willing to tack in the direction of market principles , albeit in the faith that , once the economy had recovered , this would provide a reserve of capital subject to state control or expropriation .
In contrast , present American policy constitutes a unidirectional slide towards state stewardship of the economy .
Is there some rational explanation for the relative flexibility of Lenin in contrast with the knee - jerk Keynesianism of today 's social - democratic Democrats ?
The answer to the query , will you fast - forward to an NEP , Mr. President ?
is thus far a firm " no " — but the ensuing matter of why not is one that merits speculation .
Anyone who believes in the efficacy of government actions and also favores liberalization would probably default to that portmanteau phrase " a failure of political will , " but a brief analysis into secular and psychological obstacles to the NEP might prove rewarding .
In both spheres , the manifest differences between the USSR in 1921 and the US of A in 2009 are unquestionable , but whether these differences add up to an explanation of the " non-NEP - ability of America " is not so apparent .
Ominous Parallels and Less Obvious Perpendiculars
The secular differences between the American situation of today and the Soviets ' nearly ninety years ago can be summarized in three points :
Russia had reached the end of its economic lifeline and America has yet to do so .
The suffering caused by war communism was transparent , while the suffering caused by war consumerism has been , until very recently , opaque .
Soviet policies — both war communism and the NEP — were conducted under a program of naked class struggle , while America 's policy has been framed within the context of national , and even international , social contractarianism .
In the first instance , the deterioration of the American economy in this winter of 2009 has not yet run its full course .
There are still reputable people who think that the nation can afford more guns and more butter through an expansion of public debt and the money supply .
Moreover , these people are demanding an infinite series of second chances to prove their theories right .
However , since nature abhors linear infinities , sooner or later this war consumerism ( i.e. , military and civil Keynesianism ) is bound to be superseded by either liberalization or a command economy .
Now the problem with a command economy is not that people are n't willing to work for the common good .
As Ludwig von Mises pointed out in his book Socialism , people do n't work for the common good in capitalism either .
Rather , the difficulty is that there is no mechanism to determine what is or is not a productive use of labor or capital .
The early Soviet economy was saved in part by Lenin 's pragmatic attitude towards collectivization , but more importantly by the fact that , during the NEP , Russia had a window on the rest of the world in the form of commodity prices conducted in real currency .
These prices , in turn , allowed domestic planners to mimic the price system of the global economy .
Today , America is an integral part of a world economy that is embedded in an increasingly rigorous network of economic treaties and central banking , a world in which there is no longer an " outside . "
To the extent that this global economy is subjected , by insidious degrees , to arbitrary decision making , then it also becomes increasingly susceptible to the kind of collapse that the Soviet Union narrowly avoided in the 1920s .
In all probability , one harbinger of this is the current volatility of markets , which are not so much starved for capital ( as the Keynesians claim ) as they are starved for objective information to help them make decisions about profits and losses .
So , apart from global economic collapse , what possibilities are there ?
The first would be the emergence of an " outside " from some region or regions imperfectly integrated into the global economy .
This disengagement and emergence of an external economy might save even the rump of the global market , but at the price of making the latter into a kind of ghetto politburo dancing to the tune of an increasingly robust capitalism elsewhere in the world .
However , if New York ceases to be the economic capital of the United States , forgoing any hope of remaining that of the world , nobody should expect " the world to dress in sackcloth , now that you have forsaken cake and ale . "
No , there will be other financial centers willing to take up the slack , in terms of distributing capital and talent .
The other possibility would be for the United States to tear a hole in its own governmental hegemony over commerce , allowing entrepreneurs to resume control over the allocation of capital , thus creating a domestic window against which everybody , including the newly chastised public sector , could judge the rationality of their decision making .
That is not to say that a hypothetical Obama NEP would , or should , look anything like that of Lenin .
Although the introduction of hard currency , even under the auspices of nationally chartered banks , would certainly help restore rational calculation to the fuzzy and volatile quasi markets of today , there are many other aspects of the Soviet experience in the 1920s which would best be avoided .
Possibly the most egregious of these was the emergence of a special class of state - created traders dubbed " the NEPmen . "
These people emerged at the intersection of the tightly controlled Soviet urban markets and the newly privatized hinterland of Russia and its outliers .
Their monopolistic stranglehold over the exchange of agricultural and industrial commodities , albeit an exchange conducted in cash , became so noxious that eventually the Old Bolshevik factions were able to press forward with their case for total collectivization .
Unfortunately the present program of bailouts , subsidies , and bonuses has already become instrumental in creating America 's own class of NEPmen , that is to say , people operating at the interface of the public and private sectors and skimming off of both .
Just as in Russia , in the long run the American public wo n't stand for a parastatal class of private managers subsidized and privileged by the US Treasury .
Without any market to check avarice , in its stead , regulatory measures will be tightened by insidious degrees , until either the managerial and official classes have merged , or there is a general revulsion at the trend .
A far better basis for any hypothetical NEP would be to legalize the failure of large firms and the success of small ones .
This would entail cutting down on government expenditure in general , eliminating not only bailouts but large - scale contracts ( both military and civil ) to the privileged partners of government .
It would involve reversing the growth of taxation and regulation , burdens that fall disproportionately on small businesses .
And in an echo of Soviet peasants ' liberation during the NEP , it would involve the selling ( as opposed to the current acquisition ) of public lands and curtailing eminent domain .
Even these measures might not be enough .
Still , it is remarkable that the tepid capitalism of the NEP managed to save the Soviet Union , such that , by the later 1920s , its GNP had recovered to the level of Russia in 1913 .
The Irrelevance of Good , or Even Bad , Intentions
Beneath the overarching secular trends of history , there is an irreducible human factor , and I realize it is rather unfair to compare our new president to someone as historically questionable Vladimir Lenin .
It is said that President Obama prefers the moral council of Reinhold Niebuhr to that of Karl Marx , and his inaugural address certainly gave homage to root American and Western values .
Nonetheless , President Obama is probably less inclined towards an NEP today than Lenin was in 1921 .
He is also in a more disadvantageous position for turning to liberalization .
First of all , it is far easier for a scoundrel to change his tune for the sake of self - preservation than for a stubborn idealist to renounce a fond theory .
The mind of Barrack Obama seems to operate more along the lines of a Woodrow Wilson than any Bolshevik , but this is scant comfort .
For while the coercive impact of war communism revealed a transparent tyranny , it could not appeal to the kind of passive acquiescence that occurs when a revolution is carried out " within the form " of a preexisting social contract , as was done under Wilson , and later FDR .
Now , recapturing the level of prosperity of Russia in 1913 is probably not a very inspiring thought for either Barrack Obama or any other American , but the point is not one of inspiration but of comparison .
We have already had our fill of inspired rhetoric , and the time has come for prudent policy .
Prudence is a virtue that transcends ideology and theology .
It even transcends the gap between men and women who , as perhaps Lenin did , operate out of ill will , and those who , as I presume our president does , operate out of good .
As he himself has acknowledged , it is a matter of averting catastrophe .
Finally , although I have been crediting Lenin with the merit of expediency and cunning foresight , perhaps even this is n't exactly true .
Historically , it would seem that Lenin waited until the last possible minute to save the Soviet economy , when sailors were already in revolt in Kronstadt .
No matter how cunningly Machiavellian the man at the helm , the state can only react to crises , not prevent them .
Unfortunately , this administration 's Keynesian advisors are likely to be just as loath to give up the illusions of omniscience and control .
They would do better to remember the old proverb that when everybody is hiking in the wrong direction , it is the first person to turn back who is making the most progress .
The sooner interventionism is abandoned , the more likely it is that economic disruptions can be contained .
But , more likely , the state 's leaders will wait until it is a choice between a new economic policy or national ruin .
Thus , it 's up to free - market economists to set rigorous standards for the failure of intervention , so the market can be restored at the first possible opportunity .
And that 's the kind of change we can believe in .
I had a dream : Israeli Arab students , enraged by the war in Gaza , were protesting at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem .
A counterdemonstration by Jewish students erupted .
When the head of university security , a Holocaust survivor , tried to intervene , the Arab students called him a Nazi .
Actually , I did n’t dream this .
Shlomo Avineri , a political scientist at the university , related the incident , which occurred in the first days after Israel began its Gaza war on December 27 .
But dreams cut to the quick .
There ’s no point denying that a line of sorts runs from the forty - three people killed by Israeli fire near a United Nations school in Gaza on January 6 back to the Palestinian Nakba ( catastrophe ) of 1948 and to Berlin , 1945 .
History is relentless .
Sometimes its destructive gyre gets overcome : France and Germany freed themselves after 1945 from war ’s cycle .
So , even more remarkably , did Poland and Germany .
China and Japan scarcely love each other but do business .
Only in the Middle East do the dead rule .
As Yehuda Amichai , the Israeli poet , once observed , the dead vote in Jerusalem .
Their demand for blood is , it seems , inexhaustible .
Their graves will not be quieted .
Since 1948 and Israel ’s creation , retribution has reigned between the Jewish and Palestinian national movements .
I have never previously felt so despondent about Israel , so shamed by its actions , so despairing of any peace that might terminate the dominion of the dead in favor of opportunity for the living .
More than dreams , I ’ve been having nightmares .
I cannot see a scenario in which any short - term Israeli tactical victory over Hamas is not overwhelmed by the long - term strategic cost of this war .
Khaled Meshal , the political director of Hamas in Damascus , declared fifteen days into the war that it had “ destroyed the last chance for negotiations . ”
A little over a year after the Bush administration ’s much - heralded Annapolis conference , a Mideast peace has never seemed more distant .
On Israel–Palestine , as much else , the outgoing president ’s capacity to exit in flames is conspicuous .
But before I get to that , let me return , for a moment , to those protesting Israeli Arab students .
There are about 1.3 million Arab citizens of Israel , or a little less than 20 percent of the population .
Their loyalties are divided , but never before have they protested so vigorously .
That ’s a fair guide to the virulence of Arab sentiment , stoked by graphic around - the - clock coverage of the Gaza carnage from the al - Jazeera and al - Arabiya networks .
President Bashar al - Assad of Syria , resorting to the same loaded World War II lexicon , has called Gaza “ a concentration camp , ” a term also recently used by Cardinal Renato Martino , the head of the Vatican Council for Justice and Peace .
These jackboot allusions — which …
Until 1994 , the quantity of demand deposits and other checkable deposits grew at roughly the same rate as other money supply components .
And then , if you look at the historical statistics something happened .
The quantity of checkable deposits fell back sharply during the mid 1990s and then stayed stagnant at roughly or somewhat above $ 600 billion , even as the quantity of currency in circulation and other forms of deposits kept rising .
The explanation for this new trend was that Alan Greenspan in 1994 permitted so - called sweep programs , which transferred perceived excess amounts in checkable deposits to money market accounts .
The reason why banks wanted to do that was that checkable deposits have formal reserve requirements whereas money market accounts have no reserve requirements .
And as I 've explained before , banks have ( or more correctly had as I note below ) strong incentives to minimize reserves , as holding reserves means that they forego interest income and as the Fed 's promise to always bail out banks with liquidity problems means that the old motive for holding reserves is gone .
This " deregulation " is perhaps the only " deregulation " which can be said to have played a small role in creating the tech stock and housing bubbles , as sweeps in effect meant that reserve requirements were lowered , something which especially in the context of central banks having removed the traditional motive for holding reserves distorted the markets and helped fuel credit expansion ( as lower reserve levels made expanded balance sheets more profitable given a certain level of interest ) .
Anyway , because of the sweep programs , any increase in the amount of money that the public puts in checkable deposits will be quickly " neutralized " and transferred into money market accounts , which is why the quantity of checkable deposits were so stable from the mid-1990s until just recently .
Because the narrow money supply measure M1 consists of currency plus checkable deposits ( and traveler 's cheques , but that amount is relatively trivial ) , this also meant that M1 became quite obviously irrelevant as the key component of checkable deposits had become a constant number that never changed regardless of monetary conditions .
The entire increase in M1 from 1996 to 2008 consisted in the increase in currency in circulation .
But now something has happened again .
If you look at the M1 graph , you can see that there has been a recent sharp increase in M1 which only to a minor extent can be accounted for by an increase in currency in circulation .
Instead , as can be see in the graph below , checkable deposits have suddenly surged after having stayed basically constant for more than a decade .
They have now for the first time exceeded the pre-sweep peaks .
The explanation for this is that the rules have again changed .
Remember , the reason why banks have tried to minimize checkable deposits is that they have wanted to minimize required reserves .
And the reason why they have tried to minimize required reserves is that they have had an opportunity cost in foregone interest .
But now that the Fed has started to pay interest on reserves , that motive for minimizing reserves has been removed .
And with no motive for minimizing reserves , this means that there is no motive for performing sweeps any more , which is why checkable deposits ( and therefore also M1 ) have increased so dramatically recently .
This does n't mean that I now think M1 is the proper money supply definition , but it wo n't be fully as irrelevant as it was from 1994 to late 2008 .

TOKYO , Feb 18 ( Reuters ) - Japan ’s crude steel production slid by a record 37.8 percent in January from a year earlier as the deepening global economic slump sapped demand for cars and other products .
Output came to a mere 6.37 million tonnes , the lowest since February 1969 , the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said on Wednesday .
It was the fourth straight month of falls .
“ Demand for cars and all other products fell sharply during the month .
Exports also declined , ” a spokesman for the federation said .
He added that the group expects the dismal figures to continue for a while .
Nippon Steel Corp , the world ’s No. 2 steelmaker , plans to cut output in the January - March quarter by 40 percent to a record low 5 million tonnes as customers like Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co suffer amid the spreading recession .
Nippon Steel will idle one blast furnace from Feb.1 and another at a later date .
JFE Holdings
Inc , the world ’s third - biggest steelmaker , has shuttered a blast furnace since Jan. 14 to cut back on output .
Nippon Steel , however , expects to restart the two blast furnaces later this year , as it thinks automakers will see inventories return to appropriate levels by June and start increasing output by around July at the latest .

President Obama ’s pay caps on Wall Street are having unintended consequences throughout the economy .
Analysts warn that this brain drain of executives from financial firms will inevitably release a flood of reckless , overpaid morons to other sectors of the economy .
Their concern is not entirely without warrant , according to Bob Flaterbean , a head - hunting consultant : “ These guys are n’t the sharpest tools in the shed , but can they bully their way into a cushy VP job at some textile company in Iowa ?
Yeah , definitely . ”
Leaders of some industry groups are calling for the restrictions on financial pay to be repealed .
Neal Patuvy , president of the Mid-Atlantic Waste Reprocessing Alliance , released a statement today saying , “ Our industry supports job stability .
Really .
Please let these guys stay where they are .
Increase taxes , subsidize them , just do n’t unleash these a -holes on the rest of the economy . ”
Only time will tell what effect these compensation caps and other regulatory changes have on America ’s economy .
But the great Wall Street Brain Drain of 2009 is sure to shake up history .
( CNN ) --
A federal judge ordered a north Alabama sheriff jailed this week , saying the lawman intentionally served jail inmates " woefully insufficient " meals in order to pocket more than $ 200,000 .
Sheriff Greg Bartlett is now pledging to see that all state and federal food funds are used to feed prisoners .
Morgan County , Alabama , Sheriff Greg Bartlett was ordered to jail Wednesday by U.S. District Judge U.W. Clemon in Birmingham .
After a Wednesday hearing , Clemon found Bartlett in contempt of court , saying he had failed to comply with a consent decree in the 2001 lawsuit regarding conditions at the Morgan County Jail , according to documents filed in the case .
Clemon ordered Bartlett released from the federal Talladega Correctional Facility the following day after the sheriff 's attorneys pledged to provide better and healthier meals to inmates .
At issue is an Alabama law that attorneys for the inmates claim provides sheriffs with an incentive to skimp on feeding inmates .
Under the law , sheriffs are permitted to keep -- as personal income -- money left over after purchasing food for inmates .
The state provides sheriffs with $ 1.75 per day per inmate for food , according to the Alabama Attorney General 's Office .
However , in a March 2008 opinion , the office affirmed that sheriffs may legally keep what is left over .
" There is no minimum amount of money that the Sheriff must spend on food , " said court documents filed by Melanie Velez , an attorney with the Southern Center for Human Rights , representing the inmates .
" Statutory permission to pocket the state 's food subsidy does not , however , make it acceptable for the Sheriff to provide less than an adequate amount of food to detainees at the jail . "
But in a statement issued Friday , Bartlett called coverage of the case misleading .
" The Morgan County Jail served over 328,000 meals in 2008 and only received 15 complaints on the issue of food , " he said .
" I have never or would not ever have tolerated an inmate being fed inadequate portions or meals for any reason .
That never happened , to my knowledge . "
A consent decree filed in September 2001 with the court required Bartlett to serve " a nutritionally adequate diet " to inmates .
However , Clemon wrote in court documents that a typical breakfast for county inmates was a serving of grits or unsweetened oatmeal ; half an egg or less , sometimes cold ; a slice of white bread ; and unsweetened tea or a beverage such as Kool - Aid .
Lunch was either two peanut butter or bologna sandwiches , " with a small amount of peanut butter or an exceedingly thin " slice of bologna between two slices of white bread ; a small bag of corn chips ; and flavored water or unsweetened tea .
A typical dinner was two hot dogs or meat patties ; a slice of bread ; and mixed vegetables or baked beans , the judge wrote .
At times , when chicken was served , it was undercooked and pink , Clemon said .
Salt , pepper , sugar or other condiments were not provided ; they must be purchased by inmates at the jail store .
Inmates never receive milk , Clemon said , and receive fruit only three or four times a year .
The portions , Clemon wrote , are " woefully insufficient to satisfy the normal appetites of adult males .
After eating each meal served by the Jail staff , the inmates remain hungry .
Some inmates complain of recurring hunger pains . "
Many inmates have lost weight , he said , some of them as much as 50 pounds .
Inmates complain that they get enough food only by buying more at the jail store , the judge said , noting that some have spent as much as $ 100 there .
In 2007 , the judge said , Bartlett and the sheriff of a neighboring county both paid $ 500 for half a tractor - trailer full of hot dogs .
" They were served to the inmates at each meal until they had been depleted , " Clemon wrote .
Other inmate food was donated in bulk by schools and other locations , and the sheriff did not pay for it , the judge said .
Meanwhile , since he took office in 2003 , " Sheriff Bartlett has deposited in excess of $ 200,000 to his personal account from the funds allocated to him by the State of Alabama and the federal government for the feeding of inmates , " Clemon wrote .
Last year , Bartlett made $ 95,000 , the judge said .
" Sheriff Bartlett admits that he could double the food portions served to inmates of the Morgan County jail without significantly increasing his food expenditures , " Clemon wrote .
" The court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Sheriff Greg Bartlett has converted to his personal use and benefit state and federal funds allocated for the feeding " of prisoners .
In an order filed Friday , Clemon noted that the sheriff , through his attorney , has pledged to use all state and federal funds for feeding inmates in the future , and that " fresh fruit , fresh milk , vegetables and whole grains will be a regular part of the monthly menu . "
Daily meals will follow the USDA 's Food Guide Pyramid , Clemon said , and condiments will be provided .
In a similar case in south Alabama , Mobile County Sheriff Jack Tillman pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors , perjury and an ethics offense , and resigned in 2006 , agreeing to repay some of the $ 13,000 he shifted from a jail " food fund " to his personal retirement account , according to the Mobile newspaper Lagniappe .

Tom Friedman , who I admire in many ways , has an op - ed piece in today 's NY Times where he suggests that the US government take the bailout money they are thinking of giving to the auto industry and instead give it to the top venture capital firms .
You want to spend $ 20 billion of taxpayer money creating jobs ?
Fine .
Call up the top 20 venture capital firms in America , which are short of
cash today because their partners — university endowments and pension
funds — are tapped out , and make them this offer : The U.S. Treasury
will give you each up to $ 1 billion to fund the best venture capital
ideas that have come your way .
If they go bust , we all lose .
If any of
them turns out to be the next Microsoft or Intel , taxpayers will give
you 20 percent of the investors ’ upside and keep 80 percent for
themselves .
I understand the point Tom is making – that we ought to be investing in the future instead of the past .
And for that , I applaud him .
But the venture capital business , thankfully , does not need any more capital .
It 's got too much money in it , not too little .
Just ask the limited partners who have been overfunding the venture capital business for the past 15 - 20 years what they think .
You do n't even need to ask them .
They are taking money out of the sector because the returns have been weak .
And the top 20 firms in the venture capital business are the least in need of a bailout of any group I 've ever thought about .
These firms , the Sequoias and Benchmarks and Accels and Kleiner Perkins etc etc can raise a fund anytime they want .
Accel raised a ton of money last fall in the midst of the worst global financial meltdown in my lifetime .
The venture capital business is an asset class where the top 10 - 20 percent of the firms make 80 % + of the returns .
That 's how its always been and that 's how it will likely always be .
It 's because the best entrepreneurs want to work with firms with reputations for making money , making connections , recruting top talent , and getting the right exit at the right time .
And those are the top 10 - 20 percent of the firms .
So Tom 's idea , while it looks good on paper , is a dream .
The top venture firms do n't want , do n't need , and are never going to take government money .
The same is true of the top entrepreneurs .
The worst firms , on the other hand , will gladly accept government money .
And that is what is going to happen with all of these government efforts to pour more money into the " innovation sector " .
That money will go to bad investors and weak entrepreneurs and management teams for the most part .
It 's a problem of adverse selection .
If you take a look at all of the economically targeted investment programs that have been built and managed over the past twenty years in the venture capital industry , you 'll see this plain and clearly .
There are some good ideas out there .
My friend Brad Feld told me about a new legislative effort in Colorado to give angel investors a 50 % tax credit for making investments in early stage companies .
That makes better sense to me .
Let the market work but lubricate it a bit with tax credits , particularly for the angel sector which has been the most hurt in this downturn .
But please leave the venture business alone .
It 's working pretty well as it is and it certainly does n't need more money or some kind of stimulus plan .
Apple dropped a small , stealthy iPhone update last week aimed at updating carrier settings .
The mystery update in question added iPhone - coded carrier logo replacements for AT&T ’s new MicroCell ( femtocell ) service .
What 's that you ask ?
The femtocell device acts like a mini cellular tower in your home to boost signal strength , connecting through your existing broadband internet service ( DSL or cable ) .
The 3G MicroCell supports up to ten 3G capable devices with enhanced coverage of 5,000 square feet for both voice and data .
AT&T is offering their new MicroCell device , so customers can finally enjoy the improved cellular performance they were promised with iPhone 3G in the first place .
Are you paying for 3G reception at home that sucks badly ?
Just add another device along with the associated fees to help boost your miserable 3G service for the remaining 16 month prison sentence with AT&T .
Arrival date and pricing for the new MicroCell service remains unconfirmed .
Consumer trials in three cities are scheduled for Q1 according to an AT&T service rep I spoke to .
So instead of having a network of hard hat , zombie nerds following you around like Verizon offers , you get to pay for a MicroCell FAIL tower to ensure you can enjoy your iPhone 3G at home .
Blazing 3G speeds ?
Not so much .
I 've seen the the future , it blows !
" At AT&T ...
We suck less when you pay for more of what we do poorly . "

In one of the first acts of the 111th Congress , House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers proposed legislation to create a blue - ribbon panel of outside experts to probe the “ broad range ” of policies pursued by the Bush administration “ under claims of unreviewable war powers , ” including torture of detainees and warrantless wiretaps .
Conyers ’s proposal for a National Commission on Presidential War Powers and Civil Liberties also signals that Congress will devote significant time this year to investigating the Bush administration ’s most controversial actions with an eye to rolling back its expansion of executive power .
Many civil liberties and human rights groups feared that the Democratic - controlled Congress and Barack Obama ’s administration would duck any sustained inquiry into wrongdoing by George W. Bush and his subordinates , to avoid angering Republicans .
While Conyers ’s plan falls short of the criminal probe that civil rights groups have sought , neither would it prevent a criminal investigation by Obama ’s Justice Department if the new administration moves in that direction , said two aides on Obama ’s transition team who spoke on condition of anonymity .
Obama has been ambivalent about how to proceed regarding wrongdoing by the Bush administration .
He said during the campaign that willful criminality should be punished because “ nobody is above the law , ”  but also expressed concern that an investigation might get bogged down in recriminations and could be viewed by Republicans as “ a partisan witch hunt . ” 
Obama also has suggested he might support some form of truth commission as a way of ascertaining the facts , which would be in line with Conyers ’s plan .
The proposed blue - ribbon panel would consist of nine members , with no more than five from the same political party .
Appointed by the President and congressional leaders , the panel would have a budget of about $ 3 million and subpoena power to compel testimony from high - level members of the Bush administration .
The panel would file an initial report to the President and Congress within one year and a final report six months later .
The report would include “ any recommendations the Commission considers appropriate . ”  lt is unclear if criminal prosecution could be one of the recommendations of the panel .
Mukasey ’s Stand
Last year , amid disclosures about White House approval of brutal interrogation tactics used against “ war on terror ”  detainees , Conyers called on Attorney General Michael Mukasey to appoint a special prosecutor to determine whether these actions constituted war crimes .
But Mukasey did n’t act .
In a roundtable discussion with reporters on Dec. 3 , Mukasey revealed his thinking , arguing that there is no legal basis to prosecute current and former administration officials for authorizing torture and warrantless domestic surveillance because those decisions were made in the context of a presidential interest in protecting national security .
“ There is absolutely no evidence that anybody who rendered a legal opinion , either with respect to surveillance or with respect to interrogation policies , did so for any reason other than to protect the security in the country and in the belief that he or she was doing something lawful , ”  Mukasey said .
Regarding Justice Department legal opinions sanctioning these actions , Mukasey said he feared that second - guessing of those opinions would send “ the message “ ¦ that if you come up with an answer that is not considered desirable in the future you might face prosecution , and that creates an incentive not to give an honest answer but to give an answer that may be acceptable in the future . ” 
The war - crimes issue surfaced again when Vice President Dick Cheney gave media interviews last month in which he talked unapologetically about his role in approving harsh interrogation tactics , including the simulated drowning of waterboarding which is widely regarded as torture .
Conyers ’s proposed legislation was introduced on the same day that the Senate Judiciary Committee gave reporters three previously unreleased Justice Department legal opinions pertaining to Bush ’s authority to declare war with Iraq .
The legal opinions were written by Jay Bybee and John Yoo , former Justice Department attorneys who also drafted the infamous August 2002 “ Torture Memo ”  that authorized CIA interrogators to waterboard high - level prisoners at Guantanamo Bay .
The Justice Department ’s Office of Professional Responsibility has spent the past four years investigating the genesis of that memo , specifically whether Bybee and Yoo provided the White House with poor legal advice .
In Bybee ’s newly released Oct. 23 , 2002 , 47 - page opinion , he stakes out broad war - making powers for Bush , claiming the President “ possesses constitutional authority for ordering the use of force against Iraq to protect our national interests . ” 
The memo was drafted about two weeks after Congress approved a resolution authorizing Bush to “ use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq . ” 
In the memo , Bybee reaffirmed an earlier opinion that Bush possessed the necessary war - making powers regardless of what Congress did .
“ This memorandum confirms our prior advice to you regarding the scope of the President ’s authority .
We conclude that the President possesses constitutional authority for ordering the use of force against Iraq to protect our national interests , ” Bybee ’s memo said .
“ This independent authority is supplemented by congressional authorization in the form of the [ 1991 ] Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution … , which supports the use of force to secure lraq ’ s compliance with its international obligations following the liberation of Kuwait , and the [ 2001 ]
Authorization for Use of Military Force … , which supports military action against Iraq if the President determines Iraq provided assistance to the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
“ In addition , using force against Iraq would be consistent with international law , because it would be authorized by the United Nations Security Council , or would be justified as anticipatory self - defense . ”
As it turned out , the UN Security Council did not approve military action against Iraq , forcing Bush to assemble an ad hoc multinational force that he called the “ coalition of the willing . ”
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan later acknowledged that the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq was a violation of international law .
There also has been no credible evidence indicating that Iraq provided any assistance to the 9/11 hijackers .
Another newly released legal opinion , written by Bybee ’s successor , Jack Goldsmith , authorized Iraqi prisoners be moved to other countries to be interrogated — a practice known as rendition .
The existence of the three new legal opinions were first reported Tuesday by McClatchy Newspapers , which added that “ Yoo supplements those arguments [ on presidential powers ] in two other memos dated Nov. 8 , 2002 and Dec. 7 , 2002 . ” 
Conyers ’s legislation for the blue - ribbon commission was co-sponsored by Democratic Reps .
Maxine Waters , Jerrold Nadler , Linda Sanchez , Bill Delahunt , Luis Gutierrez , Bobby Scott and Steve Cohen .

Something was missing from Chinese state television 's live coverage of President Obama 's inaugural speech two weeks ago .
As he recalled how " earlier generations faced down fascism and communism , " viewers here were suddenly returned to the studio , where flustered presenters stumbled to fill the unexpected airtime .
As officials plan to launch China 's own international TV news channel in the next year or two , burnishing the country 's image abroad while challenging CNN , BBC , and other broadcasters , the incident illustrates how hard it will be for Beijing to realize that dream .
" China 's image is very important , but the first question is the image of the medium itself , " cautions Gong Wenxiang , journalism professor at Peking University .
" If the medium lacks credibility , it is unthinkable that it will improve the country 's image . "
Such reservations do not appear to be restraining official ambitions .
The government is reported to have set aside more than $ 6 billion to launch the TV station , to nearly double the number of foreign bureaus belonging to the official Xinhua news agency , and to upgrade the ruling Communist party mouthpiece , the People 's Daily .
The drive reflects a new burst of enthusiasm in China 's long - running but generally unsuccessful effort to present a positive image to the world .
" The strength of our voice does not match our position in the world , " complains Yu Guoming , deputy dean of the journalism school at People 's University in Beijing , who has acted as a consultant on the government 's TV project .
" That affects the extent to which China is accepted by the world , " Professor Yu adds .
" If our voice does not match our role , however strong we are we remain a crippled giant . "
An international opinion poll last year by the Pew Research Center in Washington , D.C. , appeared to support that conclusion .
In only seven of 23 countries surveyed did majorities express favorable views of China , and the long - term trend is toward more negative attitudes .
News you can use – to influence
Chinese officials are well aware of the role their media might play , if successfully deployed , in boosting Beijing 's " soft power " around the world .
In a speech last month , the Communist party 's top ideology official , Li Changchun , was blunt .
" Communications capacity determines influence , " he said at a celebration of China Central Television 's ( CCTV ) 50th birthday .
" Whichever nation 's communications capacity is strongest , it is that nation whose culture and core values spread far and wide and ... that has the most power to influence the world , " he said .
China 's current efforts to make its case internationally , mainly through CCTV's English , Spanish , and French channels , have had " quite bad results " admits
Yu , partly because " they ignore Western audience 's requirement of balance . "
That kind of propaganda , he insists , will have no place in the planned TV station 's broadcasts .
" We will try to produce news the way that Western media do , " he says .
" Only by reporting objectively can we create a respected and influential TV channel . "
But American efforts to establish a government - backed news channel abroad have also struggled to win credibility as an objective source of information .
Al - Hurra ( " The Free One " ) , an Arabic - language TV station launched in 2004 and broadcast in the Middle East , has failed to gain much of a following .
To emphasize its aspirations for independence , China 's news station will be based abroad , perhaps in Singapore or Thailand , Yu explains , and Xinhua , which has been tasked with launching the channel , will seek private investors as partners .
Control vs. credibility
Some observers , however , are dubious .
" Control of the media is absolutely paramount for the [ Communist ] party , " argues David Bandurski , who heads the China Media Project at the University of Hong Kong .
" They are not going to dispense with the notion that media control is central to their power in one fell swoop , " he adds .
Certainly Mr. Li gave no signs of such a reversal in his speech at CCTV headquarters .
" We must enhance our consciousness of politics ... firmly establishing the Marxist view of journalism , " he insisted , " constantly improving our capacity to correctly guide public opinion . "
Mr. Bandurski sees the Chinese government 's international media plans as the global dimension of its new approach to news management – actively seeking to influence the agenda rather than relying on simple censorship .
" They recognize that when they censor , they just create a vacuum " likely to be filled by Western reporting the authorities do not like , says Bandurski .
Censoring can also be inconsistent in its rigidity .
When a protester hurled a shoe at Prime Minister Wen Jiabao during his speech this week at England 's Cambridge University , one CCTV channel cut away from its coverage while another kept on broadcasting .
" The new focus , " Bandurski continues , " is on how to drive the agenda . "
News is a matter of national security in China , and the authorities sometimes frame their forays into the world of international media in military terms ; officials have likened big media groups , for example , to aircraft carriers , acting as platforms for the projection of Chinese interests .
" The outreach effort is very natural because of the growing strength of the nation , " says Professor Gong .
" They [ officials ] are clear about what to say but they do n't know how to say it with the best results . "
And so long as the party insists on controlling the media , China will have difficulty convincing foreign viewers to consider its point of view , he adds .
" They have realized the problem of cross-cultural communications , but before serious political reform takes place they cannot do much . "
Bandurski puts it more bluntly .
" They 've got a lot to learn , " he says , " about how to create credibility . "
Toyota is looking to a greener future — literally — with dreams of an ultralight , superefficient plug - in hybrid with a bioplastic body made of seaweed that could be in showrooms within 15 years .
The kelp car would build upon the already hypergreen 1 / X plug - in hybrid concept , which weighs 926 pounds , by replacing its carbon - fiber body with plastic derived from seaweed .
As wild as it might sound , bioplastics are becoming increasingly common and Toyota thinks it 's only a matter of time before automakers use them to build cars .
" We used lightweight carbon - fiber reinforced plastic throughout the body and frame for its superior collision safety , " project manager Tetsuya Kaida said of the 1/X , which is pronounced " one-xth . "
" But that material is made from oil .
In the future , I 'm sure we will have access to new and better materials , such as those made from plants , something natural , maybe something like paper .
In fact , I want to create such a vehicle from seaweed because Japan is surrounded by the sea . "
A kelp car is not as far - fetched as it might sound .
Bioplastics are being used for everything from gift cards to cellphone cases .
Demand for the stuff is expected to hit 50 billion pounds annually within five years , a figure that would account for 10 percent of the world market for plastic , according to USA Today .
A company called NatureWorks claims the production of its bioplastic Inego produces 60 percent less carbon dioxide than petroleum - based plastic and requires 30 percent less energy .
And Oakridge National Laboratory has explored the possibility of producing carbon fiber from wood pulp .
Toyota is laying out its green vision of the future ahead of the Melbourne Motor Show , where it will highlight three sweet hybrids — the next - gen Prius , a cool Camry concept designed in Australia and the 1/X , so named because its carbon footprint is a fraction of that of other cars .
" The 1/ X concept is a vehicle that completely redefines what it means to be environmentally considerate , " David Buttner , senior executive director of sales and marketing , said in a statement .
" The name says it all : a car that weighs a fraction of the others in its class today and uses a fraction of the fuel . "
The 1/X has been kicking around the show circuit for more than a year , and the photo is from its North American debut at the 2008 Chicago auto show .
It features a tiny 500 cc engine and weighs about one - third as much as the Prius while offering about as much interior space .
It 's got a flex - fuel engine and electric motor powered by lithium - ion batteries .
But do n't expect to drive a Toyota Sea - Class anytime soon .
" In reality , the seaweed car is another decade away , " Buttner told the Sydney Herald - Sun .
" However , it shows where we 're going ....
Our thinking is that post - 2020 , cars like the 1/X will be made of plant - based plastic . "

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy insisted on Monday in firm and passionate terms that a comprehensive investigation be launched into the conduct of the Bush administration , saying anything less would prevent the country from moving forward .
Speaking at a forum at Georgetown University , the Vermont Democrat suggested the creation of a truth and reconciliation commission to uncover the “ misdeeds ” of the past eight years .
“ Many Americans feel we need to get to the bottom of what went wrong , ” said Leahy .
“ I agree .
We need to be able to read the page before we turn the page . ”
The Senator also stated that Attorney General Eric Holder never gave assurances to Republican Senators that he would not prosecute Bush administration officials who may have been involved in illegalities such as authorizing torture or warrantless wiretapping .
“ There are some who resist any effort to investigate the misdeeds of the recent past , ” he said .
“ Indeed , during the nomination hearing of Eric Holder , some of my fellow Senators on the other side of the aisle tried to extract a devil ’s bargain from him in exchange for the votes — a commitment that he would not make …
That is a pledge no prosecutor should give and Eric Holder did not give it .
But because he did not it accounts for some of the votes against him . ”
At one point , Leahy slammed the lectern with his right fist , underscoring the emotion he brought to the debate .
His remarks referred to claims that Holder had provided Republicans on the Judiciary Committee a pledge not to prosecute Bush officials — claims that the Obama administration denied .
Leahy framed his commission idea — which he had not discussed publicly prior to Monday — as a middle ground of sorts between those who adamantly oppose investigations and those who say “ we must prosecute Bush administration officials to lay down a marker . ”
The Senate , he proposed , would “ authorize a group of people universally recognized as fair - minded and without any axe to grind ” to investigate the Bush administration ’s actions .
“ Rather than vengeance , we need a fair - minded pursuit of what actually happened , ” he said .
This is “ not to humiliate people or punish people , but to get the truth out , so we do n’t make the same mistakes again , ” Leahy said later during the question and answer session .
“ We fought Revolution in this country so we could protest the actions of government .
We should protect that . ”
After the speech , Leahy elaborated a bit on what he had just announced :
The commission could , if needed , be granted subpoena power and it would investigate everything from torture to the faulty information that brought the country into war in Iraq .
He had not , he acknowledged , discussed the idea with the Obama administration or Holder .
After 35 years in Washington , he said , “ I like being able to say what I want to say . ”

Are You Maxing Out Your Triangle ?
I have found an interesting article called “ Maxing out your Triangle ” today .
He found that most people take on new jobs , projects and hobbies for three reasons : 1 . To learn something new , 2 .
To pay the bills , 3 .
Because they love doing it .
These three things fulfill some of our very basic needs — they give us stability , excitement , ways to contribute and opportunities to grow .
Some people might ascribe to the philosophy that it ’s okay to be at a well - paid - yet - crappy day job and use the remaining time and money enjoying your hobbies .
you end up missing out on pieces of the bigger ( triangular ) pie .
There ’s a certain joy that comes from doing what you love , getting compensated for it and constantly learning new things in the process .
Your goal should be to maximize each experience and try to cover as many new areas of the bigger triangle as possible .
Re-evaluate everything you ’re working on .
Grab a pen right now and draw a triangle for every job , project and hobby .
Take a good hard look at each one .
What can you do to get more out of that experience ?
If it ’s not helping you max out the bigger triangle , drop it and find something else to spend your time on .
I am really glad that I am a freelance web developer .
I can learn something new every day , and I love what I am doing , at the same time , it pays the bills as well .

Since their electoral landslide victory in November 2002 , Islamists within Turkey 's Justice and Development Party ( Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi , AKP ) have camouflaged themselves as " democratic Islamic conservatives . " [ 1 ]
The AKP claims to be the Muslim equivalent of the Christian - Democratic parties of Western Europe .
Such an analogy is false , however .
What the AKP seeks is not " Islam without fear , " to borrow the phrase of Trinity College professor Raymond Baker , [ 2 ] but rather a strategy for a creeping Islamization that culminates in a Shari‘a ( Islamic law ) state not compatible with a secular , democratic order .
The AKP does not advertise this agenda and often denies it .
This did not convince the chief prosecutor of Turkey who , because of AKP efforts to Islamize Turkey , sought to ban the party and seventy - one of its leaders .
While the AKP survived a ban , the majority of justices found that the AKP had worked to advance an Islamist agenda and undermine secularism . [ 3 ]
Nevertheless , the AKP enjoys the backing of the United States and the European Union as well .
Through its support for institutional Islamism in Turkey , the West loses its true friends : liberal Muslims .
Advance of Secularism
Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan ( L ) , Javier Solana , European Union high representative , and José Zapatero ( R ) , Spanish prime minister , meet at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Riga Summit , November 29 , 2006 .
A problem for both Turkey 's entry into the European Union and the Turkish diaspora in Europe is how to encourage the Turkish diaspora 's Europeanization .
If Turkey were to become a secular , European - style democracy , it would face no obstacles to European Union accession .
The processes of secularization predate the Kemalist revolution and trace back to the Tanzimat reforms , which Ottoman sultans began in the mid-nineteenth century .
However , it was the Kemalist revolution that established real secularism in Turkey .
Today , Turkey is the only one of fifty - seven majority Muslim states in which secularism is constitutionally enshrined .
After establishing the republic , Mustafa Kemal Atatürk abolished the caliphate , Shari‘a courts , and other aspects of the Islamic legal system and religious order .
The problem remains , however , that while the state is secular in terms of its full adoption of the Swiss legal code , such secularism does not extend to civil society , at least in terms of " open society . " [ 4 ]
Constitutionally , Turkey is a secular state but , in reality , both Turkish civil society and its institutions are weak .
In this sense , Turkey does not meet the democratic standards prevailing in the member states of the European Union .
Turkish law guarantees neither freedom of religion nor freedom of speech .
In 2005 , Turkish authorities sought to prosecute prominent Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk for his remarks regarding the World War I - era deaths of Armenians .
[ 5 ]
The AKP has legislated a variety of reforms , but these remain more cosmetic than real .
[ 6 ]
Şerif Mardin , a political science professor at Sabancı University who is sympathetic to the AKP , argues that " Civil society is a Western dream … [ It ] does not translate into Islamic terms . " [ 7 ]
Still , Turkey is democratic .
Despite coups in 1960 , 1971 , and 1980 , Turkey has had thirteen competitive , national elections in the past half - century and more than twenty changes of ruling party .
Next to Mali and Senegal , Freedom House ranks Turkey the freest majority Muslim country . [ 8 ]
But , even if it compares favorably to other majority Muslim countries , Turkey is not a fully democratic state .
Its national security council , Milli Güvenlik Kurulu ( MGK ) , was long run by the military and is still dominated by the military . [ 9 ]
While not the most democratic institution — the MGK could , in practice , overrule parliament — the organization has secured the secular character of Turkey much as Iran 's Council of Guardians intervenes to ensure that country 's Islamist character .
Ironically , even as European officials applauded reforms that , in August 2004 , bestowed a civilian head and civilian majority upon the MGK , Turkey has become less democratic .
Today , the AKP party with almost a two - thirds majority in parliament , rules Turkey like a one - party state .
The party ignores the opposition and has abandoned efforts to reach out to any constituency beyond Anatolian Islamists .
It awards state positions , for example , almost exclusively to Islamists . [ 10 ]
Still , even as Ankara backslides away from democracy , Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and President Abdullah Gül leverage the European Union accession process to create an illusion of tolerance and reform .
Turkey 's Approach to Europe
In a sense , the AKP's Islamism and European outreach illustrate a paradox in the way Muslims approach Europe : Either they favor Europeanization of Islam or Islamization of Europe . [ 11 ]
With reform and accommodation , Islam can be compatible with democracy , but Islamism cannot .
In the world of Islam , Islamism aims at reversing the process of cultural modernization .
Today , acculturation and secularization are reversed into re-traditionalization , de-acculturation , and de-secularization .
The ongoing de-Westernization in Turkish society is clear .
There have been three Islamist parties since the 1970s with a real chance of acquiring power .
All three were judicially invalidated — the Milli Selamet Partisi in 1980 , the Refah Partisi in 1998 , and the Fizelet Partisi in 2001 — for the threat they posed to secularity in Turkey . [ 12 ]
Each of the Islamist leaders pursued different strategies .
Neçmetten Erbakan who , as Refah leader , became Turkey 's first Islamist prime minister , combined Islamism with neo-Ottomanism — an ideological revival of Ottoman glory — and pan-Turkish outlooks .
The Erdoğan generation of Islamists , in contrast , presents itself in European terms , but its commitment to both Europe and democracy is instrumental .
As Hudson Institute scholar Zeyno Baran explains , the AKP 's commitment to democracy rests not on philosophical agreement with its principles but rather because " democratic elections … [ have ] proven to be the easiest and most legitimate path to power . " [ 13 ]
Europeanized Islam embraces the values of cultural modernity , pluralism , and secular tolerance .
Secularism and religious tolerance have , in many ways , provided the basis of European cultural development .
Despite its Christian roots , Europe has been secular since the Renaissance and Enlightenment .
Polemics that insist that the European Union is reluctant to accept an Islamic country into its fold are false .
Europe was Europeanized through " the spread of one particular culture . " [ 14 ]
There is no reason why Turkish assimilation into Europe could not Europeanize Turkey just as the EU has Europeanized Spain , Greece , Poland , and in part , Romania .
Turkey , after all , is contiguous with Europe and shares a common Byzantine heritage with much of southern Europe , including not only the Balkan states but also much of Greece .
Ottoman modernity , however , never accepted the spirit of Europe .
It was based on the adoption of European instruments and technology but the rejection of European values .
Such instrumental Europeanization did not stabilize the Islamic - Ottoman rule but rather contributed to its downfall .
The Kemalist revolution arose from the failure of the Young Ottomans and Young Turks .
Atatürk 's agenda was the Europeanization of Turkey , not only technologically but also with the adoption of cultural outlooks based on modern values and norms .
The Kemalist revolution sought to give Turkey a civilizational identity defined not by religion but rather by cultural values shared with Europe : secularism , individual human rights , civil society , and the rule of law .
The problem with Atatürk 's Europeanization of Turkey was that the process was a revolution from above , imposing innovations on society without providing the necessary cultural underpinning .
By focusing on urban centers , it left the countryside barely affected .
The result was a bifurcation of society : a European , urban culture in Istanbul , Ankara , and Izmir , and a rural society deeply rooted in Islamic tradition . [ 15 ]
The AKP , however , does not accept Europeanization .
Rather , AKP leaders pursue a double strategy :
They verbally dissociate their party — and themselves — from political Islam while simultaneously embracing Islamic identity politics and , like many Islamist parties across the globe , also engaging in anti-Christian polemics . [ 16 ]
The AKP uses education as its major instrument to further Islamist identity politics , introduce reinvented Islamic values , and de-Westernize society .
And while the AKP claims secular credit for pursuing Turkey 's EU membership , it defames Europe as an exclusionary " club of Christians . " [ 17 ]
Since its November 2002 accession , the AKP has engaged in a " creeping Islamization . " [ 18 ]
The AKP has sought to further this through politics of cultural Islamization , especially in education and media .
Erdoğan has worked to expand Anatolian culture in the cities , helped by internal migration .
The slums and shanty towns have become the AKP 's chief base of support .
Needed : Islam's Europeanization
The problem of both Turkey 's entry into the European Union and the Turkish diaspora in Europe is not Islam itself but rather how to encourage the Turkish diaspora 's Europeanization .
If Turkey were to become a secular , European - style democracy , it would face no obstacles to European Union accession , nor would such a strong boundary exist between Turkey and Europe if Turkey 's religion were a more civil Islam . [ 19 ]
What Turkey needs is not simply a laundry list of civil reforms but Europeanization of Islam .
There is nothing European about the ghettos of Turkish migrants living in Islamic enclaves in Berlin suburbs such Neuköln and Kreuzberg .
These " Muslim enclaves " — including the Turkish ones — are " in the West , but not of it . " [ 20 ]
The AKP encourages such a division , though .
In February 2008 , Erdoğan labeled assimilation of Turks a " crime against humanity . " [ 21 ]
The Turkish diaspora in Europe remains antagonistic to their new home .
The two major Turkish mosques in Germany — in Pforzheim and Bremen — are named Fatih ( conqueror ) after Ottoman Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror who , in 1453 , captured the Byzantine capital of Constantinople , modern day Istanbul .
Most Turks in Germany are not integrated into civil society .
If Turkey , as the AKP sees it , enters the European Union , it would resemble more the Kreuzberg and Neuköln enclaves than the European parts of Istanbul or Ankara .
While Erdoğan says his decision to guide Turkey toward Europe is firm , declaring , for example , that " Turkey has no other alternative than the full membership of the EU , " [ 22 ] it is less certain whether Europe could absorb a country ruled by Islamists .
The question of whether Turks can or will adopt a Europeanized Islam is crucial because demography and migration suggest that Europe will be dealing with Turkey for years to come .
Turkish migration westward is not simply a twentieth and twenty - first century phenomenon but part of a larger pattern that began almost a millennium ago . [ 23 ]
Many Turks joined Ottoman incursions into southeast Europe for opportunity and adventure . [ 24 ]
Turkey 's European Union accession would lead to a similar movement of population .
The European Union 's living standard and generous welfare system will attract Turkey 's rural population , which suffers from an unemployment rate between 20 and 30 percent , and where many do not receive welfare benefits . [ 25 ]
Indeed , some Turkish politicians have suggested that this migration should make Turkey more attractive to Europe arguing that Turkey can offer Europe , with its aging and declining populations , a young Turkish population .
There is something to this .
Turkish population figures have doubled since 1970 while Western European states have a shrinking population due to low birth rates and an aging population . [ 26 ]
No doubt , migration would be an advantage for Europe , as much as it has been for the United States , provided that Europe , like the United States , assimilates its immigrants .
Given the AKP 's instrumental approach to EU accession , it is ironic that while the European public largely opposes Turkey 's accession , European diplomats still push the Turks to undermine the three pillars of the secular republic — the military , judiciary , and educational system — purportedly to make Turkey fit into the European Union .
While European officials couch their prescribed reforms in the language of transformational diplomacy and democracy promotions , they ignore that Islamists only accept democracy as the rule of the majority , not as a culture of pluralism .
At the World Economic Forum in Davos in 1999 , the late prime minister Bülent Ecevet responded to European criticism of the imbalance of power between the parliament and the MGK by explaining , " In your countries , the political culture [ of ] secularity is well established , and therefore , there is no need for a guardian to protect it .
In my country , Turkey , secularism still lacks firm foundations and can always be threatened , therefore the need to protect it . " [ 27 ]
The Turkish writer Murat Çakır described the Islamists as " pseudo - democrats , " who use democracy as a cover for the promotion of Islamization whether in Turkey itself or among the Turkish diaspora in Europe . [ 28 ]
He observes that Ankara does not contribute to Europeanizing the Turkish Muslim diaspora .
Mosques , built and administered by the Turkish state through the Diyanet İşleri Başkanlığı ( directorate of religious affairs ) , are not European even if they are moderate in comparison to the more militant Milli Görüş mosques . [ 29 ]
The difference between the Diyanet and Milli Görüş mosques , however , has eroded since AKP accession led to its control of the Diyanet .
The secular commitment to democracy and to its values does not register in the Islamist model of an Islamic state ( din- ü - devlet ) , which the AKP 's actions show it accepts .
Why then have Western policies toward Turkey not changed under AKP rule ?
Part of the problem is that Europe does not have a clear awareness of its civilizational identity .
In contrast , migrants and Turkey itself strongly cultivate civilizational awareness in their own identity politics .
The Islamist challenge and the potential of Islamization are based on facts , but they are not well understood in Europe .
The Turkish diaspora in Europe , as well as the population in Turkey itself , is caught between Europeanization and Islamization .
The European decision - makers have proven in the past to be incapable of designing policies to address challenges arising from ethnic - cultural diversification of the population .
European officials neglect or simply ignore cultural issues such as the identity of Europe and Europeanization .
The AKP Abandons Compromise
Compromising and power sharing are an essential part of democratic politics .
Repeated experience with Islamists show that they go to the ballots but fail to compromise when they win .
The AKP is no exception .
Erdoğan wanted to promote his foreign minister , Abdullah Gül , to the presidency in 2007 , and he did so at the expense of a traditional process of consensus - building among opposition parties and so sparked a political crisis .
While the AKP won subsequent parliamentary elections , its victory had as much to do with the weakness of the secularist parties as with satisfaction with the AKP .
The 2007 election win enabled the AKP to retrench , sending Gül to Çankaya palace as the first non-secular president of Turkey .
With its majority solidified and no longer fearing the veto of a secular president , the AKP accelerated its de-secularization of Turkish society .
Here , the head scarf is especially important .
Among Islamists , the head scarf is not just an article of clothing but an icon of civilizational divide .
Islamists view the head scarf as a provision of the Shari‘a . [ 30 ]
It has become symbolic of the tension between Europeanization and Islamization .
In a 2004 ruling , the European Court of Human Rights found the right to a head scarf not to be a human right , thus dismissing an Islamist lawsuit . [ 31 ]
Upon their reelection , though , the AKP decided to provoke secular elites with legislation enabling female university students to wear a head scarf on campus and in classes .
On June 5 , 2008 , the Turkish Supreme Court deemed the AKP 's law to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it eroded Turkey 's secular character . [ 32 ]
Soon after , the London - based pan-Arabic daily Al - Hayat quoted Erdoğan as stating , " We are going to shut down the constitutional court . " [ 33 ]
Many Europeans have cheered Erdoğan and condemned court actions in Turkey .
AKP partisans in the Turkish press and proponents of Turkey as a model of moderate Islam in the United States and Europe labeled Turkish secularists as " fascists " and accused them of undermining " democratic " Islamists . [ 34 ]
Zeyno Baran observed that such an artificial dichotomy " inadvertently strengthens hard - line Islamists . " [ 35 ]
As the West sides with the Islamists , the opposition , feeling abandoned , has become more anti-Western .
Again , Baran explains , " The opposition 's anti-Western stand is more like that of a lover with a broken heart … [ they ] fear that Europeans push them to undertake reforms that will make Turkey more Islamic , and then will tell them that they are too Islamic to join a Western club . " [ 36 ]
The crisis continued into the summer as the Constitutional Court heard arguments that the AKP had violated the principles of a democratic and secular Turkish republic . [ 37 ]
Had the court dissolved the party , it would have toppled the government and plunged the country into political turmoil . [ 38 ]
The court wanted to avoid this outcome as it would have ended the AKP but not the Islamist challenge .
The AKP could simply have transferred its assets to another party and reemerged under a new name , just as the AKP had emerged from the ashes of Fezilet .
The court did not acquit the AKP , however , but instead gave it a strong warning to stop steering Turkey away from the secular order that the constitution mandates towards an Islamic one .
Court president Haşim Kiliç stated , " There is no verdict on closure … However , in this ruling a serious warning has been issued to the party [ AKP ] , and I hope this conclusion will be elevated and will be taken accordingly . " [ 39 ]
Secularism Abandoned
Western politicians , scholars , and opinion leaders barely understand what is going on in Turkey .
Too many Western pundits depict Turkey 's increasing Islamism as fortuitous .
The Rand Corporation 's Stephen Larrabee , for example , wrote , " Under the AKP , Turkey has emerged as an important diplomatic actor in the region … without the AKP … the United States would lose an important partner in trying to stabilize this volatile region …
At the same time , banning the party could undercut efforts to promote reform and democracy in the Middle East . " [ 40 ]
Such views infuriate secular Turks .
It is ironic that the intra-Turkish debate on the pernicious nature of Islamism has been more open than the Western one .
In the name of democratic reforms , as European diplomats have observed , the AKP has reduced the secular impact of the army , defamed judicial defense of the constitution as a " judicial coup , " expanded the Imam Hatip religious schools and equated them to secular schools , and fired university presidents .
Too many in the West praise the AKP as " moderate Islamic . "
The only difference , however , between moderate and jihadist Islamists is the use of the ballot box instead of violence to come to power .
It may be important to include Islamists in democracy but certainly not with the Western naive notion that inclusion will tame Islamism .
This is the lesson that should be drawn from Hamas in Gaza , Hezbollah in Lebanon , and certain Islamist parties in Iraq .
Hamas and Hezbollah may be represented in parliaments , but they have kept their militias that represent the antithesis of democracy .
They show how their embrace of the democratic game is only a tactical step .
The AKP may be better than Hamas and Hezbollah since it has no militia although its dominance and use of the police force and secret services have become nearly as abusive .
The proper solution for crisis - ridden Turkey is neither the tacit Islamic law of the AKP nor a coup by the Turkish secularists .
Rather , the European Union and the United States should encourage the strengthening of civil society by making the weak institutions of Turkish democracy stronger .
Moderate Islamists want to Islamize , not democratize . [ 41 ]
They are committed to the procedure of democracy but not to its pluralistic and peaceful political culture .
Political Islam in Turkey is an important issue for Europe .
Turkey not only has close relations to the West , but it also has a diaspora of more than four million in the European Union . [ 42 ]
While many moderate Muslims seek to Europeanize Islam , the Islamism practiced by the AKP is an ideology of cultural divide , tension , and conflict , despite all of the pro-Europe rhetoric in which Islamists in Turkey engage in their pursuit to exploit the European Union for their agenda of Islamization .

Type 508 Accommodation and the title of the report in the subject line of e-mail .
Fatal Occupational Injuries --- United States , 1980 -- 1997 CDC monitors deaths from occupational injuries through the National Traumatic Occupational Fatalities ( NTOF ) surveillance system ( 1,2 ) .
This report provides an overview of traumatic occupational deaths among civilian workers from NTOF from 1980 through 1997 , the most recent year for which data are available .
The data presented in this report indicate a decrease in occupational deaths over this period with mining , agriculture / forestry / fishing , and construction having the highest death rates ; motor - vehicle crashes were the leading cause of injury - related deaths for U.S. workers .
State health departments and others involved in prevention of occupational injuries can use the data to prioritize intervention programs .
NTOF contains information obtained from death certificates from the vital statistics reporting units in the 50 states , New York City , and the District of Columbia ( 1 ) . *
Crude death rates per 100,000 workers were calculated as the number of deaths among civilian workers for each year divided by the number of employed civilians for each year .
Employment estimates for rate calculations were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ' ( BLS ) Current Population Survey ( CPS ) , a population - based , household - sample survey of the civilian , noninstitutionalized population .
These data were extracted from the BLS Employment and Earnings  and the CPS monthly microdata files ( 3 ) .
Employment data used for rate calculations were based on the number of workers .
National Estimates During 1980 -- 1997 , 103,945 civilian workers died in the United States from occupational injuries , an average of 16 work - related deaths per day .
The annual number of traumatic occupational deaths declined 28 % , from 7343 in 1980 to 5285 in 1997 .
The rate for occupational injury deaths for all workers decreased 45 % , from 7.4 per 100,000 workers in 1980 to 4.1 in 1997 .
Males accounted for 93 % of all deaths , with a death rate approximately 11 times that of females ( Table 1 ) .
Although 85 % of civilian workers who died were white , blacks had a higher fatality rate ( 5.6 per 100,000 workers ) than whites ( 5.0 ) .
Workers aged 25 -- 34 years accounted for the largest number of occupational injury deaths , and workers aged > 65 years had the highest age - specific death rate ( Table 1 ) .
Since 1980 , motor - vehicle crashes accounted for 24 % of deaths and were the leading cause of injury - related death for U.S. workers .
In 1990 , homicides became the second leading cause of occupational injury deaths ( 14 % ) , surpassing machine - related deaths ( 13 % ) .
Deaths caused by falls and electrocutions accounted for 10 % and 7 % of work - related deaths , respectively .
The industries in which the largest numbers of deaths occurred were construction ( 19,179 deaths [ 19 % of reported deaths ] ) , transportation / communications / public utilities ( 17,489 [ 17 % ] ) , and manufacturing ( 15,490 [ 15 % ] ) .
Industries with the highest death rates were mining ( 30 per 100,000 workers ) , agriculture / forestry / fishing ( 19 ) , and construction ( 15 ) .
The risk for specific causes of death varied by industry .
Machinery was the leading cause of death in agriculture / forestry / fishing , mining , and manufacturing .
Falls were the most prevalent in construction , followed by motor - vehicle crashes , and machinery .
Motor - vehicle crashes were the leading cause of death in transportation / communications / public utilities , wholesale trade , and public administration .
Homicide was the leading cause of death in retail trade , finance / insurance / real estate , and services .
The occupation categories in which the largest number of deaths occurred were precision production / craft / repairers ( 21,412 deaths [ 21 % ] ) , transportation / material movers ( 18,251 [ 18 % ] ) , and farmers / foresters / fishers ( 13,597 [ 13 % ] ) .
Occupation categories with the highest death rates were farmers / foresters / fishers ( 21.4 per 100,000 workers ) , transportation / material movers ( 21.3 ) , and handlers / equipment cleaners / helpers / laborers ( 13.4 ) .
State Estimates
The greatest number of fatal occupational injuries occurred in California ( 10,712 deaths [ 10 % ] ) , Texas ( 10,294 [ 10 % ] ) , Florida ( 6,269 [ 6 % ] ) , Illinois ( 4,582 [ 4 % ] ) , and Pennsylvania ( 4,402 [ 4 % ] ) .
Fatal occupational injury rates were highest in Alaska ( 22.7 per 100,000 workers ) , Wyoming ( 15.8 ) , Montana ( 11.8 ) , Idaho ( 10.4 ) , and West Virginia ( 10.1 ) .
The leading causes of death varied for each of these five states .
For example , water transport accounted for the most deaths in Alaska ( 33 % ) , compared with approximately 2 % for the United States , and air transport was the second or third leading cause of death in four of the five states , compared with being the seventh overall cause of death nationally .
Reported by : Div of Safety Research , National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health , CDC .
Editorial Note :
The findings in this report indicate a general decrease during 1980 -- 1997 in the annual number of deaths and the annual rates of occupational deaths in the United States .
In addition , the leading causes of death have changed through the 1990s .
Although surveillance data cannot identify reasons for these temporal trends , changes in the workplace ( e.g. , increased and better targeted regulations , improved hazard awareness , new technology , and mechanization ) are possible factors ( 4 ) .
In addition , changes in the economy , the industrial mix , and the distribution of the workforce ( 4 ) and improvements in acute trauma care for injured workers may have contributed to these decreases .
NTOF is the only surveillance system with comprehensive fatal occupational injury data for the United States during the 1980s .
NTOF provides data for examining temporal trends and analyzing data by cause of death and industry , both useful tools for identifying injury patterns and suggesting targets for interventions .
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations .
First , only 67%-- 90 % of all fatal occupational injuries can be identified using death certificates as the source of case identification ( 1 ) .
Second , standardized guidelines for coding the " Injury at Work ? " item on the death certificates were introduced in 1992 ; § as a result , earlier application of this item may have been inconsistently applied .
Third , information derived solely from death certificates lacks the level of detail found in multisource databases , resulting in increased potential for misclassification .
Finally , the rates presented in this report do not reflect the difference in exposure for groups that commonly work < 40 hours per week ( e.g. , youth and older workers ) .
In 1992 , BLS began collecting data on work - related deaths from all 50 states and the District of Columbia through the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries ( CFOI ) , a multisource surveillance system that incorporates information from various sources , including death certificates , workers ' compensation reports , medical examiner and coroner reports , news media , motor - vehicle incident reports , information from other federal agencies , and follow - up questionnaires ( 5 ) .
CFOI uses multiple data sources and requires that work - relatedness be substantiated by at least two of these sources , leading to improvements in both case ascertainment and data accuracy .
NTOF and CFOI identified similar patterns from 1992 through 1997 , the years for which data collection for the two systems overlapped ; however , NTOF identified 32,368 deaths , compared with 37,875 by CFOI ( 6 ) .
One of the national health objectives for 2010 is to reduce the rate of work - related injury death to 3.2 per 100,000 workers ( objective 20 - 1a ) ( 7 ) .
Surveillance data , such as those gathered through NTOF and CFOI , provide the basis for strategies to prevent traumatic work - related deaths by profiling high - risk worker groups and leading causes of death .
This information can be used to develop targeted injury - prevention efforts .

There are dozens of different cable chargers for phones
The world 's biggest mobile phone makers and network operators have backed plans to create a universal phone recharger .
Most manufacturers now produce chargers which work only with their own devices .
The re-charger will consume 50 % less stand - by energy than today 's models , the GSM Association ( GSMA ) , an umbrella group for the industry , said .
Firms to back the plan include Nokia , Motorola , Samsung , Sony Ericsson , LG , T - Mobile , Orange , 3 , AT&T and Vodafone .
The majority of new handsets will support the re-charger by 2012 .
" This is a broad agreement that will move the industry to a single , energy - efficient charger for all mobile phones , " said Michael O'Hara , marketing director for the GSMA .
In a statement , Mitti Storckovius , director of environment , devices at Nokia said : " By supporting this industry initiative on common charging solutions , and enabling consumers to choose if they need a charger with every new device or can re-use existing ones , we can contribute further in improving the industry 's environmental footprint . "
The micro-USB connector will be used as the common charging interface .
Manufacturers had been under pressure from the European Commission to produce a standardised charger .
EU Industry Commissioner Guenter Verheugen told German radio station Deutsche Welle last week that there were more than 30 different kinds of charger in use across the 27 - nation European Union .
The GSMA estimates the new charger will mean the potential elimination of up to 51,000 tonnes of duplicate chargers .
' Dragged to her death ' : Woman killed after ' angry boyfriend pulled her in front of train '
A mother - of - two was dragged into the path of a train by her angry boyfriend seconds after another man had saved her when her foot was caught in a level crossing , a court heard yesterday .
Kelly Mack 's Ugg - style boot had become wedged in the side of a track before a passer - by pulled her to safety .
But she was allegedly ' snatched ' away by boyfriend Darren Palmer who ' lost his temper ' as he rushed to catch another train from a nearby platform .
Death scene : Police at Hythe station where Kelly Mack was killed
Miss Mack , 29 , was killed instantly by a train passing through Hythe Station in Colchester while Palmer , 39 , managed to jump clear .
David Etherington QC , prosecuting , yesterday described Palmer 's actions as ' selfish and incredibly dangerous ' .
' The prosecution case is that Darren Palmer dragged Kelly Mack across the railway tracks against her will to get to the opposite platform where they were going to catch a train to Clacton , ' he said .
' The problem is the level crossing barriers were down and a train was due to come through .
Darren Palmer , left , is accused of killing his girlfriend Kelly Mack .
Jonathan Freer - Smith tried to save her
' The Crown 's case is he ignored the shouts of those present warning of the train 's imminent arrival .
He acted with complete disregard to the obvious danger to which he was putting them both . '
Chelmsford Crown Court heard the couple arrived at the station at 7.45 pm in March last year and Palmer began crossing the tracks ahead of Miss Mack before her foot became caught .
' When she went to cross she caught her boot in between some of the wooden planks .
There had been some arguments and shouting between them as to why she had not crossed the track , ' Mr Etherington said .
The jury was told a member of the public , 18 - year - old Jonathan Freer - Smith , rushed to help Miss Mack .
Mr Etherington added : ' He went on to the crossing to help Kelly Mack .
He told her to " leave the boot " and got her physically to the London side of the tracks , the safe side , as the danger was coming on the Clacton side .
' Indeed , had things stayed as they were , this would have taken her out of the path of the train altogether .
Boots : A pair of Uggs
' The defendant took exception to this and walked back across and snatched her from Mr Freer - Smith 's grasp and dragged her to the Clacton side and into the path of the train .
He managed to jump clear of the train but she was killed when it hit her . '
The court heard Miss Mack was three times the drink - drive limit and was on a cocktail of methadone and four types of Valium - type drugs .
Mr Etherington said Palmer may also have been intoxicated .
Unemployed Palmer told police he thought the safety barriers were down because the train coming into the station was going to stop .
He admitted he should never have tried to cross the tracks in the first place but said he did not see the train coming .
He insisted his girlfriend had stumbled and he helped her up and denied that Mr Freer - Smith had rescued her , saying : ' Kelly would never have gone with a stranger . '
Mr Etherington added : ' You can be sure Darren Palmer lost his temper as she had failed to come to him .
He dragged her across the track in the path of the train .
The prosecution will prove it was Darren Palmer 's unlawful act that cost Kelly her life and the risk of fatal collision was obvious . '
Palmer denies manslaughter .
The case continues .

Boston College coach Jeff Jagodzinski has been told he will be fired if he interviews for the head - coaching vacancy with the New York Jets , according to sources .
The interview is scheduled for Monday evening .
Despite the threat from athletic director Gene DeFilippo , Jagodzinski plans to do the interview with the Jets , the sources said .
If Jagodzinski is fired , the school will consider three in - house candidates to replace him as head coach -- offensive coordinator Steve Logan , defensive coordinator Frank Spaziani and offensive line / assistant head coach Jack Bicknell -- a source told ESPN.com 's Pat Forde .
" If Jags wants to be here , he 'll be here , " the source told Forde .
" If he does n't want to be here , he wo n't be . "
The school is concerned that the Jets ' interview could be the beginning of a trend for Jagodzinski where he will try to get an NFL job , the source told Forde .
Jeff Jagodzinski has been head coach at Boston College the past two seasons .

According to the sources , DeFilippo first told Jagodzinski on Saturday that he would be fired if he interviewed and then reinforced the school 's position Sunday .
Jagodzinski declined to comment when reached by ESPN .
" I like Jeff .
I mean , I really like Jeff , " DeFilippo said when
asked if there was any way Jagodzinski could be back in Chestnut
Hill next season .
" We 're going to handle the situation as it
unfolds . "
But another BC source said Jagodzinski informed his coaching staff of the development this weekend after at least two discussions with DeFilippo .
The Jets did not have a reaction or confirm they are interested in Jagodzinski , but ESPN and other news outlets have reported his candidacy .
Jagodzinski , 45 , has been head coach at Boston College the past two seasons , with the team finishing first in the ACC 's Atlantic Division each year .
In 2007 the Eagles went 11 - 3 , including a victory over Michigan State in the Champs Sports Bowl .
This past season , BC finished 9 - 5 after losing to Vanderbilt in the Gaylord Hotels Music City Bowl .

On Tuesday , December 16 , 2008 the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) lowered the federal - funds - rate target from 1 % to between 0.25 % and 0 % .
According to the FOMC statement ,
The Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time .
Another main reason behind the massive reduction in the federal - funds - rate target is the suppression of emerging price deflation .
The consumer price index ( CPI ) fell by 1.7 % in November from the month before .
This was the biggest monthly fall since 1947 .
( In July 1949 the CPI fell by 0.9 % . )
Most commentators regard deflation as a terrible thing that must be countered as soon as possible .
This is also the view of Federal Reserve policymakers , in particular Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke .
To counter a possible deepening in price deflation the US central bank — in addition to lowering the fed funds to zero — is pursuing aggressive monetary pumping .
In December the yearly rate of growth of the Fed 's monetary pumping stood at 151.7 % against 141.3 % in November and 2.6 % in December 2007 .
As a result of the Fed 's pumping its balance sheet jumped to $ 2.238 trillion from $ 0.9 trillion in December 2007 .
According to the latest FOMC statement , the US central bank is likely to raise its balance sheet further in the months ahead .
The focus of the Committee 's policy going forward will be to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that sustain the size of the Federal Reserve 's balance sheet at a high level .
As previously announced , over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage - backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets , and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage - backed securities as conditions warrant .
The Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer - term Treasury securities .
Early next year , the Federal Reserve will also implement the Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses .
The Federal Reserve will continue to consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity .
Is so - called deflation such a dreadful thing as most commentators imply ?
In the present case , the emerging decline in prices is the outcome of a severe weakening of various nonproductive bubble activities that have emerged on the back of past loose monetary policy of the Fed .
Thus between January 2001 and June 2004 the federal - funds - rate target was lowered from 6 % to 1 % .
It is this aggressive loose stance that gave birth to various false activities .
The reversal of this loose stance from June 2004 to September 2007 — when the federal - funds - rate target was increased from 1 % to 5.25 % — started to undermine various false activities .
( False activities cannot survive without the support of monetary pumping ; they cannot secure goods and services without money out of thin air .
In contrast , various wealth - generating activities do not require loose - money policy to secure goods ; wealth generators acquire other goods — real wealth — by means of the real wealth they have produced . )
" If it were possible to lift real economic growth by means of money pumping , world poverty would have been eradicated a long time ago . "
As a result , the ability of false activities to increase the rate of price growth has weakened .
Consequently , their ability to divert goods to themselves from wealth - generating activities by bidding prices higher has also weakened .
( Remember that a price of a good is the amount of money per unit of a good .
Also remember that false activities divert goods to themselves by means of money that was created out of thin air . )
This is good news for wealth generators since less diversion of wealth strengthens wealth generators .
From this we can infer that pushing massive amounts of money to counter price declines serves to prop up various false activities and weakens wealth - generating activities .
This delays sustainable economic recovery .
As things stand at present , on account of banks ' reluctance to expand lending , most of the Fed 's monetary pumping ends up within the banking sector and does n't spread to the rest of the economy .
In this sense , this is positive for wealth generators .
For the time being , it seems that banks are not keen to lend , preferring instead to sit on large amounts of cash .
In the week ending December 17 , 2008 banks ' cash reserves jumped to $ 774.4 billion from $ 604.7 billion in November and $ 2.39 billion in December 2008 .
In early December the yearly rate of growth of commercial bank loans fell to 3.5 % from 4.8 % in November and 10.2 % in December 2007 .
( The data are adjusted for large commercial bank acquisitions of nonbank institutions in the week ending October 1 , 2008 . )
Banks are reluctant to lend and have significantly tightened their lending standards , due to the large amount of bad assets that they have accumulated .
According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) , equity of commercial banks and savings institutions fell by $ 44 billion in the Q3 2008 after declining by $ 10 billion in the previous quarter .
The rising level of bad loans , particularly in real estate , has led many banks to increase their level of provisions for loan losses in Q3 .
Loss provisions stood at $ 50.5 billion , more than three times what the banks put aside in Q3 2007 .
Now , the essence of credit is not about lending money as such but actually lending the real stuff — real savings .
Without real savings no lending is possible .
The fact that banks have accumulated a large amount of bad assets may indicate that the pool of real savings is in trouble .
If this is the case , it will be futile to try to boost lending by pushing more money into the banking system .
If the pool of real savings is falling , this means that the percentage of false activities exceeds the percentage of wealth - generating activities out of total activities .
Consequently , banks are likely to remain reluctant to lend regardless of the Fed 's pumping ; this in turn will continue to undermine bubble activities .
As a result the growth momentum of prices will continue to weaken .
The Fed could bypass various lenders and hand money directly to people in order to boost spending and reverse the decline in prices — via " helicopter money . "
Such a policy is likely to severely damage the real economy .
If it were possible to lift real economic growth by means of money pumping , world poverty would have been eradicated a long time ago .
Real economic growth requires real savings to fund various activities that support and promote it .
( Remember that money is just a medium of exchange and cannot grow anything .
Money is employed to exchange goods of one wealth generator for the goods of another wealth generator . )
Can fiscal policy revive economic activity ?
At the G20 summit on November 15 , 2008 leaders stressed that fiscal policy — strong increases in government outlays — will have a bigger role to play in reviving economic activity .
US President - elect Barack Obama has suggested that one should not worry about budget deficits — what matters , he said , is to revive the economy .
But how can an increase in government outlays kick - start the economy ?
Any activity that the government would initiate requires funding .
( Various individuals who will be employed by the government will expect compensation for their work . )
The government as such does n't create any real wealth , so the only way it can pay these individuals is by taxing others who are still generating real wealth .
By doing this , the government weakens the wealth - generating process and undermines prospects for economic recovery .
( We ignore here borrowings from foreigners . )
As in the case of money - printing policy , if the pool of real savings is declining , massive government outlays cannot revive the economy ; on the contrary , they will make things much worse .
The only way fiscal stimulus could " work " is if the pool of real savings is still growing .
The increase in economic activity when the pool of real savings is expanding is erroneously attributed to the government 's loose fiscal policy .
If the pool is shrinking , real economic activity will continue to decline — regardless of any increase in government outlays .
Again , government is not a wealth - generating entity ; the more it spends , the more it takes from wealth generators , thereby weakening any prospects for a recovery .
In his various comments , US President - elect Barack Obama has suggested that the aim of his economic policies would be to create employment .
He has also reiterated that various job - creation projects under his administration will not amount to a reckless spending of taxpayers ' money .
According to the president - elect , he will spend money wisely by undertaking only essential projects such as fixing roads .
But this is no different from what a centralized system like the former Soviet Union attempted .
The collapse of the Soviet Union 's system is the best testimony to the impossibility of replacing the market economy — as far as the best use of scarce resources is concerned .
Contrary to President - elect Obama 's assertions , what is required is a rapid buildup of real wealth .
What is the point of employing people in jobs that the free market would not endorse ?
Does it mean that fixing infrastructure such as roads is a bad idea ?
Not at all .
However , given the present lack of real wealth , Americans cannot afford to improve the roads .
There are more important priorities .
One could argue that it would be a great idea for every individual in the United States to have a luxury car .
However , if the level of real income cannot support this , then bicycles may be all that Americans can afford .
If the government were to push for a universal - luxury - car plan , there would not be enough means to produce more urgent needs — such as food .
By focusing on creating employment rather than real wealth , US policymakers are likely to further undermine the process of real wealth formation — and cause economic impoverishment .
Does this imply that we should n't be concerned with growing unemployment ?
Not at all .
Once the focus becomes wealth generation , then by implication this will lead towards a less - controlled economy .
In a true free - market economy , unemployment is never an issue .
At present both the US central bank and the US Treasury are pursuing knee - jerk policies .
The aggressive policies of the Fed and the Treasury are an attempt to suppress the symptoms ; no attempt is made to logically evaluate the true causes of the present crisis .
For most experts , in particular Ben Bernanke , the causes of the current crisis are of a complex nature — i.e. , they are mysterious .
This is why practitioners of the mainstream methodology treat symptoms rather than causes .
The outcome of such an approach is to inflict ever more damage on the economy .
It has not occurred to Bernanke that a massive amount of money cannot replace nonexistent real savings .
If pushing money is going to fix the problem , why is a country like Zimbabwe in total ruin after doing just that ?
Since we do not believe that Bernanke will cease his massive pumping , Congress must act as soon as possible to stop it .
Failing to do so runs the risk of severely damaging the US economy .
Conclusion
The current policy of fighting price deflation is a recipe for economic disaster .
What is required is purging the economy of various false activities that severely undermine its ability to generate real wealth .
Various policies aimed at fixing the symptoms rather than addressing the true causes are only making matters worse .
The fall in the prices of goods and services is in response to the weakening of false activities .
This means that so - called price deflation indicates that false activities are in trouble .
This should be seen as great news since it means that the process of purging the economy is in force .
The sooner the economy is cleaned up , the sooner wealth generators can start making real wealth — the key for the economy 's revival .
To prevent a further destruction of the American economy , Congress must stop the reckless policies of the Fed and the Treasury as soon as possible .

There was a time when I could 've lived at Pizza Hut .
In the 80's , it was the greatest place ever .
I could eat an entire ( personal pan ) pizza myself , collect Land Before Time dinosaur puppets -- which were better than shitty McDonalds toys , because they were puppets -- and if it were an option , I would have had the breadstick sauce pumped directly into my veins .
20 years ago , pizza was king .
No , it was better than king .
It was awesome !
The Ninja Turtles would not shut up about pizza .
Even though their choice of toppings was questionable , having the Turtles eat pizza made them instantly relatable to me and my friends .
After all , who does n't want to eat pizza constantly ( Besides adults , that is ! ) ?
Ninja Turtles became so synonymous with pizza that their direct competition , Samurai Pizza Cats , had to put " pizza " in the title of their show , just to keep up .
There was more than one chain of kid's restaurants featuring animatronic entertainment and -- what else ? -- a menu centered around pizza .
Chuck E. Cheese and Showbiz Pizza merged and thrived in kid consciousness during the 80s , but do kids even go to Chuck E's anymore ?
I mean , besides kids who want to get into fist fights with adults .
Even the government endorsed pizza in the 80s .
October is " National Pizza Month " as of 1987 .
" Book It , " a program featured in public schools since 1984 , bribes children to read with pizza .
We essentially became the United States of Pizzmerica , or Amerizza , or some similar merger between the words " America " and " Pizza . "
I think the Golden Age of Pizza has passed .
It 's easy to write that statement off as the ramblings of an 80's child , but I do n't see any excitement for pizza anymore .
Now there 's gourmet pizza , but do people really get excited over California Pizza Kitchen ?
Living in California , I eat a lot of sushi , which is tasty , but definitely not awesome .
With the push for healthier eating , I bet parents are getting their kids vegan pizza , or no pizza at all .
I mean , what are AYSO and Pony baseball teams supposed to eat after a tremendous victory or even a heartbreaking loss ?
Pizza - less bellies of America 's children is a very depressing thought , but I think ( and hope ) one day , pizza will rise again .

Behind the scenes , Obama 's support among Republicans grows John Byrne
Published : Wednesday January 14 , 2009
Print This Email This Even GOP senator praises Obama 's style over Bush 's President - elect Barack Obama has quietly been working the halls of Congress in recent weeks -- he 's been to Capitol Hill meeting with lawmakers three times since his election .
It appears , according to Congressmembers , that Obama 's push is having an effect .
In fact , two " swing vote " senators told a Capitol Hill newspaper in comments published Wednesday that they believe Obama 's aggressive wooing of legislators will win him more votes on the Hill .
The two , Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) and Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) , are moderate members of their respective parties and may signal a broader shift in the Capitol .
In comments published Wednesday , Obama received high marks from Republican senators .
Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) , who worked with Obama on government transparency issues in the Senate , offered Obama unconditional praise .
 I think he is sincere  all the time ,  Coburn told Roll Call .
 I believe it because I know him . 
 He and his staff have done a good job of reaching out to us ,  Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - TN ) added .
 I hope his tone is reflected in the Senate Majority Leaders tone . 
Sen .
Snowe , who generally votes with the Republican caucus but sometimes provides support to Democrats , said Obama 's approach differs markedly from Bush's .
Bush rarely -- if ever -- appeared on the Hill , and oftentimes when he did it was only for public events , like St. Patrick 's Day .
Obama is reaching out early on and setting the tone from the start by which , optimally , he will govern ,  Snowe remarked .
 Everyone wants him to be successful ,  Alabama senator Jeff Sessions added .
Texas Sen. John Cornyn was more cautious , saying the GOP would known " soon enough , " of Obama 's sincerity .
But Cornyn is tasked with being the GOP 's attack dog as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee -- the equivalent of the Democrats ' Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) .
Added Cornyn ,  Im confident that there will be sufficient differences to distinguish Republicans and Democrats as we move forward . 
In the House , Roll Call noted in a separate article that Republicans have muted their criticisms of the newly elected president .
The paper was careful to note , however , that the Republican effort to leave Obama alone may be part of a carefully orchestrated political calculus .
 Republicans  best friend right now is Obama because Pelosi ends up getting triangulated ,  former spokesman for retired House Speaker Dennis Hastert said .
 If Republicans attack too early and dont give him a chance to govern , we come off as sore losers and lose any credibility that were rebuilding . 
Even so , the closely - divided Senate is more important to Obama 's legislative agenda , since the Democrats ' margin in the House is far greater .
Obama 's outreach could pay major dividends when he attempts to advance his agenda following his inauguration Jan. 20 .
Young men who smoke marijuana are more likely to develop an aggressive form of testicular cancer than those who have never tried the drug , a study has found .
Smoking the drug at least once a week , or using it regularly from adolescence , doubled the risk of a fast - growing form of the disease called nonseminoma , which tends to strike men in their 20s and 30s , researchers said .
The US study is the first to find evidence of a link between cannabis and testicular cancer , which is the most common type of cancer among British men aged 20 to 44 .
More than 1,900 new cases of the disease are diagnosed in the UK each year , but it responds well to treatment , with nine in 10 men surviving .
The findings suggest that smoking the drug before the age of 18 raises the cancer risk by coaxing immature cells in the testes to become tumours later in life .
Scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Centre in Seattle investigated the possibility of a link after learning that the testes were one of the few organs in the body to contain receptors for the main psychoactive substance in the drug , tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) .
There has also been a rise in testicular cancer cases that has mirrored the rise in marijuana use since the 1950s , they said .
" Our study is not the first to suggest that some aspect of a man 's lifestyle or environment is a risk factor for testicular cancer , but it is the first that has looked at marijuana use , " said Stephen Schwartz , an epidemiologist and author on the study .
The researchers asked 369 testicular cancer patients if they had any history of marijuana use .
A further 979 healthy men were asked about their use of the drug .
After accounting for any family history of the cancer and lifestyle factors , such as smoking and drinking alcohol , the study found cannabis use emerged as a significant , separate risk factor for the disease .
Being an existing cannabis user raised the risk of cancer by 70 % , while men who had used the drug regularly from puberty were twice as likely to develop the disease than those who had not used the drug .
Men naturally produce a cannabinoid - like substance that is thought to protect the testes against tumours .
But smoking cannabis may disrupt this and so raise the risk of cancer , the study speculates .
Ecstasy remains class A
The home secretary will reject calls to downgrade ecstasy to a class B drug this week in a move that risks igniting a fresh row with its own drug advisers .
Jacqui Smith will be urged to remove ecstasy from the class A category , which it shares with heroin , in a report to be published on Wednesday by the government 's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs .
The report follows a year - long ACMD review of the health risks associated with ecstasy after a request by the all - party science and technology committee .
The Home Office has made it clear it has no intention of reclassifying the drug .
In January , the government upgraded cannabis to class B , against ACMD advice .
" For the first time in history , " writes the creators of Headbang Hero , " a wireless motion - sensing wig is used as a game controller . "
God , I was wondering if I 'd ever live to see that day .
We just got sent this in tips by Tiago Martins , who created Headbang Hero along with Andreas Zingerle and Ricardo Nascimento .
The concept is simple - Thrash the Wiigmote in time with the beat and rack up points .

Know what I love about this ?
Just as Rock Band has convinced me I can play guitar , this will convince me I still have hair .
Says the development trio :
This is the first complete prototype of Headbang Hero , an interactive project by Tiago Martins , Andreas Zingerle and Ricardo Nascimento .
It 's a kind of tribute to the popular Guitar Hero game and headbangers all around the world .
Also , for the first time in history a wireless motion - sensing wig is used as game controller .
The hardware is based on the Arduino platform ; the software is based on the Processing environment and the Minim library .

Keanu Reeves has been yearning to do a Cowboy Bebop movie for years now , no matter how many scifi movies he has to stone - face his way through — and it sounds like he 's getting closer .

Right now , Reeves is working on bringing the classic Japanese series Cowboy Bebop to life with producer Erwin Stoff ( who has the rights and the writer ) .
Reeves wants to play the lead role Spike Spiegel , which is one of the coolest leads out there .
Spiegel lives in a future that 's more like a space western , where gangs slaughter the innocent and it's up to Spiegel to cowboy around , picking up the deadliest space criminals .
And Western is exactly the look Reeves wants .
In an interview with MTV Reeves explains :
“ It ’s got a Western quality , a Western film noir aspect to it , ” Reeves said of why he ’s such a big fan of Shinichiro Watanabe and Keiko Nobumoto ’s groundbreaking series .
“ It ’s got so much style to it , and that ’s part of its appeal .
That kind of Old West , bordertown , low - tech science fiction aspect . ”

All Reeves needs now is a production designer , and I 'd love to get your thoughts on who should make Cowboy Bebop a reality .
I have to admit Keanu has the look , but Spiegel is a very complicated hero — way more complicated than , " Whoa , noodles . "
So I have my doubts about this casting , but still , Reeves gets big points for being a dedicated fan .
Plus there 's the fact that Reeves and company want to cram the whole series into one movie , which could be terribly disjointed and confusing .
“ Yeah , it ’s so episodic and so disconnected .
We ’re trying to figure out what pieces to put together to tell one story , ” he explained .
“ Because it ’s such a short form , to make a 2 hour version [ will be tough ] .
And it ’s got so much of an origin - story obligation ; you ’ve got to get people up to speed , but you do n’t want to do much of that .
There are a lot of things to take into consideration , but we think we can do something good . ”

Which means should they make the entire movie , you 'll get the operatic ending that we 've all come to love , but can he pull this off ?

Feb. 20 , 2002 -- Dental care could soon involve a process as simple as this :
Rinse once , feed bacteria .
A Florida researcher is hoping to soon begin clinical trials for his bacterial rinse that 's designed to stave off tooth decay for a person 's lifetime .
So far , the rinse has worked in rats and early prototypes have been tested in three people .
" You would just need to squirt onto tooth surfaces once , " said Jeffrey Hillman a professor of oral biology at the University of Florida in Gainesville .
Bacteria , he explains , take care of the rest .
The rinse could be a wonderfully simple approach to dental care , although some worry that introducing a modified microbe directly into the body could lead to trouble .
Building a Bug Weapon
Most tooth decay is caused by a particular strain of bacteria called Streptococcus mutans ( S. mutans ) .
While 500 - 600 different kinds of bacteria thrive on mucus and food remnants in the mouth , S. mutans is particularly damaging because it consumes sugar ( mostly refined sugars ) on the surface of teeth and converts it to lactic acid .
The lactic acid is what eats away at a tooth 's enamel .
In the early 1980s , Hillman set out to find a bacterium that might destroy the decay - causing strain .
After taking hundreds of sample swabs from patients ' mouths , he found a bacterium that secretes a toxin that kills S. mutans .
Hillman and his colleagues then altered a gene in the bacterium so it would not secrete lactic acid of its own .
Recently they tweaked the bacterium again so it would only survive if fed a particular nutritional supplement .
That ensures the bacterium wo n't spread from one person to another while kissing or sharing utensils .
" Subjects will have to chew gum or use mouthwash to provide the bacteria with its nutritional supplement , " said Hillman .
When Hillman squirted the strain on rats , the substance appeared to prevent tooth decay in the animals for the entire six - month period of the tests .
He has also squirted a version of the bacterium on three human volunteers .
The strain these people harbor in their mouths kills off the S. mutans bacterium , but does not prevent decay since it also produces lactic acid .
Tests show the strain has successfully warded off all S. mutans bacteria since the early 1980s .
And none of the three subjects have passed on their unique mouth bacteria to their spouses or children .
Ecosystem in Your Mouth
Some might worry that releasing a genetically altered creature inside the human body could lead to trouble .
But Hillman claims he 's just speeding up evolution .
The decay - causing bacterium was probably innocuous until people began eating large quantities of refined sugar .
Another 1,000 years and people might have shed the S. mutans bacterium anyway , he says .
Other dental experts warn it can be dangerous tinkering with the body 's complex balance of bacteria .
" There are many varieties of bacteria in the mouth and they live in a kind of ecosystem there , " said Kenneth Burrell , senior director of the American Dental Association 's Council on Scientific Affairs .
" There 's a balance there if you upset it , you can throw off the bacterial population .
And some bacteria may be necessary to maintain a healthy mouth . "
Burrell adds , however , if tests show the rinse does not upset this balance it could be a boon to dental hygiene .
The rinse would only need to be applied once — preferably when a person is very young — and then the bacterium would settle into the patient 's mouth for life .
Adult patients could also use the rinse to prevent any further dental decay they may have already experienced .
Bacteria is often thought of as a target when it comes to cleaning , but recently , researchers have found strains that work well as cleaning tools .
Companies like BioOne and Eco- Save provide cleaners that employ bacteria to eat through plumbing and bathroom scum .
And environmentalists have found certain bacteria are effective in cleaning up toxic waste .
Now Hillman 's bacterial strain , known as BCS3 - L1 , could take up a similar role in the mouth .
Hillman presented his findings at this year 's meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston .
Fewer Trips to the Dentist ?
Just because a bacterium may be fighting tooth decay in your mouth does n't mean you 'll be free of the task of tooth brushing and flossing , Hillman says .
Those daily practices are still needed for preventing gum disease and bad breath .
And while the thought of a decay - ending agent may cause unease among some dentists who make a living on the problem , Burrell points out the rinse could actually end up improving business .
" If this rinse really works , it could mean the average person will have their teeth for a longer time , " he said .
" Then they might have various gum infections that they would n't have experienced if they lost their teeth to tooth decay , and they 'll need dentists for that . "
Wall Street Uses the “ S ” Word to Denounce Criticizing its Bonuses — Socialism !
Created : February 01 , 2009 12:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The New York Times took a stab at getting people who work on Wall Street to defend taking in more than $ 18 billion in bonuses — roughly the amount that was paid out in 2004 , when the economy was just slightly different – and found that most are n’t owning up to ever getting the money .
From The Times :
[ I]t was rather remarkable on Friday how many white shirts denied getting a bonus altogether when they were asked .
Indeed , if the data obtained by reporters in the district was any measure , there is no telling where that $ 18 billion really went .
But a few did talk , and their feelings were hurt that President Obama called them shameful .
They used another “ s ” word to describe his views — socialism !
“ I think President Obama painted everyone with a broad stroke , ” said Brian McCaffrey , 55 , a Wall Street lawyer who was on his way to see a client .
“ The way we pay our taxes is bonuses .
The only way that we ’ll get any of our bailout money back is from taxes on bonuses .
I think bonuses should be looked at on a case by case basis , or you turn into a socialist . ”
That , indeed , was a recurring equation : Broad strokes + bonuses = socialist .
“ It ’s a very slippery slope to go down , ” said another insurance broker as he waited to be seated for lunch at Cipriani Downtown .
“ A blanket statement like that borders on ” — you guessed it — “ socialism . ”
I think we ’ve all had enough here .
Before this descends into name calling , I think the best way to resolve this bonus controversy once and for all is to call the bankers ’ bluffs .
They keep saying they need bonuses to retain talent — a hard argument to make for banks that are barely solvent , like Citigroup — and that if they do n’t pay , their top people will leave .
So let ’s just find out if that ’s true .
Let those talented people look elsewhere .
See how well the job market greets financial executives with resumes from bailed - out banks .
Watch what happens to AIG employees who do n’t get retention bonuses and go shopping their service elsewhere .
I do n’t expect a sudden brain drain .
Instead what might happen is something that should have occurred a long time ago .
Wall Street seems to be in some form of denial .
There ’s a sense that big bonuses and corporate perks are still part of the picture , and that life has n’t changed that much .
But it has .
It ’s over .
And so is the notion that top employees of failed banks are any different than the rest of us , that the private sector will pay any price for them .
The financial industry is headed for its first wake - up call with new regulations ahead from an increasingly annoyed Congress and executive branch .
The second is the growing disgust with the old ways of Wall Street at a time when other Americans look at their bank accounts and know that everything has changed .
Monster.com has been good enough for the rest of us .
It should be just fine for the finance industry too .
And accordingly , Liberty Equals Life .
Our will is what defines us as living .
It ’s what makes us critically different from dead inanimate objects , e.g. a rock has no will of it ’s own .
To the extent that you take away or restrict a person ’s will and expression of self , you ’re killing that person .
I ’ve been talking about slavery in very cold and hard terms , and if I communicated my views well , then you probably find it rather depressing .
Well I do n’t mean to be .
Unfortunately , there ’s just no delicate way to tell someone a hard truth like that .
Fortunately , knowledge is power and you have to know the truth before you can deal with it .
The gay rights movement was onto something with the slogan “ Silence Equals Death ” .
To be threatened with punishment for fully living your life as your innate will would have you live it is akin to being suffocated .
Perhaps that sense of suffocation is simply more overt amongst gay and lesbian people by virtue of having a non-typical internal will more at odds with societal standards .
In that sense , it can be seen as a gift , in the same way that sensitivity to pain was likely a beneficial mutation for some of the earliest creatures to evolve nervous systems for reacting to dangers in their environment .
It ’s why the coming out process is such a relief and so empowering .
It ’s like being alive and gulping in deep breaths after feeling suffocated .
Dog Poet Transmitting .......
Ah ... my friends ...
Each morning I arrive in my cloister here and engage in a ceremony involving the pentagram , to the end that I and my activities are shielded from inimical and malefic intrusions ; basically to ' seal the door where evil dwells ' .
That last phrase is taken from The Great Invocation .
Are you familiar with it ?
It came to Alice Bailey from the Tibetan master , Djwhal Kuhl .
It was transmitted in 1945 , just before the end of the World War .
For those unfamiliar with it , here it is ;
“ From the point of Light within the Mind of God
Let light stream forth into the minds of men .
Let Light descend on Earth .
From the point of Love within the Heart of God
Let love stream forth into the hearts of men .
May Christ return to Earth .
From the centre where the Will of God is known
Let purpose guide the little wills of men–
The purpose which the Masters know and serve .
From the centre which we call the race of men
Let the Plan of Love and Light work out
And may it seal the door where evil dwells .
Let Light and Love and Power restore the Plan on Earth . ”
Good sentiments , yes ?
So ... once I have completed the ceremony , I get to work on whatever projects are before me , or appear out of the cauldron of the subconscious .
No ... first I take a virtual stroll through the doings taking place in the world this day , that day , whatever day it may be .
That has not been a pleasant experience for some time .
The levels of delusion , rage , and hysteria ; gimme , gimme , gimme - me , me , me , are redlining without cease .
In consonance with that , is the relentless presence and celebration of depravity , perversity , and willful disregard for all moral boundaries .
It is now cool to ' push the envelope ' , ♫purple hair and nose rings and boys who kill puppies , tattoos and butt - plugs , and transgender guppies .
Preteens with Tramp Stamps and demons that sing , these are a few of their favorite things ♫
Sorry about that .
I was going to show up here today and apologize for some of the graphics that have attended my work at Freakbook and Pocketnet , until I came across this latest bit of artistic garbage that presents Jesus with breasts , in a dress with makeup , dancing for the amusement of children , and giving a sly wink .
This is from the National Church of Iceland .
It is , allegedly , Iceland 's OFFICIAL church .
They took it off their website but it is still featured on the sides of buses traveling through Reykjavik “ every time I try to get out they pull me back in . ”
So ... I can hardly apologize for the last picture when I am now posting this one ( can I ? ) .
Let me be a little more demographically specific ; although no one has said anything to me , I am a telepath and I tend to be informed about all sorts of things going on with the readers .
I know that some of you are very spiritually inclined and sometime there will be things I say or do that do not conform with what you might ' wish ' to expect of me .
This is probably because I have that Martin Luther gene that is inspired to nail excrement to cathedral entrances and ... like that .
This in no way interferes with my love of God , which is unwavering and absolute .
I do not have the same level of affection for the world and MOST ESPECIALLY in these times and I am not one to gaze somberly and with a unique and EXCLUSIVE mien upon the audience accompanied by a faraway look of wisdom in my eyes .
I do n't play those games and HAVE GONE OUT OF MY WAY to behave badly on different occasions to convince people I AM NOT what they were trying to make me out to be .
I did them a big favor but I do n't think they got that or appreciated it .
I 've stopped acting out in this fashion cause it does no good , choosing instead to isolate and only be available to certain people .
This has been working fine .
Okay ... enough about me .
As I was saying , there are these morning rituals and a number of other events through the day that I MUST engage in ( still talking about yourself , visible ? ) because of the external dramas presently being visited upon all of us BUT ...
NOT ONLY THAT ; there are invisible broadcasts going on , from Centers of Evil Intent , which are acting upon the dreaming and unaware and which are responsible for much of the bad behavior presently taking place .
I realize that even to see evil there must be evil within you ( according to the REALIZED Advaitist's . )
HOWEVER ... that is a fine perspective for those further up the road than me and were I to embrace that fully , you probably would n't be hearing from me anymore and I get the sense that the majority of you wish that I continue at this so ... there it is .
Iceland was one of those places I had considered as a possible SAFE HARBOR .
I can forget that now .
There are no safe harbors other than beneath the sheltering wings of The Divine ; see the 23rd Psalm for further details .
It has taken me a little time to realize the truth of things that I have been saying for some time .
That 's the difference between Intellectual and Visceral apprehension .
Either God is ALL POWERFUL or not .
If he is ...
ACT LIKE IT !!!
One must fully live what they believe OR ... find another line of work .
The Divine is not fond of half measures and Weekend Warriors of The Conveniently Faithful .
You are either ALL THE WAY IN or not at all .
What does the Greatest Commandment say ?
“ Thou shalt Love the Lord thy God with ALL your heart , ALL your soul , ALL your strength and with ALL your mind . ”
Or ... do n't bother coming around .
I KNOW this now .
It has taken me , as I said , some time to get that what I have been saying all along is actually true and that I should follow my own advice , indeed ... the angel of The Lord who communicates with me told me that exactly .
Another realization I have recently experienced has to do with RELIANCE on the Almighty for EVERYTHING .
This one statement ; “ rely on me ' , I have heard more than all the rest put together .
I got this , pretty much , BUT ... once again , it had not become Visceral .
It had not become a programmed response out of the subconscious .
As the result of working on it and contemplating the verities , et. al ... it is now becoming a reflex action , directly tied to the revelation I mentioned receiving , in a recent post .
Perhaps you know what I am referring to ?
It is how we can KNOW something is so , but somehow not know it , until ... in a flash of Eureka , we find ourselves the recipient of Epiphany , and then it dawns on us that what we already knew was true , really is true .
That does not sound like a clarification but hopefully , you can read between the lines .
The venomous lies and bully boy tactics , presently being disseminated and practiced by cartoon politicians , fraudulent spiritual personalities , and a sold - out and morally bankrupt media are a thing to behold .
They manifest all of the fascination and rubber - necking of a highway accident to the clueless millions driving SLOWLY right on by , never realizing that it is happening to them until it does happen to them .
Now ... the entire world is being held hostage to this mask scam , whose sole purpose is to get rid of the sitting American president .
You 've been hearing it here for years about the CREEPING INSANITY .
It has now gone Full Blown .
I try to imagine what the common folk , in all the many , many widespread localities must be thinking and feeling at this time .
What of all the small business people who have been ruined ?
What of the poor children being indoctrinated with vile bullshit , programmed to accept deviant behavior as normal ?
What of the aging and elderly , tormented with fears about an infection that does n't exist , except at the level of a seasonal flu ?
The only real pandemics are IGNORANCE and FEAR .
In most cases , the one generates the other .
Dear Lord ...
I pray with all my might that you will come soon .
I pray that you will appear in the human mind and illuminate it with the real , so that it may banish the unreal .
I pray that you open the eyes of humanity to the predators among them and the feckless millions , who serve their demonic agendas , hoping that by serving they will escape notice , that they will be SAFE .
No one is safe , if safe means avoiding suffering and death , that is a COUNTDOWN to CERTAINTY .
Lord ... we know that there are states and conditions which come to us all , but Lord ... please let us live with Integrity and Honor and face it with open eyes , not deceiving ourselves and making ourselves culpable in our own destruction .
Lord ... we know the body is only a temporary habitation but The Soul is in peril in these times .
Grant us sanctuary in our seeming jeopardy .
Comfort us with your presence and send us The Lord of Light SOON ... Lord ... SOON .
Amen .
End Transmission .......
Today 's Song is ; ♫ Back in the World ♫
This song was written for Vietnam veterans .
Parler , where you wo n't be going or voting or commenting , for whatever the reason may be , is located HERE , not that that means anything .
Pocketnet can be accessed by clicking on this highlighted link .
I have selected these passages from Volume 7 , Inspired Talks from The Collected Works of Swami Vivekananda .
I expect you will find them hard to read .
I did .
I know they are true but I AM NOT THERE YET and it serves no good purpose for me to assume I am , no matter what anyone says BECAUSE ... assumptions will be made and Pride will slip in .
I shall remain a dualist until I am TAKEN out of it .
" All knowledge depends upon calmness of mind . "
He who has filled the universe , He who is Self in self , how shall I salute Him !
To know the Atman as my nature is both knowledge and realization .
I am He , there is not the least doubt of it .
No thought , no word , no deed , creates a bondage for me .
I am beyond the senses , I am knowledge and bliss .
There is neither existence nor non-existence , all is Atman .
Shake off all ideas of relativity ; shake off all superstitions ; let caste and birth and Devas and all else vanish .
Why talk of being and becoming ?
Give up talking of dualism and Advaitism !
When were you two , that you talk of two or one ?
The universe is this Holy One and He alone .
Talk not of Yoga to make you pure ; you are pure by your very nature .
None can teach you . ”
“ Men like him who wrote this song are what keep religion alive .
They have actually realized ; they care for nothing , feel nothing done to the body , care not for heat and cold or danger or anything .
They sit still and enjoy the bliss of Atman , while red - hot coals burn their body , and they feel them not .
" When the threefold bondage of knower , knowledge , and known ceases , there is the Atman . "
" Where the delusion of bondage and freedom ceases , there the Atman is . "
" What if you have controlled the mind , what if you have not ?
What if you have money , what if you have not ?
You are the Atman ever pure .
Say , 'I am the Atman .
No bondage ever came near me .
I am the changeless sky ; clouds of belief may pass over me , but they do not touch me . '
Burn virtue , burn vice .
Freedom is baby talk .
I am that immortal Knowledge .
I am that purity . "
" No one was ever bound , none was ever free .
There is none but me .
I am the Infinite , the Ever - free .
Talk not to me !
What can change me , the essence of knowledge !
Who can teach , who can be taught ?
Throw argument , throw philosophy into the ditch .
Only a slave sees slaves , the deluded delusion , the impure impurity .
Place , time causation are all delusions .
It is your disease that you think you are bound and will be free .
You are the Unchangeable .
Talk not .
Sit down and let all things melt away , they are but dreams .
There is no differentiation , no distinction , it is all superstition ; therefore be silent and know what you are .
" I am the essence of bliss .
Follow no ideal , you are all there is .
Fear naught , you are the essence of existence .
Be at peace .
Do not disturb yourself .
You never were in bondage , you never were virtuous or sinful .
Get rid of all these delusions and be at peace .
Whom to worship ?
Who worships ?
All is the Atman .
To speak , to think is superstition .
Repeat over and over , " I am Atman " , I am Atman " .
Let everything else go .
" I am the holiness of the holy " ( Gita ) .
I am the root , each uses it in his own way , but all is I .
" I do everything , you are but the occasion . "
Do not talk much , but feel the spirit within you ; then you are a Jnani .
This is knowledge , all else is ignorance .
All that is to be known is Brahman .
It is the all .
. . .
Sattva binds through the search for happiness and knowledge , Rajas binds through desire , Tamas binds through wrong perception and laziness .
Conquer the two lower by Sattva , and then give up all to the Lord and be free .
The Bhakti-Yogi realises Brahman very soon and goes beyond the three qualities .
( Gita , Chapter XII . )
The will , the consciousness , the senses , desire , the passions , all these combined make what we call the " soul " .
There is first , the apparent self ( body ) ; second , the mental self who mistakes the body for himself ( the Absolute bound by Maya ) ; third , the Atman , the ever pure , the ever free .
Seen partially ,
It is nature ; seen wholly , all nature goes , even the memory of it is lost .
There is the changeable ( mortal ) , the eternally changeable ( nature ) , and the Unchangeable ( Atman ) .
Be perfectly hopeless , that is the highest state .
What is there to hope for ?
Burst asunder the bonds of hope , stand on your Self , be at rest , never mind what you do , give up all to God , but have no hypocrisy about it .
Svastha , the Sanskrit word for " standing on your own Self " , is used colloquially in India to inquire , " Are you well , are you happy ? "
And when Hindus would express , " I saw a thing " , they say , " I saw a word - meaning ( Padârtha ) . "
Even this universe is a " word - meaning " .
A perfect man 's body mechanically does right ; it can do only good because it is fully purified .
The past momentum that carries on the wheel of body is all good .
All evil tendencies are burnt out .
That day is indeed a bad day when we do not speak of the Lord , not a stormy day .
Only love for the Supreme Lord is true Bhakti .
Love for any other being , however great , is not Bhakti .
The " Supreme Lord " here means Ishvara , the concept of which transcends what you in the West mean by the personal God .
He from whom this universe proceeds , in whom it rests , and to whom it returns , He is Ishvara , the Eternal , the Pure , the All - Merciful , the Almighty , the Ever - Free , the All - Knowing , the Teacher of all teachers , the Lord who of His own nature is inexpressible Love .
“ Man does not manufacture God out of his own brain ; but he can only see God in the light of his own capacity , and he attributes to Him the best of all he knows .
Each attribute is the whole of God , and this signifying the whole by one quality is the metaphysical explanation of the personal God.
Ishvara is without form yet has all forms , is without qualities yet has all qualities .
As human beings , we have to see the trinity of existence — God , man , nature ; and we cannot do otherwise . ”
" When the truth is replaced by silence , " the Soviet dissident Yevgeny Yevtushenko said , " the silence is a lie . "
It may appear that the silence on Gaza is broken .
The small cocoons of murdered children , wrapped in green , together with boxes containing their dismembered parents , and the cries of grief and rage of everyone in that death camp by the sea can be witnessed on al - Jazeera and YouTube , even glimpsed on the BBC .
But Russia 's incorrigible poet was not referring to the ephemera we call news ; he was asking why those who knew the why never spoke it , and so denied it .
Among the Anglo - American intelligentsia , this is especially striking .
It is they who hold the keys to the great storehouses of knowledge : the historiographies and archives that lead us to the why .
They know that the horror now raining on Gaza has little to do with Hamas or , absurdly , " Israel 's right to exist " .
They know the opposite to be true : that Palestine 's right to exist was cancelled 61 years ago and that the expulsion and , if necessary , extinction of the indigenous people was planned and executed by the founders of Israel .
They know , for example , that the infamous " Plan D " of 1947 - 48 resulted in the murderous depopulation of 369 Palestinian towns and villages by the Haganah ( Israeli army ) and that massacre upon massacre of Palestinian civilians in such places as Deir Yassin , al - Dawayima , Eilaboun , Jish , Ramle and Lydda are referred to in official records as " ethnic cleansing " .
Arriving at a scene of this carnage , David Ben-Gurion , Israel 's first prime minister , was asked by a general , Yigal Allon : " What shall we do with the Arabs ? "
Ben-Gurion , reported the Israeli historian Benny Morris , " made a dismissive , energetic gesture with his hand and said , ' Expel them ' " .
The order to expel an entire population " without attention to age " was signed by Yitzhak Rabin , a future prime minister promoted by the world 's most efficient propaganda as a peacemaker .
The terrible irony of this was addressed only in passing , such as when the Mapam party co-leader Meir Ya'ari noted " how easily " Israel 's leaders spoke of how it was " possible and permissible to take women , children and old men and to fill the road with them because such is the imperative of strategy .
And this we say . . . who remember who used this means against our people during the [ Second World ] War . . . I am appalled . "
Every subsequent " war " Israel has waged has had the same objective : the expulsion of the native people and the theft of more and more land .
The lie of David and Goliath , of perennial victim , reached its apogee in 1967 when the propaganda became a righteous fury that claimed the Arab states had struck first against Israel .
Since then , mostly Jewish truth - tellers such as Avi Shlaim , Noam Chomsky , Tanya Reinhart , Neve Gordon , Tom Segev , Uri Avnery , Ilan Pappé and Norman Finkelstein have undermined this and other myths and revealed a state shorn of the humane traditions of Judaism , whose unrelenting militarism is the sum of an expansionist , lawless and racist ideology called Zionism .
" It seems , " wrote the Israeli historian Pappé on 2 January , " that even the most horrendous crimes , such as the genocide in Gaza , are treated as discrete events , unconnected to anything that happened in the past and not associated with any ideology or system . . .
Very much as the apartheid ideology explained the oppressive policies of the South African government , this ideology - in its most consensual and simplistic variety - allowed all the Israeli governments in the past and the present to dehumanise the Palestinians wherever they are and strive to destroy them .
The means altered from period to period , from location to location , as did the narrative covering up these atrocities .
But there is a clear pattern [ of genocide ] . "
In Gaza , the enforced starvation and denial of humanitarian aid , the piracy of life - giving resources such as fuel and water , the denial of medicines , the systematic destruction of infrastructure and killing and maiming of the civilian population , 50 per cent of whom are children , fall within the international standard of the Genocide Convention .
" Is it an irresponsible overstatement , " asked Richard Falk , UN special rapporteur for human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories and international law authority at Princeton University , " to associate the treatment of Palestinians with this criminalised Nazi record of collective atrocity ?
I think not . "
In describing a “ holocaust - in - the making ” , Falk was alluding to the Nazis ’ establishment of Jewish ghettos in Poland .
For one month in 1943 , the captive Polish Jews , led by Mordechaj Anielewicz , fought off the German army and the SS , but their resistance was finally crushed and the Nazis exacted their final revenge .
Falk is also a Jew .
Today ’s holocaust - in - the - making , which began with Ben-Gurion ’s Plan D , is in its final stages .
The difference today is that it is a joint US - Israeli project .
The F - 16 jet fighters , the 250lb “ smart ” GBU - 39 bombs supplied on the eve of the attack on Gaza , having been approved by a Congress dominated by the Democratic Party , plus the annual $ 2.4bn in warmaking “ aid ” , give Washington de facto control .
It beggars belief that President - elect Obama was not informed .
Outspoken about Russia ’s war in Georgia and the terrorism in Mumbai , Obama has maintained a silence on Palestine that marks his approval , which is to be expected , given his obsequiousness to the Tel Aviv regime and its lobbyists during the presidential campaign and his appointment of Zionists as his secretary of state and principal Middle East advisers .
When Aretha Franklin sings “ Think ” , her wonderful 1960s anthem to freedom , at Obama ’s inauguration on 20 January , I trust someone with the brave heart of Muntader al - Zaidi , the shoe - thrower , will shout : “ Gaza ! ”
The asymmetry of conquest and terror is clear .
Plan D is now " Operation Cast Lead " , which is the unfinished " Operation Justified Vengeance " .
This was launched by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2001 when , with George W Bush 's approval , he used F - 16s against Palestinian towns and villages for the first time .
Why are the academics and teachers silent ?
Are British universities now no more than “ intellectual Tescos ” ?
In that same year , the authoritative Jane 's Foreign Report disclosed that the Blair government had given Israel the " green light " to attack the West Bank after it was shown Israel 's secret designs for a bloodbath .
It was typical of new Labour 's enduring complicity in Palestine 's agony .
However , the Israeli plan , reported Jane 's , needed the " trigger " of a suicide bombing which would cause " numerous deaths and injuries [ because ] the ' revenge ' factor is crucial " .
This would " motivate Israeli soldiers to demolish the Palestinians " .
What alarmed Sharon and the author of the plan , General Shaul Mofaz , then Israeli chief of staff , was a secret agreement between Yasser Arafat and Hamas to ban suicide attacks .
On 23 November 2001 Israeli agents assassinated the Hamas leader Mahmoud Abu Hanoud and got their " trigger " : the suicide attacks resumed in response to his killing .
Something uncannily similar happened on 4 November last year when Israeli special forces attacked Gaza , killing six people .
Once again , they got their propaganda " trigger " : a ceasefire sustained by the Hamas government - which had imprisoned its violators - was shattered as a result of the Israeli attacks , and home - made rockets were fired into what used to be called Palestine before its Arab occupants were " cleansed " .
On 23 December , Hamas offered to renew the ceasefire , but Israel 's charade was such that its all - out assault on Gaza had been planned six months earlier , according to the Israeli daily Haaretz .
Behind this sordid game is the " Dagan Plan " , named after General Meir Dagan , who served with Sharon during his bloody invasion of Leba non in 1982 .
Now head of Mossad , the Israeli intelligence organisation , Dagan is the author of a " solution " that has brought about the imprisonment of Palestinians behind a ghetto wall snaking across the West Bank and in Gaza , now effectively a concentration camp .
The establishment of a quisling government in Ramallah , under Mahmoud Abbas , is Dagan 's achievement , together with a hasbara ( propaganda ) campaign , relayed through mostly supine , if intimidated western media , notably in the US , which say Hamas is a terrorist organisation devoted to Israel 's destruction and is to " blame " for the massacres and siege of its own people over two generations , since long before its creation .
" We have never had it so good , " said the Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Gideon Meir in 2006 .
" The hasbara effort is a well - oiled machine . "
In fact , Hamas 's real threat is its example as the Arab world 's only democratically elected government , drawing its popularity from its resistance to the Palestinians ' oppressor and tormentor .
This was demonstrated when Hamas foiled a CIA coup in 2007 , an event ordained in the western media as " Hamas 's seizure of power " .
Likewise , Hamas is never described as a government , let alone democratic .
Neither is its proposal of a ten - year truce reported as a historic recognition of the " reality " of Israel and support for a two - state solution with just one condition : that the Israelis obey international law and end their illegal occupation beyond the 1967 borders .
As every annual vote in the UN General Assembly demonstrates , most states agree .
On 4 January , the president of the General Assembly , Miguel d'Escoto , described the Israeli attack on Gaza as a " monstrosity " .
When the monstrosity is done and the people of Gaza are even more stricken , the Dagan Plan foresees what Sharon called a " 1948 - style solution " - the destruction of all Palestinian leadership and authority , followed by mass expulsions into smaller and smaller " cantonments " , and perhaps , finally , into Jordan .
This demolition of institutional and educational life in Gaza is designed to produce , wrote Karma Nabulsi , a Palestinian exile in Britain , " a Hobbesian vision of an anarchic society : truncated , violent , powerless , destroyed , cowed . . .
Look to the Iraq of today : that is what [ Sharon ] had in store for us , and he has nearly achieved it . "
Dr Dahlia Wasfi is an American writer on Iraq and Palestine .
She has a Jewish mother and an Iraqi Muslim father .
" Holocaust denial is anti-Semitic , " she wrote on 31 December .
" But I 'm not talking about the World War II , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad [ the president of Iran ] or Ashkenazi Jews .
What I 'm referring to is the holocaust we are all witnessing and responsible for in Gaza today and in Palestine over the past 60 years . . .
Since Arabs are Semites , US - Israeli policy does n't get more anti-Semitic than this . "
She quoted Rachel Corrie , the young American who went to Palestine to defend Palestinians and was crushed by an Israeli bulldozer .
" I am in the midst of a genocide , " wrote Corrie , " which I am also indirectly supporting , and for which my government is largely responsible . "
Reading the words of both , I am struck by the use of " responsibility " .
Breaking the lie of silence is not an esoteric abstraction , but an urgent responsibility that falls to those with the privilege of a platform .
With the BBC cowed , so too is much of journalism , merely allowing vigorous debate within unmovable , invisible boundaries , ever fearful of the smear of anti-Semitism .
The unreported news , meanwhile , is that the death toll in Gaza is the equivalent of 18,000 dead in Britain .
Imagine , if you can .
Then there are the academics , the deans and teachers and researchers .
Why are they silent as they watch a university bombed and hear the Association of University Teachers in Gaza plead for help ?
Are British universities now , as Terry Eagleton believes , no more than “ intellectual Tescos , churning out a commodity known as graduates rather than greengroceries ” ?
Then there are the writers .
In the dark year of 1939 , the Third American Writers ' Congress was held at Carnegie Hall in New York and the likes of Thomas Mann and Albert Einstein sent messages and spoke up to ensure that the lie of silence was broken .
By one account , 2,500 jammed the auditorium .
Today , this mighty voice of realism and morality is said to be obsolete ; the literary review pages affect an ironic hauteur of irrelevance ; false symbolism is all .
As for the readers , their moral and political imagination is to be pacified , not primed .
The anti-Muslim Martin Amis expressed this well in Visiting Mrs Nabo kov :
" The dominance of the self is not a flaw , it is an evolutionary characteristic ; it is just how things are . "
If that is how things are , we are diminished as a civilised people .
For what happens in Gaza is the defining moment of our time , which either grants war criminals impunity and immunity through our silence , while we contort our own intellect and morality , or it gives us the power to speak out .
For the moment I prefer my own memory of Gaza : of the people 's courage and resistance and their " luminous humanity " , as Karma Nabulsi put it .
On my last trip there , I was rewarded with a spectacle of Palestinian flags fluttering in unlikely places .
It was dusk and children had done this .
No one had told them to do it .
They made flagpoles out of sticks tied together , and a few of them climbed on to a wall and held the flag between them , some silently , others crying out .
They do this every day when they know foreigners are leaving , in the belief that the world will not forget them .
You Forgot Poland
The following are excerpts from an article by Juliusz Ćwieluch and Wawrzyniec Smoczyński [ what a name ! ] that appeared on October 25 , 2008 in the popular Polish newsweekly Polityka :
It takes less than three weeks for American and British troops to reach Baghdad without encountering strong resistance .
But Iraq is a large country , and instead of crowds hungry for democracy and human rights , the soldiers find themselves greeted by irksome attacks attributed to Saddam loyalists .
The White House adjusts the plan of action on the fly , and President Bush declares that democratization has to be preceded by stabilization .
In order not to make it look like the Americans are occupying the country , Washington decides to hand over half the country to its closest allies : the British and the Poles .
In Poland , the idea of having our own sector elicits a mixture of incredulity and delight .
We ' select ' a calm region between Basra and Baghdad [...]
But it will require two thousand soldiers , not two hundred , to control an area a quarter the size of Poland and the three million people scattered across it .
The Polish government graciously agrees , but under one condition : the Americans are going to have to foot the bill .
And so we find ourselves renting out the Polish flag , with the Polish mission imperceptibly changing from a volunteer one to a mercenary one .
With some1600 Polish entrepreneurs already picturing the treasures of the desert in their mind 's eye , it becomes all the easier for us to assume the role of the occupier .
The Lucznik company wants to equip the Iraqi Army with rifles , Stalexport wants to lay rail , Bumar would like to build a railroad from Kuwait to Iran , and Mostostal , Budimex , and Energobudowa each want to build roads , bridges , housing complexes and ports .
And everything is supposed to be easy .
After all , there were forty thousand Polish workers and twenty - five joint ventures in Iraq back in socialist days .
We will serve as the eyes and ears for the deaf and blind American companies .
[ Foreign Minister ] Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz baldly states the aims of our Iraq policy .
“ We would like for Polish petrochemical firms to finally have direct access to raw materials ” says the head of Polish diplomacy .
[ Polish state oil company ]
Orlen and the Gdansk Refinery set up a consortium , although their drilling experience lies mainly in the Baltic sea , and Middle Eastern petroleum can't be processed by Polish refineries .
Are they worried about the competition ?
With the help of the Polish government the Iraqis are sure to reward our soldiers ' hard labor with a few contracts .
After all , deals struck outside of Poland do n't have to be all that honest .
Poland , in charge of the Multinational Division , grows in stature as a military power .
It does n't hurt that the first country to join the Multinational Divison is one that the average Pole would have trouble finding on a map - Fiji .
" They gave us troops , and we had to arm them , feed them , and pay them a very high salary " recalls then - Defense Department head Janusz Zemke .
" It turns out their entire army spends its time on these kinds of missions , which relieves Fiji from having to support it .
It also reduces the risks of military coup , which has a certain history over there . "
Following their experience in Afghanistan , the Americans know that if they leave logistics to the Poles it will be a year before they see the first Polish troops arrive in Iraq .
So without being asked , they agree to take on responsibility for transporting , feeding and lodging the troops .
They are even very flexible when it comes to money .
“ I asked the people in Washington how we were supposed to finance reconstruction of the province , pay our network of agents and repurchase arms from civilians .
What I got back was a practical question - would eight tons of twenty - dollar bills be enough ?
The pallets with the cash were enough to fill an entire Hercules , but I can't tell you what the full amount was ” confesses Zemke .
...
The Polish Army embarrassed itself in even the smallest things .
Seats in our troop transports were set up so that soldiers sat facing one another .
This made it easier for them to chat , and for the enemy to shoot them in the back .
Naturally , the bulletproof vests the troops were issued only protected their chest .
When the search began for the responsible parties in Poland , it turned out that the Army had been ordering this seating layout for fifty years without anybody complaining .
The only excuse for the mission organizers was the fact that leading the multinational division was basically a fiction .
Whenever it was supposed to go into action , it would turn out that each country had some kind of limits on the use of its forces .
One group could only shoot when it was over 50 km from its base , another was only allowed to fight in self - defense , some commanders invented pretexts for inaction on the spot .
" The Hungarians sent a transport batallion without any vehicles .
When we gave them the vehicles , they still found excuses not to complete the tasks assigned to them .
We had to cut off their water to get them to give in , " said one member of the Defense Department who requested anonymity .
...
Meanwhile back in Poland , neocolonial hubris was giving way to resentment of our ally .
The largest bid to include a Polish firm ended in scandal and total disaster .
In February 2004 , the state - owned Bumar firm lost a bid for a contract to equip 27 batallions of the Iraqi army .
The contract was instead won by a mysterious consortium called Nour USA , whose subcontractor was an even more obscure Polish company called Ostrowski Arms .
What would later turn out to be a four - person company with its headquarters in a Warsaw basement was supposed to provide Iraq with arms for 20 thousand soldiers .
And its owner was not even licensed to trade arms overseas .
The Nour contract ended up being voided , but Bumar lost the second round of bids as well .
As a consolation prize it received some smaller contracts for helicopters , ambulances , cisterns and handguns .
But the scandals did n't stop .
Iraq ordered 24 post - Soviet Mi-17 helicopters that Bumar overhauled at a rush pace in Russia , using a company belonging to an ex-KGB member .
After inspecting the first seven units , the Iraqi delegation refused to take delivery .
In 2005 , the new Iraqi government accused its predecessor of malfeasance in the area of defense procurement , and of purchasing useless scrap on a wide scale , including this purchase from Poland .
Among the accused was the former Iraqi Vice - Minister of Defense , now a Polish citizen , Ziyad Cattan .
The 28 - year - old helicopters ended up , of course , being bought by the Polish Army .
On October 25 the last armed Polish soldier will leave Iraq , leaving only 20 trainers as part of a NATO force .
The military agrees on one thing : Iraq has revealed the weakness of the Polish Army , paving the way for its reform .
" Before Iraq the process of professionalizing the Army was off in the weeds " says Janusz Zemke .
But we still have a way to go to be a professional Army . [...]
Rumor has it that the new Chief of Staff may be Mieczyslaw Stachowiak , famous for losing 90 % of his units in a single day during a NATO command exercise .
[...]
We have learned to look at the Iraq mission exclusively in terms of salary paid , contracts lost and Humvees received .
There was no moral or political reflection over the intervention in Iraq five years ago , and there still is n't any now .
The humbug about weapons of mass destruction , a hundred thousand civilians killed , the tortures in Abu Ghraib - all of that took place in some other war , one that Polish public opinion always opposed , at least in polls .
Which , of course , did not prevent us from taking pride in our own valiant mercenaries , courageous colonists and good occupiers .
It certainly helps to have the authorization rules in your Rails app defined in a clear DSL , such as the one offered by declarative_authorization .
Still , with anything more than a few roles and models ( let ’s not even think about 200 models ) , it can be hard to maintain a good view of the whole rules set .
So , how about a graphical browser of your authorization rules ?
In particular inheritance between roles and privileges – and consequences thereof – may be much easier to grasp in a graphical way .
This is how it looks in the declarative_authorization demo application :
Roles are shown in colored ovals and are connected to privileges in the context boxes .
Inheritance links between roles and privileges are displayed in black , with unfilled arrows .
Filled circles on role - privilege links show additional rules that apply .
You can filter to dig deeper into the rules and limit the view to certain roles or contexts .
Also , you can decide to only display those privileges that are explicitly stated in the authorization configuration or all privileges that the roles possess .
If you are interested , give it a try .
Either in the declarative_authorization demo application or in your own application .
The declarative_authorization README tells you the one simple step to get it started .
This feature requires graphviz for graph generation and Rails 2.3 for its Engine support .
On the long run , we ’d like to integrate multiple abstraction levels for different viewing audiences and we might even add authorization rule editing capabilities .
What do you think ?
Does this help you as a developer or in discussions with non-technical customers about authorization ?
New videos highlight vivid contrast of Mandarin Oriental Hotel fire to fires in WTC 7 before its free fall collapse
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , February 10 , 2009
New videos of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel fire in Beijing highlight the vivid contrast between the damage it suffered as it was completely consumed by roaring flames , yet remained standing , and the comparative sporadic fires across just 8 floors that led to the complete free fall collapse of WTC 7 .
9/11 truth debunkers are in a bind as to how to respond to the Beijing skyscraper fire because of the building ’s similarity in size to Building 7 and the gargantuan fire damage it suffered in comparison with the limited “ office fires ” witnessed in WTC 7 .
The Mandarin Oriental Hotel is over 500 feet tall , just 100 feet short of the height of WTC 7 .
The fires that consumed the Beijing building were on a completely different scale to those witnessed on 9/11 , with the flames so violent and widespread that they masked almost the entire view of the building .
The best debunkers have come up with seems to be the false notion that the fires caused a partial collapse by making the building “ lean ” .
This is of course complete baloney because the facade of the building was designed to appear as if it was leaning in the first place , as the image below highlights , with shots before and after the fire .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Since the Beijing building was still under construction , sprinkler systems had not been installed , providing another similarity to WTC 7 , in which sprinkler systems malfunctioned before its collapse .
The Mandarin Oriental Hotel was also a steel - framed building with a concrete core and may even have included steel salvaged from the debris of the twin towers and WTC 7 that was hastily shipped off to China shortly after 9/11 .
Just take a look at the intensity of the fire that consumed the building but failed to bring it down in the following You Tube clip .
Now compare that with the fires that preceded the collapse of WTC 7 .
How can any rational thinking person watch those two videos and lend any credence whatsoever to NIST ’s claim that “ thermal expansion ” could have brought down WTC 7 into its own footprint , whereas the dramatic inferno that totally consumed the Beijing building had little structural effect whatsoever ?
Apparently forgetting NIST ’s newly invented “ thermal expansion ” theory , a scientific discovery that presumably has replaced the laws of physics , this Chinese news correspondent stands perilously close to the building completely unaware that since 9/11 , all buildings that suffer minor fires , never mind towering infernos such as this , must collapse within 7 seconds into their own footprint .
Here are another two clips for comparison .
The dramatic flames engulfing the Beijing building , compared to the restricted “ office fires ” in WTC 7 .
Here are four more images of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel ablaze and the aftermath .
Who could have guessed the resulting damage of the two fires ?
In Beijing ….
And on 9/11 ….
9/11 truth debunking websites have so far been silent on the Mandarin Oriental Hotel fire and are likely to remain so .
Yesterday ’s fire serves to reinforce facts and not the fairy tales that the official 9/11 story is based around – namely that fire cannot weaken or melt steel to the point where a building collapses at free fall speed into its own footprint , without the aid of explosives .

Oh John McCain , I 'm so glad you 're gone .
But I wish you would actually leave !
Through Cosmic Variance I found out John McCain has a Twitter feed .
That 's pretty amazing for a guy who does n't understand computers or even use email , but hey , everyone 's capable of change .
Or maybe not all of us .
McCain posted a list to Twitter of the " TOP TEN PORKIEST PROJECTS " in the stimulus Omnibus spending bill .
Now c'mon , guess what number 2 was .
Guess !
OK , did you guess that it would be some small amount of money that went to science and public education ?
Good for you !
You win ... well , nothing , except the chance to bang your head against a wall .
Here is the tweet in question :
# 2. $ 2 million “ for the promotion of astronomy ” in Hawaii - because nothing says new jobs for average Americans like investing in astronomy
Ah , McCain .
Maybe you 've changed enough to learn some new tech , but it 's nice to know some things do n't change , like that you 're an antiscience know - nothing .
But then , he helped set that standard with his ridiculous planetarium ravings .
Let 's be clear : astronomy needs to be funded .
It 's one of the best public - relations field science has .
People love astronomy .
And putting that aside , astronomy is important .
I do n't think I need go into that here , but you can always read this if you 're fuzzy on the details .
Also , it touches the philosophical aspects of our lives , like how we got here and and where we 're headed .
Perhaps platitudes about such things satisfy some people , but some of us are pretty well concerned with reality .
That 's why we study it .
And then there 's the bottom line : that 2 million dollar investment will keep people employed in a high - tech industry .
What is it about Republican leaders that they do n't understand it 's not pork , it 's investment and that equals stimulus .
Building a bridge that is n't needed to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars is pork .
Putting money towards science is making sure that we stay on the cutting - edge of technological capability in the world .
See the difference ?
Geez , this is n't rocket science .
Speaking of which , let me point out the contrast of McCain still actively unwilling to support science and science education to Obama 's wanting to fund NASA and science in next year 's budget and in the stimulus bill .
Interesting , is n't it ?
So , Senator McCain , let me make this clear : you , amateur exorcist and creationist Bobby Jindal , and the rest of your backwards - facing antiscience reality - denying brethren may huff and puff and say ridiculous things -- and I 'm sure you 'll continue to do so -- but a lot of people see right through it , and a majority of the American voting population rejected it last November .
But please , feel free to cling to such notions .
Those of us in the reality - based community will make sure we wave as we pass you , but do n't expect us to linger on your reflection in our rear - view mirrors .
We 're too busy looking ahead .
Given the nature of this post , please avail yourself to both my commenting policy and my stance on politics and religion posts before commenting below .
Thank you .
First days of invasion into Russia seemed to be a piece of cake for Nazi German army .
According to the plans of the German chief commanders the whole deal with Russia would take just a few months .
They were hoping to take over the Moscow until winter of 1941 ( the operation has started early summer , 1941 ) .
The invitations were sent to the higher officers of the German army for the celebration of the victory on Russian army in the summer , a few month before the planned victory .
And so there advancement into the Russian territory was really that easy for the first months .
They moved fast , often leaving some pockets of resistance inside the conquered Russian land .
Soon they got themselves right near two of Russian main cities – Moscow and St. Petersburg .
In Russia there is a popular belief , that Moscow should n’t be ever surrender to the enemy , because loosing Moscow can mean loosing of all the country .
So the battles were becoming more violent and fierce as the Nazis approached Moscow .
And then winter come , that was the well - known old Russian winter , with horrible frosts and lots of snow .
Before German army fought in the relatively warm climate of Western Europe and did n’t know what Russian Winter really is .
It got demoralized them very much and possibly the Russian Winter saved the Russian people from being defeated right in the first year of the war .
Then the war lasted for 5 years more , and no holiday took place for which German officers got invitations , and frankly speaking at the end of the war mostly no invitation recipients were left alive .
And those are photos of the first days of the invasion , made by German soldiers .
Ukraine has denied taking any of the gas meant for Europe for its own use Several European countries say their supplies of Russian gas have been cut or sharply reduced amid an energy price dispute between Moscow and Ukraine .
Serbia , which has had its supply completely cut , said it was a " critical " situation .
Countries as far west as Italy and Austria say they have received only 10 % of their expected supply .
Amid cold weather across the continent , the European Commission said the supply cut was " completely unacceptable " .
The EU depends on Russia for about a quarter of its total gas supplies , some 80 % of which is pumped through Ukraine .
Ukraine 's main energy company , Naftogaz , says talks with Russian counterpart Gazprom aimed at resolving the crisis are due to resume in Moscow on Thursday .
Naftogaz chairman Oleh Dubyna made the announcement , but it has not yet been confirmed by Gazprom .
Russia stopped supplying gas to Ukraine on New Year 's Day in a row about unpaid bills .
The row comes amid a cold snap across Europe likely to push up demand for gas .
EU GAS IMPORTS FROM RUSSIA
100 % dependent on Russia : Latvia , Slovakia , Finland , Estonia
More than 80 % dependent : Bulgaria , Lithuania , Czech Republic
More than 60 % dependent : Greece , Austria , Hungary Source : European Council on Foreign Relations , 2006 figures
Pressure rising as gas supplies fall Europe 's need for Russian gas Bulgaria revisits nuclear power Gazprom accuses Ukraine of an " unprecedented " shutdown of transit pipelines .
It says only 40 m cubic metres of gas is getting through to Europe , instead of 225 m cu m.
Serbia 's Srbijagas , which imports 92 % of its natural gas from Russia , said it had about 10 days ' of gas left , Reuters reported .
Slovakia says it will declare a state of emergency over the drop in gas supplies , though it aims to prevent the shortage hurting key public services and ordinary consumers .
The Austrian energy company OMV said it would now have to tap into its gas reserves after its supply fell to 10 % of the expected level .
Bulgaria , almost wholly dependent on Russian gas via Ukraine , says it has sufficient supplies for just a few days .
It says no more gas is flowing through a pipeline that also supplies Turkey , Macedonia and Greece .
Bulgarian President Georgi Purvanov said the situation was grounds for restarting a nuclear reactor , shut as part of Bulgaria 's accession to the EU in 2007 .
Gazprom decided to cut exports through Ukrainian pipelines by a fifth in a row over unpaid bills .
Wide impact Early on Tuesday , Ukraine 's Naftogaz said Russia had cut gas transit supplies by more than two - thirds and listed nine countries , including Germany , Poland , and Hungary which would receive reduced supplies as a result .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" Naftogaz of Ukraine considers that in such a case if European users receive less volumes of natural gas , all claims of the noted countries must be directed to Gazprom , " said a statement on the company 's website .
Russian gas supplies to Turkey via Ukraine have been completely cut , the Turkish government said .
The Turkish government announced it was increasing the flow through an alternative pipeline , under the Black Sea , to compensate .
Turkey gets about 65 % of its gas from Russia and about one - third of its daily supply has now been cut , the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports .
But the government says it has sufficient gas stocks to avoid immediate economic hardship .
Czech supplies also fell significantly overnight , and Croatia , which imports 40 % of its gas , said supply of Russian gas via Ukraine had completely halted .
EU deplores quarrel
In a statement on Tuesday , a European Commission spokesman said that " without prior warning and in clear contradiction with the reassurances given by the highest Russian and Ukrainian authorities to the European Union , gas supplies to some EU member states have been substantially cut - this situation is completely unacceptable " .
Europe 's gas pipeline network
Enlarge Map
" The Czech EU presidency and the European Commission demand that gas supplies be restored immediately to the EU and that the two parties resume negotiations at once with a view to a definitive settlement of their bilateral commercial dispute . "
The new EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe are heavily - and in some cases entirely - dependent on Russian gas imports .
Yet Germany and Italy together account for nearly half of the Russian gas consumed in the EU .
German Economy Minister Michael Glos called on Russia and Ukraine to resume talks , and is due to hold talks with senior Gazprom officials later on Tuesday .
But he said Germany could cope with any shortages .
" Gas storage sites are full .
And Germany gets its gas from different sources , for example from Norway or the Netherlands .
Supplies from there could be increased , " he said .
Many other countries are now tapping strategic reserves , built up to cope with just such a development , says the BBC's Europe correspondent Nick Thorpe .
Gazprom has promised to pump extra supplies through other pipelines - the Yamal from Arctic Russia through Belarus to Germany , and the Blue Stream to Turkey under the Black Sea .
' Gas stolen '
The move to reduce supplies going through the Ukraine by a fifth came after Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin held talks with Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller .
Mr Miller recommended that deliveries via Ukraine should be reduced " by the amount stolen by Ukraine , that is 65.3 million cubic metres of gas " .
Ukraine has denied stealing gas , saying technical problems are disrupting the onward flow of gas to Europe .
The row between Russia and Ukraine has been simmering for weeks .
Gazprom says Ukraine owes it more than $ 600 m ( £ 413 m ) ; Ukraine says it has paid its debt .
The two sides have also failed to agree on the price Ukraine should pay for gas in 2009 .
A similar row between Gazprom and Ukraine at the beginning of 2006 led to gas shortages in several EU countries .
EU officials have been meeting in Brussels to discuss the dispute and a delegation has also been sent for talks with both Ukrainian and Gazprom officials .
Gazprom wants Ukraine to pay $ 450 per 1,000 cu m of gas - more than double what Kiev says it is willing to pay , yet still less than what most EU states pay .

Lifehacker reader object started us down this road of videotaped hard drive destruction by sharing the following gem — a video from Hack a Day on using thermite as an anti-forensic tool .
What unholy magic is this thermite you ask ?
Turns out it 's not black magic but better living through chemistry :
The entire process is a basic reaction between finely powdered aluminum and iron oxide , with burning magnesium as a catalyst .
We here at Lifehacker are neither your legal team nor friendly local E.R. staff and would suggest you consult with both before unleashing a nearly unstoppable torrent of molten metal on anything .

Many a tank - like hard drive has shrugged off light handgun and rifle fire with neigh but a dent , the gentleman in the following video approaches the task properly with a shotgun .
The video unfortunately does n't show him retrieving the drive at the end but I can assure you from my own hard drive disposal efforts involving high - speed projectiles that the data is well beyond the reach of anyone outside an extremely specialized and well funded forensics lab .
Finally , a peek at what happens when your company ships off an entire truckload of drives to be disposed of .
Large scale data disposal companies use a variety of tools .
Industrial strength shredders are often used to render drives nothing more than pile of metal and plastic flakes .
As you 'll see in the video , the design of these industrial shredders is such that even a hard drive with an intense will to live can't cling to the side of the chute for long before meeting its fate .
If you have your own data disposal techniques to share — successes or failures are both equally interesting — sound off in the comments below .
Real - time strategy ( RTS ) games often feature a wide number unit types for the player to control .
One of my favourite titles from the past , Westwood ’s seminal Red Alert , had many classes of differently sized units : small infantry soldiers , medium - sized Jeeps and large tanks .
In Red Alert 3 , the most recent incarnation of the series , the diversity is increased even further by the introduction of units with terrain - specific movement capabilities ; for example , new amphibious units can move across both ground and water areas .
From a pathfinding perspective this introduces an interesting question : how can we efficiently search for valid routes for variable - sized agents in rich environments with many types of terrain ?
This was the topic of a recent paper which I presented at CIG ’08 .
In the talk I outlined Hierarchical Annotated A* ( HAA * ) , a path planner which is able to efficiently address this problem by first analysing the terrain of a game map and then building a much smaller approximate representation that captures the essential topographical features of the original .
In this article ( the first in a series of two ) I ’d like to talk about the terrain analysis aspects of HAA * in some detail and outline how one can automatically extract topological information from a map in order to solve the variable - sized multi-terrain pathfinding problem .
Next time , I ’ll explain how HAA * is able to use this information to build space - efficient abstractions which allow an agent to very quickly find a high quality path through a static environment .
Clearance Values and the Brushfire Algorithm
Simply put , a clearance value is a distance - to - obstacle metric which is concerned with the amount of traversable space at a discrete point in the environment .
Clearance values are useful because they allow us to quickly determine which areas of a map are traversable by an agent of some arbitrary size .
The idea of measuring distances to obstacles in pathfinding applications is not a new one .
The Brushfire algorithm for instance is particularly well known to robotics researchers ( though for different reasons than those motivating this article ) .
This simple method , which is applicable to grid worlds , proceeds as so :
First , to each traversable tile immediately adjacent to a static obstacle in the environment ( for example , a large rock or along the perimeter of a building ) assign a value of 1 .
Next , each traversable neighbour of an assigned tile is itself assigned a value of 2 ( unless a smaller value has already been assigned ) .
The process continues in this fashion until all tiles have been considered ; Figure 1 highlights this idea ; here white tiles are traversable and black tiles represent obstacles ( NB :
The original algorithm actually assigns tiles adjacent to obstacles a value of 2 ; I use 1 here because it makes more sense for our purposes ) .
Brushfire makes use of a minimum obstacle distance metric to compute clearances which works reasonably well in many situations .
If we assume our agents ( I use the term agent and unit interchangeably ) are surrounded by a square bounding box we can immediately use the computed values to identify traversable locations from non-traversable ones by comparing the size of an agent with the corresponding clearance of particular tile .
Figure 2 shows the search space for an agent of size 1×1 ; in this case , any tile with clearance equal to at least 1 is traversable .
Similarly , in Figure 3 the search space is shown for an agent of size 2×2 .
Notice that the bigger agent can occupy much fewer locations on the map ; only tiles with clearance values at least equal to 2 .
Because this approach is so simple it has seen widespread use , even in video games .
At GDC 2007 Chris Jurney ( from Relic Entertainment ) described a pathfinding system for dealing with variable - sized agents in Company of Heroes — which happens to make use of a variant of the Brushfire algorithm .
Unfortunately , clearances computed using minimum obstacle distance do not accurately represent the amount of traversable space at each tile .
Consider the example in Figure 4 ;
Here our 2×2 agent incorrectly fails to find a path because all tiles in the bottleneck region are assigned clearance values less than 2 .
To overcome this limitation we will focus on an alternative obstacle - distance metric : true clearance .
The True Clearance Metric
The process of measuring true clearance for a given map tile is very straightforward : Surround each tile with a clearance square ( bounding box really ) of size 1×1 .
If the tile is traversable , assign it an inital clearance of 1 .
Next , expand the square symmetrically down and to the right , incrementing the clearance value each time , until no further expansions are possible .
An expansion is successful only if all tiles within the square are traversable .
If the clearance square intersects with an obstacle or with the edge of the map the expansion fails and the algorithm selects another tile to process .
The algorithm terminates when all tiles on the map have been considered .
Figure 5 highlights the process and Figure 6 shows the result on our running example .
Notice that by using true clearance the example from Figure 4 now succeeds in finding a solution .
Infact , one can prove that using the true clearance metric it is always possible to find a solution for any agent size if a valid path exists to begin with ( i.e. the method is complete ; see my paper for the details ) .
Dealing With Multiple Terrain Types
Until now the discussion has been limited to a single type of traversable terrain ( white tiles ) .
As it turns out however , it is relatively easy to apply any clearance metric to maps involving arbitrarily many terrain types .
Given a map with n terrain types we begin by first identifying the set of possible terrain traversal capabilities an agent may possess .
A capability is simply a disjunction of terrains used to specify where each agent can traverse .
So , on a map with 2 terrains such as { Ground , Water} the corresponding list of all possible capabilities is given by a set of sets ; in this case { {Ground} , { Water} , { Ground , Water}} .
Note that , for simplicity , I assume the traveling speed across all terrains is constant ( but this constraint is easily lifted ) .
Next , we calculate and assign a clearance value to each tile for every capability .
Figures 7 - 9 show the corresponding clearance values for each capability on our toy map ; notice that we ’ve converted some of the black ( obstacle ) tiles to blue to represent the Water terrain type ( which some agents can traverse ) .
Theoretically this means that , at most , each tile will store 2 ^ ( n - 1 ) clearance value annotations ( again , see the paper for details ) .
I suspect this overhead can probably be improved with clever use of compression optimisations though I did not attempt more than a naive implementation .
Alternatively , if memory is very limited ( as is the case with many robot - related applications ) one can simply compute true clearance on demand for each tile , thus trading off a little processing speed for more space .
Annotated A *
In order to actually find a path for an agent with arbitrary size and capability we can use the venerable A* algorithm , albeit with some minor modifications .
First , we must pass two extra parameters to A * ’s search function : the agent ’s size and capability .
Next , we augment the search function slightly so that before a tile is added to A * ’s open list we first verify that it is infact traversable for the given size and capability ; everything else remains the same .
A tile is traversable only if its terrain type appears in the set of terrains that comprise the agent ’s capability and if the corresponding clearance value is at least equal to the size of the agent .
To illustrate these ideas I ’ve put together a simplified pseudocode implementation of the algorithm , Annotated A* :
Function : getPath Parameters : start , goal , size , capability push start onto open list .
for each node on the open list if current node is the goal , return path .
else , for each neighbour of the newly opened node if neighbour is on the closed list , skip it else , if neighbour is already on the open list , update weights else , if clearance ( neighbour , capability ) > size , push neighbour on the open list else , skip neighbour push current node on closed list if openlist is null , return failure
So , that ’s it !
If you ’re interested in playing with a working implementation of Annotated A * you can check out the source code I wrote to evaluate it .
The code itself is written in C++ and based on the University of Alberta ’s freely available pathfinding library , Hierarchical Open Graph ( or HOG ) .
HOG compiles on most platforms ; I ’ve personally tested it on both OSX and Linux and I ’m told it works on Windows too .
The classes of most interest are probably AnnotatedMapAbstraction , which deals with computing true clearance values for a map , and Annotated AStar which is the reference implementation of the search algorithm described here .
In the second part of this article I ’m going to expand on the ideas presented here and explain how one can build an efficient hierarchical representation of an annotated map that requires much less memory to store and retains the completeness characteristics of the original .
I ’ll talk about why this is important and how one can use such a graph to answer pathfinding queries much faster than Annotated A* .
At some point soon I also hope to discuss how one can use clearance - based pathfinding on continuous ( non- grid ) maps .
Hitchcock River had gotten so badly polluted that going for a dip in it would get you one of two things : superpowers or some kind of nasty flesh - eating bacterial infection .
And as awesome as it'd be to have X - Ray vision , it was just not worth the risk .
Decades ago , Ed B. was working for an underfunded state research team with an insanely - frugal mad scientist at the helm .
They were working together to study the sludge that flowed through Hitchcock River , and had a semi- friendly rivalry with a well - funded lab in a neighboring city ( " Shelbyville " ) .
Ed did n't mind the cheap boss or shoddy equipment , though , because the equipment they used had such cool names .
Honestly , one of the devices they used was called a " gas chromatograph mass selective detector . "
Awesome .
Measuring Flux Capacitance
The gas chromatograph mass selective detector ( or " gasachromamassaseladetecta " for short ) would separate the 90 - odd pollutants from a sample and send the quantities of each to a recording device via 300 - baud modem .
The data was recorded to a standard cassette tape , which Ed would run to the Texas Instruments Silent 700 tape deck ( with an accoustic coupler ) that would dial the Vax mainframe at a nearby college campus .
Then Ed would twiddle his thumbs for about an hour while it transmitted , waiting to edit the data .
Edits using the mainframe 's editor were tricky , and if the connection dropped during the edit process , he'd often have to retransmit all of the data and start over .
On a good night , they 'd process three samples .
When Ed got a chance to visit their rivals ' lab , he was floored at how much better their equipment was .
Everything was computerized , and entirely based on brand new " Apple " computers .
What a strange name for a computer , Ed recalls thinking .
He was in a state of disbelief when he learned that all of the lab 's computers could talk to one another ; the possibilities would be endless if he could get that in his lab !
He asked how he could get his PCs to do that .
" You can 't , " said Gary with a smirk .
" Only Apples can do that . "
And to add further insult , their lab had a few good looking female lab assistants !
Ed 's primary female contact on the job was the overseer of the Vax mainframe – a 67 year old grandmother with anger management issues , who would frequently throw fits , slamming a binder full of the source code on the monitor whenever she suspected someone of meddling with the system .
Ed clenched his fist and gritted his teeth , knowing in his heart that he had to beat those smug fancypants researchers with their adequate funding , their cool Apple computers , and their hot lab assistants .
He briefly considered chancing a dip in Hitchcock River to gain superpowers ( and therefore an unfair advantage ) , but decided instead to focus his energies on good old - fashioned manual process improvement .
Making Do
Ed 's lab had two semi-IBM PCs .
Specifically , they were Korean knockoffs that were less than half of the cost , equipped with 12 " amber screens and 3MHz of processing power .
And with these PCs and a whole lot of elbow grease , Ed figured out a way to bypass the tape desk , the accoustic coupler , and the mainframe .
He 'd plug the gas chromatograph mass selective detector 's output into a breakout box 's input , and the breakout box 's output to a PC 's serial port .
The breakout box had jumper wires that could connect any input pin to any output pin , which he whittled down to the correct configuration by trial and error .
Additionally , he and another researcher rebuilt the FORTRAN - based software from the Vax mainframe in a week and a half using GW Basic ( which the computer snobs called " Gee- Wiz Basic " ) on one of the lab 's PCs .
The PCs had a better text editor ( and he did n't have to worry about dropping connections while editing the data ) , so the process had improved considerably .
Now they could run an incredible 20 samples in a single day , edit the data , and print the results .
Still , Ed was n't completely satisfied .
He could n't stand the fact that the Apple computers were able to connect and share resources with one another , while his lab 's aging computers were oblivious to eachothers ' existences .
Ed racked his brain , did whatever research he could , and was ready to experiment with some hardware .
His solution involved a stack of auto switching printer boxes , a ... * ahem * borrowed copy of software called LapLink , loads of cables , and a few paper clips .
No , the paper clips are n't a setup for a hilarious MacGyver joke , they were used to suspend the cables from the ceiling as state regulations prevented them from running cabling through the ceiling .
The PCs ( including a few old 8088s that he'd gotten from other employees as they upgraded to 286s ) and lab equipment communicated via serial ports , so Ed 's solution required him to yank the end of a parallel cable off and connect the wires to serial pin outs .
The printer boxes of course had no idea they were connected to other computers and not printers , but who cares ?
The system worked , and it may have been one of ( if not the ) first PC networks .
Now users could work at their terminals and send their updates to the main PC , dubbed the " Central Laboratory Information Terminal . "
Some of the newer female lab assistants never seemed to understand the snickering among their male colleagues whenever the terminal was discussed .
Not that Ed would complain that there was finally some extra help in the lab .
With some other process tweaks , custom - built utilities , and ( finally ) the arrival of an on - site mainframe , they were able to increase their sample output by over 1000 % – to the point that they could process samples faster than they could be collected .
Fame and Fort- , Er , Just Fame
Ed 's lab had become famous , at least among other labs in the area .
Scientists from other labs would visit to have a laugh at the messy little lab with cables hanging from the ceilings , their ancient instruments and PCs , and the fleet of nice - looking young women that did the sample prep work .
Eventually Gary came out from Shelbyville to check the lab out .
Initially , he was giving a smirk that screamed " how quaint , " but after seeing the ingenuity behind it all , he had to admit that he was impressed .
With substantially less funding , old equipment , and inferior computers , Ed and his team built solutions to get more work done faster than Gary's .
Not one to directly admit he was wrong , however , Gary ( quietly ) asked for advice on report generation , macro programming , not to mention a few unsuccessful attempts at luring away some of their ( more attractive ) crew members .

One of the ( correct ) complaints about the proposed stimulus plan is that it 's full of all kinds of programs that would appear to have nothing to do with any accepted economic theory about what sorts of spending could even possibly lead to recovery .
The best example of this is the funds for family planning policy that are [ UPDATE : now " were " , but there are plenty of other examples ] in the bill .
Of course to those who understand public choice , none of this is a surprise .
One good argument against a stimulus package is that any package will necessarily have more pork in it than the Dinosaur BBQ .
That all said , I think there 's something else at work here .
This is n't just your run -of - the - mill pork .
What we are seeing happen right now is that Congress sees this crisis as an opportunity to enact a whole variety of programs that they 've wanted to pass for years , especially ( but not only ) the Democrats who no longer fear a veto , and now finally have the chance .
Just as the Patriot Act was a bunch of laws waiting for a political " crisis , " so is much of the stimulus package a bunch of programs waiting for an economic " crisis . "
The current crisis is just a convenient excuse .
But that 's not all .
Lest we get overwhelmed with nostalgia , we should remember that the exact same thing was true of much of the New Deal .
Numerous commentators , from Hughes and Cain's American economic history textbook to authors like Amity Shlaes , have pointed out that a great deal of what FDR did in his first two terms were ideas that had been bouncing around the American left for years , and the Great Depression became the chance to put them into practice .
New Deal spending was n't primarily about economic recovery , it was about transforming the American economy .
Tom Friedman 's NYT column from last week captures this spirit with respect to the current situation .
What is on the table in Washington today simply has nothing to do with any serious economic thinking , as Pete 's post below suggests .
This is why people like Krugman and DeLong have to accuse their opponents of acting in bad faith : there is precious little economic evidence for the benefits of large fiscal policy initiatives .
What these are really about is enacting programs and policies that people like them have wanted for years on their own supposed merits , independent of any " stimulus . "
The crisis is just the reason to carpe diem .
So rather than a debate over the merits of particular programs , we get the language of crisis and fear thrown at us so that we 'll swallow them all , whole hog , with little debate .
Accusing your opponents of being " ethics - free Republican hacks " and refusing to examine the actual evidence of the Hoover and FDR years means you do n't have to argue for the merits of the individual pieces , just scare the public and demonize the opposition .
Of course , that 's exactly what these same folks complained about after 9/11 .
Meet the new boss , same as the old boss indeed .
( And the evidence against The Shock Doctrine is now approaching that of The Population Bomb . )
Bottom line : the more that those of us who are skeptical continue to even refer to this as a " stimulus " plan , the more we play into the other side 's hands .
This is n't a stimulus package , it 's a whole bunch of programs designed to extend the state 's role in the economy and in our personal lives , and to do so at enormous cost to us , and to our children and grandchildren .
Let 's challenge the rhetoric of fear and crisis and name this for what it is : the current majority 's attempt to do exactly what the Bush Administration did post - 9/11 , which is to use fear and crisis to pass programs that will impoverish us and curtail our freedoms , and to do so with the minimum of serious debate possible .
ZDF said Aribert Heim died of cancer
The Simon Wiesenthal Centre has expressed doubts about a report that Aribert Heim , one of the most - wanted Nazi criminals , died in Egypt in 1992 .
" There 's no body , no corpse , no DNA , no grave , " Efraim Zuroff , the centre 's leading Nazi hunter , told AP agency .
On Wednesday , Germany 's ZDF TV reported that Heim died in Cairo , saying it had found his passport and other documents .
Heim is accused of killing hundreds of inmates at a concentration camp where he was a doctor during World War II .
' Too perfect '
On Thursday , Mr Zuroff said the report about Heim 's death raised " more questions than it answers " .

" We can't sign off on a story like this because of some semi- plausible explanation , " he said .
" Keep in mind these people have a vested interest in being declared dead - it's a perfectly crafted story ; that 's the problem , it 's too perfect , " Mr Zuroff told the AP .
In its report , ZDF quoted witnesses , including Heim 's son , as confirming that Aribert Heim , who was also known as Doctor Death , died in 1992 .
It said it had found a number of Heim 's personal documents , including his passport and personal letters , in a hotel room in Cairo where he lived under a pseudonym .
The TV channel , working with the New York Times newspaper , also said Heim had converted to Islam .
Experiments
Heim was one of the last major Nazi fugitives believed to be still at large .
He is accused of carrying out medical experiments on prisoners of the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria during World War II .
After the war he lived in West Germany , working as a doctor .
He disappeared in 1962 when police opened an investigation into his past .

Is this paragraph making any sense ?
It would if you understood the German , Cantonese , American , and Italian versions of the human body .
Since the 1970s , the rapid growth of cognitive science has led to clashes about the relation between language and the physical reality it supposedly represents .
Maintaining that the body and mind are inseparable , cognitive psychologists and linguists regard language as a product of the brain , a communications system reflecting bodily experiences .
Because languages come from bodies , they rely on metaphors rooted in physiological perceptions .
But if this is the case , ask first - year language learners , then why do different languages represent the body so differently ?
Despite the successes of cognitive science , the opposite viewpoint has maintained its appeal : bodies do n't create languages ; languages create bodies .
Whereas cognitive psychologists argue that languages reveal their bodily origins , linguistic relativists claim that languages and cultures teach people how to experience their bodies , and that there is no universally comprehensible human body unmediated by words .
George Bernard Shaw 's character Henry Higgins expresses one version of this idea when he reflects , “ You have no idea how frightfully interesting it is to take a human being and change her into a quite different human being by creating a new speech for her ” .
By altering language , Higgins hopes that he can shape thoughts — not so much Eliza Doolittle 's , as the thoughts of those hearing her speak .
For clinical medicine , the stakes of this debate could not be higher .
If languages create bodies , and people from different cultures experience illnesses differently , then they may need different treatments .
In weighing the arguments , it is helpful to consider some expressions involving body parts — expressions whose meaning is less than obvious to those who do not speak the languages .
From country to country , medical language retains a comforting uniformity , but outside the clinic , the body seems to change .
Among the most influential thinkers arguing that bodily experience shapes language have been the linguist George Lakoff and the philosopher Mark Johnson .
In Metaphors We Live By , they propose that expressions describing one concept in terms of another reveal essential aspects of the ways people think .
In English , for example , many sayings associate life and health with “ up ” and death and sickness with “ down ” , probably because a healthy person stands upright whereas a sick one has to lie down .
Lakoff and Johnson qualify , however , that , “ it is hard to distinguish the physical from the cultural basis of a metaphor …
We experience our ‘ world ’ in such a way that our culture is already present in the very experience itself ” .
In their more recent book , Philosophy in the Flesh , they assert that , “ Our conceptual systems draw largely upon the commonalities of our bodies and of the environments we live in …
One of the important discoveries of cognitive science is that the conceptual systems used in the world 's languages make use of a relatively small number of basic image schemas ” .
Although Lakoff and Johnson acknowledge that culture influences people 's understandings of their experiences , they believe that the common elements in linguistic expressions reveal their grounding in bodily perceptions .
The cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker is much harder on the hypothesis that words shape thought .
In The Language Instinct , he asks why , until recently , physical development has been viewed as genetically determined but cognitive development as culturally determined , a fact that he believes has hindered investigations of thought .
“ Language is not a cultural artifact that we learn the way we learn to tell time ” , he asserts .
“ Instead , it is a distinct piece of the biological makeup of our brains … Language is no more a cultural invention than is upright posture ” .
Citing recent studies of visual and spatial perception , he points out the common responses of people who speak different languages , proposing that people think in a “ mentalese ” that they have learned to translate into the languages with which they 've been raised .
“ People do not think in English or Chinese or Apache ” , he concludes .
“ They think in a language of thought .
This language of thought probably looks a bit like all these languages . ”
In support of Pinker 's claim , some metaphors associating body parts with abstract concepts recur in vastly different languages .
Even when bodily expressions are translated literally , their meaning can often be guessed .
In English , German , and Cantonese , you can have “ eyes bigger than your stomach ” .
No knowledge of the sympathetic nervous system is necessary to understand why a traumatic experience might be described as “ gut - wrenching ” , and no one would take a despairing mother 's cry , “ My children are eating the hair off my head ! ” as a hint that she wants to go to the beauty parlour .
It is less obvious , though , why English - speakers should “ hate someone 's guts ” .
Why not his heart or — more in tune with the findings of cognitive science — his brain ?
One can feel sympathy for the parent with no hair left on her head , but what should one feel for a person with hair on her teeth ?
The fact that so many expressions about the body are bizarre , even incomprehensible , to non-native speakers suggests that people from different cultures understand and perhaps even perceive their bodies differently .
Pinker is right that differences in language do not prove that people experience their bodies in distinct ways .
The astonishing variety of these expressions raises the question , though , of how well any language can convey sensations and perceptions , a question that scholars in medicine , science , and the humanities can best address together .
The idea that the languages we speak determine the ways that we see the world emerged during the 1930s in the studies of the linguists Benjamin Lee Whorf and Edward Sapir .
Whorf , a fire inspection engineer who taught himself Native American languages , proposed that , “ The forms of a person 's thoughts are controlled by inexorable laws of pattern of which he is unconscious .
These patterns are the unperceived intricate systematizations of his own language …
We all , unknowingly , project the linguistic relationships of a particular language upon the universe , and see them there ” .
Whorf 's idea provides one explanation of why an American who charges US $ 5 for a tiny bottle of mineral water has “ nerve ” ; a German , “ forehead ” ; and a Spaniard , “ hard face ” .
In each case , the association of the attitude with the body part makes sense once one has heard the expression .
Without some explanation , however , the meaning is unclear .
Sayings that tie feelings to body parts have cultural histories .
Besides criticising your attitude , an Austrian who asks , “ what louse crawled over your liver today ? ” is resurrecting Galenic medicine , in which an excess of bile is putting you in a lousy mood .
Once one becomes familiar with a language and the culture that created it , its associations of body parts with concepts and feelings seem quite natural .
Of course liver problems cause irritability — but what is the German trying to tell you who says that something is getting him in the kidneys ?
Or the woman from Hong Kong who says that in the corner of your mouth , you seem to be savouring a feeling of spring ?
Should you ask for herpes medication ?
Or is she trying to tell you you 're in love ?
The amazing and often hilarious expressions that human beings have created around their body parts suggest that language and culture influence , but do not determine , the ways that we live with our bodies .
The fact that clinicians in Dallas can communicate and collaborate with those in Singapore indicates that we probably do have some common “ mentalese ” representation of the way a human body works .
But this has not stopped cultural prejudices from shaping the ways that we perceive , experience , and maintain our bodies : for instance , the puzzling association of bravery with large male genitalia .
Considering the relative roles of the male and female parts in human reproduction , why does no one in the western hemisphere say about a courageous man , “ Boy , he 's got big ovaries ! ” ?
By sharing their knowledge , clinicians who know bodies and scholars who know languages just as intimately can help to create a medicine that works with these strange associations .
If we ignore them , we 'll be practising medicine with tomatoes on our eyes .
I would like to thank my colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science , Berlin , Germany , for providing the expressions discussed in this article .

By the time 2002 rolled around , it did n't matter -- the song was an Asian - mocking masturbation joke complete with a Japanese protest song called " Turning Hakujin " ( Japanese for white person ) .
Plus , even without the racism , the lyrics are incredibly creepy .
" I want a doctor to take your picture so I can look at you from inside " ?
What the fuck ?
Seems a little edgy for a soccer tournament , right ?
Although if that qualifies as a good match , we 've got the perfect song for the next Jergens campaign .

George Costanza 's Tips for Working
Never walk down the hall without a document in your hands .
People with documents in their hands look like hardworking employees heading for important meetings .
People with nothing in their hands look like they 're heading for the cafeteria .
People with a newspaper in their hand look like they 're heading for the toilet .
Above all , make sure you carry loads of stuff home with you at night , thus generating the false impression that you work longer hours than you do .
Use computers to look busy .
Any time you use a computer , it looks like " work " to the casual observer .
You can send and receive personal e-mail , calculate your finances and generally have a blast without doing anything remotely related to work .
These are n't exactly the societal benefits that the proponents of the computer revolution would like to talk about , but they 're not bad either .
When you get caught by your boss - and you will get caught - your best defense is to claim you 're teaching yourself to use new software , thus saving valuable training dollars .
Messy desk .
Top management can get away with a clean desk .
For the rest of us , it looks like you 're not working hard enough .
Build huge piles of documents around your workspace .
To the observer , last year 's work looks the same as today 's work ; it 's volume that counts .
Pile them high and wide .
If you know somebody is coming to your cubicle , bury the document you 'll need halfway down in an existing stack and rummage for it when he / she arrives .
Voice Mail .
Never answer your phone if you have voice mail .
People do n't call you just because they want to give you something for nothing - they call because they want YOU to do work for THEM .
That 's no way to live .
Screen all your calls through voice mail .
If somebody leaves a voice mail message for you and it sounds like impending work , respond during lunch hour when you know they 're not there - it looks like you 're hardworking and conscientious even though you 're being a devious weasel .
If you diligently employ the method of screening incoming calls and then returning calls when nobody is there , this will greatly increase the odds that the caller will give up or look for a solution that does n't involve you .
The sweetest voice mail message you can ever hear is : " Ignore my last message .
I took care of it " .
If your voice mailbox has a limit on the number of messages it can hold , make sure you reach that limit frequently .
One way to do that is to never erase any incoming messages .
If that takes too long , send yourself a few messages .
Your callers will hear a recorded message that says , " Sorry , this mailbox is full " - a sure sign that you are a hardworking employee in high demand .
Looking Impatient and Annoyed .
According to George Costanza , one should also always try to look impatient and annoyed to give your bosses the impression that you are always busy .
Appear to Work Late .
Always leave the office late , especially when the boss is still around .
You could read magazines and storybooks that you always wanted to read but have no time until late before leaving .
Make sure you walk past the boss ' room on your way out .
Send important emails at unearthly hours ( e.g. 9:35 pm , 7:05 am , etc ... ) and during public holidays .
Creative Sighing for Effect .
Sigh loudly when there are many people around , giving the impression that you are very hard pressed .
Stacking Strategy .
It is not enough to pile lots of documents on the table .
Put lots of books on the floor etc. . . .
You can always borrow from the library .
Thick computer manuals are the best .
Build Vocabulary .
Read up on some computer magazines and pick out all the jargon and new products .
Use it freely when in conversation with bosses .
Remember :
They do n't have to understand what you say , but you sure sound impressive .
MOST IMPORTANTLY : DON'T forward this to your boss by mistake !!!
The red band trailer for Observe and Report .
At the Forest Ridge Mall , head of security Ronnie Barnhardt ( Seth Rogen ) patrols his jurisdiction with an iron fist .
The master of his domain , he combats skateboarders , shoplifters and the occasional unruly customer while dreaming of the day when he can swap his flashlight for a badge and a gun .
Ronnie 's delusions of grandeur are put to the test when the mall is struck by a flasher .
Driven by his personal duty to protect and serve the mall and its patrons , Ronnie seizes the opportunity to showcase his underappreciated law enforcement talents on a grand scale , hoping his solution of this crime will earn him a coveted spot at the police academy and the heart of his elusive dream girl Brandi ( Anna Faris ) , the hot make - up counter clerk who wo n't give him the time of day .
But his single - minded pursuit of glory launches a turf war with the equally competitive Detective Harrison ( Ray Liotta ) of the Conway Police , and Ronnie is confronted with the challenge of not only catching the flasher , but getting him before the real cops .

Maximizing BitTorrent Speeds with uTorrent ( Guide / Tutorial )
Version 1.18 ( Updated July 2014 )
This article explains how to get up and running with utorrent Bit Torrent efficiently .
It shows how to battle ISP 's throttling bittorrent speed , optimize download speed and other ways to speed up utorrent and increase utorrent download speed .

However , if you must copy , please LINK to the original guide somewhere so that people can view the latest version .
Introduction
This is a tutorial step by step guide on how to speed up uTorrent 's configuration , a popular BitTorrent software .
What 's BitTorrent ?
Well , let 's put it this way -
What are the options when you want to send a 4.3GB DVD folder to your family , relatives and friends ?
Rapidshare ?
Mega ?
Or < gulp >...
Skype ?
Free media file hosts have some limits either in the maximum data you can download per day , or the constant nagging to buy their premium service .
And Skype is not designed for sending such large files - just imagine if the file stalled at the 97 % mark - You will need to resend the entire file !
MSN's Shared Folders had some promise but it was later replaced by OneDrive , which limits each file to 2GB , although it gives 15 GB of space .
So what other alternative is there ?
There 's FTP .
Or you can take a risk and send it via Skype .
Or you can split the file in segments and upload it to a OneDrive , RapidShare , Mega or other file hosting server .
If you have a web hosting server , you can upload it to there .
But chances are your web host will not be too happy about it as their terms of service do not allow you to share resource intensive files .
Enter Bittorrent - a very efficient peer - to - peer ( P2P ) file sharing protocol to share your files with anyone , anywhere .
You can share files privately within only people you choose , or publicly with anyone on the Internet .
The only requirement is a internet connection .
With uTorrent , BitTorrent has never got easier .
This guide gets you up to maximum speed with BitTorrent using uTorrent and is great for beginners .
It details all the steps from downloading to optimizing your utorrent and Windows settings .
Many people have used and think they are running with optimized settings , even then , it is advised to read through this guide and see what you may have missed to get the best configuration settings .

Starting off with Bittorrent
Our top recommended BitTorrent client software , in order of preference is as follows µ Torrent ( http://www.uTorrent.com/ ) ( the number one choice ) Azureus aka Vuze ( http://www.vuze.com/ ) ( java based - slow - but very popular too )
This guide will focus on the top most client , uTorrent .
A quick rundown of its major features and we 're talking SPEED here Peer Exchange
Obtains more peers for your downloading torrent in addition to trackers .
Peer exchange
Protocol Encryption , Half - Open Connections and uTP UDP Packet Protocol
This is the major speed booster if your Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) throttles BitTorrent traffic , allowing bypassing of ISP throttling .
It can do wonders on torrents with high seeds and can give high speeds especially if your peers are using the top 3 clients mentioned above , as those are the popular ones that support this standard .
A list of commonly known ISPs who throttle BitTorrent can be found here .
You can even do an online test to verify if your ISP throttles BitTorrent connections .
Capping Upload Speed
Uploading data to other peers at full throttle will severely limit your download rate .
This is one key element we have to adjust for a good download / upload ratio .
Unless you are purely seeding and not using your computer for other tasks , limit your upload to 80 % of full bandwidth .
Distributed Hash Table ( DHT )
Similar to Peer Exchange , it also obtains more peers for you to download from .
If the tracker is down , and the torrent is not private , you can depend on DHT to continue downloading !
Local Peer Discovery
Searches for peers with the same Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) as you .
Connecting to a peer in the same network ( or ISP ) means you can get the maximum accelerated speed from that peer , assuming he is generous with his uploads .
What We Need
An Internet Connection and its maximum download and upload speed .
If you are not sure of your download / upload speeds , visit http://www.speedtest.net/ to run a speed test .
Select a download location closest to you , especially if you are outside the US .
The Recommended Server ( golden pyramid ) works out most of the time .
Partial SpeedTest.net Screen Shot : Clicking the " Begin Test " works out most of the time
Once the test is done , you get the results :
Results of the speed test
Note down the numbers under Download ( a ) and Upload ( b ) including the unit ; in this case , Mbps .
You will need them later .
Patched TCPIP.sys to allow more concurrent half - open connections .
Windows XP SP2 and Vista limits the number of half - open connections to 10 .
Windows 7 users :
This patcher is NOT required for Windows 7 as there is no such limitation in Windows 7 .
NOTE : This step has been generally found not to make any improvements in Bittorrent speed .
In fact , it can even cause problems with certain routers such as auto - restarting and stalling of internet access .
Do this only as a last resort .
To increase the limit , there are two freely available patchers :
Lvllord Patch - ONLY for Windows XP Users ( NOT Vista / Windows 7 users , see next step for Vista users )
UPDATE : There has been a recent Automatic Update ( MS08-001 ) released on January 8 2008 that addresses some network security concerns .
The below has NOT been tested with the latest TCPIP.
SYS ( v5.0.2195.7147 ) file .
Update : The patch has been tested with KB941644 ( an automatic update ) and works perfectly !
Go to this site - http://www.lvllord.de/
Click on Downloads .
Right - click the " EventID 4226 Patcher Version 2.23d ( englisch ) " link and click " Save Target As " or " Save Link As " .
Save it in your Desktop .
Open the file and run the program located inside the archive , agreeing to the security warning .
Some text should scroll by in a MS - DOS window , after it ends , type C. Enter 100 for the number of concurrent half - open connections and press Enter .
Type Y and the file should be patched .
Cancel any Windows XP warnings that should appear , it is part of Microsoft 's way of ensuring its files are not tampered with ( the utility tampers with them on purpose to change the limit ) .
Half - Open Patch - For Windows VISTA / Windows XP ( NOT required for Windows 7 )
This patcher works for both 32 and 64 bit Vista and XP versions .
Go to this site - http://half-open.com/download_en.htm.
Download the EXE file in the link titled Half - open limit fix 4.2 ( as of July 2014 )
Open the folder where you saved the file and run the file you downloaded Under ' New value ' , set it to 100 ( if it is not already set )
Set the new value to 100 Click ' Add to tcpip.sys ' Click OK .
Click OK again .
Cancel any Windows warnings that may appear , it is part of Microsoft 's way of ensuring its files are not tampered with ( the utility tampers with them on purpose to change the limit ) .
Restart your computer .
If something is not working right ( e.g. Internet access does not work anymore ) and you want to undo the changes , run the software again and click " Restore original file " .
NOTE : The patchers above are known to trigger anti-virus alerts .
Ignore them .
The alerts are triggered due to the patcher making changes to the way Windows works hence making the anti-virus software suspicious .
A BitTorrent software client - We recommend uTorrent .
This guide uses uTorrent for the tutorial .
And finally , some torrents to kick off a download .
A sample torrent file will be provided later .
Download
As of July 2014 , the latest Windows version is 3.4.2 .
For MAC users , some of these tips do not apply to you .
Please see the FAQ below .
Getting to the file : Click on this download page - http://www.utorrent.com/downloads/win
Click the big green image ( NOT the orange button ) that says " Download Now " .
A dialog box should pop out .
Choose to RUN it .
If any security dialogs appear , click Run as we know this is a safe file .
Configuring uTorrent
The configuration part is where most people mess up .
Most of us will just click through the dialogs accepting the default values .
This may apply to some of us , but not the majority .
The below installation guide uses uTorrent Version 3.4.2 .
Older versions may have some steps missing .
Run the program .
Ignore the security warning if any appears ( Click Run ) - we know perfectly well that the file is legitimate .
User Account Control ( UAC ) may pop up to ask whether to allow uTorrent ( " Program Name " ) to make changes to your computer .
If so , click " Yes " .
You get the welcome screen when it runs :
Welcome screen ( note : version number may be different if you have a newer / older version )
Click Next .
A scam warning will appear as many people have been tricked into paying for utorrent which is supposed to be free in the first place .
Anyway , click Next .
New to utorrent version 1.8.3 onwards - a license agreement !
This used to be as a link in the Install location .
License Agreement
Read all the legal mambo jambo ( yea right ! ) .
Click I Agree to continue .
It will give the following dialog :
Choose Install Location
You want the program to be easily accessible , do n't you ?
Click Next > with the default options and uTorrent shortcut s will be created in your desktop , quick launch and start menu , as well as installing it to a permanent location .
uTorrent Setup asks your permission to start automatically .
Prior to version 2.0 , it will ask for permission to associate with torrent files too .
Configuration
All are fine except perhaps for the last one - ' Start utorrent when Windows starts up ' .
This used to be optional but with version 1.8.3 onwards , utorrent is set by default to start along when Windows starts .
This may irk some users , especially if you pay for Internet Access by the megabyte .
How ?
If you close uTorrent after you are done with it without deleting the torrent and restart your computer , utorrent starts in the background and continues seeding the torrents .
Bottom line ?
Uncheck the last box unless you want uTorrent to be always running and ' seed ' your torrents .
The latest releases of uTorrent may now come with some free download .
We got The Internet 's Own Boy documentary " free " download in our trial run as below .
FREE , or is it really ?
This is NOT required , 100 % optional and will NOT affect your download / upload speeds .
Then why is uTorrent including this ?
Because it gets paid for every installation and is a means of revenue for the company .
Make your choice ( tick or untick the box ) and click Next >
The latest releases of uTorrent now come bundled with Spigot 's Search Protection ( ( previously was uTorrent Browser Bar or Ask. Com Toolbar ) or some other adware
Spigot 's Search Protection
Once again , this is NOT required , 100 % optional and will NOT affect your download / upload speeds .
Then why is uTorrent including this ?
Because it gets paid for every installation and is a means of revenue for the company .
So it is entirely up to you whether you want it .
If you find that you do n't like it later on , you can remove the software from Add / Remove programs later on without affecting uTorrent .
Click the desired button .
Yet another bundled " free " software .
The latest releases of uTorrent now come bundled with PC Speed Up software
PC Speed Up
Once again , this is NOT required , 100 % optional and will NOT affect your download / upload speeds .
Then why is uTorrent including this ?
Because it gets paid for every installation and is a means of revenue for the company .
So it is entirely up to you whether you want it .
If you find that you do n't like it later on , you can remove the software from Add / Remove programs later on without affecting uTorrent .
Click the desired choice and then click Finish .
This step only applies for versions older than utorrent v1.8.2 .
It ensures that utorrent is set to handle all torrent files automatically .
Making uTorrent the default application for torrent files
Click Yes .
On current versions of uTorrent , this is done automatically .
You now see the full interface of the uTorrent window .
If you had opted for the free downloads and softwares , it may take some time and the full interface with the torrent torrent will also start downloading as shown below .
The full interface with the free torrent starting Go to Options > Setup Guide .
uTorrent Speed Guide ( v2 redesign )
Uncheck ' Bandwidth ' since you already know your Internet connection speed limits from the Speedtest . net tests above .
We do not recommend using uTorrent 's bandwidth tests as the servers are not as globalized as Speedtest .
net .
Now the value that we are interested in right now is the dropdown labelled ' Your Upload Speed ' , which is using the unit of kbit /s ( kilobits per second ) .
If you have trouble understanding your speed , consider this : Internet Explorer shows download speed as KBps when you download a file .
There is a big difference between 5 Kbps ( kilobits ) and 5 KBps ( kilobytes ) .
Make sure you got the right values in kbps ( not kBps , the cAsE of ' b ' matters ) .
Use Google Calculator if you need help with conversions . .
Click the ' Current Settings - ( Unlimited ) ' dropdown box
Preset Speed Settings on clicking Current Settings
The authors of uTorrent have been very helpful in providing a list of predefined values .
Your connection should be near to one of the above categories .
Each value ( e.g. " 28.8 kbit/s ( Dial - up ) " ) means that your download is unlimited and your upload is limited to the number indicated there ( e.g. 28.8 kbps , which is 3.6 KBps by Google Calculator ) .
With your results of the speed test you did above , select the closest upload speed from the list .
Select a value lower than your upload speed .
For example , if your upload is 31.6 kbit/s , you would select 28.8 kbit/s .
Once you select a value , uTorrent instantly adjusts the " uTorrent Bandwidth Configuration " area with recommended values for your upload speed .
1 Mbit ( 1 megabit ) is equivalent to 1024 kbit ( 1024 kilobits ) by Google Calculator .
We 're not finished yet .
Note :
The default download speed in utorrent is Unlimited .
Even if your download is limited in some way , it is always better to leave it at unlimited to get maximum download speeds .
However , if you need to limit your download speeds , right - click the utorrent icon on the system tray ( bottom right ) , click Download Limit and set accordingly .
You can also set this in the Preferences dialog .
Note : uTorrent randomly generates a port number in Current Port .
This guide assumes the port number to be 55641 - but you can substitute it with the number uTorrent shows .
Click Run Tests .
Port forwarding is important .
After you click on " Run Tests " , uTorrent will advise you of possible issues that could impact your download speed .
If you have trouble running the test ( e.g. receive results similar to " Results : Port is not open ( you are still able to download ) " or " Neither NAT - PMP nor UPnP is enabled .
Please check your preferences . " , it could be due to one or more of the following reasons :
Home Router
If you are running a router ( sometimes called wireless access point ) at home , you will have to configure it to route all TCP / UDP BitTorrent traffic to port 55641 to your computer .
If so , visit this page for a guide on how to port forward .
Note , you do not need to download any software from them .
Click the router you are using , then the model number in the next page and then the uTorrent application and follow instructions .
When following the guide and the router asks for a range of ports to forward , simply specify 55641 to 55641 ( remember to substitute it with the actual port number you are using ) .
Take care not to download any software from the site as it is not required Personal Firewall
If you are running a firewall software such as Norton Internet Security , Norton 360 , Kaspersky , Outpost Firewall , ZoneAlarm , etc , then configure your firewall such that uTorrent has access to port 55641 .
This is normally accomplished by starting up utorrent .
The firewall should spring up an access alert .
Simply select the option to " Always Allow " to allow the program to access the Internet .
Messages such as " utorrent wants to act as a server " or " utorrent is attempting to listen for connections " must be allowed as well .
In fact , if the program in question is utorrent , you should always check " Allow " no matter what request it is .
Windows Firewall Users
uTorrent will automatically configure Windows Firewall for you so there is no action needed from you .
Corporate Firewall
Are you running this software in a corporate network ?
Bad news - you have to inform the admin that you want the port to be forwarded to your computer .
The good news - you can still go by without port forwarding , but speeds will not be optimal .
Utorrent .
Com Port Forward Function Website has a problem
Yes , especially if you are accessing the Internet through a transparent proxy that your ISP forces you to use .
This simply means that the website is checking for open ports at the wrong computer .
To verify if this is the case , uTorrent port checker runs an alternative port checker at port 16000 , which you can access by using the form below :
uTorrent Port Checker
Enter the port number in this box : and click .
Sometimes the utorrent port checker server may be down - you may get ' page cannot be displayed ' or a blank page ' unable to connect ' if this is so .
If this is the case , the only way to check is to run the actual torrent .
Having done all the above , if the website still says that it has problems accessing the port , the ultimate test will be when we do a test torrent download .
For now , click on Save & Close .
If the button is disabled , reselect the upload speed value and the button should enable again .
Starting a simple torrent
We need to start a simple download , and the one that will be using is a 650 MB file of Ubuntu !
It is a perfectly legal and free file to download so that we would n't get into trouble with Dreamhost , Bootstrike 's web hosting company .
We will be downloading this file purely for testing and delete it later on ( as it is of no use to us ) Minimize uTorrent for now .
Notice that it resides on the system tray ( bottom right ) automatically .
Click to http://torrent.ubuntu.com:6969/.
Look at the column labeled " complete " .
Find the row with the largest value .
A quick way is to scroll down and scan for a 3 digit figure in that column .
Or perform a search for the string ' desktop-i386.iso ' and look for a filename that starts with " ubuntu - " and ends with " desktop-i386.iso " .
Now download the torrent - click the link in the 2nd column of that row You should get this dialog :
The IE8 " Save As " Box for torrent files
This is the metadata file , it contains information on the file you want to download eventually .
That is why the file size is so small .
We want uTorrent to automatically start downloading it , so click Open .
NOTE : The " Name and Type " may differ on your system .
This is normal , as Ubuntu is frequently updated
NOTE : If the Open button does not appear , save the file in your desktop .
Then start utorrent , File >
Open torrent and open the torrent you saved .
Delete the torrent file in the desktop as uTorrent automatically makes a copy of it .
If you get the below warning , simply click Allow
A website wants to open web content using this program on your computer
The file opens with uTorrent which automatically pops up this dialog
Add New Torrent dialog box
All values are automatically filled in for you .
Under Save
In , select where you want to download the files to by clicking " ... " .
Optionally , under Torrent Contents , select files that you do n't want to download - if the download has many files which in this case does not .
All looking good , click OK .
Progress of the Download
Click on the Ubuntu torrent ( the only item in the list ) to view more information on it and click on the Info tab below .
You will see all the values at the bottom suddenly burst with activity !
u Torrent with one torrent downloading ( plus another torrent for the free content )
Looks like the torrent has a total of 59 seeds and 615 downloaders ( also known as leechers ) .
59 seeds is a lot ( but some torrents can have 10000 + seeds , depending on popularity ) .
The higher the number of seeds vs the number of leechers , the faster you can expect your download !
A seed is a term used to refer to peers whose computers are only sharing the complete file with no downloading activity .
However , after running for 5 minutes , the speed refuses to go above 20 KB/s , which is not possible for a highly seeded torrent .
Could it be our ISP throttling ?
Enabling Protocol Encryption , uTP ( UDP Packets ) and Increasing Speed Via Max Half Open Connections
uTorrent by default disables protocol encryption .
We need to enable this so that the ISP 's packet shaping hardware will detect our BitTorrent traffic as normal traffic and hopefully let it pass .
Click on Options , Preferences .
Click on BitTorrent in the left column
You should get a dialog similar to one below
Bittorrent Preferences Dialog Box
The one we are concerned about is Protocol Encryption .
Set the Outgoing to Enabled .
Click on Advanced on the left column .
If you did NOT patch your TCPIP.sys to allow more concurrent half - open connections above , SKIP this step .
Advanced Settings Dialog Box
Change " net.max_halfopen " value to 50 by selecting the line , modifying the value at the bottom to 50 and clicking Set .
NOTE : It is normal for a asterisk (* ) to appear .
This is to indicate that the value has been changed from the default value .
From uTorrent version 1.8.3 onwards , a new UDP protocol named uTP was introduced which sends UDP packets as well as TCP packets .
The main benefit is that it provides a new avenue of bypassing ISP throttling limits resulting in .. what else ?
SPEED !
At the same Advanced screen , Change " bt.transp_disposition " value to 255 by selecting the line , modifying the value at the bottom to 255 and clicking Set. Click OK .
Stop all torrents ( red stop button on toolbar on top ) , wait 10 seconds , and Start the torrent ( green play button on toolbar ) .
Now let 's watch the speeds .
Hopefully , the above changes will improve speeds .
Ultimately , it depends on the number of seeders and peers with high upload rate .
Remember , you must upload to enjoy good download rates , but not so high that it affects download speed .
Experiment .
Bonus Tip !
This part only applies for public torrents .
It is useless for private torrents as they specifically prohibit sharing with other trackers .
The tip : Look for more public tracker servers that have the file .
However , this tip does not work for torrents that are private i.e. the DHT Tracker shows ' not allowed ' for the torrent .
Before :
Only one tracker under Trackers After getting the same torrent from torrentz.com ( a site that consolidates multiple trackers into one torrent file )
Many tracker servers !
Needless to say , the speed increased tenfold !
Now the question : how do you find more torrents of the same kind ?
There are several ways , via Torrentz and ...
Google !
Here 's how to make your search easier .
Highlight the row of the torrent by clicking on the torrent name Click on the Info tab at the bottom of the window
There should be a field labeled Hash near to the bottom with a string of 40 alphanumeric characters .
Right - click the value of this field and click Copy .
Hash value of a torrent
Now you have the hash value of your torrent .
With this hash , you can perform searches to find the exact torrent with additional trackers at most torrent sites .
There can be many versions of a torrent with some differences .
You cannot combine different versions ( with different hashes ) of a torrent into one torrent .
This is why we are using this hash to get the exact same torrent with hopefully more unique trackers .
Finding More Trackers Via Torrentz.com Go to Torrentz.com
Paste the hash into the search box .
To paste the value , right - click the search box , and click Paste .
Click Search .
You should be automatically be brought to the torrent page , if Torrentz has a record for it .
Find the keyword ' You can get a µ Torrent compatible list here ' at that page .
Click the link highlighted in the red box above
Click the link it points to .
You should get a list of trackers .
Right - click any of the text .
Click ' Select All '
Right - click any of the selected text again .
Click ' Copy '
Go to uTorrent and double - click the row of the torrent that want to add the list to In the box that pops out , go to the General tab ( if it is n't already there )
There should be a text box there labelled Trackers .
Place the cursor at the end of this box and hit Enter to add a new line Right - click the new line and click ' Paste ' to paste the list of new trackers .
Do n't worry if there are duplicates .
Click ' OK '
For the more determined , you can also search Google with the torrent hash to find more trackers .
Bonus Tip 2 !
Optimize your TCP settings .
Speedguide.net provides free utilities to make this step as easy as cake .
We also have a mirror of the file .
Optimize TCP settings for Windows XP , Vista and Windows 7
TCP Optimizer Main Window Steps to optimize your internet connection .
First , download or visit the official site here and extract the files to any folder .
Double - click on the TCPOptimizer application in the folder to launch it At the bottom of the window , click " Optimal "
At the top of the window , drag the slider to select your connection speed .
If you are not sure , run the speed test .
Use the value that you get for the Download field ( which is in kb / s ) and set the slider to it .
If you are using ADSL , check with your Internet Service Provider whether it is based on PPPoE or PPPoA .
You may also be able to obtain the information via your router 's homepage .
If your connection is based on PPPoE , tick the PPPoE box .
Under the " Network Adapter selection " box , select the network adapter you use to connect to the Internet .
If you are unsure , go to Start > Control Panel > Network Connections .
Your connection should be listed there .
Most of the time , it is Local Area Connection .
Select the entry and the status bar at the bottom should display the network adapter name .
Click ' Apply Changes ' at the bottom of the window .
Ensure that ' Backup ' is checked and click OK at the next confirmation box that appears .
Once the changes are done , reboot your system
This would have optimized your settings according to your internet connection you have .
Further Tips You Can Try For Optimum Speed
Tweaks that can improve your speed :
There should be a green tick at the bottom , not a exclamation mark as below .
Unconnectable situation
If uTorrent keeps showing this or " No incoming connections - Unless the icon turns green , it could indicate a problem with your network configuration " even after 5 minutes , check the possible causes .
To get more peers , right - click the entry on the list , and click Update Tracker ( if disabled or grayed out - you need to wait for some time ) .
Do this especially if you are on a private tracker before you exit the application , so that your ratio is maintained .
Check the Availability column for the torrent .
If it is less than 1 , chances are that the torrent is new and the original uploader is still uploading .
However , if it remains at a value less than 1 ( eg , 0.98 ) for more than a day , either the torrent does not have seeds or it is a fake .
( Thanks TTbarDJ ) Exit uTorrent .
Reset your internet connection by switching off and on the modem and router ( if applicable ) and then firing up uTorrent again .
Download the latest network driver , uninstall the current one and install back the latest network driver you downloaded by using Device Manager in Start > Control Panel > System > Hardware > Device Manager .
This CAN cause your internet to break if you update with the wrong drivers , so be careful !
Make sure you did not set a download limit accidentally !
Many people unknowingly set the download limit when they actually intended to set the upload limit in the right - click menu of the tray icon .
To check , Options > Preferences > Bandwidth > Global Download Rate Limiting >
Set to " 0 " > OK
The following software are known to cause problems with uTorrent : Nvidia Firewall , Forceware Network Manager , BitDefender , Avast , Spyware Doctor 5 , Kerio Personal Firewall , Sunbelt Personal Firewall , Norton GoBack , McAfee Firewall , SpamPal , Norman Personal Firewall , CyberSitter , V - Com System Suite , V - Com Fixit Pro , MSN Desktop , WinZIP Quickfind , Roxio Media Manager , Nero Scout , Google Desktop , Norton AntiVirus and McAfee Anti-virus .
If you have any of this software , you may want to read this page .
The following routers are known to cause problems with uTorrent : Linksys WRT54G , Linksys WRT54GL , Linksys WRT54GGS and D - Link DI - 514 .
If you have any of this routers , you may want to read this page .
As of August 2010 , the linked page does not show any of the incompatible hardware ( it did in the past ) and has been removed for some reason .
Exit uTorrent .
Power off your router and modem and power it on back after about 30 seconds .
This has made improvements in speed for some people .
Tweaks that can improve or LOWER your speed :
Some people have reported speed increases using an older version of utorrent , specifically utorrent version 1.6 .
You can download it from our servers at Bootstrike.com and try that instead .
Setting a high upload can sometimes slow down a fast torrent .
For example , in our ADSL connection , if we upload at 10 KB / s we can get up to 350 KB /s .
If we upload at 30 KB /s , the download speed gets limited to 200 KB /s .
The total upload available to me is 60 KB /s .
This is where you have to experiment by setting a low upload rate ( from 10 at Options > Preferences > Bandwidth > Maximum upload rate ) and watching if the speeds increase for 5 minutes , especially if the torrent is heavily seeded .
But remember , you must upload in order for peers to share their downloaded data with you .
It is possible to set a very low upload , but the chance of peers sending you their data will decrease , pulling down your download speed .
Some people have reported speed increases by setting the peer .
lazy_bitfield setting to false in Options > Preferences >
Advanced .
Change the Options > Preferences > Bittorrent > Protocol Encryption to Forced .
This will force encryption on all outgoing packets and will not fallback to un-encrypted mode if the peer refuses to co-operate .
Good for connecting to only encryption - enabled peers .
Avoid doing this for torrents with low peers / seeds .
Remove the check for Options > Preferences > Bittorrent > Protocol Encryption > Allow Incoming Legacy Connections .
This will make all your outgoing and incoming packets fully encrypted , except for tracker communications .
Peers who are using a torrent software that does n't support encryption are dropped .
Avoid doing this for torrents with low peers / seeds .
Private trackers , especially those that specifically tell utorrent to disable DHT ( effectively disabling Peer Exchange and Local Peer Discovery too ) , can affect speeds negatively .
You can tell if the torrent is private by selecting the torrent and looking at the DHT value .
If it says " disabled " , it is a private torrent .
That said , the main reason private trackers exist is because they enforce sharing rules that tries to prevent a person from downloading a torrent and running off without uploading back the same amount of data he downloaded .
For new and popular torrents on such trackers , you may be able to get good speeds as everyone will be trying to increase their upload / download ratio .
Again , experiment .
The key point here is the seeds / leechers ratio and the popularity of them in public and private trackers .
Increase the number of connections in Options > Preferences > Bandwidth > Number of Connections .
Experiment by increasing the number of global / max connections in steps of 25 .
Some people use software such as Peer Guardian or Protowall to ' protect ' from law spy computers .
At last check , Peer Guardian blocks about 773,125,915 out of 4,294,967,296 possible IP v4 addresses .
That is about 18 % of the whole Internet World Wide Web !
Which means lesser peers and that means lower speeds !
For the protection it claims to offer , speed is a compromise .
Windows Vista / Windows 7 users !
Disabling TCP / IP Auto Tuning helped improve speeds for some people Click Start .
In the box at the bottom , type CMD and do NOT press Enter .
You should see CMD come up on the list as shown below :
CMD shows when you type CMD in the box below RIGHT - click the icon and click " Run As Administrator " A " User Account Control " box should spring up .
Click Continue ( or ' Yes ' for Windows 7 ) Type this into the prompt : netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disable
You should get a " Ok. " response .
Restart your system .
If you have a proxy server such as a local ISP 's one , using it has helped many people improve their speeds .
Go to Options > Preferences > Connection .
Under ' Proxy Server ' , select the Type as HTTP and specify your proxy and port .
Check the box ' Use proxy server for peer - to - peer connections ' .
Press OK and restart uTorrent .
UTP has been reported to cause problems .
To fully disable UTP , go to Options > Preferences >
Advanced and set bt.transp_disposition to 5 .
Note that the setting overrides the " Enable bandwidth management " setting in Options > Preferences > BitTorrent .
The automatic TCP rate limiter can also cause problems .
To disable this feature , go to Options > Preferences >
Advanced and set bt.tcp_rate_control to false .
Disable UTP by going to Options > Preferences > Bittorrent > Enable Bandwidth Management [ uTP ] > UNCHECK > OK .
Scan your system for spyware and malware with SuperAntiSpyware .
It 's free .
Good luck !
It all boils down to Experimenting .
Readers ' Suggestions for Improving Speed
The following tips were posted in the comments below and found to be useful for some readers .
You can try them out too .
Jen says :
If Utorrent is really slow on Vista ( on my computer everything was really slow ... I.E , Outlook ) try disabling IPv6 .
Go to Control Panel > Network and Sharing Centre .
Click on view Status for your connection , then properties and uncheck Internet Protocol Version 6 ( TCP / IPv6 ) then OK it etc .
I did n't need to restart Utorrent or do anything else .
The download I was on jumped from 5 k right up to 200 .
Jen says :
Another one and it 's really simple !
I spent many an evening trying like hell to get my torrents to run faster and was n't getting anywhere .
a couple of weeks ago my ex was trying to download at 8 pm and he was getting DL speeds like a 512 connection trouble is he 's on an 8 mb line .
We could n't figure it out and quite randomly whilst trying to figure it I checked the TOC for his ISP it turned out they restrict bandwidth at certain times , in his case 6 pm to 9 pm .
Obviously I checked my ISP and mine is set 7 pm to 10 pm .
Geeman says : I noticed drastic increased speed by increasing the disk cache size ( Options > Preferences > Advanced > Disk Cache >
Override automatic cache size > ( set to higher number ) Masterkio says : Change the following in the Advanced tab of uTorrent preferences peer .
disconnect_inactive_interval from 300 to 600 .
You should be able to get a little bit more speed by doing this .
ColdBurn says : Download only a single torrent at one time .
At uTorrent > Options > Preferences >
Bandwidth , set ' Global maximum number of connections ' and ' Maximum number of connected peers per torrent ' to 375 .
Frequently Asked Questions ( FAQ )
1 ) What is the best port to open for uTorrent ?
There 's no " best port " or good ports .
All ports are suitable for use with uTorrent , unless you are running a program that is using the port .
Some recommend a port number more than 1024 , but it does not matter as long as the port is not used by any other program .
However , feel free to change the default port of it by going to Options > Preferences >
Connection and adjusting the " Port used for incoming connections " as necessary .
Remember to re-adjust your port forwarding settings in your firewall and router too .
2 ) I have tried all the above and my speeds are still slow !
In fact , it got worse !
What can I do ?
Try downloading a different torrent .
A high ratio of seeds to leechers ( Eg 2000 seeds to 10 leechers ) will make a big difference in speeds .
Make sure there is a green light at the bottom or check the possible causes .
Verify your speed by running a speed test from different locations to ensure your connection is fast to the major locations in the world .
For example , if you are downloading Chinese torrents , you should select a download location from China ( or somewhere nearby ) in the speed test .
Finally , try enabling Forced encryption and performing the extra things outlined here .
If speeds still do not improve , we are also not aware of the cause .
Perhaps your ISP has managed to break encryption in BitTorrent traffic and is limiting bittorrent connections ( e.g. Comcast ) , especially if they are in this list of Bad ISPs .
Or your ISP is limiting your connection speeds ( Try a speed test to a local server to verify this ) .
Do let us know in the comments if you have found a way to solve your problems even with the suggestions above .
One more thing - it has been reported that reinstalling the network driver has made speed differences for many people .
To reinstall , go to Control Panel , Network Connections and locate your network connection - most of the time it should be " Local Area Connection 1 " .
Right - click the icon , Properties and note down the name under " Connect Using " .
There are two ways to update drivers : AUTOMATICALLY : Click Configure > Driver > Update Driver .
Allow the system to connect to Microsoft Online to check for drivers .
Only manufacturers who send their drivers for WHQL certification can be updated using this method .
MANUALLY : Locate the latest driver for this device by going to the official site and downloading and installing it .
Blizzard also has a nice guide here .
WARNING : Installing an incorrect driver can cut off your internet !
If unsure , call the technical helpdesk ( e.g. Dell / HP / Acer ) and request for assistance on updating network card drivers .
3 ) How do I reset utorrent settings ?
Note that this will delete all saved torrents and settings .
For Windows XP users : to your C : \Documents and Settings\< username > \Application Data folder .
For Windows Vista and Windows 7 users , go to C: \Users\< username > \AppData\Roaming\ .
Delete the utorrent folder
To reset the max half open connections , run the lvllord utility again ( for XP ) or run the undopatch . bat ( for yaronmaor Vista patcher ) or run the half - open software and click " Restore original file " ( for Vista half - open patcher ) .
For enabling auto tuning back , the command is : netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal 4 ) Does this guide apply for the BitTorrent application as well ?
Yes - the application has just a name change so it is safe to use this guide .
If you compare utorrent vs BitTorrent , both are almost the same in features with the differences being the naming , branding , icons and some additional links .
There may be additional ' features ' , but all features from utorrent are there .
5 ) I am unable to surf the Internet or my Internet gets cut off when uTorrent is downloading ?
First , try reducing the upload speed .
Next , reduce the number of connections in Options > Preferences > Bandwidth >
" Global maximum number of connections : " in steps of 25 and see if it helps .
Finally , impose a download speed limit under " Global Download Rate Limiting " .
6 ) Do I still need to port forward if I am on a wired connection to the router ?
Wireless ?
Yes .
You do need to configure port forward if you are connected to a router via wired or wireless .
But if you are connected directly to a modem ( and not a router ) , you do n't need to port forward as the modem automatically forwards all packets to one computer .
7 ) How do I undo the TCP Optimizer changes ?
For the Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7 version , open TCP Optimizer > File > Restore Backup Settings .
For the old Windows Vista / Windows 7 version , run the CMD file again as Administrator , and type d and press ENTER .
8 ) Is there any way of finding an open port in my system besides port forwarding ?
If your system is behind a router , absolutely no port will be forwarded to you unless your router supports UPnP or the router is configured to port forward .
However , if you are connected to an ISP that blocks incoming connections , you can try GRC's Shield 's UP ( thanks Sonic_fanrs ) to find open ports that your ISP allows .
Click ' Proceed ' and then ' Common Ports ' .
This requires to disable your firewall and enable DMZ mode if you are using a router , which can be very * very * risky and we would not recommend this especially if your system is not updated with the latest patches .
9 ) My internet got cut out / restarted / disconnected , and when it was restored , why did the speed get so slow ?
First , this is normal .
Wait about 10 - 15 minutes , and if the speeds are still slow , restart utorrent .
Right - click the tray icon on the bottom right and click Exit .
Start uTorrent again .
Everytime you restart utorrent , it reconnects to the DHT network and obtains a new set of peers from the tracker and DHT .
Although utorrent caches the peer list in your computer , there is a possibility that it may drop good speed peers .
There 's a way around this .
When you are experiencing good download speeds with a torrent , locate the good upload peer by clicking the torrent row , and clicking on the Peer tab .
You will now see a list of peers that you are connected to .
Look for the row whose Down speed is extremely high that the majority .
Right - click that row and click ' Copy selected hosts ' .
Paste this good peer in some notepad file .
When utorrent needs to restore , click the torrent row again , click on the Peers tab , right - click any row and click " Add Peer ... " and paste your good peer here .
uTorrent will then attempt to establish connection to that good peer provided it has free upload slots ( not choked ) .
10 ) My port forwarding still does not work !
uTorrent still shows a yellow / red icon at the bottom .
Help !
For users from Singapore , we can help you configure port forwarding .
See our computer service site .
For international users , you can contact me through e-mail , letting me know your Skype account and time range you are available .
Rate will be US $ 20 .
Otherwise , there 's still light at the end of the tunnel .
uTorrent v2 onwards supports UDP hole punching via UTP .
Basically , what this means that uTorrent tries to work around port forwarding by having another peer to help you setup the connection between two other peers .
Make sure UTP is enabled above for this to work by going to Options > Preferences >
Advanced and setting bt.transp_disposition to 255 . 11 ) Does port forwarding make my computer more vulnerable to security attacks ?
Simple answer :
Yes , but as long as you keep your Windows and uTorrent updated , it should be of low concern .
Remember , if every peer in a torrent does not have port forwarding enabled , no one can connect to any one .
Port forwarding allows you to receive more connections from other peers and this means more speed .
Most modern routers have UPNP ( Universal Plug and Play ) built in where utorrent is directly able to communicate with the router to automatically setup the required ports .
Another example , when you host a DOTA multi player game , you need to port forward .
If you did n't have to , it means your router supports UPNP where port forwarding is automatically setup .
12 ) Does this guide apply to the Apple Mac version of uTorrent ?
Unfortunately , we are not familiar with the Mac version of uTorrent .
However , we believe the guide still applies except for the following : ( a ) Installation Process ( b ) TCP Half - open Patches / Optimizer 13 ) I was downloading at high speed then suddenly I get an error " Disk overloaded 100 % " and my download slows down ?
This error appears when uTorrent attempts to write the downloaded data to your hard drive and then got severely delayed by other processes waiting to read / write data as well .
To prevent this problem from occurring again , minimize hard drive activity such as copying large files or starting an application that requires a long loading time especially when uTorrent 's download speeds are reaching a high level that requires high speed reading and writing .
If despite the attempts to minimize disk activity still results in the problem , it may be that you are downloading too fast for your hard drive to catch up .
Try defragging ( Start > Programs > Accessories > System Tools > Disk Defragmenter ) or use another disk drive to save your download .
As a last resort , you can limit your download speed at Options > Preferences > Bandwidth > Global Download Rate Limiting .
14 ) The uTorrent site reports that my port forwarding works , but I still have the red icon appearing at the bottom ?
There is a possibility that the tracker is identifying an incorrect IP address .
First , locate the IP address that the uTorrent port checker page reports .
You can run the checker here .
Port Checker Page
Copy that IP address to the uTorrent > Options > Preferences > BitTorrent > IP / Hostname to report to tracker field .
Restart uTorrent and check if it works better now .
If not , change the field back to blank to allow uTorrent to automatically detect your IP Addrss .
Note that if you specify the IP address field and you ever restart your modem or your IP address changes somehow , you will need to change this field everytime if not the red icon will be back .
15 ) Sometimes I get the message " Attention - this torrent contains files that may harm your computer .
Upgrade to uTorrent Plus to protect yourself from viruses hiding in torrents " ?
This is uTorrent 's attempt to get you to pay for their paid version of uTorrent .
Simply ignore the message .
But do make sure that you have security software running on your system to scan all your downloaded torrents !

I have had a few comments regarding the last post on spanking I did , and would like to clear a few misconceptions up if I may , as it seems some who are new to this are having a few problems accepting that some subs / slaves actually enjoy being spanked , the key word here is SOME , not all like this and that is something as a Master or Dom you need to establish before you go wading in with a bull whip , hell even those who like to be spanked do not always welcome a bull whip !
There are many ways to spank someone , and indeed many places as well , the tits are a favourite , the ass , as well as the pussy , you can use your hand or you can use a paddle , a crop , a kitchen spatula , a hair brush , even a fly swat works , they all provide a sting when used properly .
When a sub or slave is spanked make no mistake , it does hurt , but it has been described to me as a ‘ good pain ’ now not being one who wants to be paddled myself I can only listen to what is being said , many subs and slaves say that their minds open to the pain and it releases them to another ‘ zone ’ that the pain then does not hurt but excites them and some can orgasm from being spanked alone , this I know is not the case in everyone but from experience I do know that after a spanking everyone I have then carried on the scene with have been all to ready for me and the power of their pleasure is intensified .
Is this from the paddling ?
Who knows but while they enjoy it and so do I , then I see no reason to stop with this fun past time .

Hillary Clinton has warned North Korea relations with the US will not improve until it engages in dialogue with South Korea and ends its nuclear ambitions .
The US secretary of state was speaking in the South Korean capital , Seoul , during her first overseas trip as the top US diplomat .
Mrs Clinton also announced that Stephen Bosworth , a former ambassador , would be her new special envoy on North Korea .
Reports suggest the North may be about to test - fire a long - range missile .
Mrs Clinton said Pyongyang should follow through on its commitment to get rid of its nuclear programme , adding that it was important to get six - party talks on the issue back on track .
Mr Bosworth , who was US ambassador to South Korea from 1997 to 2000 , will act as the American envoy to the six - party talks , which also involve Japan , China and Russia .
The secretary of state is in Beijing on Friday , the final stop of her inaugural Asian tour , which has also included stops in Indonesia and Japan .
' Different relationship ' South Korea 's prosperity and democracy stood in stark contrast to " the tyranny and poverty across the border to the North " , Mrs Clinton said during a press conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung - hwan .
" North Korea is not going to get a different relationship with the United States while insulting and refusing dialogue with the Republic of Korea , " she said .
The North should refrain from violating this resolution and also from any and all provocative actions that could harm the six party talks
Hillary Clinton
US secretary of state
Reynolds : Beijing awaits Clinton
Her visit to the region comes amid speculation over the health of North Korean leader Kim - Jong - il , after reports he had a stroke last year .
Mr Kim is not known to have named his successor and Western diplomats fear any leadership crisis could further raise tensions on the peninsula .
Referring to speculation Pyongyang was preparing to test - fire a long - range missile , Mrs Clinton said the US viewed any such tests as provocative .
" We do n't comment on intelligence matters but it is clear that under the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718 , North Korea is required to suspend all activities related to its ballistic programme .
The visit comes amid speculation North Korea is to test - fire another missile " The North should refrain from violating this resolution and also from any and all provocative actions that could harm the six party talks and aggravate tensions in the region . "
BBC state department correspondent Kim Ghattas in Seoul says Mrs Clinton 's words were a stern warning to Pyongyang , making clear that while the new administration may be ready to explore new strategies , there will be no softening of tone .
She also praised South Korea for what she described as its calm resolve in the face of provocations from the North , our correspondent adds .
Hours before Mrs Clinton arrived in Seoul , North Korea issued the latest in a series of warnings to its southern neighbour , stating that its troops were " fully ready " for war .
The North 's sabre - rattling over the past few weeks is seen as an attempt to grab the attention of the Obama administration and improve its bargaining position when the talks eventually resume , our correspondent says .
Mrs Clinton arrived in Seoul from Indonesia - the world 's most populous Muslim country - where she said the US was seeking a new kind of dialogue with the Muslim world .

Finished in all its technical glory .
Everything is there , every bolt , screw , gauge ... For me this was more than just a painting of two characters in a cockpit .
This is my dreams , my aspirations , my very being poured into a single image .
It 's been ten years too long ; ten years since I gave up on that dream ; bullied out of me by my peers .
But now .
I 've once again taken a hold of that dream , now stronger , confident , and more determined than before .
I want this more than ever , more than before .
I /need / this .
I 'd like to dedicate this to a few people ; [ though you have n't logged on in years ]
- My wonderful boyfriend who never stopped believing in me , even when I was determined to remain at the bottom , doing nothing with my life , wanting nothing with my life .
You stood by me when I needed it , and because of you , I am stronger .
Thank - you for all the help you 've given me with this piece , without your technical input , I doubt it'd look the way it does now .
" Do not flail rudder controls . "
- My cousin , who has never ceased to encourage me in whatever strange endeavor I take on , who was always there when I needed an ear or an arm up .
Thank - you for always believing in me and encouraging me to become so much more than what I was and what I am .
- One of the best friends I could ever ask for .
Thank - you for always being there for me through the good times and the bad times .
For being able to tolerate my erratic behavior and for calling me out on my stupidity .
I doubt I 'd be where I am today without you .
- You 're probably one of my oldest friends and someone who in my period of paranoia and anxiety , I 've learned to trust completely .
Your sense of humor has never ceased to leave me nearly in tears , your critiques never ceasing to help me improve more and more with my art .
- For all the times where I felt lost and without hope , you never failed to give me advice when I needed it the most .
In those brief times when you were here , you helped teach me to believe in myself and to see past all of the negativity in my life and grasp onto something real .
You helped me learn how to talk to people again .
- A /huge / thank - you for all the times you 've helped me out when Kratos was epic failing on me in every way imaginable , and for being a good friend .
Those links you keep randomly sending my way always bring a smile to my face , or send me laughing off of my chair .
Keep them coming .
- I love you .
In a completely platonic way .
xD
Thank - you for being someone who shared my passion for airplanes , for cheering me up - You were always someone I could talk to about anything and everything without making me feel like a complete moron .
Through the best and the worst , you were always there as a shoulder to cry on , and someone I felt that I could truly express myself to .
- Thank - you for your invaluable input as a pilot .
It helped me out with this image , a lot .
- To my brother , I know things were n't always the best for us , but you have always stood up for me , looked out for me , and been that stereotypical big brother .
Thank - you for pushing me even further in this endeavor , for being one of the first to acknowledge this dream and encourage me in it .
" About fucking time . "
I wo n't ever forget those words when I told you that I was renewing my aspiration to be a pilot once again .
And to all my friends and watchers here on DevArt , whose constant input and opinions I value more than anything .
I first came to this site , a confused 14 yearold who could barely draw , and you guys helped me grow as an artist , always encouraging and giving me tips and critiques when I needed them the most .
Thank - you .
And lastly , References [ because there 's no freaking way I could even dare draw a DC - 10 cockpit from memory ] : Characters are Thomas " Lux " Lux , captain and Jacques " Jake " Verte , first officer .

On Friday my son took a field trip with his first grade class to throw flower petals at his teacher as she exited City Hall in San Francisco , a newlywed .
The class took a city bus down , surprised her and her bride , then had pizza .
My son described the adventure as mostly boring , waiting around on the steps of City Hall with handfuls of flower petals .
But he was very happy for his teacher , who he has quickly grown to love .
When asked about the event , he gave a six - year - old ’s answer about people loving and caring for each other .
He then moved on to Legos and more important things .
What my son ( and I ) did n’t understand is that what he took part in was , according to Bill O’Reilly , “ A new outrage in San Francisco , ” and that “ opponents of gay marriage are up in arms , but the school administrators say it ’s no big deal . ”
Ah , a teaching moment .
Yes , kids , monsters are real .
You ’ll know them because they ’ll be the ones taking up “ arms ” against an elementary school .
A story on the event , which appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle on Saturday , has attracted more than 1,400 comments , many of them censored by the Chron — I assume because they contain threats and curse words — as well as homophobic diatribes more suitable for publication , like O’Reilly ’s .
I ’d like to thank Mayor Newsom ( who performed the wedding ) for standing up for the issue of gay marriage , even as I beg his pardon for complicating matters by allowing my kid to play a small , meaningful part in a legal and beautiful celebration .
I also want to be clear to the monsters and bigots out there that you ’re not scary .
Hateful , yes , but you do n’t scare us .

[ digg- reddit - me ] Dan Akroyd joined Saturday Night Live to explain how Republicans were using this crisis to move past business - as - usual while staying in touch with the citizens they represent :
( h/t TPIP for the link .
I had already seen the clip , but was fruitlessly looking for it on Hulu until I saw it on his blog . )
I must commend the Republican Party for discovering the value of fiscal responsibility , of Congressional oversight , and of Congress ’s proper role as a coequal branch of government and a balance to the executive branch now that they have no elective power except a slender foothold in Congress .
A few more losses in Congress and we might see the Republican Party start making the much maligned case for judicial activism – as our federal court system is filled with conservatives , despite protests to the contrary .
It seems to be part of the nature of our oppositional party structure that such ideological shifts make fools of politicians from time to time .
Sometimes I think it would be better for them if we just booted them all out so they would n’t need to face the embarrassment of changing their opinions on how things should work so obviously based on political calculations .
Of course , giving the lie to the Republican ’s newfound financial responsibility ( aside from their continued support for such expensive programs as continuing Bush ’s tax cuts and funding the various imperial activities which together cost some trillions of dollars and got us in the financial pickle we are in now ) is their response to the Obama stimulus plan – a tax cut plan that would expand the deficit even further :
At the end of the clip , that was Kimberley Strassel of the Wall Street Journal .
In response to her : yes , we all did notice that there are no Republicans in charge of anything in Washington anymore .
I wonder how and why that happened ?
At the same time , the Republicans are now trying to make a big deal of business - as - usual in Washington – after embracing the same practices while in power .
This is , of course , standard fare in itself .
As Republican opinion - makers suddenly begin to decry how Congressmen and women did not have time to read the stimulus bill , I think most of us remember that infamous exchange from Michael Moore ’s Fahrenheit 9/11 in which a Congressman explains why no one read the PATRIOT
Act before it was signed into law :
My purpose is not to defend these practices – but to point out the hypocrisy in suddenly objecting to them .
The Republicans , led by Eric Cantor , are acting with the transparent hypocrisy of an Inspector Renault :
In all honesty , I do welcome the Republicans embrace of fiscal responsibility , of Congressional oversight , and of Congress ’s proper role as a coequal branch of government and a balance to the executive branch , hypocrisy and all .
Their sanctimony on the subject though is hard to stomach .

Enlarge By Lisa Nipp for USA TODAY Wall Street - savvy Rebekka Bonner bypassed what she calls " a major promotion " at Goldman Sachs to spend seven months volunteering on Barack Obama 's campaign .
With student loans paid off , she 's vying for an administration job .
WASHINGTON  More than 330,000 people have applied for top jobs in the Obama administration so far , in an unprecedented outpouring of interest spurred by excitement surrounding Barack Obama 's election , according to independent groups that monitor presidential transitions .
" President - elect Obama said he wanted to make government cool again , " says Max Stier , president of the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service .
" We are seeing a massive response . "
The numbers dwarf those from previous transitions .
At this point in President Bush 's 2000 - 01 transition , there were 44,000 applicants ; in former president Bill Clinton 's 1992 - 93 transition , there were nearly 135,000 , according to Stier 's group , which promotes effective government .
Several factors are driving interest , transition watchers say .
Among them : •
The ease with which applicants can apply online at www.change.gov. •
The desire to help the country during an economic crisis .
•
The pent - up energy of Democrats waiting on the sidelines through eight years of a Republican White House .
Obama has " energized and engaged a whole new group of Americans , " says Jennifer Dorn , president of National Academy of Public Administration , an independent , non-profit research group on governance .
" He has made people feel welcome and wanted . "
Transition officials say a team of 50 workers is sorting the applications to match applicants to the right jobs based on their experience and qualifications .
" We are staying connected with the very supporters who worked hard to elect Obama and have always said that these same people working in their local communities would be the ones helping to bring the change we need to Washington , " transition spokesman Nick Shapiro says .
Rebekka Bonner , 35 , who went to Yale Law School and Harvard Business School , earlier this year turned down what she calls a " major promotion " at Goldman Sachs , where she worked as a vice president and assistant general counsel .
Having just paid off her student loans , Bonner said no thanks and headed to Washington , D.C. , where she spent seven months working full time , for free , for the Obama campaign .
" I found myself on Wall Street watching the country I love go off track , " Bonner says .
Now , she 's hoping for a job , she says , so she can help repair the nation 's broken economy and foreign policy .
Only about one in 100 applicants will get jobs — and that could be the downside .
The jobs Obama will fill with political appointees , some of whom need Senate confirmation , represent a tiny fraction of the 1.6 million full - time federal government jobs .
The transition has n't yet released an exact number of how many jobs it will fill with political appointees , but transition watchers say it likely will be between 3,000 and 4,000 .
The Bush administration currently has 3,300 such positions filled .
" The dilemma , the challenge , is how do you handle the heightened expectations ?
For every 10 applicants to a federal job , you have nine who are alienated " when they get a rejection letter , Dorn says .
Stier says transition officials must figure out how to channel the enthusiasm of those who do n't get offers into their communities , either in the form of state or local government jobs or volunteer work .
Otherwise , " we may ultimately do ourselves more harm than good , " he says .
Marc Grinberg , 25 — a Palo Alto , Calif. , native who has been living and working in Washington , D.C. , on and off for several years in between graduate school at Oxford University and stints volunteering for the Obama campaign 's national security team — is looking for a job at the Defense or State departments or with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence .
" Honestly , I have absolutely no idea what my chances are , " Grinberg says .
He says he knows that many , many more people worked on the campaign than will end up with jobs in the administration and he 's realistic .
He expects to find out sometime in late spring or summer .
" People at my level are the last to hear , " he says .

Gulf Oil CEO : $ 1 a gallon gas in 2009 Stephen C. Webster
Published : Thursday December 4 , 2008

This CEO also claims carbon - driven warming a ' myth ' as Merrill Lynch predicts $ 25 a barrel oil
Joe Petrowski , CEO of Massachusetts - based Gulf Oil , has some good news for consumers .
In years past , market speculation inflated prices , said Petrowski .
Now that the prices are deflated , speculators may ' overshoot ' and actually drive the consumer cost down further .
His statements came shortly before Merrill Lynch & Co. predicted oil prices will plunge to $ 25 a barrel in the coming year if the global recession begins heavily affecting China .
Petrowski also claimed that the threat of global warming driven by carbon emissions is a ' myth , ' and instead insisted that dependence on oil imports poses a greater threat to economic stability .
Petrowski's remarks were delivered to the South Shore Chamber of Commerce in Randolph , MA , according to a published report .
In spite of his remarks , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , in its 2005 report on the effect of hydroflorocarbons on Earth 's atmosphere , maintained ( PDF link ) that " the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence of the global climate . "
AAA 's national average gas price for regular unleaded was $ 1.78 as of Thursday , down from $ 3.04 this time last year .
The highest recorded national average was $ 4.11 , registered July 17 , 2007 .
Oil was trading at $ 44 a barrel on Thursday evening .
It ’s the middle of winter , and there is a huge snowstorm hitting the north east at the moment .
We thought it would be a good time to look at some things you could do with all of that snow , if you were so inclined to spend several hours being creative .
We ’re talking about snow built into various structures and sculptures here .
Who has n’t built a snowman , snow fort , or some other snow creation as a kid ?
But it ’s not just for kids anymore .
There are serious artists who spend hours upon hours on snow sculptures and entering prestigious competitions .
And even the Ivy League recognizes the skill as Dartmouth offers a course in snow sculpture .
Still , the creations are n’t all high art , they have some amusement to them as well .
For example , to the right is Trogdor the Burninator .
Here are a few more photos of what others have come up with :
The World ’s Biggest Original Chocolate Fountain
Original Chocolate fountain in Las Vegas , inside Bellagio ,
With the hight of 27 feet , it ’s the biggest Original chocolate fountain in the world .
The fountain is filled with 2100 pounds of dark , milk and white chocolate .
From far down Bellagio ’s promenade in the luxurious new Spa Tower , a mesmerizing figure entices curious guests with visual splendour and aromatic wafts : jutting out into the main corridor like the prow of a ship is a glass - enclosed , floor - to - ceiling chocolate fountain emerging from Jean - Philippe Patisserie .
Displaying a spectacular series of melted chocolate cascades , this first - of - its - kind spectacle is the tallest original chocolate fountain in the world .
Three rivers of dark , two of milk and one of white twist and swirl from vessel to vessel , flood across then spill down to the next carefully positioned receptacle .
The coloured streams and vessels are staggered , creating a mosaic effect in earthy shades of cocoa , gleaming viscous surfaces and refracted light .
Having finished their acrobatic tumble down the tiers of this colossal chandelier , each rivulet funnels into hidden melting tanks , recollects and begins the journey once more .
Surrounding all this glory is a protective , multi-faceted cloak of 300 - pound glass panels that rise in a funnel shape as the fountain expands toward the ceiling .
Designed by award - winning Executive Pastry Chef Jean - Philippe Maury and Norwood and Antonia Oliver Design Associates , Inc. , the fountain took a year and a half in planning and design .
The result is a genius work of kinetic sculpture and a daring feat of engineering .

I just found this fascinating photo in a 1932 book on forensic psychology in the Universidad de Antioquia ’s history of medicine section .
It pictures the inventor of the truth serum , Dr House , administering the drug to an arrested man in a Texas jail .
The book is called Manual de Psicolog√≠a Jur√≠dica ( literally ‘ manual of legal psychology ’ ) by the pioneering forensic psychiatrist Emilio Mira y L√≥pez and is a curious mixture of psychological theory , mental tests and descriptions of what seem like strange lie- detecting contraptions .
The history of the ‘ truth serum ’ is recounted in a fantastic article by medical historian Alice Winter from Bulletin of the History of Medicine which describes the Dr House ’s invention and the influence it had on society of the time .
Truth serum was the creation of a rural Texas physician , Robert House .
House claimed that the drug scopolamine hydrobromide , which was known for erasing the knowledge of painful events , could actually be used to extract intact information .
His announcement was seized upon by journalists , police , and forensic scientists as heralding a potentially transformative new technology , and was just as robustly rejected by the legal community .
Scopolamine ’s identity as an extractor of “ truth ” was indebted to certain earlier conventions ‚Äînotably , research into altered psychic states such as mesmerism and hypnotism , which sometimes were said to create a confessional state .
Scopolamine , in turn , created the shoes that other chemical agents would come to fill when , later in the decade and in the 1930s , the new barbiturates sodium amytal and sodium pentothal were said to have the potential to extract “ truthful ” memories .
These drugs largely act by reducing inhibition , with the hope that the person will speak more freely , but they have never been found to reliably make anyone more truthful .
Alice Winter was also recently interviewed on SciAm ’s Mind Matters blog , in light of rumours that one of the men involved in the Mumbai attacks had been subjected to interrogation under ‘ truth serum ’ .

The Unknown Revolution , 1917 - 1921 by Voline ( 1882 -1945 )
The present work is a complete translation of La Revolution Inconnue , 1917 - 1921 , first published in French in 1947 , and re-published in Paris in 1969 by Editions Pierre Belfond .
An abridged , two - volume English translate of the work was published in 1954 and 1955 by the Libertarian Book Club ( New York City ) and Freedom Press ( London ) .
The present edition contains all the materials included in the earlier edition ( translated by Holley Cantine ) , as well as the sections which were omitted ( Book I , Part I and II , and some brief omissions later in the work , translated by Fredy Perlman ) .
In the newly translated sections , Russian words are transliterated into English .
However , in the sections which are reprinted from the earlier edition , French transliteration of Russian words was frequently retained in the English translation .
As a result the present edition , a Russian word is frequently spelled in two different ways .

" A few days ' testing of Windows 7 has already disclosed some draconian DRM , some of it unrelated to media files .
A legitimate copy of Photoshop CS4 stopped functioning after we clobbered a nagging registration screen by replacing a DLL with a hacked version .
With regard to media files , the days of capturing an audio program on your PC seem to be over ( if the program originated on that PC ) .
The inputs of your sound card are severely degraded in software if the card is also playing an audio program ( tested here with Grooveshark ) .
This may be the tip of the iceberg .
Being in bed with the RIAA is bad enough , but locking your own files away from you is a tactic so outrageous it may kill the OS for many persons .
Many users will not want to experiment with a second sound card or computer just to record from online sources , or boot up under a Linux that supports ntfs - 3g just to control their files . "

Re — Photoshop : That Photoshop stopped functioning after we messed with one of its nag DLLs was not so much a surprise , but what was a surprise : Noting that Win7 allows programs like Photoshop to insert themselves stealthily into your firewall exception list .
Further , that the OS allows large software vendors to penetrate your machine .
Even further , that that permission is responsible for disabling of a program based on a modified DLL .
And then finding that the OS even after reboot has locked you out of your own Local Settings folder ; has denied you permission to move or delete the modified DLL ; and refuses to allow the replacement of the Local Settings folder after it is unlocked with Unlocker to move it to the Desktop for examination ( where it also denies you entry to your own folder ) .
Setting permissions to ' allow everyone ' was disabled !
Re — media : Under XP you could select ' Stereo Mix ' or similar under audio recording inputs and nicely capture any program then playing .

Paris , France offers its visitors one of the extraordinary urban playgrounds .
Travelers seeking culture , romance , and flavorful cuisine flock to the “ City of Light ” to engross themselves in all things French .

Protagonists : Ethan Hawke ( Jesse ) and Julie Delpy ( Celine )
Jesse : “ What do you think were the chances of us ever meeting again ? ”
Celine : “ After that December , I ’d say almost zero .
But we ’re not real anyway , right ?
We ’re just , uh , characters in that old lady ’s dream . ”
Ever meet the person of your dreams while traveling ?
Before Sunset sequel to Before Sunrise , is about the second meeting of Jesse and Celine .
The two characters , initially , had a brief love affair after meeting on a train to Vienna , Austria .
Nine years later , the two met again at Jesse ’s book reading about the romance , at Shakespeare & Co in Paris .
With just a few hours before Jesse ’s plane leaves for the United States , Celine takes him on a stroll through Paris and a walk through memory lane .
In addition to showing the beauty of Parisian life , Before Sunset delves into the ways in which the protagonists recall events along with the difference between the idealism of our 20’s and the realism of the next stage of life .
Each person we meet in life , traveling or otherwise , provides a piece of our life ’s puzzle .
As Celine says , “ you can never replace anyone because everyone is made up of such beautiful specific details . ”

2. Amélie ( 2001 )
Director : Jean - Pierre Jeunet
Protagonist : Audrey Tautou ( Amelie )
Amélie : “ I like to look for things no one else catches .
I hate the way drivers never look at the road in old movies . ”
It ’s the details of Paris that make it such an alluring destination .
Jeunet ’s film provides a visual masterpiece with a focus on the musing of eccentric Amélie and her Montmartre neighborhood .
A single waitress , Amélie spends her time attempting to help Parisians fix their lives .
In the process , she realizes that it ’s her own life that needs to be altered .
Travelers will see a lot of their own quirkiness in Amélie ’s character .
They ’ll also appreciate her father ’s longing to travel along with her attempts to motivate him to follow through on the dream using a garden gnome .
3. The Dreamers ( 2003 )
Director : Bernardo Bertolucci
Protagonists : Michael Pitt ( Matthew ) , Eva Green ( Isabelle ) , and Louis Garrel ( Theo )
Isabelle & Theo : “ We accept you , one of us !
One of us ! ”
The ultimate experience in traveling or living abroad is being accepted as part of the local community .
In The Dreamers , Matthew manages to become part of an unusual Parsian family .
He originally went to the City of Light , as an American exchange student , with an obsessive love for the cinema .
Set in the turbulent May 1968 Paris , Matthew befriends Isabelle and Theo .
We learn that the two siblings are a little too close for comfort .
Along the way , Bertolucci infuses the film with his love of Paris .
In the meantime , his audience slowly falls in love with the city and cinema itself as the characters interminably refer to and act out great film scenes .
As Matthew states , “ I saw a movie at the cinémathèque française [ and ]
I thought , “ only the French … only the French would house a cinema inside a palace . ”

Breathless © Indie Wech
Director : Jean - Luc Godard
Protagonists : Jean - Paul Belmondo ( Michel Poiccard ) and Jean Seberg ( Patricia Franchini )

New York Herald Tribune !

Marion and Jack follow the trail of many travelers who take off , across the globe , in hopes of rekindling their relationships .

6. Paris Je T’aime or Paris , I Love You ( 2007 )
Directors : Twenty Different Individuals
Carol : “ Sitting there , alone in a foreign country , far from my job and everyone I know , a feeling came over me .
It was like remembering something I ’d never known before or had always been waiting for , but I did n’t know what . ”
Paris , Je T’Aime is a tribute to the City of Light .
Twenty directors filmed segements of the movie detailing every aspect of Parisian life .
This Ode to Paris delves into the human experience with a connection to their urban jungle .
Though there are melancholy segments in the film , viewers walk away with a true feeling that Paris penetrates the core of its inhabitants and visitors .

Queensland 's Crime and Misconduct Commission ( CMC ) will oversee an investigation into the death of a teenager run over by a car after he was arrested by police .
Andrew Dornen , 16 , was left lying on a busy road in Ipswich , west of Brisbane , on Saturday night .
He was rushed to hospital with massive head injuries but did not recover .
Police arrested the teenager after receiving reports of a man wielding a machete in the suburb of Brassall at about 11 pm ( AEST ) on Saturday .
He was reportedly unarmed when arrested by plain - clothes police officers .
So my brother just finished his 2 year commitment and is facing 6 years active reserve ...
He hated the army and served a tour in the trenches in Iraq already ...
Now they 're using high - pressure to get him to sign up for the national guard before he leaves , telling him that his 6 year commitment will go down to 3 years , and that he 'll be undeployable for 2 of those years ...
Telling him this offer is off the table if he does n't take it before he leaves his post in a couple days .
Are they just trying to screw him , or would this actually be a good deal ?
Is n't it more likely that he'd be deployed in the guard than on active reserves ?
On the first sunny day in the Bay Area in nearly a week , San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom announced the installation of electric vehicle ( EV ) charging stations in front of San Francisco City Hall , in another step forward in making the Bay Area the “ EV Capital of the U.S. ”
The high - profile charging stations are part of a nine - step policy plan announced back in November by Mayor Newsom , San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed and Oakland Mayor Ron Dellums , to transform the Bay Area into the “ Electric Vehicle ( EV ) Capital of the U.S. ”
“ Electric vehicles are the future of transportation and the Bay Area is the testing ground for the technology , ” said Newsom , adding that the city began using plug - in hybrids in the city ’s fleet last year .
“ Now , for the first time the public can plug - in to the next generation of cars and take them for a drive in San Francisco , ” the Mayor said .
>> Read Mayor Newsom ’s post at gas2.0
According to Newsom , the city will use tax breaks to promote sales of electric vehicles and encourage homes and businesses to make charging stations widely available .
The city will also look at ways to speed up the permitting process to install charging outlets at homes and businesses .
But the media coverage and the buzz at Wednesday ’s opening in Civic Center Park was n’t purely a function of its California location .
The opening was timed perfectly with the big boost provided to EVs by the economic stimulus package , thus garnering national attention , as well .
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocates $ 2 billion in grants for manufacturing advanced batteries , plus tax credits to cover the cost of manufacturing facilities ; it also provides tax credits of up to $ 7,500 for those who buy new plug - in electric vehicles ; sets aside $ 300 million for federal agencies to buy alternatively - fueled vehicles , $ 400 million for “ transportation electrification , ” and another $ 4.5 billion for improving the nation ’s electric grid .
So while California ’s unprecedented budget woes continue to drag the state coffers down and threaten the viability of some of the state ’s progressive environmental policies , the City of San Francisco continues to test the boundaries of what a municipality can do by itself to push environmental protection forward .

Rod Blagojevich , less than a week removed from his removal as governor of Illinois , is booked to visit CBS ' " Late Show With David Letterman " on Tuesday night .
The Illinois senate on Thursday voted 59 - 0 to remove Blagojevich from office .
Arrested in December by federal agents , Blagojevich has been accused by U.S. Atty .
Patrick Fitzgerald of trying to sell an appointment to the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Preseident Barack Obama , among other crimes .
Blagojevich 's " Late Show " appearance , set for 10:35 p.m. Tuesday on WBBM - Ch. 2 , is being promoted by CBS as the former governor 's first late - night talk - show visit since his ouster .
It marks a return to New York City , where Blagojevich launched a national media blitz on Monday and Tuesday of last week as the senate began its impeachment proceedings against him .
" The View , " " Today , " " Good Morning America , " " Larry King Live , " " Nightline " and other TV shows all got their own versions of his talking points , which centered on the idea that conversations he is said to have been taped having are being used out of context and that the impeachment proceedings denied him due process .
Just last week , while Blagojevich was making the media rounds in New York to distract everyone from his impeachment trial , Letterman offered a Top 10 list of " Ways Rod Blagojevich Can Improve His Image " :
10 , Star in new television series , " America 's Funniest Haircuts . "
9 , Quit politics and become a fat , lovable mall cop .
8 , Start pronouncing last name with Jerry Lewis - like " BLAGOOOOYYYYYJEVICH . "
7 , Offer a senate seat with no money down , zero percent interest .
6 , Team up with John Malkovich and Erin Brockovich for hot Malkovich - Brockovich - Blagojevich sex tape .
5 , Change his name to Barod Obamavich .
4 , Safely land an Airbus on the Hudson River .
3 , I do n't know ... how about showing up for his impeachment trial ?
2 , Wear sexy dresses , high heels and say , " You Betcha ! "
1 , Uhhh ... resign ?
Do men who frequently smoke pot have a higher risk of testicular cancer than those who do not ?
It 's possible , according to a new study .
However , the researchers say the link is currently a " hypothesis " that needs further testing .
Some experts question research saying that frequent pot smokers could double the risk of having testicular cancer .
Testicular cancer is relatively rare -- a man 's lifetime chance of developing the disease is about 1 in 300 ( and dying of it is about 1 in 5,000 ) .
Frequent or long - term marijuana smokers could have about double the risk of nonusers , according to the report in the February 9 issue of the journal Cancer .
In the study , a team led by Dr. Janet R. Daling of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , Washington , interviewed 369 men between the ages of 18 and 44 from the Seattle - Puget Sound area whose testicular cancer had been diagnosed .
They compared those men with 979 men who lived in the same area , but did not have cancer .
Overall , 26 percent of the testicular cancer patients were pot smokers ( 15 percent who used daily or weekly ) at the time of diagnosis , compared with 20 percent of men without cancer ( 10 percent who used daily or weekly ) .

Is there a link between drugs , alcohol , and ADHD ?
Marijuana users had 2.3 times the risk of a type of testicular cancer known as a nonseminoma as those who were not .
Testicular cancer is divided into two types , pure seminomas ( 60 percent of cases ) and nonseminomas ( 40 percent of cases . )
The link was much weaker in men with seminomas .
These types of studies have one important caveat -- cancer patients may be more likely to remember - or may be more honest about - past drug use than men in the general population .
Because marijuana use was more closely associated with one type of tumor , rather than testicular cancer in general , it reduces the chances that the study participants were less than honest , Daling said .
" That certainly makes us feel better that the associations are true associations , " she said .
Still , the results are considered preliminary and need to be confirmed with more research .
" There have been studies done on testicular cancer , but ours is the first to look at marijuana , " said Daling .
Health.com : Dogs sniff out clues in the fight against cancer
Scientists believe that most cases of testicular cancer actually get their start in early fetal life .
Having an undescended testicle - a relatively common birth defect - a key risk factor for the disease .
There has been an increase in testicular cancers in the last half of the 20th century , however , which spurred the team to examine other factors that might explain the rise .
Marijuana use increased over the same period , and chronic use has been shown to affect sperm formation and fertility , they note .

Some experts say the association is a tenuous one , particularly because seminomas have increased 64 percent from 1973 to 1998 , while nonseminoma rates rose only 24 percent .
" These researchers have an association that they 've picked up on , but it 's a weak association , " said Steve Shoptaw , a professor in the department of family medicine and psychiatry at UCLA .
" Marijuana tends to be one of those firebrand issues were people can make statements to get airtime , so I 'd like to see these findings replicated . "

The authors note that nonseminoma rates did go up in a couple of places in the world in recent decades .
One is Norway and the other is the Netherlands , a country where cannabis use is tolerated .
The next step , said Daling , is to collect tumor tissue , evaluate it for marijuana receptors , and study how those relate to tumor development .

" Certainly we 're going to continue forward with this , " she added .
Without stronger proof , critics say the study should be taken with a grain of salt .
" There 's always been the thought that cannabinoids had some interaction with the reproductive systems , so maybe they 're onto something .
Who knows ? " said Shoptaw .
" But now we need to isolate the actual physiological responses . "
For patients using cannabis for medicinal purposes , the improvement in quality of life may outweigh any potential risk of testicular cancer , said Shoptaw .
" The bottom line is that I would not start warning my marijuana smokers that they are going to get testicular cancer , " he said .
" I do n't think there 's enough here to go forward with that message , at least not yet . "

All About Marijuana • Testicular Cancer
Imagine a drama where dreams never come true ; where the characters are real and venal and grasping and even those who wish to do good most frequently end up doing bad ; where even the best intentions lead to disaster and long - held hopes of redemption fade a little more every week .
Welcome to the world of Battlestar Galactica , America 's most depressing television drama .
That 's not to say that BSG is n't great .
It is .
It is dark and twisted and melancholy and frequently quite brilliant but it is also nearly impossible to get through without several strong drinks to numb the pain .
Take the opening episode of the second half of the show 's final season , which began three weeks ago .
At the end of the first half of season four of our intrepid band of pilots and politicians , Cylons and crew had finally achieved their long - cherished dream and made it back to the mythical planet Earth .
And , in a twist typical of this show 's dark vision , Earth turned out to be a complete dump .
Not a Wall - E style abandoned shell where regeneration might still be possible but a burnt - out husk of a planet where nothing would or could ever grow again .
It was n't simply abandoned – it was dead .
This depressing scenario established , we instantly picked up the final half of the season where we left off , waiting to see how our heroes and villains dealt with their discovery .
And the answer was … not very well .
We were treated to breakdowns and bewilderment , to rage and impotency , to an act of pyromania on behalf of Starbuck and to Dee 's devastating suicide .
It was this last act which serves to illustrate just how different BSG is from other shows .
Throughout the episode we watched Dee struggle to cope with the death of everything she had dreamed of .
We saw her contemplate life with Lee and ultimately decide that that life would never be the loving , equal pairing she hoped for , we saw her move inexorably towards the decision to take her life .
And it was unbelievably painful to watch .
Painful because Dee was one of BSG's few genuinely good characters certainly , but painful also because her actions , while shocking , were also entirely in character .
Watching her final moments you felt that she could truly conceive of no other way out and , perhaps more importantly , that her actions were terribly , movingly human .
Yes , there are other dramas that turn their spotlight on humanity in all its flawed glory : the bleak and bittersweet The Wire , the ambiguous The Shield , the darkness that lurks at the core of The Sopranos or Deadwood .
Yet great though all these shows are , none of them have BSG 's relentless refusal to temper or lighten the load .
The Wire gave Bubbles redemption and McNulty a rueful escape .
The Sopranos and Deadwood allowed wisecracks amid the carnage and even The Shield , whose ending has yet to air in the UK , has been known to show characters a way out of the mayhem and lies .
Not BSG .
Three episodes in and , in addition to suicides , breakdowns and a pervasive feeling of general despair , we now have mutiny , destruction and Saul and General Adama facing their own private Alamo .
" Trust no one " is Battlestar Galactica 's motto .
Well , either that or " No one here gets out alive " .
And that is the most interesting thing about this show .
Not since the sadly cancelled prison drama Buried or Peter Kominsky and Leigh Jackson 's brutal , brilliant war drama Warriors has a show been so determined to look at humanity 's flaws without flinching .
Yes , the end result is depressing and harrowing and seemingly determined to show us humanity at its venal , self - serving worst but the key to BSG 's brilliance is that it remains true to that vision , no matter how grim .
And that 's ultimately why America 's most depressing show is also among its very best .

The Trusted Computing Group ( TCG ) has released three final specifications for hardware - level data encryption , and virtually all the major storage manufacturers have declared that they intend to adopt the new standards in the near future .
Self - encrypted disks are already available on the market —
Seagate has been actively pushing its DriveTrust technology for several years — but there was no central standard for drive encryption developers to refer to .
The two new encryption standards provide a blueprint for desktop , laptops , and enterprise - level protection , while the third ( dubbed the Storage Interface Interactions Specification ) details how self - encrypted drives should interact with various communication protocols .
These new encryption methods do not require the presence of a Trusted Platform Module ( TPM ) , but it 's hard to imagine why an OEM would bother to build a system using self - encrypting hard drives and not include one .
The TCG expects self - encrypting drives ( and presumably TPM modules ) to become ubiquitous across the enterprise / business market over the next few years .
" With 48 states and many countries enforcing data protection laws , it has become crucial for enterprises to protect all data to avoid fines , lawsuits or even being put out of business .
Encryption with authentication directly in the drive or enterprise storage devices as outlined in the Trusted Computing Group specifications is one of the most effective ways to ensure data is secure against virtual and physical attacks , ” noted Jon Oltsik , senior analyst , Enterprise Strategy Group .
Expect future versions of consumer hardware to eventually adopt Opal ( TCG 's moniker for the desktop / laptop version of the standard ) as well .
" " This represents interoperability commitments from every disk drive maker on the planet , " Robert Thibadeau , chief technologist at Seagate Technology and chairman of the TCG , told Computer World .
" We 're protecting data at rest .
When a USB drive is unplugged , or when a laptop is powered down , or when an administrator pulls a drive from a server , it can't be brought back up and read without first giving a cryptographically - strong password .
If you do n't have that , it 's a brick .
You can't even sell it on eBay . "
Thibadeau 's last comment would seem to imply that the drive can't even be formatted or otherwise wiped without the requisite password .
If that 's actually true , it substantially diminishes the value of a stolen laptop , provided said machine is stolen for personal use rather than data theft .
Enterprise users and anyone with access to sensitive data obviously can't afford to ignore the possibility that someone might steal their system for the purposes of accessing the information it contains , but I rather think this is not the case .
The TPC reports that some 12,000 notebooks are lost / stolen in US airports , and only one - third are ever recovered by the rightful owner .
Unless you carry a laptop case with " BIG IMPORTANT SECRETS " embroidered on the side , the thefts are most likely aimed at the hardware , not the data on the hardware .
If the would - be thief knows in advance that he wo n't be able to use the system , the value of the laptop drops .
Manufacturers that have announced support for the new encryption standard include Fujitsu , Hitachi , Toshiba , Samsung , Seagate , and Western Digital .
Drive manufacturers will be able to choose between 128 - bit and 256 - bit AES encryption , which should prove adequate to protect the drive 's data even in situations where a TPM module is unavailable .
Combined with TPM , any data stored on the encrypted drive would be as secure as modern technology can make it .

Man dies after Taser jolt from San Jose police SAN JOSE
A man in his 20s died after a struggle with San Jose police during which he was jolted with a Taser , police said Thursday .
The man , whose name was not immediately released , died in the backyard of a home on the 2200 block of Amador Drive in east San Jose after being jolted with the stun gun , said Officer Enrique Garcia .
Police had chased him there after trying to detain him a short distance away .
They jolted him after a violent struggle in which they also clubbed him with batons , Garcia said .
An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death .
According to police watchdog groups , the death is the sixth to occur after the use of Tasers by San Jose police since 2004 .
1. The Simpsons head - box DVD sets
Starting with the sixth season of The Simpsons , Matt Groening and company offered up DVD sets encased in limited - edition " Simpsons Head " boxes , slick plastic shells modeled after the show 's stars .
( Season six was Homer , Season seven was Marge , and so forth . )
But as is so often the case with poorly designed packaging , whimsical form far outstripped functionality .
For one , the heads are extremely difficult to open , equivalent to cracking the seal on a jelly jar with grease - slicked fingers .
Once opened , they sprayed out a bunch of loose , unsecured material ( special - offer cards , an X - ray of Homer 's brain with a pencil jammed inside it , etc. ) .
And over time , the flimsy paper jacket covering the discs and keeping the liner notes in place inevitably fell apart .
The outrage over the Simpsons Heads was so strong that Groening set up a website where disgruntled buyers could exchange their heads for the boring old box packaging of the previous seasons .
But first , he castigated fans for failing to embrace his whimsical conceit .

2. The Herbie Hancock Box tower
Advertisement
Columbia 's vault - clearing Miles Davis CD sets established a high standard for jazz reissues .
A CD set dedicated to Herbie Hancock 's tenure on the label — during which he helped pioneer fusion , funk , and electronic music while still keeping one foot in his post - bop ' 60s past — was no exception .
And the packaging only added to the appeal .
Its four discs arrived in a clear plastic cube that made them appear to float in mid-air .
But problems began when purchasers actually tried to listen to the discs — they tended to fall out as soon as the box was opened , and it required Michael Jordan - esque levels of coordination to return them to their original positions .
As an objet d'art , The Herbie Hancock Box lived up to the material inside , but it made that material even more inaccessible than its subject 's wildest excursions .
3 . Fargo snow globes
Even the best VHS tapes made for unsatisfying viewing .
Even if they looked and sounded great ( which they almost never did ) , their clunky size and the way even minimal repeated use wore them out made them pretty damn uncollectible .
Nonetheless , studios kept trying to start a collectors ' market , often adding incentives for those who needed to watch , say , Cliffhanger at a moment 's notice , but remained too cheap to shell out for a laserdisc player .
In 1997 , Polygram cleverly marketed Fargo by selling the VHS packaged with a snow globe depicting a tiny Frances McDormand kneeling over a corpse in the snow .
A second globe , featuring the infamous wood - chipper scene , followed a bit later .
Great idea , but unfortunately , Polygram did n't bother to create particularly good snow globes .
The water turned yellow with exposure to light , leaving poor McDormand drowning in what appeared to be a sea of urine , a grimmer image than even the Coens imagined .
Worse yet , the things tended to leak over time , leading to " urine " - soaked tapes on store shelves .

4. Public Image Limited 's Metal Box canister
Advertisement
PiL 's second album continued John Lydon 's attempts to move beyond the punk of the Sex Pistols and toward something more abstract , and sometimes aggressively unmusical .
In keeping with that spirit , Metal Box was originally released on three 12 - inch 45s , and packaged in a film canister .
The hi- fi vinyl format suited the songs — " This is tactile music , " Trouser Press raved — but the canister itself proved problematic .
Aside from being difficult to file , Metal Box 's metal box dinged easily , making it tough to fit the records back inside .
Plus , the records themselves sometimes warped after spending time in the can .
After an initial run of 60,000 copies , Metal Box was reissued as a standard double album , and re-titled Second Edition .
The sound suffered , but not the storage .
5. Sex And The City 's thin -plastic DVD sets
Say this for the Sex And The City DVDs :
At least their makers had the courage to see a horribly botched conception all the way through .
The show 's six seasons ( including half - seasons at non-budget prices ) were all packaged in a transparent tinted plastic that , on the surface , cleverly mimics the suggestiveness of high - end lingerie .
But the plastic is as brittle as Sarah Jessica Parker 's heart :
After a few uses , the spine tends to break off on all the individual discs , leaving collectors to arrange the seasons in a series of color - coded piles .

6. Spectrum 's Soul Kiss ( Glide Divide ) oil - blister sleeve
Advertisement
Pete " Sonic Boom " Kember 's first post - Spacemen 3 full - length was a doozy , both sonically and in its limited - edition packaging : Soul Kiss ( Glide Divine ) came in a supposedly watertight PVC sleeve filled with a goopy mixture of colored oil and water .
It looked pretty great , except when it burst in transit and ruined the records around it .
Or when , years later , it dried up into a hard , crackly rock .
On top of that , getting the LP ( and presumably the CD ) out of the sleeve was tricky .
No album should require its own waterproof storage area .
7. Spiritualized 's Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space drug - themed containers
Advertisement
Sonic Boom 's Spacemen 3 partner , Jason " Spaceman " Pierce , has had plenty of goofy packaging ideas , too , but none more completely insane than for his masterwork , Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space .
He had to top the glow - in - the - dark plastic box of Pure Phase , so Pierce offered Ladies in various drug - related configurations .
The front cover was designed to look like a box of medicine , and Pierce took the idea even further :
You could get the single disc version in a special cardboard - and - foil package , so the CD popped out like a pill .
( And once you cut the aluminum , it would never be in mint condition again . )
That 's fine .
But for the super - limited version , Pierce took things even further :
The album was available on 12 individual 3 - inch CDs , all held together in a foil blister pack that looked like a box of pills .
Awesome idea , but horrible if you just want to listen to the record .

8. The Total Recall : Special Limited Edition DVD
Mars box
Advertisement
Paul Verhoeven 's 1990 Philip K. Dick adaptation is set on Mars .
Mars is round .
DVDs are round …
So why not package the disc in a Mars - shaped tin ?
Here 's why : Round objects do n't shelve well .
Artisan 's solution of resting the tin in a flimsy cardboard cradle did n't solve the problem .
Once the cardboard piece bent , tore , got lost , or got sat on , Arnold Schwarzenegger 's quest to bring a blue sky to Mars was free to roll under the couch .
9. Sting 's Soul Cages puzzlebox packaging
Back when Sting released his third solo album in 1991 , CDs were an affront to the environment :
They were not only housed in landfill - clogging , non-biodegradable jewel cases , they were also displayed in " longboxes " composed of cardboard sleeves three times the size of the actual product .
So tip of the hat to Sting - a - ling - ding - ding for trying to break the mold on The Soul Cages by fusing the two together in a more green - conscious way : Compressing the cardboard longbox into a multi-fold , biodegradable digipack for easy shelving .
Unfortunately , this opened the door for another bad packaging habit by forcing listeners to unfold gate after gate after gate to finally reach the CD .
And in this case , all that work yields little reward .

10 . The Durutti Column 's Return Of The Durutti Column sandpaper sleeve
Advertisement
One of the many ways Manchester 's Factory Records strove to set itself apart from the rest of the UK punk pack was with its record covers , which were often more like modernist art than commercial design .
The 1980 release The Return Of The Durutti Column was packaged in a jacket made of sandpaper , borrowing an idea from Guy Debord 's Situationist art - and - essay collection Mémoires .
Anything the cover touched — particularly the albums next to Return on the shelf — got scuffed , marred , or outright destroyed .
It was a clever , aggressively punk concept in theory , but obnoxious in practice .
11 . The Memento limited - edition DVD features barrier
Most complaints about the limited - edition double - disc Memento DVD have to do with its not - as - cool - as - it - sounds special - features menu , which requires users to correctly respond to a series of vague psychological tests in order to access goodies like a poster gallery and a chronological edit of the film .
( The tests are fun at first , but impractical and annoying in the long run . )
But just as bothersome is the actual DVD package : a fake case file on the movie 's protagonist , " Leonard Shelby . "
The box looks neat , but the papers in the file are packed so tightly that it 's difficult to remove the DVDs .
Tugging at the box causes the dossier to permanently loosen , letting the papers inside flop free .
Over time , the package degrades further — just like Leonard .

12 . The cassingle
Advertisement
As a music - delivery device , 7 - inch 45 - rpm singles were sublime .
They were cheap and portable , and people who bought them knew they were getting easy access to a song they already liked .
But when vinyl started to lag in popularity behind cassette tapes , the industry had to find some way to keep the singles market active , so they introduced the cassingle , which put all the molded plastic and tiny gears of a cassette tape to work on delivering two or three songs — or in some cases , only one , repeated on both sides .
Cassingles were easy to lose , easy to break , and — given that most were packaged in flimsy cardboard sleeves — tough to store .
The standard cassingle " storage case " was the floorboard of a car , between an empty plastic bottle and some stale french fries .
13 . Whatever : The '90s Pop & Culture Box 's coffee - top
Advertisement
To capture the essence of the '90s , Rhino packaged a decade - summarizing CD set in a box with a plastic cover sleeve containing actual coffee beans .
The coffee smell is strong — and persistent , lingering for years after the purchase — but the bigger problem with the box is that if the plastic cover gets breached , then beans and coffee dust spill all over the floor every time the set is touched or moved .
( Though come to think of it , the '90s were a time of powerful odors and inconvenient messes . )
14 . UNKLE 's War Stories " treasure chest "
The limited - edition version of UNKLE 's War Stories required the band to post instructions on how to open it .
We 'll let those instructions explain the calamity : 1 ) Pull the sides apart for about a minute to loosen up the outside package and let air in .
2 ) Grab the box with the sliding end facing away from you and shake it hard for a couple of minutes .
3 ) Once the inner case slides out a bit , grab it and pull .
4 ) Smile because you 've opened the new UNKLE treasure chest .
5 ) Put the CD in , turn up the volume , check out the artwork in the booklet and enjoy !
( Alternate suggested step five : Do n't kill us for making you ruin your expensive disc ! )

15 . Mad Men 's season - one DVD lighter box
Advertisement
Although it 's now available in a standard cardboard box , the original release of the hit AMC series Mad Men came in a metallic replica of a Zippo lighter bearing the show 's logo .
This was embarrassing enough on its own — it resembled a big novelty lighter from Spencer 's Gifts , or the nearest roadside Stuckey 's — but it also necessitated stacking the discs in a tiered foam holder that made it easy to scratch the playing surfaces .
Worst of all , it took the show 's lovingly crafted , precise evocation of the hard - drinking , chain - smoking world of early - '60s ad execs and swapped it out for cheesy novelty appeal .
Plus , it would n't even light your Lucky !
16 . The Strangers With Candy : The Complete Series Trapper Keeper
Advertisement
When Amy Sedaris ' cult hit Strangers With Candy was released in a series - spanning collection , the designers hit on the idea of making it look like a Trapper - Keeper , the ubiquitous high - school notebook binder of the 1980s .
It was a neat idea , perfectly suiting the afterschool - special - gone - horribly - wrong vibe of the surreal sitcom , and it allowed them to throw a bunch of jokes , photos , drawings , and quotes onto the interior of the package .
Unfortunately , for practical use , it was a mess :
The fuzzy Velcro tab used to close the package either did n't work or fell off , the discs were held loosely onto flimsy cardboard instead of sturdy plastic , and the whole package was angled like a binder , which meant that it did n't look right on a shelf , and could n't be stacked .
It soon became the laughingstock of Flatpoint High .
17 . Goddamn motherfucking security tape
The little strips of tape that seal the tops , corners , and edges of new CDs and DVDs have become , alongside airline food and car alarms , a favorite target of hacky standup comics .
But just because a lot of rotten comedians hate security tape does n't make it any less sucky .
Security tape has replaced the dreadful Blister - Pak as the single most infuriating development in the history of consumer packaging ; it 's incredibly difficult to remove , yet totally flimsy , so cheap that it comes apart in your fingers when you try to pull it off the product , but so tenacious that it often leaves the case permanently marred with glue residue that picks up dust and lint .
And in the case of DVDs where the inner paper sleeve is n't completely centered within the protective plastic , the security tape frequently attaches to the paper and rips it apart in chunks .
You know you 're dealing with truly epic bad packaging when it actually destroys the thing it 's meant to protect .
The crowning insult is that security tape is n't even necessary : it 's placed beneath an external layer of shrink - wrap that already prevents theft , and is often combined with a magnetic " screamer " on a product that usually costs no more than $ 20 in the first place .
There 's a special place in designer 's hell for whoever invented security tape ; there , he will forever shred his fingernails clawing through endless layers of his own creation .

18 . Kenny G CDs
The vast majority of CDs released by soft - jazz saxman Kenny Gorelick suffer from packaging that is , if anything , designed too well .
The jewel cases hold the discs firmly in place , preventing them from coming loose inside the case , where they can become scratched and unplayable .
If that is n't bad product design , we do n't know what is .

It ’s an oversimplification , but Maslow ’s Hierarchy of Needs says that you can figure out how people will behave by looking at their underlying needs .
Maslow believed a starving person would find food first , putting aside every other consideration , including social niceties .
Maslow ’s theory has its uses .
Yet most modern management experts and psychologists regard it with suspicion .
One obvious criticism is that the hierarchy does n’t take into account acts of selflessness , bravery , charity and heroism .
You might ask yourself why some German citizens hid Jews from the Nazis .
Or why starving soldiers in Japanese prisoner of war camps would give up their own food supplies to help the weak and dying .
But then most economists and biologists would also find what look like irrational acts hard to explain .
Painters starving in attics
Likewise , many of the best and most creative painters and poets – who Maslow would describe as self - actualising – were in fact starving in attics when they did their best work .
Where does Vincent van Gogh sit on the hierarchy of needs ?
And we can all think of examples of filmmakers , musicians and other artists whose creativity dried up when they hit the big time .
Years ago I worked as a music journalist .
I discovered that many rock bands would deliver a brilliant first album , score a huge contract , then wallow self - indulgently in the studio for album number two .
Many never got the opportunity to make a third record .
Jim Clemmer and Art MacNeil make an important criticism of Maslow ’s Hierarchy of Needs theory in their book “ Leadership skills for Every Manager ” ( ISBN 0861889630 ) .
The book is out of print .
But you may find a copy of it in a university library ( If you ’ve got it and no longer want it , get in touch with me ) .
Spiritual dimension
Clemmer and McNeil suggest that Manslow misses the point because he left people ’s spiritual dimension out of the picture .
They say that humans look for meaning in their lives .
That meaning transcends any animalistic drives .
In their words , “ even starving people are not immune to the lure of higher values . ”
Think about van Gogh .
A more scientific criticism was published in the 1977 edition of the learned journal , “ The Annual Review of Psychology ” .
Here , A.K. Korman , J.H. Greenhaus and I.J. Badin wrote that there ’s no empirical ( that is , researched ) evidence to support Maslow ’s ideas .
In fact , they argue the empirical evidence points in the opposite direction .
Other critics point out that Manslow came up with his theories after observing only a handful of people and it lacks scientific rigor .
We ’ll leave these debates for the academics .
The important thing about Maslow ’s idea is that it is a good , maybe crude , starting point for understanding what drives other people .
From our point of view , managing and motivating others , the Hierarchy of Needs is a useful template that sometimes , not always , helps to explain how and why people behave .

Study Says Home Wind Turbines Are Often Useless
January 15th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Before buying a small wind turbine for your roof , consider this : a recent British study claims that many home turbines generate only a fraction of what manufacturers promise , and some do n’t even generate enough power to run their own electronics .
The study , which was funded by the British Wind Energy Association , looked at turbines in four rural , 10 suburban , and 12 urban sites over the course of a year .
Many of the turbines in the study generated on average only 214 watt hours per day — less than five percent of a household ’s electricity .
Unfortunately for many homeowners , obstructions like trees and buildings often get in the way of accessing substantial wind power .
Turbines installed on buildings in exposed positions obviously have the best results .
Of course , there are still plenty of options for homeowners hoping to invest in renewable energy , including solar panels , which usually reap better results than home turbines .

The all time record for fatalities on Australian soil was set in 1942 , when Darwin was bombed by the Japanese .
So far it ’s been impossible to establish an exact toll from the fires , and the “ Hell ” fires are still raging .
Australian bushfires : 108 dead , murder charges likely Australia PM Kevin Rudd calls bushfires ' mass murder ' Firebugs in Australian Bush Fires Labeled Mass Murderers More Some people want to stay in the area , understandably enough , waiting for news of missing people or to be able to go back and check out the remains of their lives .
4000 people are now known to be in need of emergency assistance .
The community response has been quick and strong .
$ 7 million were donated around Australia over the weekend .
Corporate Australia was quick to pitch in , with communications giant Telstra contributing $ 500,000 alone .
Insurers state they ’re ready to assist all bushfire victims .
The Federal social security agency Centrelink has been authorized to make immediate cash payments to those in need .
In Federal Parliament , even the politicians were speechless .
Nobody wanted to talk , and for the first time since the Bali bombings , Question Time was canceled .
The Churchill fire , which killed 19 people , is now confirmed to have been deliberately lit .
Survivors of the fire sent in a lot of pictures which show how utterly the fires obliterated the areas they passed through .
Temperatures of bushfires have been known to hit the 800 - 1000C range .
Radiant heat from temperatures like that can kill people at a distance .
The first shot in the Daily Telegraph ’s As news , the fires took everyone by surprise .
The news sources were having trouble dealing with the changing situation , which was moving faster than they could publish .
Now , they ’re getting a lot more efficient , and whole web pages are being created with updates and mixed media .
The ABC , which was first on the scene with helicopter footage on the first day of the fires , ( which really did look like a scene from hell , miles of red landscape and smoke ) has also put together a

The street lights are on , and the scene extends to the hills some miles away .
From space , the smoke from the fires looks like a weather front .
The area covered by the long plume of smoke is about 150 miles long and 50 deep .
You can also see what we mean by “ drought ” .
The whole state is dry as dust .
The brown areas are supposed to be greener , and much patchier , with different types of growth .
The dark green areas are actual forests , and there ’s nothing much between them .

An amendment designed to protect Internet users from the anti-piracy lobby has been rejected by President Sarkozy of the European Council .
The rejection goes against the will of the European Parliament , where 88 % of the members already voted in favor of the amendment , which was originally destined to protect file - sharers from Internet disconnection under the ' 3 strikes ' framework .
When the European Parliament accepted the amendment this September , it did so to protect the rights and freedoms of Internet users .
This was much needed , as in recent years , anti-piracy lobby groups have called for tougher monitoring of Internet users and are actively working to erode their rights further .
The amendment , drafted by Guy Bono and other members of the European Parliament , was supposed to put a halt to the march of the anti-piracy lobby .
However , despite the fact that is was adopted by an overwhelming majority , with 573 parliament members voting in favor with just 74 rejections , the European Council went against this democratic vote .
In September , Bono stated in a response to the vote : “ You do not play with individual freedoms like that , ” going on to say that the French government should review its three - strikes law .
Sarkozy had other plans though , and in his position of President of the European Council , he convinced his friends this Thursday to reject the proposal .
The rejection also goes against conclusions from the EU culture ministers last week , who sided with the more balanced view of the European Commission , by encouraging copyright holders to work on offering “ high quality , accessible , easy to use and consumer friendly ” content online – instead of chasing pirates .
Guy Bono was appalled by the recent decision of the Council , which he referred to as “ an arrangement between friends . ”
Not all is lost though , the amendment might pass in January or February 2009 , when it will be proposed again .
However , as Bono noted , this initial rejection is likely to result in a negative image of European democracy .
It seems that the lobbying efforts of the MPAA , RIAA and others have paid off , and for France and other European member states the road to a ‘ three - strikes law ’ for alleged pirates is now wide open again .
In France , Sarkozy will now go forward with implementing his controversial three - strikes law .
We can only hope that other European countries wont follow this example .
What a great demokarzy Europe has .
The Kremlin 's rule is beginning to look much shakier than at any time since Vladimir Putin came to power , after a series of protests in cities across its vast landmass this weekend by Russians disgruntled about the economy .
And as the country starts to feel the effects of the global credit crunch , there are also signs of a growing rift between Prime Minister Putin , and his hand - picked successor as President , Dmitry Medvedev .
In Vladivostok , 2,000 protesters took to the streets , with some carrying banners reading " Kremlin , we are against you " , and other people chanting directly for the removal of Mr Putin .
The Pacific port city , seven time zones away from Moscow , has become a focal point for dissent after riot police broke up a march last year over car imports and detained 100 people .
Saturday 's demonstration , under the watchful eye of the police , passed off peacefully .
Nearly every major city had a street rally , and though most were low key , the unusual scale of dissatisfaction is likely to worry the authorities .
The Russian economy has been hit hard by falling oil prices , many oligarchs have seen billions of pounds wiped off the value of their shares , and ordinary Russians are feeling the pinch as factories struggle to stay afloat and companies lay off employees .

In Moscow , a motley band of communists , anarchists and liberals gathered at several points across the city to protest against Kremlin rule .
At one spot , a dozen protesters taped over their mouths with white tape , held up white placards with no slogans , and handed blank white flyers to passers - by .
Bemused by such a conceptual approach to protest , the police rounded them up and arrested them anyway , and the organiser got five days in prison .
Mr Putin has made several speeches blaming the economic chaos on America , and says he expects things to improve by the end of the year .
State - controlled television is playing down the crisis , and most newspapers are also toeing the Kremlin line , but the internet is a worrying medium for those in charge , and offers a forum for dissenters to exchange ideas .
Tiger , an acronym for The Society for Proactive Russian Citizens , is an online community of anti-government activists based across Russia 's 11 time zones .
Participants use the online forum to discuss how best to oppose the government .
Those involved estimate that about 10,000 people have signed up since last autumn .
" We 're waiting for warmer weather because it 's simply difficult to stay outside for long when it 's minus 20 , " said Maria Baranova , a 27 - year - old resident of Vladivostok active in the Tiger movement .
" But in the spring we plan to mount protests every weekend .
Before I got involved I never realised how many people are unhappy .
I can't believe that there are so many people living near me who are politically aware and saying smart things . "
While there are signs that the ripple of anger could turn into a tidal wave , few analysts expect street protests to have any chance of bringing down the government .
" There will be more unrest , but it will be localised , " says Dmitry Oreshkin , a political analyst in Moscow .
" There is not the organisational structure in place for anything more . "
But , says Mr Oreshkin , the business and political elite , who largely accepted the trade - off of political freedoms for the economic prosperity of the past few years , is becoming disillusioned .
" Two or three years ago , we could talk about the ' Putin Consensus ' among the elites .
Now that consensus has broken down .
The elites are better informed than the rest of the population , have more to lose , and understand just how bad things are . "
Mr Medvedev , who was swept into the Kremlin last year with the backing of Mr Putin , has begun to emerge as a more independent player .
He has criticised the government for failing to implement anti-crisis measures effectively , stating that only 30 per cent of measures had been put through and the government was working " more slowly than the current situation demands " .
Though he did not mention Mr Putin by name , the economy is traditionally the responsibility of the Prime Minister , and many commentators noted the water he was putting between the presidency and the premiership .
" Everyone serious knows that in six months , things will be catastrophically bad here , " says Mr Oreshkin .
" Medvedev is subtly trying to make it clear that the economy is Putin 's responsibility .
However well - disposed he is towards Putin , it 's very clear that the beginnings of a divide are there . "

The prospects : Grim , and getting grimmer
* Oil prices : Urals crude has slumped to $ 43 per barrel from a high of more than $ 150 last summer .
Russia 's 2009 budget is based on an oil price of $ 95 and will be in deficit if oil averages less than $ 70 this year .
* Currency reserves : During the boom in oil prices , Russia built up the third - largest currency reserves in the world .
But since August , more than $ 200bn has been spent defending the rouble , with reserves now standing at around $ 380bn and decreasing by the day .
* Rouble rate : Last summer , President Medvedev suggested the rouble would become a major world currency .
Now , the ailing rouble has lost 30 per cent of its value against the dollar and euro .
* Inflation : Officially , inflation for 2009 is forecast to be 13 per cent , but many expect the actual figure to be much higher .
* Unemployment : Unemployment grew grew by a quarter to nearly six million in 2008 , and , with the grim economic climate , could rocket higher this year .

The most recent NASA soap opera started with administrator Michael Griffin giving the incoming Obama transition team a hard time — coming from an engineering background Griffin ’s fear was that the Obama administration was going to gut the new moon rocket program .
To be fair to Griffin the program was way over budget ( so it looked like a good target ) and early in the campaign trail Obama sent mixed signals on his support for manned exploration .
The latest chapter was Griffin ’s wife sending out a sad email pleading his case to keep his job ( despite the fact that he is a Bush administration employee ) .
As a NASA fanboy I admit that I was fearing the worst :
But now the good news is that it turns out that Obama is dead serious about not only going back to the moon , but trying to beat China .
This story just came out on Friday when the press leaned that Obama was going to tear down the wall between NASA and the Pentagon .
At first I sort of winced at the idea of watering down NASA ’s mission — but it made me realize that Obama was dead serious about manned spaceflight a cause that I fully approve .
Now do n’t get me wrong : I ’m a big fan of international efforts — in fact the International Space Station could n’t exist without the support of Europe and Russia ( and so many other nations ) .
However the last time space exploration was sexy was the 60s during the space race — and ironically the communists proved that competition is a good thing .
The result of the space race was that within less than twenty years you got to watch the first satellite go into orbit and then just a short time later ( in the big picture ) you see man on the moon .
But sadly after the Apollo program manned space exploration has been stuck in time .
Thanks to Hubble we ’ve discovered more planets in the last ten years than the last thousand , but there ’s something very cool about humans getting off this damn rock .
In fact Stephen Hawking believes critical for humans to move off of planet Earth if we ’re to survive as a species in the long term .
But sadly since the 70s we have n’t done anything except to go into orbit and create a better version of Skylab .
Having a new space race is good because not only will it bring NASA back , but it will also encourage China ( and maybe India ! ) to accelerate their space programs .
My hope is that not only can this happen quickly within the next few years — but that it might get the world serious about going to Mars .
In fact my hope is that a return to the moon would be what it was advertised to be :
The first serious step in a Mars exploration program .
We 're already aware that the white - supremacist crowd is already creating a higher level of security concerns surrounding Barack Obama 's inauguration .
So somehow it probably figures that Sean Hannity 's old pal Hal Turner would be out there leading the parade of nutcases making threats around the events .
According to Mark Potok at the SPLC , Turner has gone public this week with his threats :
On Friday , neo - Nazi threatmeister Hal Turner , amplifying on an earlier posting suggesting that it would be a good thing to use an unmanned drone carrying explosives to attack the crowds , said a mass murder of those attending the festivities “ would be a public service . ”
“ I wo n’t say what may happen Tuesday but I will say this , ” Turner wrote on his blog .
“ After Tuesday , the name Hal Turner may live in infamy .
Let it be known that I saw what was necessary and decided to do what had to be done .
I make no apology to those affected or their families . ”
Earlier , on Jan. 11 , Turner had posted photos to his blog , under the headline “ My Inauguration Dream , ” of a small , unmanned drone , an electronic guidance system and sticks of dynamite as he laid out one method of attack .
He also discussed the possibility of sending up balloons filled with helium and a “ payload ” and fitted with fuses that would explode the balloons over the crowds .
And he displayed a grainy video that purported to show that method being tested .
“ Too far fetched ? ” Turner asks of a possible balloon attack .
“ It got tested and it worked ! …
Watch the video and imagine what payload , other than the index cards taped to the outside of the test balloons , might be substituted ?
HMMMMMM .
Might be something messy ?
Something contagious ?
Something deadly ?
Ahhhh , such possibilities ! ”
Then , last Thursday , he posted an update , saying : “ All the assets that need to be in - place for next week are now in - place ; deep within the security perimeter .
Everything is a ‘ go . ’
We have crossed the Rubicon ; let history judge us well . ”
Well , fortunately , Turner is not someone to take seriously , any more than gay - basher Fred Phelps .
He 's made numerous threats in the past , and all have been just so much gasbaggery .
Moreover , he has a nonexistent following , especially after it was revealed he had been doing federal - informant work , which pretty much destroys your cred in white - power circles .
Mind you , part of Turner 's schtick is planting a seed of doubt in the back of people 's minds .
That 's what he is doing when he says he hopes more to target the crowds than Obama himself .
Mind you , if you happen to see Turner this week in D.C. , you 'll want to steer clear .
Not because he really poses a threat , but just because he 's Hal Turner .
There was a time in the mid-nineties when geeky , awkward , “ alternative ” girls ruled the world .
I call them “ Lisa Loeb Girls ” ( or LLG for short ) ; named after the very cute and very talented singer / songwriter whose song “ Stay ” was on the “ Reality Bites ” soundtrack ( a good movie but a GREAT song ) .
They were really smart , really shy and really obsessed with art , music and books .
The nerdy glasses , the plaid skirts , the self - effacing irony – fuck me they were hot !
Where the hell did they go ?
Where are the Lisa Loeb Girls of today ?
All I see now are chicks with tramp stamps , belly shirts and “ fuck me ” hairdos ( sometimes referred to as slut stripes ) .
Trust me , I ’m fine with women trying to look like porn stars .
Bring it on !
But that ’s all I ’m seeing everywhere I go .
“ The Hills ” girls , “ The Rock of Love ” girls , “ A Double Shot of Love ” girls – all of them are skanks and could n’t hang for one second with my LLG .
[ And yes there is Tina Fey who is funny and great and is bringing that nerdy , alternative girl back , but she ’s not like Lisa Loeb .
Let ’s be honest .
Which would you rather have ?
A Lisa Loeb
Girl who writes a love song about how great you are in the sack or a Tina Fey Girl who uses your premature ejaculation as a comedy bit for her show ?
Yeah , that ’s what I thought . ]
LLG embraced their dorkiness and I love them for that .
They did n’t like what was trendy .
In fact , a lot of things they liked I ca n’t stand .
Have you ever sat in a coffeehouse all night drinking green tea and listening to a poetry slam ?
There are better ways of spending your time – like gouging your eyes out with a melon baller .
But that ’s okay because the Lisa Loeb Girls liked it , even though they acknowledged it was kinda lame .
And that ’s what made the LLG so attaractive .
They were n’t trying to be cool .
They were n’t trying to be hot .
They just were .
What you need to understand about a Lisa Loeb Girl is that once she got to know you and like you - she REALLY liked you .
And she would show it .
And that ’s way better than what the ho -bags of today have to offer .
All of these “ I wanna be really , really famous by any means necessary ” girls will only disappoint you in bed .
They only care about how they look while they ’re blowing you .
Lisa Loeb
Girls care only if you ’re enjoying yourself ( which of course , being naked with them , you are ) .
I miss the girls who shopped at the Salvation Army .
I miss the girls who carry around a well - worn notebook in their messenger bag to jot down lyrics or book ideas whenever they feel the inspiration .
I miss the girls who drink wine not to get fall down drunk but because they like the taste of alcohol when they make out with you .
Come back , LLG , come back .
As Lisa sang in “ Stay ” , “ Because I miss you . ”
Ben Casselman reports :
The indestructible " blue jobs " the energy industry crowed about earlier this month are quickly turning pink - as in pink slips .
Happy days ( AP ) Baker Hughes Inc. is cutting 1,500 employees , the Houston Chronicle reported this morning .
That 's nearly 4 % of the oilfield service company 's global workforce .
The move comes after similar announcements by larger rivals Schlumberger Ltd. which said last week it was laying off 5,000 workers around the worldand Halliburton Co. , which said Monday that it 's cutting an unspecified number of employees .
ConocoPhillips is also cutting 1,350 jobs .
The job cuts are n't hard to explain .
Oil prices have crashed from $ 145 a barrel last summer to about $ 45 today , and natural - gas prices are n't any better .
U.S. oil and gas producers are slashing spending at a furious pacethey 've laid down more than 500 drilling rigs since September , and analysts expect that many more to fall idle before activity hits bottom .
Those rigs , by the way , employed some 14,000 people , according to the Land Rig Newsletter .

The case against a man accused of drinking beer on his own stoop has been dismissed , but before you go cracking open a Pabst or a Brooklyn Lager in celebration , be warned — the case was dismissed on a technicality .
Yes , Kimber VanRy is no longer facing a $ 25 fine for the public drinking summons he received on Aug. 27 for gulping a Sierra Nevada on his front stoop , but Judge Eugene Schwartzwald dismissed the case on Tuesday morning only because it “ took too long ” to get the case to trial .
“ I ’m dismissing this on ‘ speedy trial ’ grounds , ” said the judge , using shorthand to refer to plantiffs ’ constitutional right to a prompt trial .
“ This has been going on too long . ”
Though he did not reveal how he might have ruled on the merits of the case , Schwartzwald did tell VanRy ’s lawyer , Tina Kansas , “ You did a nice job on the motion . ”
That motion conveyed the substance of VanRy ’s challenge to the portion of the city ’s open - container law that allows cops to write summonses for any drinking that is done in view of the public , even if the drinking itself is done on private property , such as a front stoop .
VanRy said he was drinking his Sierra Nevada on his Sterling Place front steps , far from the public sidewalk .
His summons set off a wide debate over that most iconic of Brooklyn public spaces : the stoop .
VanRy hoped that winning the case on the merits would forever prevent cops from ticketing people for a quiet beer on their private steps , so Tuesday ’s dismissal was a little unsatisfying .
“ It feels a little hollow , ” VanRy said .
“ This dismissal does n’t allow us to drink on the stoop , which was the purpose of this case . ”
It ’s unclear why the case took “ too long , ” as Schwartzwald said .
VanRy showed up for all his court appointments last fall and this winter , but the trials never took place , though reasons were never given .
Last week , the trial was scuttled when a judge took himself off the case because — in his words , not ours —
The Brooklyn Paper ’s coverage of the VanRy Affair has been “ too good . ”
“ I read about the case in your paper , ” said Jerome Kay , a Park Slope resident .
In the end , Brooklynites should not take VanRy ’s “ win ” as evidence that stoop drinking will be officially condoned by the NYPD , the successful Sierra Nevada lover said .
“ I ’m not sure I ’ll drink on my stoop , ” he said .

WASHINGTON , DC — The creation of the George W. Bush Presidential Library hit yet another snag this week , when Montana refused to issue a building permit .
This makes it the seventh state – after Utah , Oklahoma , Missouri , Virginia , West Virginia and Florida — to reject the President ’s proposed home for his administration ’s legacy .
WASHINGTON , DC — The creation of the George W. Bush Presidential Library hit yet another snag this week , when Montana refused to issue a building permit .
This makes it the seventh state – after Utah , Oklahoma , Missouri , Virginia , West Virginia and Florida — to reject the President ’s proposed home for his administration ’s legacy .
“ We could n’t wait to get rid of him after eight years , ” said a spokesperson for Montana ’s Office of Public Works , who asked to remain anonymous .
“ Why would we want a permanent reminder of his failed presidency in our backyard ? ”
In a conciliatory gesture , the Montana Senate voted to rename a landfill after the president , but rescinded the legislation after workers in the sanitation department threatened to walk out .
“ Montanans can live without a presidential library , ” said a legislative aide , “ but they need a place for their trash . ”
The Bush team ’s alternate plan to build the library on foreign soil has met with equally disappointing results .
Representatives for Kuwait have turned down requests from the administration to purchase real estate anywhere within its borders , as have Namibia , Pakistan , Great Britain , Lebanon , Greece , Holland , Bosnia , Zimbabwe and Taiwan .
Fearing a White House request might be forthcoming , the Palestinians have pleaded with Israel to quickly rebuild their settlements on all occupied territories .
“ This way , ” explained Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas , “ we can say to President Bush , ‘ We simply have no room for such a building . ' ”
The President said if a suitable location cannot be obtained , he will seek permission to share floor space in the library of his father , former President George Herbert Walker Bush , located on the West Campus of Texas A&M University .
In an Op - Ed piece in the New York Times , the 41st president expressed his reluctance , stating that it would be confusing to have a “ double Bush library . ”
“ For example , ” wrote the senior Bush , “ people might think that he was the one who served as Ambassador to the United Nations , or that I was the one who let those people in New Orleans suffer needlessly . ”
He added , “ A word of advice :
If you want your son to follow in your footsteps , give him a different name . ”
NASA has chimed in as an unlikely champion of the project , saying they would relish the opportunity to construct the Bush library as a test facility on Mars , making it the first structure built in the noxious and unbreathable atmosphere of the red planet .
“ We ’d love to see the president cut the ribbon on opening day , ” said an assistant NASA administrator .
“ We ’ll even provide the transportation . ”
The Obama administration , led by Geithner , is proposing a triage of bad ideas for troubled assets .
The Washington Post has the story in Bank Rescue Would Entail Triage for Troubled Assets .
The Obama administration 's emerging rescue plan for the banking system would amount to financial triage , with the Treasury Department playing the delicate role of deciding which of the trillions of dollars in troubled assets plaguing the economy to buy , guarantee or leave in the hands of banks , sources said .
The high - stakes approach would dramatically increase the investment of taxpayer money in the financial industry , and the potential losses .
The basic problem confronting the government is that banks hold large quantities of assets that they value on their books for much more than investors are willing to pay .
Banks cannot sell these assets without recording massive losses .
But holding the assets is tying up vast amounts of money , choking the financial system .
My Comment
Since the early days of the financial crisis , officials have struggled to unwind that knot .
If the government buys the assets at prices that banks consider fair , the Treasury would take a huge loss when it ultimately sells the assets for much less .
If , instead , the government insists on paying market prices , the banks may not survive their losses .
My Comment
Instead of taking a single approach , the Obama administration plans to divide assets and other loans into three categories , each with its own solution , according to sources familiar with the discussions , speaking on condition of anonymity because the details are not finalized .
The government would buy and hold on to those assets whose falling prices are putting banks under the most pressure .
Officials want to limit these purchases because of the vast expense .
The centerpiece of the plan would be a guarantee to limit losses on a second group of troubled assets that can be kept by the banks because they have more stable prices .
And it would allow banks to retain and profit from their healthiest assets .
My Comment
Beyond these initiatives , the government also is likely to inject more capital into troubled institutions .
My Comment :
The triage approach is a response to accounting rules .
When banks buy assets such as loans , they must specify for accounting purposes whether they plan to hold the asset until it is repaid in full or whether they might sell the asset earlier .
If the price of similar assets begins to fall , banks may be required to record a loss in value .
Those rules apply much more strictly to assets that a bank has said it may sell .
The government plans to focus on buying assets " available for sale " -- those assets whose values banks have already written down substantially , sources said .
Such assets are causing immediate problems for banks because they must set aside substantial amounts of capital to compensate for the losses recorded on their books .
My Comment
Assets " held to maturity " would remain with the companies , but the government would guarantee to limit any losses .
My Comment
Allowing institutions to hold those assets rather than selling them to the government would avoid a moment of reckoning because the banks will also be able to avoid acknowledging on their books the sharp declines in market prices .
Government officials argue the approach is better for banks and taxpayers because the price of many assets will eventually recover after the financial crisis passes , so there is no value in forcing the banks to record losses .
My Comment
Do n't Ask - Do n't Sell
The plan boils down to this : Do n't Ask - Do n't Sell .
Do n't Ask what the asset is worth .
Do n't Sell or you will find out and not like the result .
Joshua Rosner , a financial analyst at Graham Fisher , said in a recent research note that it makes no sense to accept the prices banks have assigned to assets as more accurate than the prices assigned by investors in the marketplace .
" I would argue that it is a thinly veiled attempt to prevent losses from being recognized and which will result in larger levels of ultimate losses , " he wrote .
My Comment
In November , the government agreed to limit Citigroup 's losses on a portfolio of $ 301 billion of troubled assets .
Last month , the government issued a similar guarantee to Bank of America covering $ 118 billion in troubled assets .
In both cases , the companies agreed to absorb an initial increment of losses -- about $ 30 billion for Citigroup and $ 10 billion for Bank of America -- with the government absorbing 90 percent of any subsequent losses .
To address public anger over the bailout , White House officials are set to detail today the restrictions that would be imposed on financial firms receiving what the government deems to be " exceptional " assistance .
A minority of recipients would fall into this category .
Such companies would be required to cap their executives ' pay at $ 500,000 , a source said .

An entire album ’s worth of Elliott Smith unfinished recordings and outtakes from From A Basement On The Hill has leaked .
I ’ll be talking more in depth about it ( and the glut of recent Elliott leaks , which are all totally awesome ) once I ’ve had the chance to absorb them , but given my love of Elliott ’s covers , it ’s amazing to find another one in this tracklist — a version of the Beatles ’ “ I ’ll Be Back . ” [ Correction :
The track was mislabeled and is not “ If I Fell ” ]
Elliott ’s version is faithful but ragged and noisy as most of the Basement leaks have been , a quality I wish had been more evident on the final version of the album .
It ’s among his best covers ; considering we ought to be scraping the bottom of the barrel of Elliott ’s posthumous material here , I can only marvel at the man ’s sheer talent and hope that someday other musicians will aspire to be this great .

Thieves have used explosives to blow up an ATM at a bank on Brisbane 's north side overnight and steal a quantity of cash .
The explosion at 4.30 am scattered debris throughout the bushes and car park surrounding the Bank of Queensland in Geebung , and left the machine a mess of wires and metal , unrecognisable as an ATM .
Police forensic officers are now scouring the surrounding area .
For quite some time I 've been wanting to put together a pluggable Django application for querying Yahoo !
BOSS .
In itself doing that is pretty trivial though , so the app needed to include some kind of special sauce to sweeten the deal .
I hope you 'll find the taste agreeable .
This is django - springsteen .
( Credit for the name goes entirely to Justin Lilly . )
springsteen provides a trivial wrapper for Yahoo !
BOSS , but goes further and provides a simple framework for building distributed search networks .
If you dream of a world where every blog network is searchable , and each niche has its own vertical search , then springsteen is for you .
Let 's start with some examples .
Querying BOSS for Web Results
springsteen has prebuilt views for searching Yahoo !
BOSS for web , images and news results , making this the simplest usecase .
from django.conf.urls .defaults import * from springsteen.views import web , images , news urlpatterns = patterns ( '' , ( r'^search / web /$ ' , web ) , ( r'^search / images /$ ' , images ) , ( r'^search / news / $ ' , news ) , )
Then navigate to http://yourproject.com/search/web/
( or / search / images / or / search / news / and you 'll immediately have a search page waiting for you .
The search results for Web -- as well as all implemented services -- are cached using the caching backend specified in your settings .py file .
The speed benefits of caching Yahoo !
BOSS may be fairly minimal , but for more exotic services ( and frequent searches ) the caching may become more of a feature .
To clean up the appearance override either the springsteen / base . html or springsteen / results .
html templates .
( You can also override the *_result . html templates to customize differerent result types . )
BOSS Results with Site Restrict
If you only want web results on a single site ( the poor man 's site search ) , you can subclass the springsteen . services .
Web class ( you could restrict news or images , by subclassing the springsteen . services .
News and springsteen.services .Images classes respectively ) .
First the subclassing .
from springsteen .
services import Web class DjangoProjectSearch ( Web ) : def __init__ ( self , query , params = {} ) : super ( Web , self ) .
__init__ ( query , params ) self .
params [ ' sites ' ] = ' djangoproject.com '
You can add other parameters as well , which are defined in the Yahoo !
BOSS documentation .
After writing your custom search , then write a view which uses it .
from springsteen.views import search from my_searches import DjangoProjectSearch def dp_search ( request , timeout = 2000 , max_count = 5 , \ services = ( DjangoProjectSearch , ) , extra_params = {} ) : return search ( request , timeout , max_count , services , extra_params )
Querying Multiple Services in Parallel
One of the frequent mistakes I 've made as a web developer is to make http requests sequentially when they could have been done concurrently .
springsteen aims to aggregate numerous search services , so it needs to be able to request and process them in parallel .
To perform concurrent requests simply specify multiple services .
( Note that the below values defined in settings are not standard , but you can put them in your settings.py if that 's how you like to organize globals . )
from django.conf import settings from springsteen .
services import Web , Images from springsteen.views import search def my_search ( request ) : timeout = settings .
SPRINGSTEEN_TIMEOUT
max_count = setttings .
SPRINGSTEEN_MAX_COUNT
services = ( Web , Images ) return search ( request , timeout , max_count , services )
By default results from services are stacked on one another .
For example , results from the above my_search would return all results from Images and then begin showing results from Web .
Ranking results is the hardest part of search , and springsteen wo n't solve that .
Instead it 'll give you the levers to do it yourself .
For most small scale situations it should be possible to write fairly concise ranking logic that is specific to the services you 're querying that will outperform any generic genius that springsteen might try to provide .
Exposing Results via a Springsteen Service
Because springsteen is all about aggregating search services , it will be gradually extended to understand new formats .
However , sometimes you just want to expose new data to springsteen , and have n't already decided on a format .
For those situations , you can use a Springsteen Service .
Cool name aside , they are about as simple as it gets .
Let 's imagine that you can somehow get search results in CSV format ( no it does n't make sense , it 's an example ) .
Perhaps your data looks like this :
title , url , text abc , http://yadayad/abc/ , some text here efg , http://yadayad/efg/ , some text here as well
and you have a function csv_search which returns relevant rows .
You could expose that via a Springsteen Service as follows .
from csv import DictReader from fake_web_service import csv_search from django.utils import simplejson from springsteen.views import service def retrieve_csv_results ( query , start , count ) : csv_results , total_results = csv_search ( query , start , count ) results = [ ] for line in DictReader ( csv_results ) : result = { ' title ' : line [ ' title ' ] , 'url ' : line [ ' url ' ] , ' text ' : line [ ' text ' ] , } results .
append ( result ) data = { ' total_results ' : total_results , ' results ' : results , } return simplejson .
dumps ( data ) def my_service ( request ) : return service ( request , retrieve_func = retrieve_csv_results )
At this point in time the only three acknowledged fields for a Springsteen Service are the above title , url and text .
As need arrises the standard may be fleshed out to accomodate additional metadata .
Rather than the hypothetical csv_search , you can use this approach to wrap Solango or Django - Sphinx results , as well as routing to non-Django apis or services in your ecosystem .
A Search API Repeater & Transformer
Let 's say you want to implement a site search api for your blog , but do n't have the " engineering resources " to integrate a solution like Solango or Django - Sphinx .
First we need to subclass
Web to get our site 's results .
from springsteen .services import Web class MySiteService ( Web ) : def __init__ ( self , query , params = {} ) : super ( Web , self ) .
__init__ ( query , params ) self .
params [ ' sites ' ] = ' lethain.com '
Then we need to expose the results .
from django.http import HttpResponse from springsteen.views import service from django.utils import simplejson from somewhere import MySiteService def retrieve_func ( query , start , count ) : params = { ' start ' : start , ' count ' : count } mss = MySiteService ( query , params ) mss . run ( ) results = mss .
results ( ) json = simplejson .
dumps ( results ) return HttpResponse ( json , mimetype = " application / json " )
Now the Yahoo !
BOSS results are transformed in the Springsteen Service format , and can be predictably queried by external springsteen searches .
Retrieving Results from Springsteen Service
Retrieving results from a Springsteen Service is simple , akin to retrieving Yahoo !
BOSS results .
from springsteen .
services import SpringsteenService , Web from springsteen.views import search class MyService ( SpringsteenService ) : _uri = " http://example.com/search/cvs/ " def my_search ( request , timeout = 2500 , max_count = 20 ) : services = ( MyService , Web ) return search ( request , timeout , max_count , services )
springsteen already knows how to display results from a Springsteen Service , so integration is rather concise .
Accessing a Custom Service
It 's always easiest when you can get partners to expose a service in the format you want ( in this case , a SpringsteenService ) , but sometimes you have to get in there and parse the data yourself .
In springsteen . services both the SpringsteenService and BossSearch classes provide examples of interfacing with different data formats .
The key point is to write a run method that retrieves results and converts them into a Python list of dictionaries .
If you want to render them with one of the existing template fragments ( web , news , image or springsteen results ) then you should add the corresponding value to the source key for each result 's dictionary .
def run ( self ) : stuff , total_results = get_results ( self .
query , self .
params ) results = simplejson .
loads ( stuff ) for result in results : result [ ' source ' ] = ' web ' self .
_results = results self .
total_results = total_results
Let me know if it proves challenging to follow the existing results , and I 'll gladly provide a complete walkthrough of subclassing Service and CachableService .
The Future of springsteen
At the moment the core of springsteen is nearly complete , I just need to refactor slightly to facilitate inserting custom ranking logic .
Beyond that , there are an infinite number of services that springsteen would like to know how to query and display .
There is a working example of both exposing data via a Springsteen Service as well as querying and aggregating results , and hopefully it'll be sufficiently composed for revealing by this upcoming Monday .
I hope that springsteen and its vision of distributed search by small - time players is something that you find exciting , I know I 'm excited about the prospect of creating targeted and relevant search boxes powered not by thousands of commodity servers in datacenters but instead by my vps , and yours .

Banks made $ 33.3 billion in 2016 from overdraft fees alone , according to The Wall Street Journal .
Combine that figure with other bank fees and you ’ll see how fast they can add up — and how much money you can waste on them .
Instead of allowing these financial institutions to keep your hard - earned cash , take the necessary steps to avoid paying fees altogether .
Find out what your bank tacks on to your account in fees and how to avoid paying those bank fees .
Common Bank Fees
Here ’s a list of the nine most common bank fees account holders pay .
To avoid these bank fees , consider opening an account with one of the best banks , which are often fee - free .
Review these fees to see if you ’re paying them unnecessarily :
Maintenance fees : Several banks charge a monthly maintenance fee just for having an account .
Bank of America charges $ 5 each month for the Bank of America Regular Savings account , but you can get the fee waived if you keep a minimum daily balance of $ 300 , link its Interest Checking account to your savings or sign up for the Preferred Rewards program .
Overdraft fees :
Also known as an insufficient funds fee , banks charge overdraft fees when you write a check or use your debit card for an amount that exceeds your account balance .
TD Bank charges its account holders $ 35 when they overdraw their accounts by $ 5 .
To get out of paying overdraft fees , opt out of overdraft protection at your bank — the transaction will be denied , but you wo n’t be charged .
In addition , you can always call your bank and ask for a “ waive fee ” — if you ’re a good customer , you might get it .
Wire transfer fees :
Whether you need to send or receive money through your bank , you ’ll likely be charged a wire transfer fee .
Sturdy Bank charges between $ 15 and $ 40 for wire transfers , depending on whether they ’re foreign or domestic .
Avoid this fee by using a different form of payment like PayPal or by sending a check .
ATM fees :
Most banks charge a non-network fee if you withdraw cash from another bank ’s ATM .
Comerica Bank , for example , charges $ 2 for transactions at non-Comerica ATMs .
Avoid using an out - of - network ATM or switch to a financial institution that gives you ATM rebates .
Alliant Credit Union , for example , will provide up to $ 20 each month in rebates for non-Alliant ATM fees .
Excessive savings account withdrawals fees : Savings accounts sometimes come with excessive withdrawal fees .
Chase Bank allows up to six withdrawals per month and any transactions that exceed that number incur a $ 5 fee .
To avoid paying the fee you must keep a $ 15,000 balance in your account .
Plan ahead so you do n’t make more than the allowed number of savings account transactions in a month .
Minimum balance fees :
When your account balance falls below the minimum amount set by your bank , you can be charged a fee .
Typically , that fee comes in the form of a monthly maintenance fee , which is waived as long as you do n’t go below the required minimum balance .
SunTrust ’s Balanced Banking account adds a $ 12 fee if your account falls below $ 3,000 at any time during the month .
If you do n’t think you can meet the minimum monthly requirement , look for a bank with no minimum demands .
Paper statement fees :
You ’ll likely pay a fee to get that all - important bank statement via mail .
TD
Bank keeps its charge low at $ 1 , but you can eliminate it entirely by going green and signing up for electronic statements .
Many financial institutions offer this kind of incentive , so check with yours .
Foreign transaction fees : Shopping in a foreign country with a U.S. debit or credit card can result in your bank charging you a foreign transaction fee .
Wells Fargo , for instance , charges 3 percent of your foreign transaction amount .
Some banks do n’t charge foreign transaction fees , so if you plan on going abroad , consider signing up for an account at a bank that does n’t .
Account closure fees :
Some financial institutions charge an early account closure fee .
PNC , for example , charges you $ 25 if you close your account within 180 days of opening .
The only way to avoid this fee is to wait until the designated period of time has passed — or stick with a bank that has no early termination fees .

How to Avoid Bank Fees
Once you understand how each of these fees works you ’ll be able to take measures to avoid them .
So if you ’re allowed six withdrawals and you ’ve already made four , you ’ll know you can make only two more before you have to pay a fee .
If you can , stick with fee - free banks .
Build an emergency fund you can use as a cushion to keep your bank accounts above the minimum requirements — and link that account to your checking to protect you from overdrafts .
Finally , monitor your bank account regularly and set up electronic alerts so you always know where you stand financially .

D is a systems programming language .
Its focus is on combining the power and high performance of C and C++ with the programmer productivity of modern languages like Ruby and Python .
Special attention is given to the needs of quality assurance , documentation , management , portability and reliability .
The D language is statically typed and compiles directly to machine code .
It 's multiparadigm , supporting many programming styles : imperative , object oriented , and metaprogramming .
It 's a member of the C syntax family , and its appearance is very similar to that of C ++.
For a quick comparison of the features , see this comparison of D with C , C++ , C# and Java .
D is not governed by a corporate agenda or any overarching theory of programming .
The needs and contributions of the D programming community form the direction it goes .
Multiple compilers exist for the D programming language , including the Digital Mars compiler ( dmd ) , the gnu compiler ( gdc ) , the upcoming ldc compiler , and even a . net D compiler is in the works .
They are all based on the same open source front end code .
dmd has an X86 code generator .
It currently targets Windows and Linux .
But now that the Mac is on X86 machines , it opens the possibility for a straightforward implementation of dmd on the Mac .
The only way to find out how feasible it is is to get a Mac and get to work on it .
Over Christmas I ordered a MacMini from Amazon .
Compiler development does n't require a powerful machine or lots of memory and / or disk space , so a low - end machine will do nicely .
I 've never used a Mac before , so I was also curious how the machine would work .
It did n't take long to get it up and running .
I keep spare keyboards and mice around ( because they break often ) , and plugged them in along with an old monitor .
The monitor and mouse worked perfectly , but the Mac had some trouble with the keyboard , and needed to be configured for it .
The machine comes with the gnu dev tools , though they needed to be installed separately .
I then figured out how to remotely connect to the Mac over the LAN , and ( the Mac people will hate me for this ) put the Mac in the basement and operate it remotely with a text window .
From a text window , the Mac is just another Unix machine .
I put all the source code to the compiler on it and set about trying to compile it .
Most of that consisted of finding all the conditional compilation :
# if linux
and changing it to :
# if linux || __APPLE__
Remarkably , there were very few API differences that needed to be accounted for , a couple gcc differences , and the compiler was running .
I thought I 'd start by assuming that the C ABI on the Mac was the same as for Linux , and configured dmd appropriately .
The first big problem is that dmd can generate both Intel OMF and ELF object file formats , but the Mac used the Mach - O format .
The best way to learn a file format is to write a dumper for it ( called " dumpobj " for object files ) .
Object file specs are usually wrong in some detail or other , and the mach - o spec is no exception .
The Mac comes with an object file dumper called otool .
Unfortunately , otool does n't give a clue as to the structure of the object file , nor will it disassemble any code that is not in a __text segment .
So I also got the Digital Mars disassembler , obj2asm , converted to work with mach - o files .
Fortunately , the Mac uses Dwarf for its symbolic debug information format , and dmd has a Dwarf generator , so that should be good to go .
But when I first looked at the debug output of gcc , there was a " macinfo " section .
Uh - oh , some undocumented Macintosh enhancement .
Googling ( how indispensible google has become ) " macinfo " revealed my mistake -- I had forgotten that Dwarf had a special section for information on C preprocessing macros called " macinfo " .
I forgot about it because D does n't have a text macro preprocessor .
Object files on the Mac are all generated as pic ( Position Independent Code ) , necessary so that shared libraries will work .
On Linux , pic is an option .
Pic is done completely differently on the Mac , so this was where most of the work was so far .
Some other differences :
Names get an ' _ ' prepended to them , although when using gdb you have to leave off the '_ ' .
There 's no thread local storage mechanism in the object file format .
This is a serious shortcoming , and I 'll have to figure out a solution .
There are special sections for C strings and read - only literals that the linker can compress redundancy out of .
I finally got to the point where dmd would compile " hello world " and using dumpobj to compare object files with that produced by gcc for the C " hello world " , it looked like it should work .
The gcc one worked fine , and the dmd generated one crashed with a segmentation fault .
I was really pulling what few strands of hair I had left out over that one , as I could not find anything wrong with the fixups or object layout .
Eventually , I noticed that the gcc version was putting some unneeded space on the stack , and I suspected something was up .
Put out the same extra stack , and it started working .
Googling around some more , I discovered that code on the Mac that calls any library functions must align the stack to 16 bytes .
Tweaking the code generator to do this , now I had " hello world " working in D on the Mac .
It Works -- Sort Of
I had " hello world " working , but I was using D as a C compiler to do it .
All that existed was a main ( ) function .
There was a long way to go -- functions , data , the runtime library , the test suite , etc .
First I 'd try and build the runtime library .
Doing so exposed a lot of conditional compilation issues that had no case for OSX .
I found that Linux has a bunch of API functions that are missing in OSX , like getline and getdelim , so some of the library functionality had to revert to more generic code for OSX .
I had to be careful , because although many system macros had the same functionality and spelling , they had different expansions .
Getting these wrong would cause some mysterious behavior , indeed .
After compiling the library modules , they had to be combined into a library file .
Normally this is just done with ar , the standard " archive " program , but dmd has a nice feature where it can build the library directly without having to write object files out to disk .
Not only is this very fast , but it makes the build process simpler by obviating the need to manage the object files .
The archive file format is supposed to be a standard , but of course everyone implements it very differently .
The OSX archive format spec is only about half there , and what is there is wrong on a few details .
This is where building a file dumper again comes in real handy .
By varying the input to ar , dumping the resulting archive , and seeing how things change , one eventually figures out the format .
If you get it wrong , the OSX linker ld likes to help you out with a convenient " Bus error " message .
To figure those out , it 's back to puzzling out the hex dumps of the archive dmd generated against the one ar generated .
I did finally figure it out ; the archive format has some definite oddities like entries are aligned on 4 - byte boundaries but the object file within each entry must be aligned on 8 - byte boundaries , offset by 4 .
Weird .
Anyhow , once that was working and the linker accepted the archive , it was very pleasing to see how fast dmd would chew through the code and build the library .
Unfortunately , none of the library code ran , and I mean none of it .
When the compiler was originally designed , I attempted to do the right thing and abstract away the memory model and the object file format .
Because I had only one example , the abstraction lines turned out to be in all the wrong places .
I coined the term " premature abstraction " , which , like the related term premature optimization , is coming up with all the wrong abstractions because you do n't know what you 're doing .
( Andrei Alexandrescu suggested I write a column about that , but a quick google search showed I was not original and the term is already in use ! )
For example , the data structures being written out were divided into mutable and immutable sections , the immutable stuff being destined for a read - only hardware protected memory section .
But on OSX , read only data sections get marked as " TEXT " and put in with the code , where they are expected to be position independent .
Position independence means no relocations are possible at program load time , meaning the read only data cannot have any pointers in it .
If there was a relocation in the TEXT section , the loader did n't complain , you just wound up with garbage for a pointer .
So , all the data structure generating code had to be carefully gone through and separated into " has pointers " and " no pointers " blocks , and the " has pointers " stuff gets routed to the regular mutable data segment .
Another tricky problem with position independent code on OSX is the way data variables are accessed .
If they are defined within the module they are referenced in , one indirection is generated .
If defined externally , two are necessary .
The trouble is , the D programming language allows forward references to data , so there 's a chicken - and - egg problem in deciding what to resolve first .
The last problem is D needs to generate some tables that are coalesced with other tables , such as the exception handling data .
To group stuff together , it is put in a specially named segment .
The problem is locating the beginning and end of that segment at run time .
The solution is a trick I learned long ago in the DOS world -- to always put out that special segment as a trio of 3 , always in the same order .
The linker thankfully will then maintain the same order in the executable , so to find the beginning of the second segment , a global variable is put in the first and third segments , and the addresses of those globals neatly bracket the table in the second segment .
This is the way I 'm going to try and do thread local storage , too .
Now that dmd is generating three very different object file formats , where the abstraction lines should be is a lot clearer .
Finally , tonight , I got the runtime to start up , run , and shut down successfully .
Next , I 'll try to get the test suite to run .
It Works !
The short version -- it 's done and out !
I had thought retargeting the D programming language to the Mac was just an object file format change -- a week , maybe two .
It turned out to be six weeks .
I feel like Yosemite Sam walking through a mine field , managing to step on every single mine in it .
So let 's pick up where I left off at the end of my last entry , where I had just gotten the library to compile and a couple sample pieces of code to link to it and run .
Now it was time to run the test suite .
It 's essentially impossible to develop a compiler without some sort of test suite .
The one I use is an ad - hoc collection of every fixed bug and other assortments of things .
The beauty of putting in every fixed bug is that the bugs stay fixed , and the quality of the compiler steadily ratchets forward .
Over time , this makes for a formidable test suite .
If it passes the suite , I know it 's at least as good as the previous version , and if it shows to not be , that failing gets added to the suite for next time .
( I 've discovered that just throwing volumes of code at the compiler is fairly useless as a test suite .
The test code has to be crafted to test specific things and verify correct results . )
The first thing that failed was exception handling .
But surprisingly , it only took me about an hour to get that to work .
Exception handling is complicated and hard to understand , and I expected a tough slog .
The EH design in the back end dates back to when it was a 16 - bit compiler ( Digital Mars C++ was the only C++ compiler to ever implement exception handling on DOS ) .
The support code moved to 32 bit DOS extenders , then Linux , and now OSX with very little change .
The OSX support needed to tweak the assembler bits to keep the stack 16 - byte aligned .
( Exception handling for Win32 is completely different , using Microsoft 's Structured Exception Handling scheme . )
The dmd exception handling system is completely independent of g++'s .
The two do not interact with each other .
D is binary compatible with C++ name mangling and single inheritance , and g++ on OSX uses the same protocol for this as on Linux which dmd is already compatible with , so that was easy .
My next problem was the floating point failed miserably .
Some investigation showed that , uniquely , OSX aligns the CPU 's 10 - byte reals on 16 - byte boundaries .
This is 6 bytes of pad for each .
I do n't know the reason for this ; Linux uses 12 and Win32 uses 10 .
It 's just that if you have large arrays of reals , it 's going to chew up 60 % more space .
Oh well , it was easy to account for in the code generation .
The worst problem I had was my own fault .
The front end is only few years old .
But the back end code generator is about 25 years old ( it may be the oldest code generator still in professional use ! ) .
Although it is well debugged ( sporting a thorough test suite ) , fast , and generates great code , it uses a lot of global variables to communicate .
Problem after problem was traced back to the use of global variables .
Over time I 'd eliminated a lot of them , but there 's a lot left .
It 's hard to change how a function works if there 's a back channel of globals passing state around .
Globals break encapsulation , making code difficult to understand .
Of course I would n't write it that way today , hopefully I 've learned something in the last 25 years .
You might ask " why not just rewrite it " and certainly that thought comes to mind .
The problem is a code generator is about a zillion special cases , most of which interact with each other .
Getting that all adjusted , tweaked and working right across the broad spectrum of code that it must generate is years of work .
It 's not something you throw away and rewrite lightly .
But there is some hope .
The Mach - O generating part is a lot nicer than the Elf generating part , which itself is much nicer than the very old OMF generator .
And if I 'm doing open heart surgery on a particular section , I 'll refactor it and rely on the test suite to make sure the patient recovers .

Rather this is news about Tweets , whereof the BBC declared there was a Tweet smell of success over Digg .
Use of Twitter , the mobile phone - based micro-blogging service , rocketed nearly 1,000 % in the UK over the past year , according to industry analysts HitWise .
For the first time , the site has seen more visits than “ social bookmarking ” site Digg , which allows users to share links to sites .
Now the journalists and politicians are beginning to ask To tweet , or not to tweet ?
Apparently almost anything goes on Twitter .
What are socially acceptable rules for when — or when not — to use Twitter at all ?
Case in point : President Obama met in a “ closed door ” session with House Republicans this week .
The press was not invited in order to allow the president and congressmen to have a frank conversation outside the glare of media scrutiny .
But Republican U.S. Rep. Pete Hoekstra twittered his impressions of the president ’s presentation in real time .
Was that OK ?
Let ’s be clear this is not a fringe activity .
According to Mathew Ingram , The Reuters editor - in - chief now Twitters .
David Schlesinger , Reuters News , has a fascinating post up at his blog , Full Disclosure — a fitting title , given the topic of the post .
Schlesinger writes about how he has been Twittering from the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland and how his Twitter messages ( or “ tweets , ” as people insist on calling them ) actually beat his own wire service , as described in a post at Silicon Alley Insider .

It took 35 years .
The New York Legislature finally seems poised to overturn the infamous Rockefeller drug laws .
The impending change comes too late for the tens of thousands of low - level , nonviolent drug offenders who wasted away in prison because of mandatory sentencing policies when they should have been given treatment and leniency .
But after years of building support for reform , legislative leaders now have it within their power to make wholesale changes in this profoundly destructive law .
The Rockefeller laws tied the hands of judges by requiring lengthy prison terms even for first - time offenders .
Essentially , the law allowed prosecutors to decide who went to jail and for how long .
The system , which has been imitated throughout the country , filled the jails to bursting , while doing nothing to curb the drug trade .
The law has been especially disastrous for black and Latino offenders , who represent the overwhelming majority of those held in state prison for drug offenses .
The Assembly speaker , Sheldon Silver , made just that point last week when he criticized a state commission that had been appointed to study the reform issue .
The commission , which appears to have been dominated by prosecutors , called for more rational sentencing guidelines and allowing judges to send more offenders to treatment instead of prison .
But it failed to get to the heart of the matter , which is a full restoration of judicial discretion .
Mr. Silver , who has favored reform for many years , described the panel ’s report as “ a missed opportunity ” and signaled his intent to push for legislation that would eliminate mandatory sentencing for low - level , nonviolent drug crimes and expand judicial authority .
Real reform “ means untying the hands of our judiciary , ” he noted , “ and placing emphasis on probation , alternatives to incarceration and treatment . ”

Energy - guzzling flatscreen plasma televisions will soon be banned as part of the battle against climate change , ministers have revealed .
“ Minimum - energy performance standards ” for televisions are expected to be agreed across Europe this spring , they say , and this should lead to “ phasing out the most inefficient TVs ” .
At the same time , a compulsory labelling system will be drawn up to identify the best and worst devices .
The moves , which follow last week 's withdrawal of the 100W incandescent lightbulb , are part of a drive to slow the rapid growth of electricity consumption in homes by phasing out wasteful devices and introducing more efficient ones .
Giant plasma televisions can consume four times as much energy as traditional TVs that used cathode ray tubes ( CRTs ) .
The number of televisions in homes , together with other electrical devices such as computers , scanners and coffee - makers , has also grown rapidly ; there are now 60 million of them , one for every person in the country .
The amount of power needed to run this electronic explosion has more than doubled in the same period , and the official Energy Savings Trust estimates that it will grow by another 12 per cent over the next four years .
Different makes and models of television vary in their use of power , but a 42in plasma television may use some 822 kilowatt hours a year , compared to 350kWh by an LCD flat screen of the same size .
A 32in CRT , the biggest available , would use 322kWh .
Now governments are finalising a mandatory EU regulation to set minimum standards for TVs .
The worst performers will be phased out , and the rest will have to be labelled with energy ratings .
The scheme is modelled on an existing one for white goods which has greatly increased their efficiency .

U.S. - based explorers who say they have found a legendary warship may be in for tug - of - war with the British government , which claims the wreck is its property .
Odyssey Marine Exploration announced Monday that it has found the wreck HMS Victory , a warship that sank in the English Channel 265 years ago .
The 175 - foot tall sailing ship was the largest and most heavily armed of its day .
It was the inspiration for the HMS Victory famously commanded by Adm. Horatio Nelson decades later .
" This is a big one , just because of the history , " Greg Stemm , Odyssey 's co-founder told the Associated Press .
" Very rarely do you solve an age - old mystery like this . "
The ship has 110 brass cannons , of which the Odyssey team has already salvaged two , Stemm said .
The explorers estimate the wreck also houses 3.6 tonnes of gold , but say they have n't recovered any of it .
Stemm said he did not want to specify where his team found the ship , for fear of attracting plunderers .
" We found this more than [ 80 kilometres ] from where anybody would have thought it went down , " Stemm said .
Federal court records filed by Odyssey in Tampa seeking the exclusive salvage rights said the site is 40 to 65 kilometres from the English coast , outside of its territorial waters .
Consent required before ' intrusive action '
But the British government has not confirmed whether it will work with the explorers .
" Assuming the wreck is indeed that of a British warship , her remains are sovereign immune , " a spokesman said on condition of anonymity in keeping with government policy .
" This means that no intrusive action may be taken without the express consent of the United Kingdom . "
The whereabouts of the wreck had long been debated after the Victory sank without a trace somewhere off the coast of the island of Alderney after it got separated from the rest of its fleet .
The ship went down with some 1,100 - odd crew members as it returned to England after a naval battle with a French fleet .
The belief that the Victory had crashed onto the rocks had marred an otherwise exemplary service record of the ship 's commander , Sir John Balchin .
A lighthouse keeper on Alderney also suffered a black mark on his reputation after he was prosecuted for failing to keep the light on .
Odyssey believes the discovery exonerates both men .
Odyssey has a history of finding lucrative wrecks , sometimes running into trouble in the process .
The company successfully negotiated a haul of over $ 600 million taken from the wreck of the HMS Sussex with the British government in 2007 .
Also in 2007 , Odyssey uncovered another shipwreck in the Atlantic laden with 15 tonnes of gold .
But the Spanish government sued the company , saying the gold taken from the wreck was Spanish property .
That case is still pending .
Here 's something that I am surprised is not already in the Python standard library : a simple module to generate and assemble HTML fragments ( or if you prefer , general XML fragments ) , up to and including full HTML pages .
I find it especially surprising because not only is this something that a lot of people wind up needing to do sooner or later ( consider generating error pages from inside a simple CGI program ) , but there 's even a very common simple model for it that everyone seems to write their own version of :
from html import * page = HTML ( HEAD ( TITLE ( " Qwerty " ) ) , BODY ( H1 ( " Qwerty 's page " ) , P ( " Some text goes here . " ) ) ) print page
( Details often vary considerably beyond the basic idea of nested objects with optional keyword arguments as the properties of the element . )
Now , you can argue that this is so simple to implement from scratch that it does n't need to be in the standard library , but I have two replies .
First , doing a good implementation is more work than it looks ( consider quoting of bare strings and the Unicode issues , for example ) , and second , if lots of people are going to do it themselves , it makes sense to save everyone the effort and put a single quality implementation in the standard library .
Possibly the Python people consider this a terrible pattern to follow once you start getting beyond the very basics and think that there is a much superior interface .
If so , it would be nice if an implementation of the better version was in the standard library ; as it is , as far as I can tell there 's absolutely nothing that will do this at all , although there are a number of things that will parse HTML and XML .
( It is possible that a simple HTML builder is hiding somewhere in the depths of the standard XML modules .
In my defense , I will note that it 's not obvious from skimming the library documentation and XML is not where I naturally look for ' simple ' . )
Sidebar : pointers to some relevant resources
HTML : EasyTags , one of the Perl versions of the same basic idea .
Perl 's implementation probably came first .
( HTML : : LoL is another interesting take on the overall idea . )
XIST , which among many other features can do this .
But it looks like a very big package , which brings up certain issues if I install it myself .
markup.py is a single Python file and so easy to drop into a project , but it seems to not be intended to let you generate HTML fragments ; instead you have to generate all of the HTML page in the proper sequence , which I find confining .
And hopefully I have missed something obvious in the standard library ; if so , and if I find out about it , I 'll add a note here .
Tensions have exploded between Air - O - Matic , Inc. and InfoMedia , Inc. , two of the hottest names in iPhone flatulence .
Air - O - Matic , maker of " Pull My Finger , " has complained to Apple , threatened to sue its competitor over " iFart Mobile , " and demanded monetary compensation , so InfoMedia is responding via the courts .
At the center of this combustible situation ?
A trademark Air -O - Matic was awarded for the phrase " pull my finger . "
Air - O - Matic 's Pull My Finger and InfoMedia 's iFart Mobile both quickly stank up the charts in Apple 's App Store last December when the iPhone maker finally relented and opened up to such apps .
Although iFart Mobile enjoyed a massive sales surge of over 100,000 copies in its first 14 days , iFart Mobile still maintains the number 11 spot in the App Store 's Entertainment category .
Air -O - Matic complained to Apple and InfoMedia that its competitor was using unfair business practices , such as spamming Twitter users , gaming Google , and tooting its own horn with overtly glowing reviews on the iTunes Store .
Air - O - Matic eventually demanded $ 50,000 after estimating its losses from InfoMedia 's practices , then threatened to sue over InfoMedia 's use of its silent - but - deadly ace in the hole : a trademark it filed for in December 2008 on the phrase " pull my finger " in relation to " computer application software for mobile phones . "
InfoMedia used the phrase in promotional video titles and even its initial press release , though " pull my finger " linked to iFart Mobile .
Air - O - Matic complained early on and InfoMedia agreed to change the press release 's language " as a matter of good will . "
After tiring of the threats , InfoMedia has filed a lawsuit ( PDF ) in federal court .
Across eight pages that include descriptions of the origin of the " pull my finger " colloquialism , InfoMedia attempts to preempt an Air - O - Matic lawsuit by arguing that the phrase is common slang and not eligible for trademarking .
To conclude , InfoMedia says that its use of the phrase — despite its goodwill change of language in its press release — qualifies as fair use .
The company seeks a declaratory judgement that its use of " pull my finger " is lawful and does not infringe on any rights that Air - O - Matic might have .
Naturally , it is also seeking attorney fees and other typical costs .
You may not believe it , but fart tools are among the largest categories of iPhone apps .
In fact , outside of games — the most popular apps — fart apps may very well take the lead .
A quick search for " fart " in the App Store produced well over 100 results .
Other categories with high " me too " ratios pale by comparison , such as flashlight apps ( 50 ) and tip calculators ( 80 ) , and while " bible " yields over 170 results , each of these categories contain quite a few false positives .
Whether or not InfoMedia is successful in nullifying Air - O - Matic 's flatulent trademark or it eventually has to pay up , the situation highlights yet again a number of App Store growing pains that Apple has been slow to acknowledge and act upon .
Developers have raised questions about Apple 's App Store schizophrenia , and concerns over ambiguous censorship rules have not subsided since Apple opened the flood gates in December to apps that were previously rejected on various grounds of indecency or " duplicating existing functionality . "
It should come as no surprise that the riffraff Apple finally allowed into its walled garden are raising quite the stink .
Obama : Wall Street ' Arrogance and Greed ' Wo n't Be Tolerated
Says Administration Will Crack Down on Banks ' Executive Bonuses
President Obama , usually cool , was visibly angry in his weekly address , chastising corporate bankers for the second time this week for accepting taxpayer bailout money and then doling out $ 18 billion in bonuses .
" The American people will not excuse or tolerate such arrogance and greed , " Obama said in the video and radio message released today .
" Even as they petitioned for taxpayer assistance , Wall Street firms shamefully paid out nearly $ 20 billion in bonuses for 2008 . "
Administration officials challenged a report in The Washington Post that suggested Obama was unlikely to tighten restrictions on compensation for banks that accept bailout funds , saying the report was " simply untrue . "
White House and Treasury officials said the president will soon crack down on those big bonuses , shareholder enrichment and overall accountability .
Banking executives have long argued that they need to pay bonuses to retain quality executives .
This week , ABC News asked all 26 banks that have received $ 1 billion or more in bailout funds if they gave executive bonuses for 2008 .
Of the 21 that responded , 19 indicated they 've either paid bonuses , or might still .
Yet government strings come at a cost .
Several healthy banks have recently declined money from the bailout fund aimed at persuading them to loosen credit and foster lending to boost the economy .
Rick Adams , executive vice president of United Bankshares Inc. of Charleston , W.Va. , told ABC News the bank has declined $ 197 million in government funds in order to keep the government out of the boardroom , citing the government 's ability to change the rules unilaterally and limit dividends , which have increased at the bank for 35 consecutive years .
" That was one of the factors , " Adams said .
" We 're in a position to weather the tough times ... but the terms of the conditions was also a factor . "
Nevertheless , the laments of bankers have been pilloried on Capitol Hill .
" We have a bunch of idiots on Wall Street that are kicking sand in the face of the American taxpayer , " Sen .
Claire McCaskill , D - Mo. , said Friday on the Senate floor .
Wall Street greed has been panned on late night television , as when Jay Leno recently lampooned former Merrill Lynch and Bank of America executive John Thain , who spent $ 1.2 million redecorating his office .
" Then he gave billions of dollars to former Merrill Lynch employees , " Leno said , deadpan .
" They 're calling this the biggest Wall Street scandal since Friday . "
Banking excess has been lamented in the labor movement .
" Giving themselves $ 20 billion for the worst year we 've had sine 1929 flies in the face of anything that make sense , " Richard Trumka , secretary - treasurer of the AFL - CIO labor union , told ABC News .
Trumka says excessive executive compensation contributed to the risk - taking that caused the collapse of the financial industry .
With executive bonuses tied to revenue , he said , executives were encouraged to take bigger risks – in particular on housing loans for risky borrowers who later defaulted .
" All of that contributed to the collapse , " Trumka said .
" We need to rein that in .
We need to reregulate them and we need to arm investors with the tools to be able to control companies and manage this risk so investors do n't get hurt in the long term . "
Perception is mathematically impossible .
This might seem like a bold statement — after all , you are perceiving these letters right now — but it ’s nonetheless true .
Imagine a black - and - white line drawing of a cube on a sheet of paper .
Although this drawing looks to us like a picture of a cube , there are actually an infinity of other three - dimensional figures that could have produced the same set of lines when collapsed on the page .
But we do n't notice any of these alternatives .
Happily for all of us , our visual systems have more to go on than just bare perceptual input .
They use heuristics and short cuts , based on the physics and statistics of the natural world , to make the “ best guesses ” about the nature of reality .
Just as we interpret a two - dimensional drawing as representing a three - dimensional object , we interpret the two - dimensional visual input of a real scene as indicating a three - dimensional world .
Our perceptual system makes this inference automatically , using educated guesses to fill in the gaps and make perception possible .
It turns out that our brains use the same intelligent guessing process to reconstruct the past , in addition to using it help perceive the world .
Memory itself is not like a video - recording , with a moment - by - moment sensory image .
In fact , it ’s more like a puzzle : we piece together our memories , based on both what we actually remember and what seems most likely given our knowledge of the world .
Just as we make educated guesses in perception , our minds ’ best educated guesses help “ fill in the gaps ” of memory , reconstructing the most plausible picture of what happened in our past .
The most striking demonstration of the minds ’ guessing game occurs when we find ways to fool the system into guessing wrong .
When we trick the visual system , we see a “ visual illusion ” — a static image might appear as if it ’s moving , or a concave surface will look convex .
When we fool the memory system , we form a false memory — a phenomenon made famous by researcher Elizabeth Loftus , who showed that it is relatively easy to make people remember events that never occurred .
As long as the falsely remembered event could plausibly have occurred , all it takes is a bit of suggestion or even exposure to a related idea to create a false memory .
In the Blink of an Eye
In past literature , visual illusions and false memories have been studied separately .
After all , they seem qualitatively different : visual illusions are immediate , whereas false memories seemed to develop over an extended period of time .
A surprising new study blurs the line between these two phenomena , however .
The study , conducted by Helene Intraub and Christopher A. Dickinson , both of the University of Delaware , reveals an example of false memory occurring within 42 milliseconds — about half the amount of time it takes to blink your eye .
Intraub and Dickinson ’s study relied upon a phenomenon known as “ boundary extension ” , an example of false memory found when recalling pictures .
When we see a picture of a location — say , a yard with a garbage can in front of a fence — we tend to remember the scene as though more of the fence were visible surrounding the garbage can .
In other words , we extend the boundaries of the image , believing that we saw more fence than was actually present .
This phenomenon is usually interpreted as a constructive memory error — our memory system extrapolates the view of the scene to a wider angle than was actually present .
The new study , published in the November issue of the journal Psychological Science , asked how quickly this boundary extension happens .
The researchers showed subjects a picture , erased it for a very short period of time by overlaying a new image , and then showed a new picture that was either the same as the first image or a slightly zoomed - out view of the same place .
They found that when people saw the exact same picture again , they thought the second picture was more zoomed - in than the first one they had seen .
When they saw a slightly zoomed - out version of the picture they had seen before , however , they thought this picture matched the first one .
This experience is the classic boundary extension effect .
So what was the shocking part ?
The gap between the first and second picture was less than 1/20th of a second .
In less than the blink of an eye , people remembered a systematically modified version of pictures they had seen .
This modification is , by far , the fastest false memory ever found .
Although it is still possible that boundary extension is purely a result of our memory system , the incredible speed of this phenomenon suggests a more parsimonious explanation : that boundary extension may in part be caused by the guesses of our visual system itself .
The new dataset thus blurs the boundaries between the initial representation of a picture ( via the visual system ) and the storage of that picture in memory .
So is boundary extension a visual illusion or a false memory ?
Perhaps these two phenomena are not as different as previously thought .
False memories and visual illusions both occur quickly and easily , and both seem to rely on the same cognitive mechanism : the fundamental property of perception and memory to fill in gaps with educated guesses , information that seems most plausible given the context .
The bottom line ?
The work of Intraub and colleagues adds to a growing movement that suggests that memory and perception may be simply two sides of the same coin .

Did the Indian subcontinent start spinning without Chinese know - how ?
Ancient silk strands have been found in artefacts from Pakistan ’s Indus valley .
I. Good
New findings suggest that silk making was not an exclusively Chinese technological innovation , but instead arose independently on the Indian subcontinent .
Ornaments from the Indus valley in east Pakistan , where the Harappan culture flourished more than 4,000 years ago , seem to contain silk spun by silk moths native to the region .
What 's more , the silk seems to have been processed in a way previously thought to have been a closely guarded secret within China .
There is hard and fast evidence for silk production in China back to around 2570 BC ; the newly discovered objects are believed to date from between 2450 BC and 2000 BC , making them similarly ancient .
There have been no previous finds of manufactured silk at sites outside China before about 1500 BC .
" This is the first evidence for silk anywhere out of China at such an early date , " says Irene Good of Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts , one of the authors of the study .
" It was a complete surprise . "
The objects come from two sites in the Indus valley : the city of Harappa itself , the hub of the Indus civilization , and Chanhu - daro in Sindh province , about 500 kilometres to the south .
They were collected from archaeological excavations in 1999 and 2000 conducted by the Harappa Archaeological Research Project ( HARP ) , a US–Pakistan collaboration .
Because of the sheer volume of artefacts amassed so far , they have only recently been studied in detail .
Good , working with HARP directors Richard Meadow of Harvard University and Jonathan Kenoyer of the University of Wisconsin in Madison , used an electron microscope to look at the fine structure of silk strands found in necklaces and bangles .
The precise shape of the individual silk threads — determined by the shape of the orifice through which they are extruded — is characteristic of the species of silk moth that produced the strands .
In a paper in the journal Archaeometry , the researchers show that the Harappa samples — two metal ornaments — contain silk from species of Antheraea moths indigenous to south Asia ( I. L. Good , J. M. Kenoyer and R. H. Meadow Archaeometry doi:10.1111/j.1475-4754.2008.00454.x ; 2009 ) .
The origin of the Chanhu - daro silk , threaded through soapstone beads , is less clear , but it may be from one of the same species .
Chinese silk comes from the domesticated silk moth Bombyx mori .
The Harappan silks seem to have been made by a process called reeling , in which the strands are collected on a bobbin rather than being twisted in short segments into a thread .
The researchers say that reeling was thought to have been part of a silk technology known only to China until the early centuries AD .
Now it seems that knowledge was not so exclusive .
" Archaeology in early China is showing increasingly there were connections outside China , " says Shelagh Vainker , a silk expert at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford , UK .
" It does n't seem unreasonable . "
But she sees evidence for silk production in China " significantly earlier " than 2500 – 2000 BC , which would suggest China could still claim priority .

" I believe that the people of the Indus civilization either harvested silkworm cocoons or traded with people who did , and that they knew a considerable amount about silk , " says Good .
She does , however , acknowledge that some might find this challenging : " National pride is at stake with such a discovery as this . "
The stock market is now back near its November lows and the pessimism is as thick as a copy of Keynes 's General Theory .
The “ stimulus ” package has been deemed either insufficient or overkill depending on your political persuasion , but certainly not stimulating .
The joy over the selection of Timothy Geithner as Treasury secretary has faded to a fear that his creative abilities were exhausted in the preparation of his personal tax returns .
The natives , or at least those at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , are getting restless and the fear trade is the only thing that seems to work with gold and Treasury Notes the only assets that seem to catch a bid for more than day or two .
Amid the gloom and doom it is easy to overlook the good news in our midst , but it does exist .
I have little confidence in the ability of government to fix our problems but I am ever the optimist about the capitalist system that so many seem intent on blaming for our economic problems .
Despite the declaration of Newsweek that We Are All Socialists Now , the market , not knowing it has been declared obsolete , continues to do what it has always done .
Prices rise and fall , the forces of supply and demand interact and the excesses of our recent past are purged .
Despite the determined efforts of politicians to prevent the inevitable , our economy is undergoing a much needed reallocation of resources .
The home construction industry is being reduced to its former position of relative unimportance .
The financial sector , which had become much too titanic for its trousers , is being put on a forced diet .
A stomach staple may yet be needed , but the slimming is well underway .
We ’ll be hearing more from our timid Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner this week about his plans for the banking sector , but the market waits for no man .
The verdict on Citigroup and several other financial institutions has already been rendered ; the only question at this point is whether they will get the death penalty or join the likes of AIG , Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the government gulag .
Having watched Citigroup , and its predecessors , find its way into every financial debacle of the last three decades , I would prefer to put them out of our misery .
The housing market , which everyone believes must be healed before recovery can begin , is quietly healing itself .
Home sales in California , the eye of the housing storm , are rising .
Lower prices are attracting buyers at a rate 85 % above last years pace .
Indeed , even as the median price fell over 40 % , the total dollar volume of sales in December was higher than the same month last year .
Florida has seen existing home sales rise for four consecutive months , although the rise is more muted than California , up only 27 % over last year in December .
The government ’s actions last week to limit foreclosures not only angers responsible homeowners , it slows the process of moving houses from those who ca n’t afford them to those who can .
The news of the credit markets ’ death also seems to have been a bit premature .
Those real estate sales in California and Florida were n’t all cash deals .
While banks are certainly requiring more in the way of a downpayment and may actually call your employer to verify you are indeed gainfully employed , it is obvious that banks are lending .
Contrary to news reports , banks are even extending financing for other consumer wants ; consumer loans at commercial banks are still rising at a 10 % rate .
That does n’t mean that lending as a whole is still rising ; the securitization market is basically dead .
As non -bank lending has withdrawn from the market , banks have stepped up to fill the void .
The total volume of lending may not be where it was , but is that something that should be lamented by anyone other than the Wall Street firms who benefited from the easy profits in the boom years ?
I think not .
Leading economic indicators have risen two months in a row .
Some have been quick to seize on the fact that the rising money supply is the biggest contributor to the rise .
These pessimists assume that we are in a liquidity trap and that monetary policy has lost its effectiveness .
If that is true then the rise in money supply means nothing and the LEI is rendered ineffective as an indicator , but based on the continued rise in bank lending , I remain unconvinced .
Furthermore , in last month ’s LEI report , five of the ten indicators were positive .
Productivity , which fell in the bad recession of 1981 - 82 and during the Great Depression , was up 3.2 % in the fourth quarter .
Incomes , adjusted for the recent deflation in the CPI , are rising .
And while the Keynesians among us fret about the paradox of thrift , I find the rising savings rate comforting .
Higher savings is exactly what we need to repair the damage done to our economy by excess consumption fueled by easy credit .
And besides , retail sales were up in January .
Obviously , we are still in recession and there is more pain to come , but the gloomy mood that surrounds the Obama administration is either manufactured for some political purpose or completely unwarranted .
The idea that only government can come to the rescue at this point is not only entirely too convenient for an administration determined not to waste a crisis , but also false .
Whether one is speaking of the economic condition or the response to it , we are not experiencing unprecedented events right now .
In the panic of 1819 , caused primarily by reckless lending and real estate speculation , Thomas Law advocated increasing the supply of money ( from Murray Rothbard ’s The Panic of 1819 : Reactions and Policies which is available online at the Mises Institute ) :
“ To Law , domestic manufactures were distressed from “ the want of money , for the home manufactures cannot afford to sell on long credits .
They must have quick returns to pay workmen .
I know of manufactures which have stopped , not because they were undersold by foreign goods , but solely because they could not get money .
Money is the means to pay workmen , to set up machinery … . ” . ”
Law also expounds an early , cruder version of Keynes theory :
“ Elaborating on the benefits from increased money , Law pointed to the great amount of internal improvements that could be effected with the new money .
He decried the slow process of accumulating money for investments out of profits .
After all , the benefit was derived simply from the money , so what difference would the origin of the money make ?
And it would be easy for the government to provide money , because the government “ gives internal exchange value to anything it prefers ” .
All it needs to do , concluded Law , was spend five millions of newly issued currency per year on public works , and , in a pump priming effect , “ the money thrown into circulating would , in the course of a year , enable individuals to make a number of improvements also . ” ”
Maybe Mr. Keynes was n’t the original thinker everyone makes him out to be .
The debate also centered on whether relief should be provided to debtors :
“ The moratoria were known as “ stay laws ” or “ replevin laws ” , which postponed execution of property when the debtor signed a pledge to make the payment at a certain date in the future .
Minimum appraisal laws provided that no property could be sold for execution below a certain minimum price , the appraised value being generally set by a board of the debtors ’ neighbors .
Such laws had been an intermittent feature of American government since early colonial Virginia . ”
Those on the other side of the debate employed arguments quite similar to the ones we see today :
“ The report began with assurances that the committee was deeply sensitive to the prevailing financial embarrassments , and that they had given due weight to the numerous petitions for relief legislation .
While the proposed legislation , however , would perhaps alleviate the condition of the debtors temporarily , it would , in the long run , make their distress worse …
The Hopkinson Committee used a familiar medical analogy noting that “ palliatives which may suspend the pain for a season , but do not remove the disease , are not restoratives of health ; it is worse than useless to lessen the present pressure by means which will finally plunge us deeper in distress . ”
… The report remarked that suffering men were disposed to complain about their lot and look for rapid remedies rather than admit that the only cure was slow and gradual . ”
This sounds remarkably similar to the debate which rages today .
Then , as today , one side argued for monetary expansion , debt relief and public spending .
The other side argued for sound money ( gold standard ) , thrift and industry as well as limited government intervention :
“ Time and the laws of trade will restore things to an equilibrium , if legislators do not rashly interfere to the natural course of events . ” - The New York Evening Post
President Monroe basically ignored the depression , barely mentioning it in his annual addresses .
Some states enacted debt relief measures and others enacted schemes to inflate the money supply ( all of which failed ) , but basically the depression ran its course and ended by 1821 .
The current crisis is not near the magnitude of some of the previous crises we ’ve faced in the history of the US .
We recovered from them all despite the ministrations of our perplexed pols .
What stands out about the current difficulties is not its unique nature but how much it resembles all the others .
The common characteristic of past crises is fairly easy to identify : overlending by banks for some speculative activity , although real estate is the most common .
The overlending was generally a result of some type of monetary inflation .
The Great Depression stands out for its length and the depth of political interference in the market processes .
While I do n’t believe the current administration ’s actions will be helpful in the recovery , neither do I believe they have taken action nearly as drastic as that taken by FDR and his brain trust .
The economy , and the stock market , will recover from their current malaise .
The healing is already underway and unless the administration further impedes the workings of the market , it will become more obvious over the coming months .
It is time for the debate to shift to longer term concerns .
Given the banking systems ’s penchant for periodic self destruction , a rise in capital requirements would seem obvious .
The tax code ’s favorable treatment for real estate investment also needs review .
Monetary policy , which is the real source of our troubles , needs to be reduced once again to the role it is best equipped to fulfill - preserving the purchasing power of our money .
I am optimistic about America .
We are the most productive nation the world has ever seen and there is no reason we should n’t stay that way .
We need to end the bickering and do the heavy lifting required for recovery .
I have every confidence in the ability of the American people to do exactly that .
The gloom and doom talk , especially by President Obama , needs to end .
MANILA ( Reuters ) - The Philippines ’ highest court has ruled an American soldier convicted of raping a Filipina in 2006 must be placed in government custody , scrapping a deal between the two countries that allowed detention inside the U.S. embassy .
The Supreme Court , in a majority vote taken on Tuesday but announced only on Wednesday , upheld a decade - old security treaty between Manila and Washington .
It also said the treaty was clear on the detention “ by Philippine authorities ” of any U.S. personnel serving sentences .
Jose Midas Marquez , a court spokesman , said the U.S. Marine could remain at the U.S. embassy until final arrangements have been made for his detention in a Philippine facility .
He said the court had ordered the government to begin talks with U.S. officials on Lance Corporal Daniel Smith ’s transfer to Philippine custody .
The court nullified two executive agreements signed by Philippine Foreign Minister Alberto Romulo and U.S. Ambassador Kristie Kenney in December 2006 that allowed the transfer of Smith to the embassy premises .
“ Agreements on the detention of the accused in the United States embassy are not in accord with the VFA ( Visiting Forces Agreement ) itself because such detention is not by Philippine authorities , ” the judges said in a 19 - page decision .
The U.S. Embassy in Manila said in a statement it has taken note of the court ’s decision and would refer the matter to legal experts in Washington .
It did not give further comments .
In November 2006 , a local court found Smith guilty of raping a Filipino woman inside a former American navy base northwest of the capital Manila while on break at the end of annual U.S. - Philippine military exercises in 2005 .
Smith was then sent to a local prison but was transferred shortly after to the U.S. embassy in Manila following the December 2006 agreements between Manila and Washington .
On Wednesday , left - wing activists protested against Smith ’s continued detention at the U.S. embassy , questioning the validity of the 1998 security agreement that allowed U.S. troops to train Philippine soldiers in the country .
The Philippines is one of America ’s closest allies in the region and was a colony for nearly 50 years until 1946 .
American troops retained a presence in forward bases until 1992 when Philippine senators voted to terminate a basing agreement .
The big trade story is the continuing sharp decline in both imports and exports .
The Census Bureau reports :
[ T] otal December exports of $ 133.8 billion and imports of $ 173.7 billion resulted in a goods and services deficit of $ 39.9 billion , down from $ 41.6 billion in November , revised .
December exports were $ 8.5 billion less than November exports of $ 142.3 billion .
December imports were $ 10.2 billion less than November imports of $ 183.9 billion .
Click on graph for larger image .
The first graph shows the monthly U.S. exports and imports in dollars through December 2008 .
The recent rapid decline in foreign trade continued in December .
Note that a large portion of the decline in imports is related to the fall in oil prices - but not all .
The second graph shows the U.S. trade deficit , both with and without petroleum through December .
The blue line is the total deficit , and the black line is the petroleum deficit , and the red line is the trade deficit ex-petroleum products .
Import oil prices fell to $ 49.93 in December , although import quantities increased in December - so the petroleum deficit only declined slightly .
Import oil prices will probably fall further in January .
Excluding petroleum , the trade deficit has been falling since early 2006 .
The rebalancing of trade continues , although the sharp declines in both imports and exports is very concerning .
Digg to Cut 10 Percent of Employees ; Says It Will Try to Be Profitable in 2009 ( The Entire Blog Post )
Digg , the San Francisco - based news discovery service and one of Silicon Valley ’s more prominent start - ups of late , said in its company blog today that it would cut its 75 - person workforce .
A company spokeswoman told BoomTown the cut would be about 10 percent , but would not give out a specific number of employees to be let go .
In addition , Digg noted it would be aiming to cut costs and be profitable in 2009 .
It will also be hiring a direct sales team .
In other words , revenue does matter too , Web 2.0 !
Here ’s the entire blog post on the layoffs and more , by CEO Jay Adelson :
Brief update on Digg
Hey all ,
Wanted to reach out to folks with an update on Digg and our priorities for 2009 as well as address some of the recent speculation about our business .
As we ’ve often stated over the past couple of months , given the current economic climate , we ’ve made the decision to take a more conservative approach to our expansion plans and aggressively focus on reaching profitability within the year .
This means we ’ll be taking proactive measures to manage our costs including a headcount reduction in certain areas that are less core to this year ’s objectives while continuing to hire for roles that will help build on our leadership position and get us to profitability faster .
This includes hiring a direct sales team , in addition to other targeted hires in 2009 .
As part of our aggressive path to profitability within the year , I also wanted to take this opportunity to highlight some of the major priorities for the company :
• Rolling out new features to grow and engage our community
• Building on our advertising infrastructure
• Building on our successful partnership with Microsoft
• Ongoing sponsorship opportunities
• Ongoing publisher and trade partnerships
I ’m confident that with commitment and focus on these priorities , Digg will be an even stronger company in 2009 and will continue to create innovative features for our more than 35 million community members .
I want to thank you all for your continued support and commitment –helping us achieve our vision of the democratization of media , and revolutionizing the way people consume and discover information online .
Thanks ,
Jay
The stimulus package has passed – and despite whether you are pushing tax cuts or waving the flag of infrastructure spending , perhaps its worth reconsidering the underlying goal either version looks to achieve : growth .
I ’m not the first to propose that our entire economic system is in need of an overhaul , but thinking back even further , I think we could take a leaf from Helen and Scott Nearing .
The Nearings moved from New York City to a Vermont homestead in 1932 because they perceived the capitalist economy was failing due to fundamentally bad underlying principles .
Essentially what they started in the New England countryside was a small farm , with a cash crop – maple syrup – which made enough money to help them buy building supplies , seed and necessities .
Now , reading their book , Living the Good Life , during the current economic crisis , I cannot help but wonder the same thing they wondered then :
Are we suppose to seek profit above all things ?
Farming in America got a closer look last week when the ag census for 2007 debuted and we could crunch some hard numbers .
Total small farms ( 1 - 9 acres ) increased by about 50,000 to 232,849 — 80 % of whose farmers are making under $ 10,000 ; while 75 % of the agricultural production ( read : commodity crops ) took place on 125,000 of the largest farms .
Here money and size correlate ; our “ Get Big or Get Out ” mentality has produced giant farms — producing things we ca n’t eat without processing — which get a continuous flow of government subsidies , and grow in size as they buy up their neighbors in a quest for the almighty dollar .
But what I am most interested in here is those small farms , where more and more young people are gravitating , where organic is often practiced with or without certification , and perhaps most of what is being produced is used by the family unit or sold to neighbors .
These small farms might be a chance to learn , or an example of how land expense for a beginning farmer is just too great , or maybe these new farmers , too , have made a political decision to be self - sufficient .
But this phenomenon could be part of a real revolution going on in the way we think our society should be run , as well as a hat tip to the pioneering Nearings .
Get the latest articles in your inbox .
La Vida Locavore took a look at these small farms in detail last week , and saw that most farmers were turning a small profit or breaking even .
Now I know what I am about to say is controversial , but could n’t this be considered a good thing ?
I am not trying to insist that we all become peasants again , that we should give up coffee and chocolate , learn how to slaughter a chicken , throw out our laptop and iPhone and never , ever travel again .
Nor am I saying that the government should n’t be helping new farmers with land access and funds : they most certainly should .
But I ask , with a full belly and satisfying work , is n’t it time we re-frame our society ’s expectations for growth of the bottom line at any cost ?
Scott Nearing was an economist and social theorist who lost his job as a professor in the city due to his anarchist and pacifist beliefs .
Both Nearings had strong opinions about the uses of money , and self - sufficiency .
Here ’s are the Nearings on the economics of consumption :
Life ’s necessaries are easily come by if people are willing to adjust their consumption to the quantity and variety of their products .
Difficulties begin when the subsistence advocate enters the market with its lures and wiles for separating the unwary and the dullwitted from their medium of exchange .
Never forget that the private ownership of the means of production , through the monopoly of natural resources and patents , the control over money , the imposition of the tribute called “ interest ” , the gambling centers , which trade in commodities and “ securities ” , to price control and the domination by the wealthlords of the agencies which shape men ’s minds and the machinery of government , the entire apparatus of a competitive , acquisitive , exploitive [ sic ] , coercive social order is rigged and manipulated for the rich and powerful against the poor and the weak .
Keep out of the system ’s clutches and you have a chance of subsistence , even if the oligarchs disapprove of what you think and say and do .
Accept the system , with its implications and ramifications , and you become a helpless cog in an impersonal , implacable , merciless machine operated to make the rich men richer and the powerful men more powerful .
The two things Americans value most are money and god , which often act to segregate us .
What then should we value in our society ?
My answer would be community , quality and real justice for all living creatures ; and food could be the most fundamental way through which we change our ways of thinking because it is a central front in our daily lives , and has the potential to bring us together .
That change is starting already , and Washington will have no choice but to listen from here on out .
According to the ag census , organics are growing in demand .
( Collin Peterson , are you paying attention ? )
This speaks to the fact that we are becoming more concerned about the quality of the things we put in our mouth and the effect our food choices have on our community and environment at large .
Woody Tasch , an advocate of what he calls “ Slow Money , ” where the investor is concerned with building a stronger community , said in a recent interview that “ there may well be a whole new , wider role for the investor as earthworm , rather than the investor as master of the universe . ”
But first , as Civil Eats environment editor Aaron French reminded us in a recent post , we must define sustainability .
It seems we have been dragging our feet about this for fear that ridicule from the growth - focused economy would pummel anyone who dared say something bad about profit .
Well here goes :
Using growth as the final and absolute indication of a healthy economy is bound to blow up in our face , whether by creating empty calorie foods to increase intake of commodity crops ( leading to heart disease and diabetes , and a ballooning tax payer burden of health costs ) or starting wars to increase sales of weapons ( leading to an endless struggle and antagonizing much of the world in the process ) or ignoring science so that we do n’t have to act on climate change by regulating industry ( at our future peril ) – we can all agree these things are not sustainable .
In an article in the New York Times last weekend , Secretary of Ag Tom Vilsack was quoted encouraging diversification as a means to make small farms sustainable — focusing on energy production , carbon sequestration , conservation and ecotourism aside from crops and livestock , which he referred to as the “ new rural economy . ”
He also said last week that the USDA should represent “ eaters ” and not just farmers , which made many of us eaters cheer .
It is my sincere hope we continue to hold him to his word , because while the Nearings have set a fine example for homesteading , we must work together for change as we are linked through interdependence .
The food community must stay in dialog , pushing the fundamentals of our economy towards awareness , justice and quality for eaters everywhere .

The US trade deficit -- which is a good proxy for the current account balance ( the income surplus offsets a transfers deficit ) -- is now around $ 40 b a month .
At its peak it was more like around $ 60 b a month .
That implies , if nothing changes , the 2009 current account deficit would be around $ 500 b , down from a peak of $ 700b .
In fact , if nothing changes the trade balance balance might improve a bit more .
The US imported an unusually large amount of oil in December , and that rise in volume obscured some of the benefits from the fall in the price .
The US paid an average of around $ 95 a barrel for its imported oil in 2008 , but only about $ 50 a barrel in December .
Remember this the next time someone argues that the US will be borrowing more from the rest of the world to finance its fiscal deficit : the total amount the US borrows from the world is defined by the current account deficit and the current account deficit clearly went down in the fourth quarter even as the US fiscal deficit ( and the Treasury ’s borrowing need ) soared .
That is because the rise in government borrowing offset a contraction in private investment and a rise in private savings .
Of course , it would be far better if the global economy adjusted through strong growth abroad not a collapse in private US demand growth .
But , well , we are where we are .
Y/y nominal non-oil imports were down about 10 % in December .
Nominal export growth was down a bit less , more like 8 % .
Real goods exports and real goods imports are both falling .
The improvement in the non-oil trade balance now reflects a faster fall in imports than exports .
US real import growth has been weak for a while now .
Until a few quarters ago though real export growth was strong .
Not any more .
Real exports could soon start to fall faster than real imports .
If the stabilization of US imports reflects the stabilization of the US economy then it would be good news .
But a faster stabilization in the US than in the world -- together with a strong ( ish ) dollar would also push the non-oil deficit back up over the course of 2009 .
Forecasts that the US deficit will fall to 2.5 % to 3 % of GDP strike me as optimistic .
The net result : I expect a slowing global economy to take a toll on US exports and do not expect much additional improvement in the US current account balance .
I ’ll be watching closely to see if the markets are willing to finance a growing deficit .... and , for that matter , if China is willing to finance a growing US deficit and add to its already considerable exposure .
China ’s January surplus ( $ 39.1b ) is roughly the same size as the United States ’ December deficit ( $ 39.9 b ) .
It is reasonable to think it will roughly match the United States January deficit as well .
The extreme symmetry captures something real .
Deficits and surpluses are shrinking globally now that the price of oil is at levels that roughly cover the oil exporters imports .*
Right now China ’s ( growing ) surplus is clearly the main counterpart to the United States ’ ( shrinking ) deficit .
* Actually is a bit lower than the price most oil exporters need , so some oil exporters will need to sell their existing assets to cover their import bills .
Death by moron /
Has anonymous commenting destroyed meaningful online dialogue ?
Oh , hell yes
Here is my strange confession : I miss my hate mail .
It 's an odd thing to admit , but in a perverse sort of way , I actually miss the wretched river , the rancid flow of puerile , nasty , sickeningly homophobic email I used to receive on a regular basis from the ultra- right and the Christian right and the Mormon right and the Bush - impaired whenever I would post a friendly , pointed column full of tangy liberal attitude .
Which is , of course , all of them .
Oh , I miss all the lovely and positive email too , which outpaced the nasty stuff by a huge margin .
But the hate mail was ( and still is , what dribble I now get ) very special indeed , great fodder for live readings , for the reaction of horrified disbelief of anyone who saw it , for the charming reminder of just how ugly and violent and grammatically challenged the human animal can be .
( FYI : the best of the worst of my hate mail -- about 50 truly stunning examples -- will be published in my upcoming mega- compendium of a book , " The Daring Spectacle . "
Get on my personal newsletter to find out more ) .
So , what happened ?
Where has all the hate gone ?
One easy explanation : the merciful EoB , the End of Bush .
The extraordinary failure of the neocon mindset means that the most troglodytic of the haters have now retreated to the Caves of Ignorance to lick their wounds and fellate each other in assorted airport restrooms .
Good news all around .
But that 's only a small part of it .
Something else is afoot , something more nefarious and curious and , well , downright sad .
Fact is , despite the steadily increasing traffic to my column over the years , I now get far less email overall than I used to , either positive or negative .
You already know the reason : Anonymous commenting .
Those semi-public forums like the one you see right down there , at the bottom of this very column , those " community " discussion areas borne of the blogosphere and spread to every media site imaginable , from SFGate to the New York Times to YouTube to Knitting World .
Indeed , they 're one of the most popular , widely used innovations of the Web 2.0 revolution , and they 've dramatically transformed public communication and conversation .
For the worse .
Oh , for the far , far worse .
I did n't always think so .
I was , for years , an enthusiastic advocate of the egalitarian , free - for - all , let 's - level - the - playing field aspect of the Web .
More voices !
More feedback !
More participation !
Bring it on !
Not anymore .
As I 've mentioned before , I now tend to agree with " West Wing " creator Aaron Sorkin , who said , " Nothing has done more to make us dumber or meaner than the anonymity of the Internet . "
Hyperbole ?
Not by much .
But let 's spin backwards for just a moment , to a time before blogs and Facebook and the Web 2.0 socialgasm .
There was this wonderful killer app called email .
There was a concomitant killer innovation , called HTML links .
As every newspaper hastily rushed its content online , suddenly reporters and columnists and hardcore news jockeys alike began seeing their bylines turned into a sweet , baffling little " mailto " link .
And lo , a revolution was born .
For the first time in more than a century , a fundamental shift occurred in the sacred -- but formerly quite cold and detached -- writer / reader relationship .
Suddenly , readers could respond instantly to a newspaper piece , to the journalist in question , and authors could instantly know the effect and accuracy of their words .
No more hand - written , snail - mailed Letters to the Editor that might ( but probably wo n't ) get published two or three weeks later .
The feedback loop was made instant , and enormously compelling .
It was lauded as a new era , one that would change the newspaper biz forever .
Or maybe not .
Because now , that once - revolutionary connection , all those vibrant reader interactions I once cherished , have changed again .
Or more accurately , have devolved dramatically .
That sacred relationship is no longer the slightest bit sacred .
If you 've ever spent much time in the comment boards of this or any major media site ( or , of course , any popular blog ) , you already know : Anonymity tends to bring out the absolute worst in people , the meanest and nastiest and least considerate .
Something about not having to reveal who you really are caters to the basest , most unkind instincts of the human animal .
Go figure .
Thoughtful discourse ?
Humorous insight ?
Sometimes .
But mostly it 's a tactless spectator sport .
It 's about being seen , about out - snarking the previous poster , about trying to top one another in the quest for ...
I 'm not sure what .
A tiny shot of notoriety ?
The feeling of being " published " on a major media site ?
Or is it the thrill that can only come from hurling a verbal Molotov at the Great Satan of " corporate media , " and then running away like a snorting 8 - year - old ?
All of the above ?
Do not misunderstand :
It is far from all bad , and many intelligent , eloquent , hilarious people still add their voices to comment boards across the Interwebs , including ours .
Hell , I still get terrific pleasure from reading some of the comments on a few of my favorite blogs , along with rich information , morbid humor , even new column ideas and unusual angles I never thought of .
What 's more , some of the larger media sites still have enough resources ( read : overworked , as - of - yet - not - laid - off staffers ) to moderate their forums and keep the verbal chyme to a minimum .
But the coherent voices are , by and large , increasingly drowned out by the nasty , the puerile , the inane , to the point where , unless you 're in the mood to have your positive mood ruined and your belief in the inherent goodness of humanity stomped like a rainbow flag in the Mormon church , there 's almost no point in trying to sift through it anymore .
The relentless nastiness is , quite literally , sickening .
Solutions ?
That 's easy .
One is to block it all out .
Install and employ something like the fabulously named StupidFilter ( which I wrote about last year ) , an elaborate algorithm that scans through and removes all insidiously childish , dumb , or otherwise moronic language from a given chat forum .
Hey , it could work .
The StupidFilter Project is , apparently , still quite real , though I 've no idea if it will ever catch on .
We can only hope .
There is , of course , another solution , and it's far simpler and more elegant and it would fix the entire problem in an instant .
It is this : Reveal yourself .
Anyone who wishes to post a public comment must also post his / her real name , an actual email address , maybe even a nice little headshot .
You want to participate and add to the conversation , criticize and parry and thrust ?
Great .
Let 's see who you are , honest and true .
Fire it up .
Debate .
Engage .
Let 's create a real community .
No more hiding .
No more anonymous cowardice .
No more hit - and - run verbal spitwads and avoiding responsibility for what you say .
Hey , writers and journalists have been doing it for years , posting our names and email addresses and even photos for the entire world to see .
If Web 2.0 means we 're now all in this public sphere together , should n't I know exactly who you are , too ?
Should n't everyone ?
Will it happen ?
Not a chance .
Truth is , anonymous forums still drive a ton of desperately needed traffic to every media joint that offers them , including this one .
Until the novelty of anon posting dies out -- which I 'm fairly convinced it will , relatively soon -- commerce wins .
In a land where click - throughs are king , quantity still trumps quality , every time .
Do n't you just hate that ?
I look forward to your emails .

Many people are aware that Harry Potter , The Anarchist Cookbook and Stephen King books have been banned from schools around the country , but as many civilizations have figured out , censorship is a slippery slope .
It is pretty strange to consider Shakespeare has not only been banned from public schools over sexual themes , but that censored editions have been out since the 1700s .

Of the Radcliffe Publishing list of the top 100 books of the past century , almost half have been challenged by schools , many are banned in whole countries .
Here ’s a few banned titles that just may surprise you :* Note : Plot summaries may include spoilers .
I know all you Neatorama readers are pretty intelligent , so I would n’t doubt if many of you have read these books .
I ’ve included the summaries to give an idea as to why the books may have been banned .
A soldier , Henry , on the Italian front meets and seduces a young woman , Catherine .
Their relationship continues as he heals a knee that was injured in battle .
By the time his knee is fully healed , Catherine is three months pregnant .
Unfortunately , Henry has to return to the war and the Germans break through the Italian lines .
The Italians charge the soldiers for treachery for letting the Germans defeat them .
Henry escapes during another officer ’s execution and runs away to Switzerland with Catherine .
They live happily until Catherine gives birth to a stillborn and then dies in labor .
Published in 1929 , this novel caused trouble immediately .
Boston banned the magazine it was originally published in , claiming the story was too sexual .
Italy banned the book because of its portrayal of the army ’s retreat from Caporatto .
The Nazis burned the book in 1933 .
In 1939 , Ireland banned the novel .
In modern America , plenty of school districts have banned the publication for sexual content .

The book ’s plot uses the same story line as Tarzan .
A couple of civilized people , Bernard and Lenina , enter a primitive society and bring a “ savage ” back into their modern society .
The difference here is that these “ civilized people ” live in a futuristic world filled with castes , happy drugs , sex without reproduction and euthanasia .
Love , sadness and families have become obsolete , as well as self - expression and exploration .
The Tarzan in this piece is the son , John , of an ex-civilized woman who now lives with the “ savages . ”
John was raised with family , love and Shakespeare .
When they return to the city , John becomes a spectacle for society types and even Lenina starts finding him interesting .
John begins falling in love with Lenina even as he is disgusted with the modern world and her role in it .
John finds he cannot escape this world and eventually kills himself to discontinue playing his role as a tourist spectacle .
This text is one of the most frequently banned books in literary history .
It was banned in Ireland the year it was published , 1932 .
Multiple school districts have restricted access to this book because the atheistic people in the futuristic society it depicts take drugs and have promiscuous sex to avoid emotional connections .
There are a lot of people who try to compare this book to our modern society , but if that was accurate , would we still be banning it from school ?
Source | Brave New World at AmazonA teenage boy , Holden Caulfield , runs away to New York after being expelled from reform school .
The book is a first person narrative and over the course of the story , you learn about his brother ’s passing and how that has affected his present state of mind .
Throughout his adventure , he drinks , smokes , hits on adult women , gets beaten up by a pimp , is hit on by a past teacher and deals with many other activities that a teen should n’t be going through .
He constantly complains about other people his age , calling them “ phony ” or stupid .
The novel explores Holden ’s psychological need to grow up after his brother ’s death .
It also does an excellent job depicting his desire to protect young children from becoming adults .
In 1960 , a teacher was fired from her job for requiring her eleventh grade class to read the book .
Between 1961 and 1962 , it was the most censored book in high schools and colleges .
This novel has been banned in schools throughout America for being anti-white , blasphemous , profane , racist and overtly sexual .
How anything can be racist and anti-white , I do n’t know .
I meant this statement as how the book can be racist against both blacks and whites at the same time , which is what the people condemning the book seemed to imply .
Personally , I do n't think you can be racist against your self and persons of other races at the same time , I think it makes you more of a person hater than a racist .
Although I 'm sure many readers would still like to disagree with this .
Completely unrelated but interesting : many murderers read Catcher In The Rye shortly before committing their crimes .

The Catcher in the Rye at AmazonConsidered to be the first modern erotic novel , there are quite a few naughty bits in this book , if you want to read a bit , there ’s an excerpt on the Wikipedia page .
The story revolves around a young country girl who must leave her village due to poverty .
She is forced to work at a brothel , but escapes with her true love before she loses her virginity .
When her love is forced to leave the country , she has to take on a variety of male “ acquaintances ” in order to survive .
This book was monumental to both English and American obscenity standards .
A year after the book was released , John Cleland and the publisher were both arrested and charged with “ corrupting the king ’s subjects . ”
They subsequently stopped publishing the novel , but it still managed to become popular thanks to pirated editions circulating the country .
Cleland attempted to clean up the book and republished it in 1750 , but he was arrested again , although this time the charges were dropped .
The book continued to be published underground and in 1963 there was an obscenity trial against a book seller carrying the novel .
Although the defense lost , it helped to shift public opinion about obscenity laws in Britain .
In 1970 , the unabridged book was legally published for the first time .
Over in the states , the book was banned for obscenity in 1821 .
In 1963 , a publisher tried to re-release the book under the title John Cleland ’s Memoirs of A Woman of Pleasure .
The book was also banned under this title , but the publisher , G.B. Putnam , challenged the ban .
The Supreme Court ruled the novel did not meet the standards for obscenity .
This was the last book to be banned by the US federal government .

The group is forced to leave their home in Oklahoma that has fallen victim to the dust bowl storms .
They hope to find better luck in California , though on their way out West , they constantly run into other families hoping for the same luck .
When they get to California , they find the farmers have bound together to exploit the massive amount of laborers offering their services .
When workers begin to unionize , the Joads work as strike breakers and end up involved with a bloody strike , forcing Tom Joad to kill again .
In the end , practically all of the family ’s actions prove to be pointless as they are starving and homeless in California .
Published in 1939 , this Steinbeck story caused an uproar as soon as it was released .
These days , the book seems to be fairly mild , with a few references to sex and some minor curse words , but the book was quite racy for its day .
Kern county was one of the first places to ban the novel as they were insulted by how Steinbeck depicted their citizens .
It was immediately burned by the East St. Louis library , banned from Buffalo , New York and Kansas City .
Since then , it ’s been banned in many high schools - mostly for bad language .
A parent in Burlington , North Carolina said , " book is full of filth .
My son is being raised in a Christian home and this book takes the Lord 's name in vain and has all kinds of profanity in it .
" Internationally , the book has had trouble too .
In 1953 , Ireland deemed the book obscene and banned it .
In 1973 , eleven publishers in Turkey were charged for “ spreading propaganda unfavorable to the state . ”
Why Grapes of Wrath would be seen as unfavorable to Turkey , I have no idea .

She struggles to remain faithful to him , but ends up having an affair with the gamekeeper .
The novel covers her struggle to live only mentally , although she proves to need physical stimulation as well .
The Penguin Books 1960 British publication of Lady Chatterley ’s Lover was one of the first novels tried under England ’s 1959 obscenity law .
This law gave publishers the right to release racy books , as long as the work was of literary merit .
Penguin was found not guilty and the novel was legally available in England for the first time .
The trial was later turned into a BBC show known as “ The Chatterley Affair .
” Conversely , Australia not only found the book to be legally obscene , but also banned publication of a book depicting the British trial called The Trial of Lady Chatterley .
A copy of the book was smuggled into the country anyway and published underground .
Many people read the book and it eventually led to lesser censorship of books in the country .

Humbert tries to drug the Lolita to have his way with her , but she instead seduces him .
Humbert becomes Lolita ’s guardian and falls in love with her although she has very little interest in him .
She escapes his guardianship by making plans with another pedophile .
Humbert tries to find Lolita and her abductor , but gets nowhere .
Two years later , a married and pregnant Lolita contacts him requesting money .
He brings her money and tries to get her to leave with him .
She refuses .
She does , however , give him information on her abductor and Humbert tracks down the man and kills him .
Humbert goes to jail , where he writes a novel called Lolita .
The book was released in 1955 and received little attention until author Graham Greene sang its praises in an interview with The London Times .
After reading the statement , the editor of the Sunday Express replied that the book was “ sheer , unrestrained pornography . ”
That ’s when the book was banned in Britain and all imported copies were ordered to be seized by the customs department .
By December 1956 , France followed suit , although both countries repealed the ban in 1959 .
Argentina and New Zealand both banned the book in the following years .
Surprisingly , the book was n’t criticized as much in America , in fact , in its first three weeks available it sold over 100,000 copies .

Random Permutations and Sorting
In this article , we implement a purely functional algorithm for selecting a permutation of n elements at random .
The main idea is that shuffling a list is * essentially the same * as sorting a list !
Introduction
The standard algorithm for shuffling a deck of cards , or generating a random permutation of a finite set with n elements in general , is the Fisher - Yates shuffle .
Conventionally , the elements are stored in a mutable array and then randomly swapped a few times .
More specifically , they are swapped n times , so the algorithm runs in O ( n ) time .
Of course , the point is that these swaps are chosen carefully such that each permutation is equally likely .
In a message to the Haskell beginners mailing list , Jan Snajder presented a short program that implements exactly this , with mutable arrays and all .
His post made me wonder whether there is a purely functional way to do this , one without mutable arrays and indexes but with similar time complexity ?
Yes , there is !
The main idea is that shuffling a list is essentially the same as sorting a list ; the minor difference being that the former chooses a permutation at random while the latter chooses a very particular permutation , namely the one that sorts the input .
In other words , the idea is to take a generic sorting algorithm like merge sort and turn it into a shuffle algorithm by simply replacing each comparison with a random choice .
Thus , in the following article , we are going to transform merge sort into a random permutation generator .
Random Numbers
Before we begin , a few words about random number generation .
Jan used the IO monad to obtain random numbers , giving the shuffle algorithm the type
permute :: [ a ] -> IO [ a ]
This is both pretty and ugly at the same time ; ugly in that IO is used as ragbag for side effects that do n’t seem to fit elsewhere , but pretty in that the usual procedure of carrying around and updating a random seed is hidden behind an abstraction .
We will drop the ugly part by using a new monad R
permute :: [ a ] -> R [ a ]
which works like IO but allows only random number creation .
In other words , the only side effects available in R are functions like
getRandomR :: ( Int , Int ) -> R Int
which generates a random integer in the given range .
Note that the restriction to random numbers gives R a a meaning on its own ; we can interpret R a as “ a collection of values a of which one will be picked at random when the program is run ” or for the mathematically inclined as “ a random variable of type a ” .
You can implement it as type R a = IO a if you like , but we will use the MonadRandom package and set
import Control .
Monad .
Random type R a = Rand StdGen a
Samples can be generated with the functions evalRand and evalRandIO .
Merge Sort
Recall how merge sort works : the list is divided in half , both halves are sorted individually and then merged to give the result .
Let us capture the second phase of the algorithm with a designated data type SortedList a that represents sorted lists .
Of course , we can simply implement it as ordinary list , with the convention that the elements appear in order :
type SortedList a = [ a ] empty :: SortedList a empty = [ ] singleton :: a -> SortedList a singleton x = [ x ] merge :: Ord a => SortedList a -> SortedList a -> SortedList a merge [ ] ys = ys merge xs [ ] = xs merge ( x: xs ) ( y:ys ) = if x <= y then x : ( xs `merge` y:ys ) else y : ( x: xs `merge` ys )
With these preliminaries , the whole algorithm reads :
mergesort :: Ord a = > [ a ] ->
SortedList a mergesort = fromList where fromList [ ] = empty fromList [ x ] = singleton x fromList xs = ( fromList l ) `merge` ( fromList r ) where ( l , r ) = splitAt ( length xs `div` 2 ) xs
Random Lists
To generate random permutations , we now replace sorted lists with “ random lists ” , i.e. some kind of list structure that presents its elements in random order .
The straightforward choice
type RandomList a = R [ a ]
will do the trick .
Trivially , we have
empty :: RandomList a empty = return [ ] singleton :: a -> RandomList a singleton x = return [ x ]
Merge
Now , we want to merge random lists .
This process is entirely analogous to merging sorted lists : we select the first element and then combine the tails with merge .
But instead of always putting the smallest element in front , we toss a coin and select an element at random .
In Haskell pseudo code , this would look something like this :
merge ( x:xs ) ( y:ys ) = do k <- getRandomR ( 1,2 ) -- toss a coin if k == 1 then x : ( xs `merge` y:ys ) else y : ( x: xs `merge` ys )
That being said , giving each list an equal probability of 1/2 is unfair when the lists have different sizes .
For instance , if the first list has only 1 element and the second list is a random permutations of 5 elements , then the single element would have a probability of 1 /2 to appear as first element in the result .
In a fair permutation , this probability should be only 1/6 .
The selection can be made fair if we weight the lists by their sizes .
In our example , this means giving the first list a probability of 1/( 5+1 ) and the second one a probability of 5 /( 5+1 ) .
By keeping track of the list sizes and adjusting the random selection accordingly , we obtain the following implementation :
merge :: RandomList a -> RandomList a ->
RandomList a merge rxs rys = do xs <- rxs ys <- rys merge ' ( length xs , xs ) ( length ys , ys ) where merge ' ( 0 , [ ] ) ( _ , ys ) = return ys merge ' ( _ , xs ) ( 0 , [ ] ) = return xs merge ' ( nx , x :xs ) ( ny , y:ys ) = do k <- getRandomR ( 1,nx+ny ) if k <= nx then ( x : ) `liftM` ( ( nx - 1 , xs ) `merge '` ( ny , y:ys ) ) else ( y : ) `liftM` ( ( nx , x : xs ) `merge '` ( ny - 1 , ys ) )
Clearly , this function needs O ( n ) time to merge two random lists .
Permute
The final algorithm to generate a random permutation has exactly the same structure as merge sort :
permute :: [ a ] ->
RandomList a permute = fromList where fromList [ ] = empty fromList [ x ] = singleton x fromList xs = ( fromList l ) `merge` ( fromList r ) where ( l , r ) = splitAt ( length xs `div` 2 ) xs
And just like merge sort , this implementation will take O( n log n ) time to generate a random permutation .
After all , the new merge has the same time complexity and the old analysis applies .
The time complexity may seem like a regress compared to O(n ) for the Fisher - Yates shuffle , but the connection to sorting shows that without arrays , O( n log n ) is optimal .
After all , there are n!
permutations in total , so we need at least O( n log n ) bits to encode them and we will need equally many steps to pick one if we may only decide one bit at a time .
Where to go from here
I hope you have enjoyed this excursion into sorting and functional programming .
For your convenience , I have packaged the implementation of random lists into a tiny module .
I would like remark that it is Haskell ’s first class treatment of computations like R a that makes the RandomList abstraction possible at all .
Also , purity is a boon ; I do n’t think that an impure language treating random numbers as a side effect can convey the abstraction of random variables R a this convincingly .
Quicksort
Merge sort is not the only sorting algorithm that can be turned into a random permutation generator .
How about trying the same with quicksort ?
Fairness
The merge function looks fair , but can you actually prove that ?
Probabilistic Functional Programming by Erwig and Kollmansberger to the rescue !
Available on Hackage .
Incremental Generation
I ’ll end with another challenging problem : how about an incremental algorithm that generates random elements on demand ?
For instance , we want
head `liftM` permute
to return a random element in O ( n ) time and
take k `liftM` permute
to return elements in say O( n + k log n ) time .
For sorting , this question is explored in Quicksort and k-th Smallest Elements .
Note that the merge sort implementation presented here is too inefficient at constructing the call tree for merge .
Also , the RandomList implementation has to be changed unless the random monad R is sufficiently lazy .
In the spirit of Inductive Reasoning about Effectful Data Types by Filinski and Støvring , try a variant of
data RandomList a = Nil | Cons ( R ( a , RandomList a ) )
to achieve the desired behavior .
