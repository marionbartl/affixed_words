Whilst mooching around the internet to stave off the christmas boredom , came across this little gem .
A lovely old wooden ringer ( ring netter ) being built .
From the drawing board to launch .
Superb bit of film .
The caulking bit of the video was a treat .
Kinda get the idea these guys might have done that before a bit !
The fact they are building a wooden boat with virtually no power tools as well is a skill that is pretty much lost today as well
probably the best wooden boat building video I 've come across .
The music 's seen better days though , the commentary is the poem “ The Building of the Ship ” by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow ( he of " I shot an arrow into the air .... " fame )
* What 's gannin on here like *
It only took them 18 minutes !
Great video .

The house in Shepherds Bush , London .
Photograph : Nationalpictures.co.uk
A house in west London has gone on sale for more than half a million pounds , despite being only 1.8 m ( 6ft ) wide .
In estate agent speak , the house for sale in Goldhawk Road , Shepherd 's Bush , is " historic and enchanting " and " internationally recognised for its unique character " .
But to most £ 549,950 is a lot to pay for a property which is no wider than a disabled toilet cubicle , however enchanted they may be by its idiosyncrasies .
The five - floor property is being sold by estate agents Faron Sutaria , who with clever photography have managed to suggest that anyone swinging their cat in the living room would not give their pet a nasty bang on the head .
But there is no disguising that the bedroom is so thin you can only climb into the built - in bed from one end .
Despite its width , however , the little house packs a lot in .
It boasts two reception rooms , a dining room , an extremely narrow kitchen in the basement , a bathroom , shower room , two bedrooms and a study .
Sceptics can visit the house tomorrow or Sunday as part of the estate agent 's open house weekend .
The price reflects the property 's novelty value , according to Simon Beatson , of agents Faron Sutaria .
" It 's unique , " he said .
" For pounds per square foot it 's actually incredibly good value . "
He is confident of reaching a good price as a shortage of stock across London and low interest rates continue to drive prices up .
The last time the house changed hands , three years ago , it cost £ 61,450 less .
BBC News reports : Google has begun to phase out support for Internet Explorer 6 , the browser identified as the weak link in a “ sophisticated and targeted ” cyber attack on the search engine .
The firm said from 1 March some of its services , such as Google Docs , would not work “ properly ” with the browser .
It recommended individuals and firms upgrade “ as soon as possible ” .
Included below is an e-mail that was forwarded to us as part of this news submission by user chrisfriberg .
Dear Google Apps admin , â€ ‹
In order to continue to improve our products and deliver more sophisticated features and performance , we are harnessing some of the latest improvements in web browser technology .
This includes faster JavaScript processing and new standards like HTML5 .
As a result , over the course of 2010 , we will be phasing out support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 as well as other older browsers that are not supported by their own manufacturers .
We plan to begin phasing out support of these older browsers on the Google Docs suite and the Google Sites editor on March 1 , 2010 .
After that point , certain functionality within these applications may have higher latency and may not work correctly in these older browsers .
Later in 2010 , we will start to phase out support for these browsers for Google Mail and Google Calendar .
Google Apps will continue to support Internet Explorer 7.0 and above , Firefox 3.0 and above , Google Chrome 4.0 and above , and Safari 3.0 and above .
Starting next week , users on these older browsers will see a message in Google Docs and the Google Sites editor explaining this change and asking them to upgrade their browser .
We will also alert you again closer to March 1 to remind you of this change .

We are aiming to beat that in 2010 and continue to deliver the best and most innovative collaboration products for businesses .
Thank you for your continued support !
Sincerely , The Google Apps team
I think it was safe to say that the attack on Google , woke Google up to the threat of IE on their own systems and they must have done ( or are in the process of ) an internal review of it ’s use .
I had not expected them to react publicly so quickly though .
I think this is a good thing .
Increasing internal complaints from corporate desktop users should increase the pressure on backwards and incompetent companies to update .
Of course , they ’ll want users to upgrade to a browser like Chrome , and it ’ll be interesting to see come March and onwards if browser trends see a noticeable uptick , just like Mozilla saw when the German and French governments recommended to users to not use IE6 .
Of course , moving users on is good for their security , but will this move developers on too ?
That remains to be seen .

A Venus flytrap awaits its next victim
The origin of the voracious Venus flytrap has been uncovered .
The flytrap , and one other carnivorous snap - trap plant which grows underwater , evolved from a more conventional relative that had sticky leaves .
Over time , the plants added elaborate structures and weapons such as trigger hairs and teeth to trap and immobilise their meaty prey , botanists say .
Ultimately , the need to hunt and eat ever larger animals drove the plants ' evolution , say the scientists .
Carnivorous plants come in many forms , and are known to have independently evolved at least six separate times .
The Venus flytrap acts like an animal , it moves fast and eats fresh meat
Botanist Don Waller
For example , pitcher plants create tube - like leaf structures into which insects tumble and become trapped , while other plants have sticky surfaces that act like flypaper .
But among all these plants , two species stand out : the Venus flytrap ( Dionaea muscipula ) and the waterwheel plant ( Aldrovanda vesiculosa ) .
Both are known as snap - traps because they actively hunt animals , snapping shut specially adapted leaves to trap any hapless creature that crosses them .
The Venus flytrap closes around an insect in just 0.3s or faster , while the waterwheel use thin translucent traps to snare copepods and other aquatic invertebrates .
Copepods should steer clear of the waterwheel
Charles Darwin was so enamoured by this striking adaptation , and the speed with which it works , that he described the Venus flytrap as being " one of the most wonderful plants in the world . "
" Darwin was fascinated by carnivorous plants in general and the Venus flytrap in particular , I think , partly because they go against type , " says Don Waller , a botanist at the University of Wisconsin , in Madison , US .
" In his time and ours , most of us feel that plants are passive , harmless , and can't move .
But the Venus flytrap acts like an animal , it moves fast and eats fresh meat . "
Elusive origins
But until now , it has not been clear which plant the Venus flytrap and waterwheel evolved from .
Waller and his colleague Thomas Gibson now think they have the answer , which they have published in the journal New Phytologist .
What is more , they think its possible to trace a series of steps that the Venus flytrap and waterwheel must have undergone to become accomplished hunters .
They started by comparing snap - traps with other carnivorous plants known as sticky traps .
The two types look very different .
While snap traps have gaping leaves , sticky traps have small leaves that are covered by simple stalks , which are often covered in sticky glue .
Many sticky trap plants belong to the genus Drosera , such as the circumboreal sundew ( Drosera rotundifolia ) , and come in various forms .
The sticky leaves of a Drosera regia plant curl around its prey A DNA analysis by Ken Cameron of the University of Wisconsin confirmed that the Venus flytrap and waterwheel are indeed related , and the closest relative of both turns out to be a species called Drosera regia .
Then Waller and Gibson mapped out the steps that would have been required to evolve from a sticky trap ancestor into a snap - trap .
First the ancestral plant must have adapted to move its tentacles and leaves in a particular direction , giving it a greater chance of sticking to and engulfing a passing insect .
Next it sped up how quickly it detected prey and tried to respond .
Then the plant would have had to find a way to become selective , so it only tried to trap live prey and not any detritus that landed upon it .
Finally , it must have evolved its tentacles into sensory hairs and teeth that detect and wrap around prey , respectively , while also losing its sticky glands and growing new digestive glands capable of digesting the victim 's corpse .
But that raises the question of what strong selection pressure could have driven the evolution of such an extraordinary series of adaptations ?
Bigger and better
The short answer , say Waller and Gibson , is the benefits of eating ever larger prey .
" Capturing big prey provides big rewards to any carnivorous plant , and snap - traps can immobilize and digest these bigger prey far more effectively than the sticky fly - paper type traps we see in sundews , " says Waller .
" A bug twice as long as another has more like eight times the biomass and nutrients , so these rewards accelerate as prey get bigger .
This is why flytraps build bigger traps as soon as they can , unlike almost all other plants where the size of leaves or traps remains the same as plants get bigger . "
Waller also suspects that engulfing and sealing in prey may also provide other advantages to the Venus flytrap and waterwheel .
It stops other more sure - footed predators coming along and stealing a captured insect or spider , he says , and any nutrients being washed away by water or rain before the plant can digest them .
Answering such questions is particularly important because the Venus flytrap is becoming increasing rare in the wild , and should be listed as endangered in the US , where it only lives in North and South Carolina , says Waller .
Knowing its evolutionary history will help botanists work out , for example , if it is becoming dangerously inbred .

We can make their polluting society unworkable and unprofitable .
We can win real action to address climate change .
We have the power .
Mass civil disobedience by a significant minority can stop the wheels of business , at least temporarily .
After the failure of Copenhagen , blocking coal trains on the way to port in Newcastle was a great symbolic action showing the bosses and their politicians what may lay ahead .
It will not be enough .
The task is to turn the symbolic into the everyday .
We must turn the world upside down until the polluters and their politicians back down and begin the urgent task of moving to a renewable energy economy and creating hundreds of thousands of high wage green jobs for those displaced by the end of killer coal and other changes needed .
This is not about limiting temperature rises to 2 degrees centigrade .
It is about returning to 350 parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere from the current 390 , a figure growing by almost two parts per million a year .
We stand in a grand tradition – Gandhi , Martin Luther King , Nelson Mandela .
It was the mass democratic and radical wings of their movements which took the struggle forward .
The task is urgent .
As James Hansen argues we are approaching tipping points in climate change which will produce feedback effects whose catastrophic impacts can only be guessed at .
The Greens in Australia have an historic opportunity and duty to lead and build this movement .
I doubt their politics and their marriage to parliamentary niceties will see them do so .
The key to successful action is as always the class that produces the bosses ’ wealth .
The entrenched conservative trade union leadership around the Australian Council of Trade Unions is an impediment to any struggle for real action on climate change .
We must appeal to the rank and file unionists to force their unions to take action to save the planet before the bosses destroy us .
Stopping their profits concentrates the bosses ’ mind like nothing else and what before seemed impossible becomes a manageable task .
This is not just an appeal to workers in the polluting industries .
It is an appeal to all workers to save our planet from the pollution that profit produces .
At the moment i Australia postal workers , Qantas workers and others are striking over pay and conditions .
Let ’s support those fighting for economic justice and link their fight with ours – for a future world where we will still have jobs and an environment .
Industrial action over climate change will be illegal .
Defy their laws to save our planet .
This movement has to be a world - wide one .
While the fight begins here it has to spread across the globe if we are to be successful .
We in Australia must begin to build our forces , just as those in Europe and America and across the developed and developing world will and must do .
We are for a mass democratic and radical movement to stop the polluters destroying our home .
It will be no easy task taking on the political and economic dictatorship in China and the economic dictatorship in the United States .
Only a strong working class movement can do that .
The task appears daunting .
But to do nothing is to consign the planet to possible oblivion .
In the past ordinary working people have through extraordinary struggles re-made the world for their own benefit .
We can do so again .
We have a world to win .
Today .
By George Friedman U.S. President Barack Obama announced the broad structure of his Afghanistan strategy in a speech at West Point on Tuesday evening .
The strategy had three core elements .
First , he intends to maintain pressure on al Qaeda on the Afghan - Pakistani border and in other regions of the world .
Second , he intends to blunt the Taliban offensive by sending an additional 30,000 American troops to Afghanistan , along with an unspecified number of NATO troops he hopes will join them .
Third , he will use the space created by the counteroffensive against the Taliban and the resulting security in some regions of Afghanistan to train and build Afghan military forces and civilian structures to assume responsibility after the United States withdraws .
Obama added that the U.S. withdrawal will begin in July 2011 , but provided neither information on the magnitude of the withdrawal nor the date when the withdrawal would conclude .
He made it clear that these will depend on the situation on the ground , adding that the U.S. commitment is finite .
In understanding this strategy , we must begin with an obvious but unstated point :
The extra forces that will be deployed to Afghanistan are not expected to defeat the Taliban .
Instead , their mission is to reverse the momentum of previous years and to create the circumstances under which an Afghan force can take over the mission .
The U.S. presence is therefore a stopgap measure , not the ultimate solution .
The ultimate solution is training an Afghan force to engage the Taliban over the long haul , undermining support for the Taliban , and dealing with al Qaeda forces along the Pakistani border and in the rest of Afghanistan .
If the United States withdraws all of its forces as Obama intends , the Afghan military would have to assume all of these missions .
Therefore , we must consider the condition of the Afghan military to evaluate the strategy 's viability .
Afghanistan vs. Vietnam Obama went to great pains to distinguish Afghanistan from Vietnam , and there are indeed many differences .
The core strategy adopted by Richard Nixon ( not Lyndon Johnson ) in Vietnam , called " Vietnamization , " saw U.S. forces working to blunt and disrupt the main North Vietnamese forces while the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) would be trained , motivated and deployed to replace U.S. forces to be systematically withdrawn from Vietnam .
The equivalent of the Afghan surge was the U.S. attack on North Vietnamese Army ( NVA ) bases in Cambodia and offensives in northern South Vietnam designed to disrupt NVA command and control and logistics and forestall a major offensive by the NVA .
Troops were in fact removed in parallel with the Cambodian offensives .
Nixon faced two points Obama now faces .
First , the United States could not provide security for South Vietnam indefinitely .
Second , the South Vietnamese would have to provide security for themselves .
The role of the United States was to create the conditions under which the ARVN would become an effective fighting force ; the impending U.S. withdrawal was intended to increase the pressure on the Vietnamese government to reform and on the ARVN to fight .
Many have argued that the core weakness of the strategy was that the ARVN was not motivated to fight .
This was certainly true in some cases , but the idea that the South Vietnamese were generally sympathetic to the Communists is untrue .
Some were , but many were n't , as shown by the minimal refugee movement into NVA - held territory or into North Vietnam itself contrasted with the substantial refugee movement into U.S. / ARVN - held territory and away from NVA forces .
The patterns of refugee movement are , we think , highly indicative of true sentiment .
Certainly , there were mixed sentiments , but the failure of the ARVN was not primarily due to hostility or even lack of motivation .
Instead , it was due to a problem that must be addressed and overcome if the Afghanistation war is to succeed .
That problem is understanding the role that Communist sympathizers and agents played in the formation of the ARVN .
By the time the ARVN expanded — and for that matter from its very foundation — the North Vietnamese intelligence services had created a systematic program for inserting operatives and recruiting sympathizers at every level of the ARVN , from senior staff and command positions down to the squad level .
The exploitation of these assets was not random nor merely intended to undermine moral .
Instead , it provided the NVA with strategic , operational and tactical intelligence on ARVN operations , and when ARVN and U.S. forces operated together , on U.S. efforts as well .
In any insurgency , the key for insurgent victory is avoiding battles on the enemy 's terms and initiating combat only on the insurgents ' terms .
The NVA was a light infantry force .
The ARVN — and the U.S. Army on which it was modeled — was a much heavier , combined - arms force .
In any encounter between the NVA and its enemies the NVA would lose unless the encounter was at the time and place of the NVA 's choosing .
ARVN and U.S. forces had a tremendous advantage in firepower and sheer weight .
But they had a significant weakness :
The weight they bought to bear meant they were less agile .
The NVA had a tremendous weakness .
Caught by surprise , it would be defeated .
And it had a great advantage :
Its intelligence network inside the ARVN generally kept it from being surprised .
It also revealed weakness in its enemies ' deployment , allowing it to initiate successful offensives .
All war is about intelligence , but nowhere is this truer than in counterinsurgency and guerrilla war , where invisibility to the enemy and maintaining the initiative in all engagements is key .
Only clear intelligence on the enemy 's capability gives this initiative to an insurgent , and only denying intelligence to the enemy — or knowing what the enemy knows and intends — preserves the insurgent force .
The construction of an Afghan military is an obvious opportunity for Taliban operatives and sympathizers to be inserted into the force .
As in Vietnam , such operatives and sympathizers are not readily distinguishable from loyal soldiers ; ideology is not something easy to discern .
With these operatives in place , the Taliban will know of and avoid Afghan army forces and will identify Afghan army weaknesses .
Knowing that the Americans are withdrawing as the NVA did in Vietnam means the rational strategy of the Taliban is to reduce operational tempo , allow the withdrawal to proceed , and then take advantage of superior intelligence and the ability to disrupt the Afghan forces internally to launch the Taliban offensives .
The Western solution is not to prevent Taliban sympathizers from penetrating the Afghan army .
Rather , the solution is penetrating the Taliban .
In Vietnam , the United States used signals intelligence extensively .
The NVA came to understand this and minimized radio communications , accepting inefficient central command and control in return for operational security .
The solution to this problem lay in placing South Vietnamese into the NVA .
There were many cases in which this worked , but on balance , the NVA had a huge advantage in the length of time it had spent penetrating the ARVN versus U.S. and ARVN counteractions .
The intelligence war on the whole went to the North Vietnamese .
The United States won almost all engagements , but the NVA made certain that it avoided most engagements until it was ready .
In the case of Afghanistan , the United States has far more sophisticated intelligence - gathering tools than it did in Vietnam .
Nevertheless , the basic principle remains :
An intelligence tool can be understood , taken into account and evaded .
By contrast , deep penetration on multiple levels by human intelligence cannot be avoided .
Pakistan 's Role Obama mentioned Pakistan 's critical role .
Clearly , he understands the lessons of Vietnam regarding sanctuary , and so he made it clear that he expects Pakistan to engage and destroy Taliban forces on its territory and to deny Afghan Taliban supplies , replacements and refuge .
He cited the Swat and South Waziristan offensives as examples of the Pakistanis ' growing effectiveness .
While this is a significant piece of his strategy , the Pakistanis must play another role with regard to intelligence .
The heart of Obama 's strategy lies not in the surge , but rather in turning the war over to the Afghans .
As in Vietnam , any simplistic model of loyalties does n't work .
There are Afghans sufficiently motivated to form the core of an effective army .
As in Vietnam , the problem is that this army will contain large numbers of Taliban sympathizers ; there is no way to prevent this .
The Taliban is not stupid :
It has and will continue to move its people into as many key positions as possible .
The challenge lies in leveling the playing field by inserting operatives into the Taliban .
Since the Afghan intelligence services are inherently insecure , they can't carry out such missions .
American personnel bring technical intelligence to bear , but that does not compensate for human intelligence .
The only entity that could conceivably penetrate the Taliban and remain secure is the Pakistani Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) .
This would give the Americans and Afghans knowledge of Taliban plans and deployments .
This would diminish the ability of the Taliban to evade attacks , and although penetrated as well , the Afghan army would enjoy a chance ARVN never had .
But only the ISI could do this , and thinking of the ISI as secure is hard to do from a historical point of view .
The ISI worked closely with the Taliban during the Afghan civil war that brought it to power and afterwards , and the ISI had many Taliban sympathizers .
The ISI underwent significant purging and restructuring to eliminate these elements over recent years , but no one knows how successful these efforts were .
The ISI remains the center of gravity of the entire problem .
If the war is about creating an Afghan army , and if we accept that the Taliban will penetrate this army heavily no matter what , then the only counter is to penetrate the Taliban equally .
Without that , Obama 's entire strategy fails as Nixon 's did .
In his talk , Obama quite properly avoided discussing the intelligence aspect of the war .
He clearly cannot ignore the problem we have laid out , but neither can he simply count on the ISI .
He does not need the entire ISI for this mission , however .
He needs a carved out portion — compartmentalized and invisible to the greatest possible extent — to recruit and insert operatives into the Taliban and to create and manage communication networks so as to render the Taliban transparent .
Given Taliban successes of late , it is n't clear whether he has this intelligence capability .
Either way , we would have to assume that some Pakistani solution to the Taliban intelligence issue has been discussed ( and such a solution must be Pakistani for ethnic and linguistic reasons ) .
Every war has its center of gravity , and Obama has made clear that the center of gravity of this war will be the Afghan military 's ability to replace the Americans in a very few years .
If that is the center of gravity , and if maintaining security against Taliban penetration is impossible , then the single most important enabler to Obama 's strategy would seem to be the ability to make the Taliban transparent .
Therefore , Pakistan is important not only as the Cambodia of this war , the place where insurgents go to regroup and resupply , but also as a key element of the solution to the intelligence war .
It is all about Pakistan .
And that makes Obama 's plan difficult to execute .
It is far easier to write these words than to execute a plan based on them .
But to the extent Obama is serious about the Afghan army taking over , he and his team have had to think about how to do this .

Global warming creeps across the world at a speed of a quarter of a mile each year , according to a new study that highlights the problems that rising temperatures pose to plants and animals .
Species that can tolerate only a narrow range of temperatures will need to move as quickly if they are to survive .
Wildlife in lowland tropics , mangroves and desert areas are at greater risk than species in mountainous areas , the study suggests .
" These are the conditions that will set the stage , whether species move or cope in place , " said Chris Field , director of the department of global ecology at the Carnegie Institution in the US , who worked on the project .
" Expressed as velocities , climate change projections connect directly to survival prospects for plants and animals . "
The study , by scientists at the Carnegie Institution , Stanford University , the California Academy of Sciences , and the University of California , Berkeley , combined information on current and projected future climate to calculate a " temperature velocity " for different parts of the world .
They found that mountainous areas will have the lowest velocity of temperature change , meaning that animals will not need to move very far to stay in the temperature range of their natural habitat .
However , much larger geographic displacements are required in flatter areas such as flooded grasslands , mangroves and deserts , in order for animals to keep pace with their climate zone .
The researchers also found that most currently protected areas are not big enough to accommodate the displacements required .
Healy Hamilton , director of the centre for applied biodiversity informatics at the California Academy of Sciences , said : " One of the most powerful aspects of this data is that it allows us to evaluate how our current protected area network will perform as we attempt to conserve biodiversity in the face of global climate change . "
He added : " When we look at residence times for protected areas , which we define as the amount of time it will take current climate conditions to move across and out of a given protected area , only 8 % of our current protected areas have residence times of more than 100 years .
If we want to improve these numbers , we need to both reduce our carbon emissions and work quickly towards expanding and connecting our global network of protected areas . "
The study found that global warming would have the lowest velocities in tropical and subtropical coniferous forests , where it would move at about 80 metres a year , and montane grasslands and shrublands - a biome with grass and shrubs at high elevations - with a projected velocity of about 110 metres each year .
Global warming is expected to sweep more quickly across flatter areas , such as mangrove swamps and flooded grasslands and savannas , where it could have velocities above 1 km a year .
Across the world , the average velocity is 420 metres each year .
The results are published in the journal Nature .
Wildlife in areas with low projected climate change velocities are not necessarily better protected , the scientists point out .
Habitats such as broadleaf forests are often small and fragmented , which makes it harder for species to move .
The study examines the movement of climate zones , not species , the scientists stress , which means it is difficult to predict what the impacts may be on individual trees , insects and animals .
Some are more tolerant to changing temperature than others , and the movement of species can be difficult to track .
While trees are estimated to have spread northwards through a warming Europe after the end of the last ice age at a speed of about 1 km per year , this could be down to dormant seeds reseeding the landscape , which would not be possible if species are forced to shift to new territories .
The scientists say that global warming will cause temperatures to change so rapidly that almost a third of the globe could see climate velocities higher than even the most optimistic estimates of plant migration speeds .
Some plants and animals may have to be physically moved by humans to help them cope , the scientists say , while protected areas must also be enlarged and joined together .
The woman said it was an emergency - as the cat had gone on for two hours A woman made an emergency 999 call to Greater Manchester Police ( GMP ) to say her cat was " doing her head in " because it was playing with string .
The force has released audio footage of the call to remind people that the 999 service should not be abused .
The woman said it was an emergency as it had " been going on for two hours " .
Between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day , GMP said it received 1,377 999 calls , but only a fraction were genuine emergencies .
In another call a man contacted emergency services to say he was stuck on a patch of ice in a street in Bolton and was too scared to go forwards or backwards .
' Silly pranks ' GMP 's head of call handling , Supt Karan Lee , said : " We are still expecting a high volume of 999 calls on New Year 's Eve .
" Research tells us that a very high percentage of these will not actually be related to an emergency .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" I urge people to think first and only dial 999 in an emergency , where there is threat to life or property , so that we can focus on the real emergencies . "
She added : " Silly pranks can have a major impact on members of the public who need the police .
" I do n't want a person to call 999 and be delayed because someone else is calling to report something that is not an emergency or , worse still , a deliberate joke . "
Last new year , GMP 's call handlers dealt with more than 2,400 emergency calls in the six hours after midnight .

If a little dreaming is dangerous , the cure for it is not to dream less but to dream more , to dream all the time .
accurately perceive what is really happening – both outside and inside yourself ;
appreciate this present experience without the need to judge it ;
take effective action .
Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way : on purpose , in the present moment and non-judgmentally .
A. Identify experience as mental content
Notice that the mind is continually full of chatter ( making commentary or judgement ) ;
Become aware that this chattering you hear during « thinking » is no more than a discursive habit , a « script » ; Admit that the « script » or the « voice » you hear may not be concrete reality or absolute truth ; Distinguish your thoughts ( by carefully observing them ) from these « scripts » ; Release attachment to predispositions , « scripts » or « automatic reactions » and see your thoughts for what they are ( just thoughts ) without aversion or judgment .
B. Feel free to observe life

( We ’ll let Marcel Proust tell us how he discovered mindfulness in another article ) .
Let ’s change « dreaming all the time » in « being mindful all the time » .
Mindfulness practice starts with paying attention to what is going on in the body , in the mind , in our emotional life here and now .
In short , mindfulness means having « presence » - the quintessential quality of awareness that creates peak experiences in living .
By bringing your awareness to focus on what your mind experiences at the present moment , you can : In his book , Wherever You Go , There You Are : Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life , Jon Kabat - Zinn offers a good definition of mindfulness : This reminds me of a photographer who , when asked what it takes to make a good photo , answered : « Being there » .
So how can you get « there » ?( consider both inner and outer aspects of reality as aspects of the mind ) : without getting caught in the commentary / judgement trap or in the automatic identification with the « voices » and « scripts » your mind forges when « thinking » .
By practicing mindfulness , you learn to « be there » , to develop awareness throughout the day .
The aim is to make mindfulness continuous .
This may take the form of nothing more than taking a few successive breaths while remembering they are a conscious experience of body activity within mind .
Or nothing more than observing a flower , the way Marcel Proust learned to do
What are your thoughts on the subject of businesses that offer discounts to Christian customers ?
Is this practice no different from the even more common practice of granting discounts to seniors , or is there an important enough difference that one should be permitted but not the other ?
Would you spend money at such a business , knowing that you were paying more than those patrons who professed Christianity ?
I bring up this subject after a recent post at Mississippi Atheists in which one of my co-authors , Steve , encountered just such a business near his home in Biloxi , MS .
Grains of Montana , a restaurant and bakery , proudly advertises a 10 % discount to anyone who brings in a church bulletin .
According to the Freedom From Religion Foundation , this practice violates the federal Civil Rights Act .
In fact , they helped to resolve a similar case in North Carolina not too long ago .
Steve and a friend plan to visit the establishment and inquire about the size of the discount offered to atheist customers .
I can't wait to hear how that goes .
In the meantime , we are trying to get a letter - writing ( and / or email ) campaign going .
I think it is quite obvious that businesses like this resort to such tactics in an effort to attract the post - church crowd .
Here in Mississippi , that is a massive crowd indeed .
I learned long ago that Sunday was a bad time to go out to eat because of these crowds .
Attracting such crowds means considerable revenue .
It is equally obvious , to me at least , that I would never support such a business if at all possible .
Businesses who engage in such practices probably do so without realizing that they are violating the law .
I hope that the combination of pointing this out and letting them know that they are losing customers over this may help .
( CNN ) -- Skeletal remains found in a hayfield are those of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington , a spokeswoman for the Virginia State Police said Wednesday .
The remains were identified based on dental records provided by the victim 's family , spokeswoman Corinne Geller said .
Morgan Harrington , a 20 - year - old education major , went to a Metallica concert at the University of Virginia 's John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville , Virginia , on October 17 .
She was separated from her friends and was the subject of repeated searches .
" Investigators are now working to determine how the remains came to be in this particular location , cause and time of death , and identifying who was responsible for the remains being there , " Geller said in a news release .
More information is expected after the completion of an autopsy , the spokeswoman added .
Police said skeletal remains were found Tuesday morning by a farmer driving a tractor through a hay field on his 700 - acre farm .
The area has no public access point , police said .
The farm is about 10 miles from where the concert was being held .
The farm 's owner , David Dass , told CNN affiliate WTVR that he was out looking for damage after wind and rain knocked down several trees in his yard over the past week .
He told WTVR that the area is at least a mile and a half from a main roadway .
" I looked down and saw what looked like a human skull , and my first thought was that it was Morgan Harrington , " Dass told WTVR , adding that he immediately called 911 .
WTVR : State police ' confident ' remains are Harrington
There was significant evidence leading police to believe that the remains are Harrington's , Virginia State Police Col .
W. Steven Flaherty said , though he declined to specify what the evidence was .
Police said the area where the remains were found had not been searched during the early stages of the investigation into her disappearance .
The girl 's parents , Dan and Gil Harrington , were in town to identify the remains , WTVR reported .
Dan Harrington , in tears , told WTVR that " this is a horrible day " for his family .
Gil Harrington expressed concerns Saturday that there was beginning to be complacency in the search , she wrote in a blog on the Web site set up to help find their daughter .
On Sunday , more than three months after Morgan went missing , Gil Harrington still clung to hope .
" Despite the length of time Morgan has been gone I remain hopeful , " she wrote .
" Part of me is waiting to be surprised .
Waiting for God to pull the rabbit out of the hat and bring Morgan home .
" I remember that the light always returns , it can not help but return .
Will the light of my life return soon ?
I cannot imagine that all the water of Morgan 's potential is to run down the drain and be wasted .
Can it really play out like that ? "
Now , it appears , the Harringtons finally have their answer .
Police say they have now switched their focus to finding out how Morgan Harrington ended up in the remote farm and who put her there .
During the concert , Harrington left her friends to use the restroom , police said .
When she did not return , they called her cell phone at 8:48 p.m .
She told them she was outside the arena and could not get back in because of its policy , police said , but told them not to worry about her and that she would find a ride home .
There are restrooms inside the arena , police said , and police do not know how or why Harrington got outside .
Witnesses who saw her outside the arena said she did not appear to be with anyone , police said .
About 9:30 p.m. that night , witnesses reported seeing a person matching Harrington 's description walking on a nearby bridge , police said .
No further sightings were reported .
Harrington 's purse , with her identification and cell phone inside , was found the following day in an overflow parking lot near the arena , police said .
A friend had driven Harrington 's car to the concert , she said , and was still in possession of the car keys when they got separated .
Harrington was reported missing the day after the concert , when she did not show up at her parents ' home to study for a math exam with her father .
Working with police and the Texas - based Laura Recovery Center , the Harringtons organized community searches , saying they would not give up hope that their daughter would be found .
A $ 150,000 reward has been offered for information leading to Harrington 's whereabouts , police said .
Of that , Metallica contributed $ 50,000 .
The couple was joined at a news conference after her disappearance by Ed Smart , whose daughter Elizabeth was abducted in 2002 .
She returned home nine months later , after police say they found her in the custody of Brian David Mitchell and his wife , Wanda Barzee .
Harrington said he reached out to Smart last week to seek advice on how to go through the disappearance of a child .
Harrington was wearing a black Pantera T - shirt , a black miniskirt , black tights and black boots when last seen .

I do n’t believe in human rights .
Put simply , I think you should n’t get any absolute rights for just being human .
Instead , the best society rewards those who do good things and makes sure those who do destructive things are smote , while doing nothing for those who do nothing to help themselves , the rest of us and the world around us ( environment , culture , and so on ) .
I do believe in trying to do the right thing by people who are also trying to do the right thing for me and others like me .
I believe in censorship .
I believe if a TV program encourages young girls to act like sluts , those of us who know that this leads them to disaster in later life — and lonely alienation in their 40s , not to mention a declining population — will want to take the tapes and burn them .
I can see how this violates human rights , in which every person has an absolute right to do whatever they want , but human rights do n’t measure consequences .
I measure consequences .
I believe in the death penalty , or rather , death to the dysfunctional .
Life is a gift , and those who are going to defecate all over it and destroy others need to be viewed just how we ’d view technology : the failed machines go into recycling , and the good ones go on to bigger and better things .
But again , I believe in trying to do the right thing .
Voltaire has this interesting quotation :
I do not agree with what you have to say , but I ’ll defend to the death your right to say it .
For me , it ’s not censorship to defend the airing of an opposing viewpoint .
However , I also believe in doing the right thing , and that includes civility .
When we are polite , and express ourselves logically , the emotions and drama are secondary to simple communication — and getting clear the reasons for disagreement .
But then I see comments like this :
Without HELP ?
Africa would be holocausted , as it can support only 1/8 % of its population with its own resources .
Negro middle - class professionals under - preform
White counterparts by 30 % â€ “ from doctors & engineers to clerks , according to a self - described â€˜liberal - centristâ€ ™ associate of my dadâ€™s from S. Africa , they canâ€™t finish any project autonomously & steal freely .
Pure [ censored ] & halfbreeds are a biologically worthless burden , they know it deep down & most passive - agressively hate us for it .
You will note that I have n’t replicated one of the words there .
I do n’t think it ’s too much to ask to request that our visitors keep civility in mind and speak using the terms we find make the most sense out of politeness , for example , “ African - Americans . ”
It wo n’t kill you to do it , and it ensures your message is expressed clearly without throwing emotional bombs into the mix that are going to drive people away from responding logically .
And if they cannot find a logical response , they then cannot fall back on an emotional one , or if they do , they are signaling to the rest of us that they ’re not ready for that debate .
We shy away from no truth on this site .
We ’re cool with talking about ethnic differences in intelligence and other abilities , fine with talking about the third world ’s ongoing failure as not a byproduct of Western colonialism , and we ’re honest about class war and IQ , the psychology of liberalism , biological determinism and other taboo issues .
But our goal is to express them succinctly , clearly and without using words as an emotional weapon against others .
Our staff here are not all from a single ethnic group , religion or political bent .
They ’ve been picked because they ’re intelligent and realistic .
As with all of us , their realism may evolve and get better over time .
But they ’re here to be treated with respect .
Each of us who writes here is determined to face as much of the whole truth as we can discern , no matter what it says about us as individuals or our ancestors .
We do n’t yet have African - American or gay columnists , but we ’re not excluding the possibility — we are New Right , which means we ’ve cast aside the pretense of both destructive liberalism and calcified conservatism , and we ’re looking for others who face the truth .
One aspect of that truth is that no group is within needing a lot of work to get back in line , and that the same solutions can be adapted in different parts of the world to bring us together not as one grey race of cultureless modern droids , but as parallel nations striving for excellence in each of their areas .
It would be great if other people saw the wisdom in what I ’m trying to do here , and would voluntarily comply with civility , so that we do n’t need censorship .
As we like to say around here : no tyrant exists without a thoughtless population that needed and deserved him .

One of the most common e-mail questions I get is “ Should I buy Rosetta Stone Japanese ? ”
It ’s time to put an end to this e-mail silliness .
From now on , I get to link to this post and video .
Hopefully you , whoever “ you ” are ( tell me in the comments ) , can get something out of this post as well .
P.S. Want even more Japanese language resources ?

Should I buy Rosetta Stone Japanese ?
What makes Rosetta Stone “ good ” ?
Alternatives to Rosetta Stone Japanese Getting Your Opinion
Should I buy Rosetta Stone Japanese ?
The nice and quick answer would be a nice and quick “ no , probably not . ”
I ’m not saying that Rosetta Stone is bad , necessarily .
They put a ton of money into it , so of course they came up with something that ’s decent .
I ’d give them a C + or so – some parents would n’t accept a “ C ” grade , but on the other hand some parents would be super happy because they ’re used to you getting F’s all the time ( you know who you are ) .
When it comes down to it though , if you ’re going to buy Rosetta Stone , in terms of value versus what you can actually get out of it , you better be really damn rich .
I imagine a Rosetta Stone customer looks something like this :
or maybe this …
Rosetta
Stone is fine , it probably works for some people , but it ’s also a huge waste of money .
Please , if you were planning on buying Rosetta Stone , stumbled upon this article , and changed your mind , send me the extra $ 1000 so I can buy a monocle , pocket watch , and top hat .
I ’ve always wanted to look like a rich Rosetta Stone Customer .
Nya !
What Makes Rosetta Stone “ Good ” ?
There ’s a couple different versions of Rosetta Stone Japanese that you could buy .
There ’s the normal software package , which is around $ 500 .
Or , you can go with their TotalE program , which is all online and adds the benefit of having a live online Japanese teacher once a month , for a mere $ 1200 a year ( they ’ve lowered they ’re prices , good for them – $ 20 / month now ) .
The Rosetta Stone software is really spiffy , it ’s pretty glitch - free , and if you go with TotalE the pictures are a lot less corny .
All - in - all , it looks nice , which might be important to some of you when making a decision , but it still does n’t change how expensive it is , and how you could be doing a lot better than Rosetta Stone .
Here are the things that they like about themselves , though .
Rosetta Stone Loves Their Marketing Budget
They spend a ridiculous amount of money on all that advertising / marketing / mall kiosk - ing stuff .
The actual number eludes me at the moment , but I remember having myself a little heart attack when I heard it .
But it makes sense – they are the big sleeping bear of language learning .
Everyone knows who they are , and when you think “ language learning ” you probably think , at least for a couple of seconds , about Rosetta Stone as an option .
This is great for them , of course , because it makes them look like they ’re the best way to learn a new language .
This is far from true , of course , but it ’s all about how you present yourself , right ?
They do a great job of it .
At the very least , even if you are hooked by their marketing department , try sleeping on the decision at least one night , or keep reading and try out the alternatives I ’ve laid out below .
Rosetta Stone “ Immerses ” You Into the Language ( Japanese )
One thing Rosetta Stone likes about themselves is the idea that they teach you Japanese just like a baby in Japan would learn it .
No grammar , no explanation , just practice and context .
First of all , you ’re not a baby in Japan ( and if you are , you ’re probably in good shape on the learning Japanese front ) , and secondly you are n’t spending 24 hours a day in front of Rosetta Stone ( most likely ) so it ’s not anywhere near immersion ( see immersion section down below for more info ) .
At the most , you ’re probably spending an hour or two doing the Rosetta Stone thing , which definitely is n’t enough if you want to take this approach .
Either do it all the way , or do n’t do it at all .
Japanese babies do n’t have 2 hours of Japanese “ immersion ” and then 22 hours of English .
If they did , they ’d all speak English , not Japanese , and that ’s not the goal you ’re trying to head towards here .
So is Rosetta Stone Japanese Good ?
It ’s okay , I ’ll give them that , and probably not worth the money it costs ( you ’re paying a ton extra to fill their marketing budgets I imagine ) .
Unfortunately for them , there are way better ( and cheaper / free - er ) alternatives out there that blow Rosetta ’s socks off .
The only problem is these alternatives do n’t have marketing budgets like Rosetta , which means you ’ve never heard of them before ( that ’s why I ’m here ! ) .
Alternatives to Rosetta Stone Japanese
So this is the part you might have been waiting for – here are the alternatives to Rosetta Stone Japanese .
Sure , it is a big list of resources , but when used all together , you ’ll find that your Japanese learning speed will go way up ( compared to Rosetta Stone ) , you ’ll spend a lot less money , and in the end probably have a lot more fun doing it .
All these resources do a good job doing what they do , and Rosetta Stone just does a mediocre job doing all of these things .
Much better to find a hip doctor that ’s really good at hips , rather than one that ’s mediocre at hips , hearts , elbows , golfing , and boob jobs .
Am I right right , Dude , or am I right ?
( name that reference )
Immersion
We ’ve already established that Rosetta Stone does n’t cut it when it comes to immersion .
AJATT kind of pioneers this method , and he ’s a smart frood .
Here are some great resources to help immerse yourself in Japanese for more than an hour or two a day , like Rosetta Stone .
Favorite Choice : iTunes Japanese Podcasts
A lot of people have iPods , and even more people have computers , CD Players , and the like .
It ’s really easy to get Japanese podcasts for free and listen to them 24/7 ( or whenever you have a chance , even at work I ’m sure ) .
All you have to do is change your location settings on iTunes to Japan , and suddenly you have access to every free Japanese podcast on there .
You have to do a bit of a work - around to have access to things that cost money , but anything that ’s free is good to go for you .
Choice 2 : JapanesePod101 – JapanesePod101 is just what it sounds like : a website full of Japanese podcasts .
In this case , their podcasts are designed to help people learn Japanese , and they do a pretty good job at it .
There are paid programs , which get you things like PDFs and other study materials , but a lot is also available for free .
Choice 3 : YouTube : YouTube has a ton of Japanese content you can sit and listen to , or put on in the background , and it can be a lot more interesting because you get the visuals with it .
Just try and avoid subtitles , because that ’s not doing you much good unless you really actively compare and contrast as you ’re watching .
More Alternatives : Vimeo NicoNicoVideo CrunchyRoll ( and of course , several “ illegal ” options as well , which I wo n’t be listing – sorry ! )
Choice 4 : Become a Japanese Hobo –
They have pretty sweet hobo - houses .
One - way tickets to Japan are n’t as much as round trip tickets ?
Perfect immersion strategy for the person who ’s strapped for cash .
Not sure how green cards work in this situation – I imagine you ’d just become a fugitive ?
TotalE Teacher Alternatives
One of the things you get with the TotalE program is a live online teacher .
I called Rosetta Stone and got some details on this .
You get one class a month ( which you can repeat if you still do n’t get things after taking it , but it ’s the same lesson over and over ) , which changes every month as you progress .
You go over the stuff you went over in the online app , which helps solidify things .
I think this is a bit of garbage – it ’s a nice attempt at offering a good “ teacher ” solution to help guide you along , but you could still spend the $ 120 a month you ’re spending somewhere else , and get a lot more out of it .
Favorite Choice : eduFire for Live Online Classes .
When it comes to finding an online Japanese teacher , eduFire is the way to go .
There are alternatives to eduFire in the live online education space ( which will be listed below ) , but they are n’t as good for Japanese just because their listings are a bit lacking ( and the pricing can be pretty steep ) .
eduFire has free online classes as well as a subscription program ( a mere $ 29 a month for unlimited Japanese classes with live online teachers ) .
Especially with the recent study that came out from the U.S. Dept. of Education which shows online learning as being more effective , I think it ’s a no brainer ( oh , and to be fair , I should probably mention I ’m an employee here , but promise , not being bias .
Research it for yourself if you want ) .
Alternatives to eduFire : WizIQ Myngle
Choice 2 : Craigslist – Craigslist is mostly in America , but I imagine there are “ alternatives to Craigslist ” in other countries as well .
It ’s a good way to find affordable local teachers , just be careful not to accidentally join a sex or drug ring .
Choice 3 : TeachStreet – TeachStreet is aiming to become the leader when it comes to teacher listings , online or local .
Like Craigslist , they are only in certain locations , but if you ’re in a fairly big city in the U.S. you might be in luck and be able to find some great Japanese classes as well .
Rosetta Stone Clones
There have even been some Rosetta Stone clones popping up .
Complete alternatives to Rosetta Stone , and the cool thing is that they ’re pretty much all free .
There are some programs out there that do n’t have Japanese ( yet ) as well , that I ’m keeping my eye on , but here ’s what ’s available right now .
Favorite Choice – LiveMocha : Two things about LiveMocha .
First of all , I ’m not sure how they ’re going to make money , because basically they ’re offering what Rosetta Stone offers , except it ’s free , and secondly , I ’m not sure what Rosetta Stone is going to do once more people figure out about LiveMocha , because it ’s basically Rosetta Stone ( with a lot of its pitfalls as well , but hey , it ’s free ! ) .
[ Editor 's Note : Since this article was first published , LiveMocha has been shut down .
And guess who bought them .
Rosetta Stone… DUN DUN DUN !]
Japanese Vocabulary Learning Alternatives :
At Rosetta Stone , because of the whole “ baby immersion thing ” you do n’t really learn vocab in the traditional sense .
Here are some great vocab resources for you to use instead :
Favorite Choice – Smart.fm : Smart.fm does an amazing job with flashcards .
It ’s like they can read your brain in a way that helps you learn more vocab and kanji at a nice and speedy rate .
Just spend a little bit of time every day , and you ’ll be a vocab expert in no time .
Couple this with some of the other resources , and you have yourself a powerhouse .
Alternative : Anki is a lot like Smart.fm , and has it ’s own cult following .
Maybe you ’ll like it more than Smart.fm , but it ’s not for me .
Second Choice – NihongoUp : NihongoUp is a little game you can play on your computer or iPod Touch / iPhone .
Definitely takes some of the monotony out of vocab learning , and can help solidify a lot of things for you .
You can trial run it for quite a while , and the paid version is too cheap to pass up ( and the particle practice mode is gold ) .
Japanese Grammar Learning Alternatives :
Another thing that Rosetta Stone does n’t really do is “ Grammar . ”
I ’m a big fan of grammar learning + actual usage + some of that immersion stuff to make it all meld together .
Boo on you , Rosetta .
Favorite Choice – guidetojapanese.org : Tae Kim does a good job explaining grammar , and takes you all the way from basic to advanced .
He does a good job simplifying things , and of course , everything over there is free , so indulge yourself !
Second Choice – Genki Textbooks :
When it comes to textbooks , I think Genki is the best I ’ve come across so far .
Definitely not perfect by any means ( and costs $ 30 - $ 40 , which really is n’t that bad for a textbook ) , but gets the job done .
You can even use Smart.fm to practice the vocab from the textbook series .
Third Choice – Jgram.org : Jgram is a wiki of Japanese grammar .
Sometimes their explanations are better than the top two , and sometimes they ’re not .
Either way , it ’s a good resource to keep a hold of .
Japanese Language Exchange :
Language exchange is something that Rosetta Stone can’t really shake a stick at .
Learning a language with a native speaker of that language is an awesome way to have fun , meet new people , and keep up with all the things the cool kids say .
Favorite Choice – Lang - 8 : Lang - 8 is all about language exchange , which is n’t necessarily a new idea , but it ’s an idea Lang - 8 has taken and done good things with .
At Lang - 8 , you write in the language you are learning ( Japanese ? ) , and then native speakers of that language ( i.e. Japanese people ) correct your entries in a way that makes it easy to see your mistakes so you do n’t make them again .
Everything ’s free , though they have a premium plan that gets you more features and fewer ads .
Second Choice Skype Forums : I have n’t actually made my way to the Skype forums , so I ca n’t confirm this , but from what I hear you can find people to talk with that will help you learn Japanese ( and then they ’ll help you ) .
Over at Lang - 8 , as well , you can see who has added a Skype account and talk to them that way too .
So What ’s Your Opinion ?
Oof , that ’s a lot of writing , and my fingers hurt .
I bet some of you have used Rosetta Stone in the past ( or are currently using Rosetta Stone … your rich bastard you ) .
What do you think ?
What resources am I missing that you could n’t live without ( and totally beat down “ The stone ” ? ) .
Anyways , so there you have it .
That ’s my opinion on Rosetta Stone .
Decent / Okay / Mediocre , but not worth the money .
It ’s one of those situations where because they ’ve made it so expensive , people automatically think it ’s valuable , which is n’t always the case .
Either way , no matter what you decide to do , now is the best time to start learning Japanese .
You do n’t want to look back six months from now and wish you were six months into things .
That always sucks big time .
Go , figure out what your next actionable step is and start learning today .

Minutes 0:00 - 1:00
Minna - san konnnichi wa , koichi de gozaimasu .
[ meow sound ]
When I ’m checking my email inbox , I notice a couple of things .
First , I get a lot of emails .
Please do n’t email me .
Second , a lot of them are about Rosetta Stone .
And , of course , the question is always the same .
Dear Koichi … that ’s me .
What is your opinion of Rosetta Stone ?
I would like to know your opinion before I spend $ 1,000 buying Rosetta Stone .
That guy ’s a robot .
To all of you who have nice and short Youtube attention spans , the quick answer is , “ No , you probably should n’t buy Rosetta Stone . ”
It ’s not because Rosetta Stone is bad , per se .
I ’d give them a C+ or so .
You know , some parents would n’t be too happy .
Some would be happy because they ’re used to you failing .
Now , let ’s get that big white elephant gift out of the room .
Rosetta Stone is expensive .
It ’s like $ 400 to $ 500 for the software pack .
And it ’s like $ 1200 for their TotalE program .
If you ’re going to buy Rosetta Stone , you probably have like a top hat , a monocle and a pocket watch , maybe a British accent as well …
Minutes 1:01 - 2:00
Oh , look at me [ speaks in Japanese and words on screen say : British accents sound intelligent to me .
Bad representative on my part . ]
If you ’re going to spend all that money on Rosetta Stone , do n’t do it , stop , get off the ledge , go over to tofugu.com , check out all the resources that I ’ve laid out for you that are great alternatives to Rosetta Stone and then send that extra money to me because I spend all my money on cat shirts or they have eye patches and I ’m hungry , no food .
[ meow sound ]
Now , before I go on and list off a ton of resources that make up that sinewy concert of alternatives to Rosetta Stone , let me tell you what Rosetta Stone has going for it or at least what they think they have going for them .
First of all , they spend a ridiculous amount on advertising and they have airport kiosks and mall kiosks .
Ca n’t beat the mall kiosks except for that hermit crab kiosk and the kiosk where you can get that cigarette that ’s not actually a cigarette but it ’s actually a gadget .
But , since they spend so much money on advertising …
Minutes 2:01-3:00
likely than not you ’ve heard of them .
And , if you ’re watching this video , then maybe you are actually considering buying from them .
They have a really good marketing strategy and a pool full of gold that they can swim through .
That , right there alone , is the key to success .
Now , most of the really cool resources that are available out there for free or very cheap .
They do n’t have this kind of resource .
In fact , if you ’re paying for Rosetta Stone , more likely than not , a lot of the money you ’re putting in there is going straight towards the marketing budget .
That ’s why everything costs so much .
So they have good marketing .
That ’s reason number one why Rosetta Stone is pretty good .
Now , Rosetta Stone has another thing that they like about themselves .
They say that they can create this “ immersive environment ” .
They teach you Japanese in a way that ’s just like a baby in Japan would learn the language .
Waaaah .
This , of course , is total B.S. , because you ’re not actually inside of an immersive environment .
More likely than not , you ’re only gonna spend one to two hours at the very most , everyday , on Rosetta Stone .
That leaves
Minutes 3:01 -4:00
That leaves 22 other hours .
You do n’t need to spend all that money to create an immersive environment for yourself .
You can do all sorts of other things like , for example , downloading Japanese podcasts and listening to them .
It ’s really easy .
It ’s free .
All you have to do is change your location setting in Itunes to Japan and you have access to thousands of Japanese podcasts .
On top of that , there ’s a ton of Japanese programming available on the Internet through Youtube [ sounds like vimeo ] , Crunchy Roll , all those kind of things .
If you want to immerse yourself in Japanese , you do n’t need Rosetta Stone to do it for you .
In fact , if you are planning on spending $ 1,000 bucks on Rosetta Stone , use that $ 1,000 bucks to become a Japanese hobo .
Get that one way ticket over to Japan , become a hobo .
You ’ll learn a lot faster and a lot better that way .
It ’ll be fun .
Please note that I am not liable for any injury or death from anyone who becomes a hobo in Japan .
I said it .
That being said , that is just the tip of the iceberg in a world without global warming .
There are a lot other resources , a lot other alternatives …
Minutes 4:01 - 5:01
There are a lot of other resources , a lot of other alternatives to anything that Rosetta Stone throws at you and you ’ll find them all over at tofugu.com , link on the right .
Basically , what I ’m trying to say is you do n’t have to spend a ton of money to learn Japanese .
The overall conclusion to the question , Should I learn Japanese using Rosetta Stone is ‘ no . ’”
If you want to know why and you want to see all of the cheaper or freer alternatives that absolutely destroy Rosetta Stone , check out the article that ’s linked on the right .
And that is it for this video .
Thank you so much for watching and go learn some Japanese now .
Hey , coming up is a commercial , but after the commercial … it ’s a good commercial by the way … after the commercial you get a little [ sounds like magay ] , a little extra , right ?
Alright .
So Christmas is coming up .
Oh , no .
How am I going to buy cool Christmas presents from Japan for people that like Japanese things ?
I do n’t know .
Maybe , you can check out flutterscape .
Flutter what ?
Flutterscape .
Well , what ’s that ?
Oh , you do n’t know flutterscape ?
It ’s really cool cause people in Japan
Minutes 5:01 - End
People in Japan , they take picutres of neat things in stores .
And then you can say , hey , can you buy that for me and send it to me ?
I ’ll pay you a little extra and pay for shipping .
Oh that sounds cool .
Yeah it ’s pretty neat .
People take lots of pictures of cool things and you just buy from them and it ’s totally safe and stuff .
Oh , that ’s nice .
So what kind of stuff do they have ?
Oh , you know , cool Japanese things .
Anything ?
But in all seriousness , Flutterscape , one of the coolest ideas I ’ve ever seen .
It ’s just like how I described it .
People take pictures of things .
You ask them , you say , hey can you buy that for me ?
And they say , yeah .
And they go to the store .
They buy it .
They send it to a shipping center which makes sure they actually send it .
And they send it to you .
You sned them the money .
Everything works out and you buy stuff .
Like , from stores from Japan .
It ’s like you ’re there except for it takes a little while longer .
Smart idea .

The race to find exoplanets — planets outside our solar system — continues to quicken .
Last week NASA researchers announced that the agency 's new space telescope , Kepler , has discovered five new exoplanets , expanding the number of known exoplanets to 422 , an increase of about 25 percent in the past year alone .
A satellite proposed by MIT researchers could accelerate these discoveries and even detect hundreds of Earth - sized planets — a few of which could be natural candidates for life .
The MIT team , led by Senior Research Scientist George Ricker of the Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research , is awaiting NASA approval for the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ( TESS ) , which would conduct the first - ever spaceborne survey of transiting planets , or planets that pass in front of their host stars as seen from Earth .
By searching a region of the sky 400 times larger than revealed by Kepler 's scope , TESS would observe 2.5 million of the closest and brightest stars when it is launched .
Ricker 's team predicts it would detect between 1,600 and 2,700 planets within two years , including between 100 and 300 small planets .
" Although TESS should find hundreds of small planets , only a handful would be in the ' habitable zone ' and would be natural candidates for life , " said MIT assistant professor of physics Joshua Winn , who is part of Ricker 's team .
Most of the 422 exoplanets discovered to date ( and catalogued here by astronomer Jean Schneider of the Paris Observatory ) are hot Jupiters , giant planets that are likely inhospitable to biological activity .
TESS would focus on finding smaller planets similar in size to Earth .
Using six wide - angled , high - precision cameras to scan the sky for temporary drops in brightness caused when a planet passes in front of its star , TESS would measure the light obscured by a planet as it transits .
TESS would then catalog the light curves caused by these transits so that follow - up work through ground observations and high - resolution spectroscopy can determine the planet 's mass , radius and density .
Spectroscopic studies with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope of bright exoplanets found by TESS could reveal details about a planet 's atmosphere , such as whether water or carbon dioxide exist .
Ricker 's team disclosed details about TESS in its first comprehensive public presentation at the annual American Astronomical Society conference on Jan. 6 in Washington .
A mix of science and guesswork
Winn and fellow MIT professor Sara Seager explained the science behind their estimate that TESS could detect as many as 2,700 planets , including several hundred Earth - sized planets .
Estimating how many planets TESS would find is a complicated process that Winn compares to counting how many people in a crowded stadium are waving cigarette lighters at the moment you take off a blindfold .
The number would depend on how far away your eyes can detect a flame , as well as how many people are actually waving lighters at that moment .
" The first question is a physics question , " Winn explained .
" The second question is unanswerable unless you happen to know exactly how many people carry lighters and are likely to wave them around . "
Add to that the fact that the flame from each lighter may have a different brightness , just as stars may differ in brightness and planets may differ in size .
These factors had to be taken into account to estimate how many planets TESS might find .
To reach their estimate , the scientists made an educated guess about how many of these stars actually have planets orbiting them , based on information already known about giant planets , such as orbital distance and size .
" It 's a bit more complicated , but we assume in this case that all planets are equally common , and that the abundance is about the same as the abundance of giant planets , " Winn said of the several hundred giant exoplanets that have been found to date .
The scientists then considered certain properties of the stars and of TESS , such as stellar luminosity and the size of the camera lenses , to estimate how many Earth - like planets will transit their host stars from a distance that TESS could probe .
Schneider said that although he has n't examined the numbers in detail , he believes the estimate and methodology are " a reasonable order of magnitude " given his experience with other satellites searching for exoplanets .
While the overall estimate is not surprising to the MIT team , it is the prospect of finding 100 to 300 Earth - sized planets that tantalizes astronomers .
The TESS project began in 2007 when NASA announced its Small Explorer ( SMEX ) satellite program to provide funding for science missions using small to mid-sized spacecraft .
In June 2008 , NASA selected Ricker 's team , which includes scientists from MIT , the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and NASA - Ames Research Center , to receive $ 750,000 for an initial feasibility study .
A year later , NASA elected not to proceed with TESS , but said the MIT - led group and other teams could submit new proposals later this year .
Ricker 's team is currently working on implementing modifications to the original proposal .
" We are really making the case for NASA and the astronomy community as a whole to establish that this must be the next big leap that will be made in this field , " Ricker said .
TESS is part of a joint effort between the Kavli Institute , the Department of Physics and the Department of Earth , Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT to study exoplanets .
The project also involves scientists at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics , NASA Ames Research Center , NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network .
If you see a good surfing wave , just shoot a free panorama or a 360 to share it with other surfers .
It is easy and fun with pixeet and its fisheye lens .
I 'm no vegetarian , in fact I firmly believe that if God did n't want us to eat animals , He would not have made them so darn delicious .
To compound that , have you seen my canine teeth ?
They 're like razors ; and furthermore , I do love me some good - good In - N - Out , crisp bacon wrapped around a tender Fillet Mignon , and some Panko encrusted Veal Parmigiana .
The fact remains , that much of the US meat industry is riddled with problems .
Government subsidized corn and soy artificially drive down the price of meat in this country to the point where a double cheeseburger costs less than a large tomato .
I love double cheese burgers , but still , that should n't be so .
Hormones , antibiotics , animal rights .
Cardiovascular disease , cholesterol , obesity .
Hinduism , Zen Buddhism - even Catholics abstaining from " meat " on Fridays .
Mass production , pollution ; there 's a new pun in " pork - barrel " corruption .
Your own health , the overall health of the animals .
The reasons to eat less meat are many , why do we consume so much of it ?
It is practically " Un- American " not to have meat at every meal .
A wonderful Spanish professor of mine , the late Tim McGovern , told me a story about ordering a cheese pizza in Commerce , Texas where the Manager came out and watched him eat it - because he had never heard of someone ordering a pizza without meat .
Yes America , we are like that .
According to a recent article in USA Today , the Department of Agriculture estimates that it takes about 15 pounds of feed to make 1 pound of beef .
Later in the article they quote Nathan Fiala , a doctoral candidate in environmental economics at the University of California Irvine , " A family of four that gives up eating beef one day a week has basically traded in their pickup for a Prius . "
I do n't want to lecture about the horrors of meat but I got to thinking as of late because some friends of mine are going vegetarian from Thanksgiving to Christmas .
They 'll owe the other one $ 100 if they cheat .
I thought it was a great idea .
Think about this for a second , Smithfield Packing Company in Tar Heel , North Carolina is capable of butchering over 32,000 pigs a day ( according to the Wiki ) .
That 's faster than one pig every three seconds .
If you do n't think that 's your ham , they make Butterball .
And just in case you have n't seen any good footage from slaughterhouses recently , I 'm posting some here .

One guy says to the Inspector after a cow stumbles and falls to the ground because it's too weak to walk , " That looks like you Friday night ! "
Hilarity ensues .
Runner up quote ?
USDA Inspector , " Next time just tell Frank or Terry , ' cause that 's something I 'm not supposed to know .
' Cause I could shut them down for that . "

This " Apple memo " that appeared mysteriously on Fake Steve Jobs ' site plans an all - out iPhone attack on AT&T 's network this Friday , December 18 at noon Pacific :
Subject : Operation Chokehold
On Friday , December 18 , at noon Pacific time , we will attempt to overwhelm the AT&T data network and bring it to its knees .
The goal is to have every iPhone user ( or as many as we can ) turn on a data intensive app and run that app for one solid hour .
Send the message to AT&T that we are sick of their substandard network and sick of their abusive comments .
The idea is we 'll create a digital flash mob .
We 're calling it in Operation Chokehold .
Join us and speak truth to power !

Since news broke of Google ’s own Android - powered smartphone , the Nexus One , the Net ’s gone wild for the phone .
Some enterprising fellows have even taken apart a leaked ROM and worked out what ’s inside it :
Good stuff , that ’s what .
The ROM hackers concerned are the guys at TheseAreTheDroids , and they took it upon themselves to sift through the data in a leaked Android 2.1 ROM from a Nexus One .
Hidden in the code is all the necessary info to work out what powers the beast–and what they found is interesting .
There ’s the usual accelerometers , proximity and ambient light sensors that are now de rigeur in touchscreen smartphones thanks to the iPhone , a magnetic compass , references to the autofocus camera with LED flash , Bluetooth , and dual - mic noise canceling chips .
Then there are four neat facts that seem to support rumors of the very best pieces of hardware in the phone : OpenGL ES 2.0 graphics support , 802.11N
Wi -fi , stereo FM receiver , and a Snapdragon CPU .
This is very exciting stuff .
Why so ?
Because the Snapdragon at the top end of its 1GHz capability clocks in at nearly twice the chip speed of the CPU inside the Motorola Droid – the other Android phone people got all hot under the collar about recently ( even though perhaps they should n’t have ) .
OpenGL graphics combined with a hot processor means the Nexus is going to be very capable indeed , and high - powered , 3 - D graphics - heavy games should be a serious possibility–aided by the phone ’s large screen .
It ’ll be as capable of the iPhone in this regard , for sure , and could even surpass it .
Wireless ‘ n ’ specs will also mean the phone can pull down data at a much higher rate over Wi - fi than nearly every other smartphone out there ( including the iPhone ) since they use the older and slower b and g standards .
And the stereo FM is a lovely touch that even Apple has n’t seen fit to adopt yet –except on the newly - revamped iPod Nano .
There may even be FM transmission powers –making the phone handy for in - car use .
The upshot of this hacking effort is that the Nexus One has been revealed to be quite the Droid - beater , which will certainly have the executives at Motorola hopping mad–should rumors that Google will sell this phone to the public unlocked from next January prove true ( and if Google gets the price right with all this expensive - sounding tech inside . )
Those rumors are getting hotter all the time , driven by more news surfacing on the Web like the video of the phone in action below , and now Google ’s applied for a trademark on the name .
But that might prove to be one tiny sticking point in Google ’s plans :
As I pointed out Nexus is a name very closely associated with the androids in Blade Runner , and the estate of original author Philip K . Dick is n’t best pleased .
They ’ve contacted their lawyers , and Google will be hearing from them shortly –it might have to hand over a wodge of cash before it gets permission to use the name properly .
Else the family will be sending their Nexus Six around as a “ persuader . ”
Brickhouse Security ’s Micro Bluetooth Earpiece is so small it actually fits inside the ear canal to allow covert two - way communication via any Bluetooth mobile phone or two - way radio .
Its size means that a battery is out of the question , so the tiny device is powered by magnetism , which is also used to remove the earpiece from the ear canal .
The earpiece , which is actually a strong passive magnet , receives the audio signal via vibration from an induction - type neck loop transmitter draped over the user ’s shoulders .
Working on a vibration principle not only allows for the unit ’s small size by doing away with the need for a battery , but also means it has no open sound cavity .
Four sizes of magnetic earpiece are included ranging from extra small for pixie - esque ears to Michael Phelps large .
The earpiece also comes with a microphone , which can be concealed under clothing , where Brickhouse claims it is still able to pick up the faintest sounds .
Meanwhile , for those occasions when you ca n’t talk there ’s the silent SOS Button .
The button is attached to a wire that is long enough to run down a pant leg and allow the button to be placed underneath your toe or hidden inside a pocket .
Upon pressing the beeper button , a beep tone is sent to your associates over the phone , no matter where they are in the world .
The covert SOS button could be used to signal one click for yes , two clicks for no .
Any spy worth their salt , however , will be able to get more advanced with full fledged SOS beep communication , without anyone thinking they have anything more than a nervous tic .
The microphone , beeper button and neck loop transmitter are all connected to a Bluetooth Board - a PCB board small enough to fit in a pocket that is powered by a 9V battery .
The device was originally designed for the Secret Service but is now available to the general public .
Some possible uses suggested by Brickhouse include on - camera journalists , actors and actresses who need to be fed lines , and modern day Cyranos looking for some instant feedback on their first date performance .
Unfortunately use while gambling or during tests is advised against .
There ’s either been a shortage of Brickhouse Security Invisible Bluetooth earpieces rolling off the production line , or there are a lot more spies getting about than I had realized – which I guess would make them good at their job .
The earpiece , which is currently out of stock until January 2010 due to “ overwhelming demand , ” usually retails for US$ 300 , but is currently available for pre-order at $ 219.95 .

On the eve of major international climate change negotiations in Copenhagen , belief in global warming in the United States has slipped to the lowest point in 12 years of measuring , according to a poll from New York - based Harris Interactive Inc .
As U.S. negotiators fly to the Danish capital to forge a political agreement based on President Obama 's proposal to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by about 17 percent , most of the American public does n't know what the talks are about , according to the Harris survey .
Just 51 percent of adults questioned said they believed carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would cause the Earth 's average temperature to increase .
Two years ago , fully 71 percent of respondents linked greenhouse gases directly to global warming .
The Harris results follow polls in recent months from the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press , the The Washington Post and ABC News , and The Wall Street Journal and NBC showing a similar decline in the percentage of people who believe climate change is real and is caused by emissions from fossil fuels .
" This is a big problem for the president , " said Julian Zelizer , a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University .
" One of the main tactics of opponents of environmental regulation since the 1940s has been to challenge the science . "
The dramatic 30 - percentage - point drop over two years in the Harris poll is the starkest indicator yet that belief in climate change has plummeted in a short amount of time .
The shift in numbers since 2007 came from a 15 - point percentage increase from those saying they " are not sure " about the cause of climate change .
The results of a poll commissioned by the European Commission , released yesterday , showed that 90 percent of Europeans view climate change as a " serious problem , " one that ranks second behind concerns about world poverty and starvation .
Sixty - three percent of Europeans polled in September , for example , believed that addressing climate change will be beneficial to their economies .
The polling in Europe was done in August and September .
Growing ' partisan gap ' dominates climate and other issues
For analysts , the roots of the U.S. public 's growing climate skepticism lie in an increasing partisanship dominating the political arena on a range of issues , from health care to the federal deficit .
Furthermore , climate change already stood as an issue more divisive politically than most , according to many polls .
" We 're seeing an increasing partisan gap in perceptions of Obama , " said Karlyn Bowman , a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute .
She noted that most of the disbelief in climate science inherent in the recent assessments is driven by shifts in Republican and independent voters .
The Harris poll , for example , noted that 73 percent of Democrats believe that greenhouse gas emissions cause global warming , compared to 28 percent of Republicans and 49 percent of independents .
Similarly , the Pew poll found that the dive in the overall number of people believing in the existence and cause of climate change came mainly from shifts in responses among Republicans and independents .
In April 2008 , for example , 75 percent of independents in that poll said there was solid evidence of global warming , compared to 53 percent in October 2009 .
When you break down independents even further , into the " lean Republican " or " lean Democrat " category , you find the same partisan patterns on climate change , said Mark Mellman , a Democratic pollster who has met with Democratic leaders and Obama officials .
More Republicans and Republican - sympathetic people do not believe that man-made emissions cause the Earth to warm , he said .
Lagging economy and cool summer may also be factors
Yet Carroll Doherty , an associate director at the Pew Center , said that political party affiliation is not the only factor at play , even though it is the dominant one .
The lagging economy may be playing a role in how people feel about climate change , he said .
He also noted there was some " trace evidence " that weather factors into people 's thinking .
" In places where the areas of summer temperatures were much below normal , people were less likely to say they believe in global warming , " Doherty said about some of the Pew Center 's recent polling .
As Obama prepares to give a speech in Copenhagen , 52 percent of Americans do n't know that the talks there are related to climate change , according to Harris .
Nine percent guessed the global economic crisis was the main item on the agenda .
Pew found a parallel lack of awareness in October about " cap and trade " as a concept , with 55 percent of respondents reporting that they had heard nothing about the idea .
Cap and trade is the main plan under consideration in Congress to curtail U.S. greenhouse gas emissions via bills passed by the House and a Senate committee this year .
A ' serious problem , ' but what is it ?
Mellman countered , though , that a lack of a familiarity with the details of climate policies or international negotiations does not mean the public wo n't get behind a plan to control global warming .
He noted that many of the same polls reporting a growing disbelief in climate science also state that the public wants Congress to do something about the issue .
Indeed , amid the low numbers about belief in the cause of climate change , the Harris poll reported that 75 percent of people said global warming should be treated as a " serious problem , " though the percentage of respondents who said it was a " very serious " problem decreased from 2007 .
The Pew poll also revealed that half of the public favors setting limits on carbon dioxide emissions , even if they may lead to higher energy prices .
For an example of how so many contradictory findings could appear in public opinion tracking , Mellman provided an overseas metaphor .
" Very few people know where Kabul is , " said Mellman about the capital of Afghanistan .
" But they do care about the war . "
The Harris poll was conducted online with 2,303 adults , Nov. 2 - 11 .
The estimated equivalent margin of error lies somewhere between 1 and 2 percentage points , said Alyssa Hall , a spokeswoman at Harris Interactive .

This astronaut photograph features one of the largest of a series of ten mostly fresh water lakes in the Ounianga Basin in the heart of the Sahara Desert of northeastern Chad .
The lakes are remnants of a single large lake , probably tens of kilometers long , that once occupied this remote area approximately 14,800 to 5,500 years ago .
As the climate dried out during the subsequent millennia , the lake shrank , and large , wind - driven sand dunes invaded the original depression , dividing it into several smaller basins .
The area shown in this image is approximately 11 by 9 kilometers .
The lakes ’ dark surfaces are almost completely segregated by linear , orange sand dunes that stream into the depression from the northeast .
The almost - year - round northeast winds and cloudless skies make for very high evaporation rates ; an evaporation rate of more than 6 meters per year has been measured in one of the nearby lakes .
Despite this , only one of the ten lakes is saline .
The reason for the apparent paradox — fresh water lakes in the heart of the desert — is that fresh water from a very large aquifer reaches the surface in the Ounianga Depression .
The aquifer is large enough to keep supplying the small lakes with water despite the high evaporation rate .
Mats of floating reeds also reduce the evaporation in places .
The lakes form a hydrological system that is unique in the Sahara Desert .
The aquifer was charged with fresh water and the original lake evolved during the African Humid Period ( about 14,800 to 5,500 years ago ) , when the West African summer monsoon was stronger than it is today .
Associated southerly winds brought Atlantic moisture well north of modern limits , producing sufficient rainfall in the central Sahara to foster an almost complete savanna vegetation cover .
Pollen data from lake sediments of the original 50 - meter - deep Ounianga Lake suggest to scientists that a mild tropical climate and a wooded grassland / savanna ecosystem existed in the region .
Ferns grew in the stream floodplains .
The same vegetation groups are now only encountered 300 kilometers farther south .
Even shrubs that now occur only on the very high , cool summits ( above 2,900 meters ) of the Tibesti Mountains have been found in the Ounianga Lake sediments .

This seems to be the new USA 10 / 12 Home football kit made by Nike to be worn at the World Cup 2010 in South Africa , and which will be available through the FSC Shop and Official Nike Store
Apparently the shirt design is based on the shirts used by the US national team at the World Cup 1950 .
In the 1950 World Cup , the United States lost its first match 3 – 1 against Spain , but then won 1–0 against England in what is widely considered one of the greatest upsets in football history , England having recently beaten the rest of Europe 6 – 1 in an exhibition match .
Sports Illustrated and Soccer Digest have called the game the " Miracle on Grass . "
Bit by bit we ’re getting information on the Obama stimulus plan , enough to start making back - of - the - envelope estimates of impact .
The bottom line is this : we ’re probably looking at a plan that will shave less than 2 percentage points off the average unemployment rate for the next two years , and possibly quite a lot less .
This raises real concerns about whether the incoming administration is lowballing its plans in an attempt to get bipartisan consensus .
In the extended entry , a look at my calculations .
The starting point for this discussion is Okun ’s Law , the relationship between changes in real GDP and changes in the unemployment rate .
Estimates of the Okun ’s Law coefficient range from 2 to 3 .
I ’ll use 2 , which is an optimistic estimate for current purposes : it says that you have to raise real GDP by 2 percent from what it would otherwise have been to reduce the unemployment rate 1 percentage point from what it would otherwise have been .
Since GDP is roughly $ 15 trillion , this means that you have to raise GDP by $ 300 billion per year to reduce unemployment by 1 percentage point .
Now , what we ’re hearing about the Obama plan is that it calls for $ 775 billion over two years , with $ 300 billion in tax cuts and the rest in spending .
Call that $ 150 billion per year in tax cuts , $ 240 billion each year in spending .
How much do tax cuts and spending raise GDP ?
The widely cited estimates of Mark Zandi of Economy.com indicate a multiplier of around 1.5 for spending , with widely varying estimates for tax cuts .
Payroll tax cuts , which make up about half the Obama proposal , are pretty good , with a multiplier of 1.29 ; business tax cuts , which make up the rest , are much less effective .
In particular , letting businesses get refunds on past taxes based on current losses , which is reportedly a key feature of the plan , looks an awful lot like a lump - sum transfer with no incentive effects .
Let ’s be generous and assume that the overall multiplier on tax cuts is 1 .
Then the per -year effect of the plan on GDP is 150 x 1 + 240 x 1.5 = $ 510 billion .
Since it takes $ 300 billion to reduce the unemployment rate by 1 percentage point , this is shaving 1.7 points off what unemployment would otherwise have been .
Finally , compare this with the economic outlook .
“ Full employment ” clearly means an unemployment rate near 5 — the CBO says 5.2 for the NAIRU , which seems high to me .
Unemployment is currently about 7 percent , and heading much higher ; Obama himself says that absent stimulus it could go into double digits .
Suppose that we ’re looking at an economy that , absent stimulus , would have an average unemployment rate of 9 percent over the next two years ; this plan would cut that to 7.3 percent , which would be a help but could easily be spun by critics as a failure .
And that gets us to politics .
This really does look like a plan that falls well short of what advocates of strong stimulus were hoping for — and it seems as if that was done in order to win Republican votes .
Yet even if the plan gets the hoped - for 80 votes in the Senate , which seems doubtful , responsibility for the plan ’s perceived failure , if it ’s spun that way , will be placed on Democrats .
I see the following scenario : a weak stimulus plan , perhaps even weaker than what we ’re talking about now , is crafted to win those extra GOP votes .
The plan limits the rise in unemployment , but things are still pretty bad , with the rate peaking at something like 9 percent and coming down only slowly .
And then Mitch McConnell says “ See , government spending does n’t work . ”
Let ’s hope I ’ve got this wrong .
The agency 's settlement prohibits three schools from promoting the use of the Kindle in classrooms
Three U.S. universities will stop promoting the use of Amazon.com 's Kindle DX e-book reader in classrooms after complaints that the device does n't give blind students equal access to information .
Settlements with Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Pace University in New York City and Reed College in Portland , Oregon , were announced Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice .
The National Federation of the Blind and the American Council of the Blind had complained that use of the Kindle devices discriminates against students with vision problems .
The complaints about the Kindle were based on the Americans with Disabilities Act , which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability .
The three universities were among six schools participating in an Amazon.com pilot program testing the use of the Kindle DX in classrooms .
On Monday , a fourth participating school , Arizona State University , also reached a settlement with the DOJ and the two organizations representing the blind .
Three other schools announced in late 2009 they will not deploy Kindle in classrooms .
The Kindle DX has the capability to convert text to synthesized speech , but the device does not include text - to - speech functionality for its menu and navigational controls , the DOJ said in a press release .
Some reviewers and users of the device 's text - to - speech software have also said the speech is difficult to listen to and the conversion can be inaccurate .
The agreements are a " step forward " for blind students , said Chris Danielsen , director of public relations at the National Federation of the Blind .
The group is encouraged that Amazon has announced improvements for the Kindle , he added .
" With regard to the Kindle DX , it can read books aloud , but a blind person cannot independently select a book , start the read - aloud function , or navigate within the book , among other things , " he added .
" In other words , a blind student could only really use the device with the assistance of a sighted person . "
Amazon.com is making changes to the Kindle to make it more accessible to blind people , a spokesman there said .
The Kindle team is working on an audio - based menu system , and the devices will have a super - size font added , Amazon said in a press release .
Those new features are due out by mid-2010 , the company said .
" Kindle is for anyone who loves to read -- in fact , we 've heard from thousands of vision - impaired customers and customers with learning disabilities over the past two years who have been helped tremendously by Kindle , " Ian Freed , vice president for Amazon Kindle , said in a statement .
" With some key modifications , we believe Kindle can be a breakthrough device for the blind , and the team is excited about making these enhancements . "
Under the agreements reached Wednesday , the universities generally will not purchase , recommend or promote use of the Kindle DX , or any other dedicated electronic book reader , unless the devices are fully accessible to students who are blind or have low vision .
The universities agreed that if they use dedicated electronic book readers , they will ensure that students with vision disabilities are able to access and acquire the same materials and information , engage in the same interactions , and enjoy the same services as sighted students with substantially equivalent ease of use .
The DOJ 's agreement with each university becomes effective at the end of the Kindle pilot projects .
" Advancing technology is systematically changing the way universities approach education , but we must be sure that emerging technologies offer individuals with disabilities the same opportunities as other students , " Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez said in a statement .
" These agreements underscore the importance of full and equal educational opportunities for everyone . "
Hundreds of Iranian men have dressed as women in Hijab to support Majid Tavakoli , a student activist who was arrested on December 7 , and express solidarity with women .
Iranian authorities claim Mr. Tavakoli was dressed as a woman to escape after delivering a speech in Tehran on Student Day .
However , human rights activists in Iran have published a report from an eyewitness saying : “ All the pictures published by the state media are false and a clear use of immoral means against student and civil activists in Iran . ”
Hundreds of Iranian men are now dressed as women in their FaceBook profiles .
Here is a YouTube video in support of Majid that has collected some of these photos ( begins after 42 seconds ) .
Stop hinting and say what you really mean .
I do n't take hints .
For example : Someone says , " Can the television get any louder ? "
I reply , " Yes , it can . "
I do n't know when you are hinting so you might as well be frank and honest with me .
So if you want me to turn the television down , just ask me to , do n't try to hint that it is turned up too loud and hope I will divine what you want .
I 've mostly given up on trying to figure out when people are trying to drop a hint to me .
When I do that I tend to see hints where none exist or misinterpret actual hints .
So the way I cope with it now is to ask the person if he is hinting if he says something that otherwise makes no logical sense .
For example :
My partner says , " I 'm cold sitting here on the love seat by myself . "
I reply , " Are you hinting at something ? "
Because , logically , if he 's really saying he is cold he would either grab a blanket or ask me to bring one , or go put on a sweater or something , not just tell me he is cold and then do nothing else about it .
So , yes , he was hinting that he wanted me to come and snuggle .
But now he has learned not to hint most of the time .
Some people will think I 'm being mean when I say that I do n't take hints in those words so I tend to say , " I do n't understand hints so if you would like me to do something , please ask me instead of hinting . "
So you can make the lives of people on the autistic spectrum ( and probably your own as well ) easier by not trying to modify their behavior with hints .
It seems passive aggressive anyway so maybe it 's just a better way to communicate overall ?
I , of course , never “ caught ” the drum of the cement mixer rotating .
( The chassis and cab of the cement mixer were painted the intense orange of real public - works vehicles ; the drum was painted in alternating stripes of the orange and a deep green , and I often envisioned the hypnotic swirl of the stripes as the drum rotated unobserved by me .
I should have included this fact earlier , I realize . )
I pulled the cement mixer around so much that my mother , after giving up on trying guiltily to distract me with other toys , banished me to the basement with the cement mixer so that its wheels would not wear further grooves in the living - room carpet .
I never found a way to observe the drum ’s rotation without stopping that rotation .
It never once occurred to me that my parents might have been putting me on .
Nor did it ever bother me that the striped drum itself was glued or nailed to the orange chassis of the cement mixer and could not be rotated ( or even budged ) by hand .
Such is the power of the word “ magic . ”
The same power accounts for why the “ voices ” I heard as a child never worried me or caused me to fear that something was wrong with me .
And , in fact , the free rotation of an unpowered and securely fastened drum was not the “ magic ” that drove me .
The magic was the way it knew to stop the instant I tried to see it .
The magic was how it could not , not ever , be trapped or outsmarted .
Though my obsession with the toy cement mixer had ended by the next Christmas , I have never forgotten it , or the feeling in my chest and midsection whenever yet another , even more involved attempt to trap the toy ’s magic met with failure — a mix of crushing disappointment and ecstatic reverence .
This was the year , at five or six , that I learned the meaning of “ reverence , ” which , as I understand it , is the natural attitude to take toward magical , unverifiable phenomena , the same way that “ respect ” and “ obedience ” describe the attitude one takes toward observable physical phenomena , such as gravity or money .
Among the qualities that made my parents see me as eccentric and mysterious was religion , for , without any prompting or even understanding , I was a religious child — meaning I was interested in religion and filled with feelings and concerns that we use the word “ religious ” to describe .
( I ’m not putting any of this well .
I am not and never have been an intellectual .
I am not articulate , and the subjects that I am trying to describe and discuss are beyond my abilities .
I am trying , however , the best I can , and will go back over this as carefully as possible when I am finished , and will make changes and corrections whenever I can see a way to make what I ’m discussing clearer or more interesting without fabricating anything . )
My parents were intellectuals and devout atheists , but they were tolerant and largehearted , and when I began to ask “ religious ” questions and to express interest in “ religious ” themes they freely allowed me to seek out religiously oriented people with whom I could discuss these themes , and even to attend church services and Mass with the families of other children from school and our neighborhood who were religious .
If you consider the usual meaning of “ atheism , ” which , as I understand it , is a kind of anti-religious religion , which worships reason , skepticism , intellect , empirical proof , human autonomy , and self - determination , my parents ’ open tolerance of my religious interests and my regular attendance of services with the family next door ( by this time my father had tenure , and we had our own home in a middle - class neighborhood with a highly rated school system ) was exceptional — the sort of nonjudgmental , respectful attitude that religion itself ( as I see it ) tries to promulgate in its followers .
None of this occurred to me at the time ; nor did the connection between my feelings for the “ magic ” toy cement mixer and , later , my interest in and reverence for the “ magic ” of religion become apparent to me until years later , when I was in the second year of seminary , during my first adult crisis of faith .
The fact that the most powerful and significant connections in our lives are ( at the time ) invisible to us seems to me a compelling argument for religious reverence rather than skeptical empiricism as a response to life ’s meaning .
It is difficult to stay on what feels like the “ track ” of this discussion in an orderly , logical way .
Some of the adults my parents allowed me to approach with religious questions and issues included teachers , a religion professor whom my father knew and respected from an interdepartmental university committee they had served on together , and the father and mother of the family next door , who were both deacons ( a type of élite lay minister ) in the church two blocks from our home .
I will forgo a description of the issues , questions , and themes that my parents allowed me to discuss with these religious adults ; they were entirely unexceptional and universal and average , the sorts of questions that everyone eventually confronts in his own time and his own individual way .
My surfeit of religious interest also had to do with the frequency and tenor of the “ voices ” I regularly heard as a child ( meaning up until roughly age thirteen , as I recall it ) .
The major reason that I was never frightened about the voices or worried about what “ hearing voices ” indicated about my possible mental health involved the fact that the childhood “ voices ” ( there were two of them , each distinct in timbre and personality ) never spoke of anything that was n’t good , happy , and reassuring .
I will mention these voices only in passing , because they are both not directly vital to this and also very hard to describe or convey adequately to anyone else .
I should emphasize that , although “ make - believe ” and “ invisible friends ” are customary parts of childhood , these voices were — or appeared to me as — entirely real and autonomous phenomena , unlike the voices of any “ real ” adults in my experience , and with manners of speech and accent that nothing in my childhood experience had exposed me to or prepared me in any way to “ make up ” or combine from outside sources .
( I realized just now that another reason that I do not propose to discuss these childhood “ voices ” at length is that I tend to fall into attempts to argue that the voices were “ real , ” when in fact it is a matter of indifference to me whether they were truly “ real ” or not or whether any other person can be forced to admit that they were not “ hallucinations ” or “ fantasies . ”
Indeed , one of the voices ’ favorite topics consisted in their assuring me that it was of no importance whether I believed they were “ real ” or simply parts of myself , since — as one of the voices in particular liked to stress — there was nothing in the whole world as “ real ” as I was .
I should concede that in some ways I regarded — or “ counted on ” — the voices as another set of parents ( meaning , I think , that I loved them and trusted them and yet respected or “ revered ” them : in short , I was not their equal ) , and yet also as fellow - children : meaning that I had no doubt that they and I lived in the very same world and that they “ understood ” me in a way that biological adults were incapable of . )
( Probably one reason that I fall automatically into the urge to “ argue for ” the voices ’ “ reality ” is that my “ real ” parents , though they were wholly tolerant of my believing in the voices , obviously viewed them as the same sort of “ invisible friend ” fantasies I mentioned above . )
At any rate , the best analogy for the experience of hearing these childhood “ voices ” of mine is that it was like going around with your own private masseur , who spent all his time giving you back — and shoulder — rubs ( which my biological mother also used to do whenever I was sick in bed , using rubbing alcohol and baby powder and also changing the pillowcases , so that they were clean and cool ; the experience of the voices was analogous to the feeling of turning a pillow over to the cool side ) .
Sometimes the experience of the voices was ecstatic , sometimes so much so that it was almost too intense for me — as when you first bite into an apple or a confection that tastes so delicious and causes such a flood of oral juices that there is a moment of intense pain in your mouth and glands — particularly in the late afternoons of spring and summer , when the sunlight on sunny days achieved moments of immanence and became the color of beaten gold and was itself ( the light , as if it were taste ) so delicious that it was almost too much to stand , and I would lie on the pile of large pillows in our living room and roll back and forth in an agony of delight and tell my mother , who always read on the couch , that I felt so good and full and ecstatic that I could hardly bear it , and I remember her pursing her lips , trying not to laugh , and saying in the driest possible voice that she found it hard to feel too much sympathy or concern for this problem and was confident that I could survive this level of ecstasy , and that I probably did n’t need to be rushed to the emergency room , and at such moments my love and affection for my mother ’s dry humor and love became , stacked atop the original ecstasy , so intense that I almost had to stifle a scream of pleasure as I rolled ecstatically between the pillows and the books on the floor .
I do not have any real idea what my mother — an exceptional , truly lovable woman — made of having a child who sometimes suffered actual fits of ecstasy ; and I do not know whether she herself had them .
Nevertheless , the experience of the real but unobservable and unexplainable “ voices ” and the ecstatic feelings they often aroused doubtless contributed to my reverence for magic and my faith that magic not only permeated the everyday world but did so in a way that was thoroughly benign and altruistic and wished me well .
I was never the sort of child who believed in “ monsters under the bed ” or vampires , or who needed a night - light in his bedroom ; on the contrary , my father ( who clearly “ enjoyed ” me and my eccentricities ) once laughingly told my mother that he thought I might suffer from a type of benign psychosis called “ antiparanoia , ” in which I seemed to believe that I was the object of an intricate universal conspiracy to make me so happy I could hardly stand it .
The specific instance traceable as the origin of my religious impulse after my interest in the cement mixer passed ( to my parents ’ great relief ) involved a nineteen - fifties war movie that my father and I watched together on television one Sunday afternoon with the curtains drawn to prevent the sunlight from making it hard to see the screen of our black - and - white television .
Watching television together was one of my father ’s and my favorite and most frequent activities ( my mother disliked television ) , and usually took place on the couch , with my father , who read during the commercials , sitting at one end and me lying down , with my head on a pillow on my father ’s knees .
( One of my strongest sensory memories of childhood is the feel of my father ’s knees against my head and the joking way he sometimes rested his book on my head when the commercial interruption occurred . )
The movie in question ’s subject was the First World War and it starred an actor who was much lauded for his roles in war movies .
At this point my memory diverges sharply from my father ’s , as evidenced by a disturbing conversation we had during my second year at seminary .
My father apparently remembers that the film ’s hero , a beloved lieutenant , dies when he throws himself on an enemy grenade that has been lobbed into his platoon ’s trench ( “ platoon ” meaning a small military grouping of infantrymen with close ties from being constant comrades in arms ) .
According to my father , a platoon is usually commanded by a lieutenant .
Whereas I remember clearly that the hero , played by an actor who was noted for his portrayal of conflict and trauma , suffers private anguish over the moral question of killing in combat and the whole religious conundrum of a “ just war ” and “ justified killing , ” and finally undergoes a total psychological breakdown when his own comrade successfully lobs a grenade into a crowded enemy trench and leaps screaming ( the hero does , fairly early in the film ) into the enemy ’s trench and falls on the grenade and dies saving the enemy platoon , and that much of the rest of the film ( albeit constantly interrupted by commercials when I saw it ) depicts the hero ’s platoon struggling to interpret the action of their formerly beloved lieutenant , with many of them bitterly denouncing him as a traitor , many others holding that battle fatigue and a traumatic letter from “ Stateside ” received earlier in the film exculpated his act as a kind of temporary insanity , and only one shy , idealistic recruit ( played by an actor I have never seen in another movie of that era ) secretly believing that the lieutenant ’s act of dying for the enemy was actually heroic and deserved to be recorded and dramatized for posterity ( the shy , anonymous recruit is the narrator , in “ voice - overs ” at the film ’s beginning and end ) , and I never forgot the movie ( whose title both my father and I missed because we did n’t turn on the television until after the movie had begun , which is not the same as “ forgetting ” the title , which my father jokingly claims is what we both did ) or the impact of the lieutenant ’s act , which I , too ( like the shy , idealistic narrator ) , regarded as not only “ heroic ” but also beautiful in a way that was almost too intense to bear , especially as I lay across my father ’s knees .

Advertisement US President Barack Obama has ordered 30,000 more US troops to Afghanistan but warned America would begin to withdraw its military forces by 2011 .
Soldiers will be deployed as quickly as possible , bringing US troop strength in the country to more than 100,000 .
World security was at stake , Mr Obama said , calling for more allied troops .
The mission in Afghanistan , he added , was to defeat al - Qaeda , reverse the Taliban 's momentum and deny them the ability to overthrow the government .
Just as we have done in Iraq , we will execute this transition responsibly
Barack Obama
Full text of speech Nato pledges 5,000 Afghan troops US media on the troop surge Afghan concern over pullout date Mr Obama reached his deployment decision after more than three months of deliberations and 10 top - level meetings with advisers .
Gen Stanley McChrystal , the US commander in Afghanistan , welcomed the speech , saying he had been given " a clear military mission " and the necessary resources .
Some 32,000 other foreign troops are serving in Afghanistan but Nato allies have been cautious about further contributions .
Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen urged members to do more .
He told reporters on Wednesday that 5,000 extra troops would be sent in 2010 , and " probably " a few thousand in addition .
" This is our fight together , " he said .
" We must finish it together . "
The Afghan government said it supported the new US strategy .
Foreign Minister Rangin Dadfar Spanta said that with international help Afghanistan 's armed forces would be able to start taking responsibility for security in 18 months .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
There was plenty designed to reassure those who were worried about what is , after all , a massive escalation
Read Mark Mardell 's thoughts in full However the BBC's Ian Pannell in Kabul says there is concern that putting a date on a US withdrawal sends the wrong signal and risks giving encouragement to the Taliban .
In his speech , Mr Obama : celebrated the US as a nation " founded in resistance to oppression " and talked about its long record of sacrifice in " advancing frontiers of human liberty "
promised an " effective partnership " with Pakistan , and warned that the US could not " tolerate a safe haven for terrorists "
repeatedly cited the poor economy and stated that the estimated cost - $ 30bn for the US military this year - was a factor in his deliberations Taliban threat The speech was delivered at the West Point military academy in New York .
ANALYSIS Adam Brookes , BBC News , Washington
There seems to be an acknowledgement that a level of insurgent activity will continue - even in the best case scenario .
Wiping out the Taliban is not a war aim .
And given the Taliban 's ability to make use of parts of Pakistan as a safe haven , nor could it be .
The July 2011 date requires that , by then , elements of the Afghan armed forces are in sufficiently good shape to begin taking on sole responsibility for security .
The first areas of the country handed over would be those that are quietest and least vulnerable to Taliban influence .
This is a very rapid timetable - accelerated , the president called it - and there will be many in the US military who wonder if it is optimistic , given the difficulties of finding competent leaders for the Afghan army and police .
Shoring up support Stressing that the US was in Afghanistan because of the 9/11 attacks on America by al - Qaeda militants , Mr Obama said their Taliban allies had " begun to take control over swathes of Afghanistan " while committing " devastating acts of terrorism " against Pakistan .
US forces , he said , lacked " the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population " .
" I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 US troops to Afghanistan , " he told the cadets .
" After 18 months , our troops will begin to come home . "
Rising violence - more than 900 US soldiers have died in Afghanistan - and August 's discredited elections have fanned mounting domestic opposition to the eight - year - old war .
Mr Obama said he was aware of the gravity of his decision to send the extra troops but he urged Americans not to see the conflict as a new Vietnam war .
America was backed by a " broad coalition of 43 nations " , he said , and was not facing a " broad - based popular insurgency " .
" Most importantly , unlike Vietnam , the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan , and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border , " the US leader added .
TROOPS FIGHTING THE TALIBAN US : More than 100,000 by July 2010 Other foreign ( mainly Nato ) : Some 32,000 currently , with a British offer of 500 more Afghan National Army : 94,000 Afghan National Police : 81,000
Map : Foreign forces in Afghanistan Speech reactions US surge ' to aid UK '
The US would take the Iraq experience as its model for withdrawal , he added .
" Just as we have done in Iraq , we will execute this transition responsibly , taking into account conditions on the ground , " he said .
Pledging to continue to advise and assist Afghanistan 's security forces , he warned : " It will be clear to the Afghan government - and , more importantly , to the Afghan people - that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country .
" The days of providing a blank cheque are over , " he added .
Other priorities Mr Obama outlined included enhancing US domestic security , preventing nuclear materials falling into the hands of terrorists and forging better ties with the Muslim world .
Plea to allies
The White House wants to convey that this is Barack Obama 's war and he is clear about the aims he wants to achieve , the BBC's Matthew Price says .
Calling on America 's allies to boost their troop commitment , Mr Obama said : " What 's at stake is the security of our allies , and the common security of the world . "
From my perspective as a Nam Vet 67 / 68 , it appears to be Deja Vu

In pictures : Obama speech Welcoming the US pledge , UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said : " I call on all our allies to unite behind President Obama 's strategy .
" Britain will continue to play its full part in persuading other countries to offer troops to the Afghanistan campaign , " Mr Brown said , a day after London confirmed it was sending 500 more troops , taking the UK 's total deployment to 10,000 .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy offered full support to Mr Obama 's strategy and called it " courageous " but France earlier ruled out deploying more combat soldiers , though it might send military trainers .
Germany has said it will wait until after a 28 January conference in London on Afghanistan before deciding on any troop increases .
Italy has also said it will increase its force , although without saying by how much .

Here ’s a riddle :
How do you make your book a best seller on the Kindle ?
Answer : Give copies away .
That ’s right .
More than half of the “ best - selling ” e-books on the Kindle , Amazon.com ’s e-reader , are available at no charge .
Although some of the titles are digital versions of books in the public domain  like Jane Austen ’s “ Pride and Prejudice ”  many are by authors still trying to make a living from their work .
Earlier this week , for example , the No. 1 and 2 spots on Kindle ’s best - seller list were taken by “ Cape Refuge ” and “ Southern Storm , ” both novels by Terri Blackstock , a writer of Christian thrillers .
The Kindle price : $ 0 .
Until the end of the month , Ms. Blackstock ’s publisher , Zondervan , a division of HarperCollins Publishers , is offering readers the opportunity to download the books free to the Kindle or to the Kindle apps on their iPhone or in Windows .
Publishers including Harlequin , Random House and Scholastic are offering free versions of digital books to Amazon , Barnes & Noble and other e-retailers , as well as on author Web sites , as a way of allowing readers to try out the work of unfamiliar writers .
The hope is that customers who like what they read will go on to obtain another title for money .
BRUSSELS , Nov 19 ( Reuters ) - A majority of European Union leaders agreed on Thursday to appoint Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy as EU president and Britain ’s Catherine Ashton as foreign affairs chief , senior diplomats said .
“ There is a consensus .
The largest centre - right governments and Socialist leaders have reached a deal , ” one diplomat familiar with the negotiations told Reuters .
Several other diplomats confirmed the deal , which must still be finalised .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown earlier withdrew his support for former Prime Minister Tony Blair to become EU president , Brown ’s spokesman said , opening the way for a compromise in which Ashton , the EU ’s trade commissioner , will become the high representative for foreign affairs .

A Vanoc video about the Olympic torch relay contains uncredited footage from Adolf Hitler ’s favourite filmmaker .
About 25 seconds into the video Lights Will Guide You Home on the Vanoc Web site , a runner holding the torch enters a huge sports stadium .
The image came from Leni Riefenstahl ’s Olympia , which was shot during the 1936 Olympics in Berlin .
In Riefenstahl ’s film , you can see images of people giving the “ Heil Hitler ” salute with their arms extended .
The Vanoc video obscures those images .
NDP tourism critic Spencer Herbert accused the Vanoc film of trying to “ black out history ” by covering up the Nazi salute .
“ I think this is offensive , ” Herbert said .
“ If you ’re going to use the footage , acknowledge ... where it ’s from .
And have some sort of remark about that dark period of the Olympics .
Or you do n’t use the footage .
But to go in and try to correct the politically uncorrect — the Heil Hitler — and try to hide the footage , it ’s just insulting to history . ”
The first - ever Olympic torch relay took place ahead of the 1936 Summer Games , which helped cement Hitler 's rule over Germany .
An excerpt from Olympia .
A clip of this film is seen in the Vanoc video .

The iPad may not have a camera in its current incarnation , but Apple 's at least laying the foundation for one : we just confirmed with extremely trusted sources that iPhone OS 3.2 contains rudimentary support for video calling , which could explain that mysterious space at the top of the device in our leaked pics .
We 're told that there are hooks to accept and decline a video conference , flip a video feed ( which suggests a front - facing camera ) and -- most importantly -- run the video call in either full screen mode or in just a portion of the screen .
That means you 'll be able to chat and do other things at the same time , which could mean there 's at least some type of multitasking going on here .
We can also confirm that iPhone OS 3.2 supports file downloads and local storage in the browser , which means you 'll be able to pull files off the web and use them in other apps , and there 's at least the beginnings of SMS support buried within the code -- a fact we were able to verify with noted iPhone jailbreaker chpwn , who sent in the above screenshot from a hacked - up copy of the iPad simulator .
( The simulator always says " iPhone simulator " in the menu bar , but that 's the iPad. ) chpwn also tells us he 's found some inklings of actual phone support , there 's a spellchecker , and that both the new landscape orientation for the homescreen and keyboard support appear to be destined for the iPhone itself when 3.2 comes out .
We 're not sure what any of this means at this point , or if any of it will ever be implemented , but we 're definitely starting to get the impression that Apple did n't tell us everything there is to know about the iPad on Wednesday -- and we 're even more curious to find out what iPhone OS 4.0 will look like when it arrives .
P.S. - chpwn was also able to port iPhone multitasking hacks ProSwitcher and Backgrounder to the iPad simulator , which is certainly going to be useful if an iPad jailbreak exploit is eventually discovered .
Check out a shot of it going in the gallery below , along with some other settings panels the coder dug up .
We just got another tip from iPhone jailbreak dev Ryan Petrich , confirming that there 's a spell checker with multiple dictionaries and user - added entries ( huzzah ! ) , much richer text support for apps , the ability to selectively draw to external displays ( using the VGA or component adapters , we 'd imagine ) , location - aware ads in Maps and possibly other programs that use the Maps API , file upload ability in Safari , a modifiable cut / copy / paste menu , and , most interestingly , prototype support for a " handwriting keyboard . "
Maybe we 'll see some stylus action on this thing after all .
Peep Ryan 's take after the break .
It 's been a good month for female superheroes , first with the announcement of the Birds of Prey relaunch by DC and now with Marvel announcing a new comic featuring teen superheroines .
There 's one problem with the new Marvel project .
The name .
Her -Oes .
First , the large " O " has an unfortunate implication all on it's own and I do n't mean " Othello . "
The second is take phonetic pronunciation of the two capital letters .
H.O.s .
Not exactly evoking what I 'd want to associate with a fun , teen - centered comic .
And we wo n't even talk about why there needs to be an appallingly bad pun on " her . "
I think the all - girl cover might just clue the reader in that there are female - types inside .
When I first heard about this project the grapevine , I thought it was an Onion story .
No one could seriously come up not only with an ungainly name but a one that invoked unfortunate sexual imagery .
Wrong .
It sounds like a wonderful project .
Featured in a New Jersey high school setting will be teen versions of the Wasp , She - Hulk , Namora ( an Atlantean , passed off as an exchange student from Greece ) , and Ms. Marvel , among others .
It 's written by Grace Randolph , who has credits at Marvel , DC and Boom Studios .
In an interview , Randolph talks about how while she hopes the project will naturally appeal to girls and women that it's also going to be a superhero comic , which means lots of action as well .
It would definitely be something my kids would read .
If the eldest could stop snerking about the " O . "
Please , Marvel , just ditch the original name and replace it .
It does n't have to be snazzy .
It just has to not be appallingly awful .
Even " Girl Power ! " would be better .
Somehow e-mail lives on despite spam , instant messaging , Twitter , Facebook , and LinkedIn .
Heck , if it were n't for e-mail notifications , I 'd never check my Facebook page .
But what 's driving e-mail these days ?
A look at MailRadar.com shows that Sendmail is still the No. 1 MTA ( mail transfer agent ) in use today , followeded by Postfix , while Qmail is a distant third .
And dear God , someone is still using MMDF .
Surprisingly , Microsoft Exchange is n't even in the mix , which casts doubt on the validity of those numbers , but it 's probably safe to say that Sendmail remains the top MTA .
[ Sendmail is one of InfoWorld 's Top 10 Open Source Hall of Famers .
Read the full story in " The greatest open source software of all time . " ]
The rallying cry behind most non-Sendmail MTAs is that they 're , well , not Sendmail .
Sendmail is much maligned for being a security risk , but my experience of running hundreds of Sendmail - based mail servers and mail relays does not bear that out .
Over the past 15 years , I 've yet to see Sendmail used as an attack vector .
Case in point : I recently helped a friend set up MailMan on a hosted Linux VPS server .
The VPS ran Plesk and Qmail .
Seems simple enough , except that in this particular case , e-mail for the domain was hosted elsewhere , so a subdomain was required to push e-mail traffic to that specific server .
Still , that 's a very minor configuration issue , or so I thought .
After several hours of diagnosing perplexing Qmail errors , I switched the whole server over to Sendmail and had everything running in a matter of a few minutes .
Indeed , my familiarity with Sendmail assisted here , but I 'm not a Qmail newbie either -- there are some significant problems related to Qmail and Plesk in this instance , and I simply was n't willing to fall all the way down that particular rabbit hole .
Another stick poked at Sendmail is that it suffers from Byzantine configuration .
Speaking as someone who 's written custom rulesets for a hideously complex Sendmail structure , I can verify that when you start digging into the guts of Sendmail , it gets crazy real fast .
But the point is that you really can dig into the guts .
Like many things in computing , high configurability comes with high complexity .
The reality is that 99 percent of Sendmail configurations are extremely simple -- a few lines in a sendmail.mc and a make and all is well .
But what of complexity in other popular MTAs ?
Take a brief look at how you configure virtual e-mail domains and aliases with Qmail and tell me that Sendmail is more complex .
In fact , do n't .
Qmail is fantastically simple at some simple things , yet needlessly complex with others .
If I never have to write another script to spit out .qmail - xxx files , it will be too soon .
Postfix is a viable alternative , marrying some of the better concepts of Sendmail to a simpler ( and less malleable ) configuration .
In my mind , it 's the only real competition to Sendmail in terms of features and overall ease of operation .
One of the main reasons I have n't bothered with Postfix in the past was the lack of milter support .
This meant that using milters such as MIMEDefang , milter - greylist , and others was n't possible .
However , Postfix finally added this support in version 2.3 .
And then there 's the gorilla called Exchange .
To anyone who grew up with Sendmail or Postfix , Exchange is an abomination from an administration standpoint .
It 's gotten slightly better over the years , but I still groan every time I have to deal with it .
It 's slow and cranky , and the GUI management makes Sendmail 's configuration seem like child 's play .
Say what you want about non-Microsoft MTAs , but one thing they all have in common is that there 's generally only one or two places to look for the entirety of the MTA configuration .
With Exchange , it 's all over the place , yet somehow all within one MMC tool .
Exchange is more than an MTA , granted , but that 's no excuse for the hoops that admins must jump through to do what should be relatively simple tasks , like migrating to a new server .
Another case in point : A Sendmail - based server with the dovecot IMAP and POP service running needs to be migrated to new hardware or a VM .
This task requires building the new server ; copying over the contents of / etc / mail , /etc / passwd , /etc / group , and etc / shadow ; and running rsync on the mailbox folder .
If there 's centralized authentication , it 's even simpler .
All told , that 's about an hour 's work from starting the OS installation to having the new server up and running .
With large mailboxes , rsync might take a bit longer .
If it 's a Cyrus - based IMAP / POP server , a few more tweaks will be needed , but overall , it 's a very simple , straightforward situation .
On Exchange , that 's hardly the case .
Just the act of migrating a relatively small mailstore from old to new can take hours and hours .
One recent Exchange migration had the GUI progress meter for the Move Mailbox operation run to 100 percent for the mail migration within 5 minutes , which was puzzling .
A few checks showed that the migration was nowhere near 100 percent , but was still running .
The progress meter then proceeded to have an epileptic fit of blocking and clock face jitters for the better part of six hours before the 15 GB of mail was finally moved .
For those scoring at home , that 's roughly 4.5 M bit , or 600 KBps -- and this was between two dual - CPU servers with gigabit interfaces and six - spindle RAID5 arrays .
If there 's one thing I can't stand when doing dicey migrations , it 's the fact that these long , overly onerous processes are a one - way trip .
If at the end of that six hours there were problems with the migration , the only backout plan is to try to roll back to the original server , since the maintenance window is shot .
Also , I intensely dislike it when progress bars lie to me right out of the gate .
Limbo is not a comfortable place for an admin doing an overnight migration .
It 's also not lost on me that many Exchange implementations do n't deal directly with the Internet -- there 's generally a mail relay filtering e-mail before it ever gets to Exchange .
Personally , I would never install Exchange as a front - end MTA .
I prefer using a Linux prophylactic running Sendmail , MIMEDefang , and a virus scanner .
But without Exchange , we would n't have Outlook , and without Outlook , I imagine people would simply wither at their desks , completely confused as to where their meeting was located and who was in it .
It 's true that most organizations need the features provided by Exchange , and while there are open source products that provide those features , they 're not as streamlined and integrated as the Exchange / Outlook combination .
I 've often thought that if a company wanted to make serious inroads on Microsoft 's grasp of the business world , that 's where to start .
If you build a better mailserver , they will come .
Maybe that 's why the grandaddy of all mailservers is still the most widely used .

Following the likes of Modern Warfare 2 , Aliens vs. Predator , and RAGE , Ubisoft mentioned in a Q&A session that Splinter Cell : Conviction will not support dedicated servers .
Will there be a dedicated server for Splinter PC ?
No , there is no dedicated server mode .
So naturally , you might be wondering about the matchmaking , which Ubisoft also addressed in the Q&A .
How does the matchmaking work exactly ?
( PC and Xbox )
The matchmaking system attempts to put two players together that are looking for the same type of match based on the selected Map , Difficulty , Language and Ping .
If no good matches are found , the player can create a match and wait for someone to connect .
Players can also create private matches .
Additionally , in the event where we do n’t find an exact match to your preferences , we gradually and automatically start widening the search parameters until we find the closest best match to what you were looking for .
There are no match listings in Conviction , you are matched with the best possible person out there .
Conviction will have a lobby system as well where players can negotiate match settings .
For the selectors of the Canadian , Russian and Swedish men ’s hockey teams , with their abundance of talent , the hard part of filling an Olympic roster is figuring out which top players to leave out .
But the selector of the German Olympic team faces a different predicament : he actually wants to leave out some of his most talented players .
“ It ’s a bit of a tightrope act , ” said Uwe Krupp , Germany ’s coach and the man who will choose the squad .
“ We ca n’t simply take all our N.H.L. players just because they ’re N.H.L. players .
What about the guys who were here all through the qualifying process and got us into the Olympics ?
Do I tell them to just step aside ? ”
The International Ice Hockey Federation ’s deadlines for announcing Olympic rosters fall between Christmas and New Year , ahead of the Winter Games in February in Vancouver .
But unlike the powerhouses of world hockey , second - tier countries like Germany , currently 12th in the I.I.H.F. world rankings , behind Norway and just ahead of Denmark , must find a more delicate balance than simply picking the best players with the appropriate passport .
“ We have 10 players in the N.H.L. and A.H.L. , but none of them took part in qualifying , ” Krupp said , referring to the brief tournament in Hanover , Germany , last February that got Germany into the Olympics with nail - biting 2 - 1 victories against Austria and Slovenia .
All the players on that German roster were domestically based .
This is hopefully the start of a longer series wherein I discuss how to get your players more involved in the roleplay aspects of the game .
Many
GMs get frustrated by players who do n’t bother getting into character and I see a lot of forum posts about the topic .
I feel that one of my biggest strengths as a GM is in drawing players out of their shells , and I ’d like to share my methods .
Before I begin I need to make clear that you ca n’t force players to roleplay .
RP is n’t fun for everyone .
Many have tried it and decided that it ’s just not for them .
Some of these players show up for a beer ‘n pretzels style hack and slash fest .
Others like building and optimizing characters .
Some people just show up to game because it ’s where all their friends are .
In one game I was in we had a player who was clearly bored with combat .
We figured he was the roleplaying type , except that he kept his mouth shut during any sort of PC or NPC interaction .
And he did n’t know any of us previous to the game .
As far as we could tell , he showed up so his dice could get exercise .
Other players were dissatisfied so we had group therapy .
We went around and talked about what everyone got out of the game .
When it got to this player he said that what he enjoyed was the story .
We were confused .
He did n’t bother roleplaying but he was showing up for the story in the game ?
It turned out he just liked the storytelling aspect of the game .
He showed up to listen to the GM ’s plot and probably would have been just as happy spectating as playing .
What I ’m getting at is that some players do n’t want to roleplay .
They come to game for other reasons .
If you try and force them to roleplay they ’re going to be miserable and you ’re going to be frustrated .
Where possible give these players what they want and offer the roleplay to other players .
In the case of the story gamer , he ’d be just as happy watching someone else ’s plot , so focus the plot elsewhere and you ’ll make two players happy .
D&D is the name of the game , but it applies to so many different games .
My games are collaborative storytelling .
Others are math homework .
There needs to be consistency between the game the GM is offering and what the players are expecting .
Sometimes you have to accept that somebody is just a warm body at your table .
Other times you may be better off finding different players .
Be aware of what game you offer and what your players are after .
Next time we ’ll discuss encouraging roleplay .

One of the more awkward situations facing Austrian economists today is that we are divided on whether to expect price deflation or inflation .
Although it 's good that we publicly disagree with each other — rather than bury our disagreements to reassure the lay public that we know what we 're talking about — it 's nonetheless unsettling that our prognoses for the US dollar are so divergent .
Back in July , I took Mike Shedlock ( a.k.a. , " Mish " ) to task for warning his readers of an impending price deflation .
I thought the real threat was a rapid loss in purchasing power , and I explained why Mish 's focus on credit was in my opinion inconclusive .
I would like to be able to say that one of us has since been proven wrong , but so far the evidence is mixed .
As one of Mish 's followers told me , 2010 will be decisive — and if prices only move modestly one way or the other , Mish and I both will be wrong .
In the present article I want to reiterate why I view rising prices as the real threat .
I also want to point out some problems for the deflation camp .
Rising Prices Are Still the Threat
First off , I want to acknowledge that earlier this year , I was warning of large rises in consumer prices .
Although the average Joe is wrong for thinking we are currently in a deflationary trap ( as I 'll show in a moment ) , obviously I was too alarmist in my predictions .
So I should at least explain what I think went wrong .
What happened is that Ben Bernanke put the brakes on the supply of money held by the public , measured by aggregates such as M1 or M2 .
As you can see in this figure below , the quantity of money held by the public — in checking accounts , currency in their pockets , and other very liquid forms — rose sharply at the end of 2008 .
At the same time , Bernanke allowed the " monetary base " ( which includes bank reserves held on deposit with the Fed itself ) to explode .
The reader may recall that at the end of 2008 and early 2009 , major politicians were calling on the banks to expand loans and hence justify the huge bailouts they received .
After all , the ostensible purpose of the bailout , Paulson told us , was to allow small businesses to have access to credit .
I foolishly believed that the growth we saw in M1 and M2 at the end of 2008 would continue , and that 's why I was warning of large price inflation in 2009 .
Yet as the chart above shows , Bernanke has held M1 at its new level for some months now , and there is a similar pattern for M2 .
Even though many people think that the Fed is spewing gushers of new money into the economy daily , that 's not really accurate .
It 's true that the monetary base continues to reach new highs , but most of that new money is bottled up in the banks ' own checking accounts ( as it were ) on deposit with the Fed .
My reason for expecting large - scale price inflation is fairly straightforward : I see no coherent strategy for Bernanke to remove the excess reserves from the banking system .
A plan to sell off the assets on the Fed 's balance sheet ( and thereby drain some of the reserves out of the system ) does n't reassure me because ( a ) I do n't think Bernanke would have the guts to do it and thereby crash the housing market ; and ( b ) the Fed would have to sell its newly acquired assets at a loss from what it paid for them , meaning there would still be excess reserves it could n't sop up .
Another strategy the financial analysts and Fed officials discuss is the new " tool " of paying interest on bank reserves held on deposit with the Fed .
The idea is that once banks relax and see fairly safe investments yielding 4 or 5 percent , they will want to use some of their excess reserves ( currently parked at the Fed ) to take advantage of the opportunities .
In order to keep those reserves from working their way back into the hands of the general public ( where they can start pushing up prices ) , the Fed will have to raise the interest rate it pays to persuade the banks to keep the reserves parked at the Fed .
But this simply postpones the day of reckoning , as the troublesome stockpile of excess reserves grows even faster .
When Will the Inflation Genie Get Out of the Bottle ?
Of course , nobody knows for sure what prices will do in the future .
In particular , if there is a major terrorist attack or another financial crash , it 's entirely possible that investors worldwide will flock back into relatively safe US Treasurys and thereby push up the US dollar on the foreign exchanges .
However , I still think the general outlook is for a falling dollar and rising consumer prices .
Ironically , the trend is already here .
As the chart below shows , consumer prices as measured ( imperfectly ) by the CPI have been steadily rising all year .
This might be puzzling to readers who rely on the financial press .
In the typical article in 2009 , the press would report that the previous month 's price level was 0.2 percent higher than the preceding month's , but would convince the reader that " inflation is still tame " by pointing to year - over - year changes .
For example , the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) informed us last month that October 's prices were 0.3 percent higher than in September , but that they were still 0.2 percent lower than consumer prices back in October 2008 .
Although technically accurate , this practice of citing the year - over - year declines in the CPI has been very misleading .
What really happened is that CPI fell extraordinarily quickly in the last three months of 2008 .
But the collapse bottomed out in December 2008 , and the CPI has risen in almost every month since then .
Looking at just the raw CPI numbers , consumer prices have risen a cumulative 2.8 percent this year , and that 's only based on the first 10 months of data .
Come December 16 , the government will release the data for November 's CPI reading .
At that point , we will have moved over the hump of the huge price drops in late 2008 , meaning that the year - over - year comparisons will suddenly flip into positive territory .
For example , if November 's prices rise above October 's prices at the same average rate as has occurred so far this year , then the BLS will say that consumer prices are up 1.7 percent from November 2008 .
The real fun will come in mid-January , when the BLS has to issue the numbers for December 's prices .
At that point the full CPI drop in late 2008 will have worked its way through the 12 - month window , and the public will finally realize just how far prices have been rising .
Again , if we simply plug in the average price hikes so far in 2009 , the government will report in January that the December 2009 CPI was a full 2.7 percent higher than prices from a year earlier .
Thus in two short months the public will snap from thinking we are still stuck in deflation to realizing that official price measures have been rising for quite some time .
It 's true , in the grand scheme a 3 - percent annual CPI rise is nothing to lose sleep over .
However , I believe the one thing that has forestalled absolute panic in the financial markets is that investors have seen with their own eyes that prices are n't exploding .
In fact , most investors probably think that we are still perched on the edge of a deflationary cliff .
So once it 's clear that CPI has been rising at a decent clip for a full year , the spell just might be broken and dollar holders might run for the exits .
If and when that flight from the dollar begins , the banks will want to follow suit with their more than a trillion dollars in excess reserves , and then Bernanke will have some weighty soul - searching to do .
Problems for the Deflation Camp
I have talked with many people who are very knowledgeable and come down squarely in the deflation camp .
In particular , even many die - hard fans of Austrian economics and Ron Paul have debated me on the topic — including Vijay Boyapati .
I do n't mean to suggest that these people are idiots or ignorant of Austrian monetary theory ; they are n't .
I would love to think , as many have suggested , that despite Bernanke 's efforts to inflate , the collapsing asset bubble has overwhelmed him .
I just do n't think that 's what 's happening .
As I understand it , the central argument of the deflation camp is that , in our economy , new money is created primarily through the creation of new bank loans .
Since the banks are already in such a shaky position , they are hardly going to make new loans in this environment .
Thus , no matter how much the Fed pushes , we wo n't see an actual expansion of overall buying power until consumers and businesses work off the huge debt overhang and become comfortable spending money on purchases ( as opposed to paying down debt ) .
But why have n't we seen prices fall steadily throughout 2009 ?
As the chart below shows , the credit crunch hit businesses in late 2008 and consumers a few months later ; but it has stayed constant ever since .
So if it 's the contraction of credit that is supposed to drive falling prices , why did the CPI bottom out in December 2008 ?
Why has it risen fairly steadily all year ?
I was recently on a conference call with a group of asset managers , most of whom were in the deflationist camp .
When I made these points , they said that the total CPI has risen , yes , but that it was driven by rising commodity prices .
If we focus on the " core " CPI ( which excludes food and energy ) , then the CPI has n't risen nearly as much in 2009 , showing just how weak consumer spending has been .
Fair enough , but by the same token the so - called core CPI never fell substantially , either .
The reason people thought we were in a deflationary trap last year was that oil and other commodities fell quite sharply .
As the chart below shows , if you just looked at core CPI , you would n't realize there was an enormous collapse in late 2008 .
So it 's true that focusing on core CPI can take away some of the problem for the deflationist by reducing 2009 's price hikes , but then it also wipes away much of the collapse in prices at the end of 2008 .
Thus the deflationist must still explain : if the credit crunch has been in strong force for a full year — and this is what will drive a Japanese - style deflation — why have n't we seen it kick in yet ?
Conclusion
After reviewing the evidence and the theories offered by the two camps , I still believe that Bernanke 's unprecedented infusions of new reserves will lead to rapid price increases .
These increases may not show up in the price of US financial assets , but they will rear their ugly heads at the gas pump and grocery checkout .
Moreover , I think the genie may already be slipping out of the bottle .
His escape will only be hastened once the year - over - year CPI figures show moderate inflation .
People who run long distances without shoes cushion the blow with their gait .
Barefoot runners may naturally cushion the impact of hitting the ground by landing on the balls of their feet .

Barefoot endurance runners may have a more cushioned ride than most people who run in shoes , according to a biomechanical analysis .
Barefoot long - distance running has been a small but growing trend in the athletics community , driven in part by popular books and articles that maintain that runners might get fewer injuries if they ran the way humans evolved to — without supportive , cushioned running shoes .
But although the idea is seductive , with running shoe companies recently marketing ' minimal ' footwear , there has been little evidence to support the claims .
Now , evolutionary biologist Daniel Lieberman at Harvard University in Cambridge , Massachusetts , has found crucial differences in the way that barefoot and shod runners land , with dramatic consequences for how the body takes the impact ( see Nature 's video ) .
" The first time we had a long - distance barefoot runner come to the lab and run across the force - plate , I was amazed , " says Lieberman .
Whereas most runners hit the ground with a sudden collision force as the body abruptly decelerates , says Lieberman , this barefoot runner made no such impact .
Hard impact
Lieberman found that long - distance runners who usually wear shoes , in both the United States and in Kenya , tend to land directly on their heels , abruptly bearing the full force of the impact .
The force of the collision , even with a cushioned sole , was the equivalent to up to three times their bodyweight .
The force could be linked to common running injuries such as stress fractures and plantar fasciitis , although this has yet to be demonstrated .
Americans and Kenyans accustomed to running barefoot , however , tend to strike the ground with the ball of their feet before touching down the heel — a fore - foot strike — allowing the tendons and muscles in the foot and lower leg to act as shock absorbers , bringing the impact force down to 60 % of their bodyweight .
The team 's research is published in Nature1 .
" The ankle is a very compliant , springy joint , and barefoot runners use it a lot , " says Lieberman .
" It is n't available to you when you rear - foot strike .
Then you 're relying solely on the spring on the heel of the shoe . "
By not taking advantage of the structure and function of the foot , says biologist Dennis Bramble at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City , runners may be risking injury .
" Ignoring how we evolved and what our bodies were made to do is risky business , " he adds .
Together with Bramble , Lieberman has proposed that features of the human body such as longer legs , shorter toes and a highly arched foot are linked to long - distance running and enabled early hominins to chase and eventually exhaust prey2 .
But just because human ancestors landed on the balls of their feet when they ran , that does n't mean it 's ideal for today 's runners who grew up with shoes .
There 's no evidence showing that running shoes prevent injuries .
But nor is there much evidence that people who run barefoot get fewer injuries than those who run in shoes .

Google Announces Jan. 5 Android Event
This just in : Google will host an Android press gathering at its global HQ on Jan. 5 ( click on image below to enlarge ) .
Presumably , the event will have something to do with the company ’s Nexus One , an Android phone that Google plans to sell on its own Web site and perhaps through T - Mobile as well .
Google ’s ( GOOG ) choice of date here is an interesting one .
By scheduling the event just before the official start of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Jan. 7 ( and hours before the first CES press briefings begin ) , the company would seem to be taking a page from the Steve Jobs ’s playbook –sucking some air out of the annual event .
Remember , Apple ( AAPL ) upstaged CES in a very big way back in 2007 when it announced the iPhone .
It appears that Google is attempting something similar here .
Question is , does the Nexus One have the same sort of …gadget gravitas to pull focus from CES ?
If you asked the average non-geek to name three superheroes , chances are they ’d say Superman , Batman and Wonder Woman — arguably the most iconic comic book heroes in existence .
It ’s just as likely that few ( if any ) of these people would know anything about Lobo , a DC character who was introduced as a villain in the early ’ 80s .
So it would stand to reason that Wonder Woman , who has been a major part of the DC Universe since 1941 , would get the big - screen treatment long before a second - tier player who had a run of popularity in the ’90s .
But while Hollywood has yet to show Diana any love , Guy Ritchie — a legitimate filmmaker ! — is set to direct a live - action movie about Lobo .
Lobo .
Look ; it ’s bad enough that Wonder Woman has gotten second - class citizen treatment compared to her alleged equals , Superman and Batman .
They ’ve both had several major motion pictures across several generations .
The last time Wonder Woman enjoyed a big pop culture moment outside of comic books was when Lynda Carter donned the costume in the ’70s .
You could chalk that up to garden variety sexism or just a serious failure of imagination on the part of DC - Warner Brothers .
But when frickin ’
Lobo gets to the big dance before she does , that ’s just ridiculous .

Jamie is now able to hunt using a 12 - gauge shotgun attached to a battery - powered machine operated via breathing tube .
For a quadriplegic , firing a shotgun requires help from a companion .
In Mr Cap 's case , a friend sets up the contraption , safety on , on Mr Cap 's wheelchair and Mr Cap aims the shotgun by moving the toggle switch with his mouth .
Once his partner releases the safety , Mr Cap fires by sipping on the breathing tube .

It 's great that the technology exists to allow Jamie to continue to enjoy a hobby that he loved before his accident .

Abu Dhabi Grand
Prix chiefs will keep the radical elements of their race - including the pitlane tunnel and day - night timing - for 2010 despite initial scepticism about the concepts prior to its inaugural event .
The Yas Marina circuit hosted this year 's season finale - but raised eyebrows beforehand when it revealed its unique tunnel pitlane exit that goes under the track , plus plans to host the event during dusk .
However , despite some doubts about the concepts , both the pitlane and timing of the race proved a success - and on the back of the event capturing the FIA 's prestigious Race Promoters '
Trophy , track boss Richard Cregan says that it has already been agreed both will stay in place for next year .
" Nothing will change in that respect , " he told AUTOSPORT when asked about the pitlane exit design and the day - night race timing .
" We are doing some small modifications in light of some of the things that we recognised over the course of the event , but nothing major .
" Like anything new , there is always that challenge of breaking the mould , as in designing a circuit that has a pitlane tunnel as an exit .
You will have lots of people who will detract from the spectacle of it by talking only of the doom and gloom , but we did n't have it - it worked very , very well .
" The lighting system worked incredibly well , the drivers were happy with it and most importantly it created an amazing spectacle . "
With the dust having settled on the spectacular end - of - season event , Cregan said the feedback from the race - day spectators and sport 's officials was good - as he said interest in ticket sales had already started .
" It certainly fulfilled everything that we set out to achieve in terms of creating awareness for Abu Dhabi and the UAE .
" I think the most important thing was that we did sell out , and people went away , they were happy , and they want to come back .
We have already had a lot of people contacting us through our numbers and emails to book their tickets again , so they had a great experience .
" That was our target from the beginning - to make sure there was a good experience had by all . "
And although the on - track battle did not produce the most memorable race of the year , Cregan thinks that had more to do with current F1 car design than the layout of the Yas Marina circuit .
" We were very happy that the event went off very well , " he said .
" Both the FIA and FOM said the event was fantastic .
" The racing spectacle is something that comes about through weather conditions or other circumstances - and it's also down to car design and sporting regulations .
" If you look at some of the other circuits around , they all have that same issue that a lot of it is down to the car design and the regulations as to what it can create - and the fact of whether drivers are willing to take a risk ?
Are they willing to lose a hundredth of a second here or there to have more spectacular racing ?
" Next year when you have no refuelling you will see more exciting racing , you will see cars on full tanks , and you will see very much that it is down to how the driver will look after his tyres .
We will see more interesting racing . "
In the snow - hushed woods on Moscow ’s northern edge , scientists are decades deep into research on bending the weather to their will .
They ’ve been at it since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin paused long enough in the throes of World War II to found an observatory dedicated to tampering with climatic inconveniences .
Since then , they ’ve melted away fog , dissipated the radioactive fallout from Chernobyl and called down rains fierce enough to drown unborn locusts threatening the distant northeastern grasslands .
Now they ’re poised to battle the most inevitable and emblematic force of Russian winter : the snow .
Moscow ’s government , led by powerful and long - reigning Mayor Yuri Luzhkov , has indicated that clearing the capital ’s streets of snow is simply too expensive .
Instead , officials are weighing a plan to seed the clouds with liquid nitrogen or dry ice to keep heavy snow from falling inside the city limits .
Word of the proposal has sent a shudder through Moscow just as the first dark , snowy days have fallen on the capital .
It has also piqued the surrounding region , which would receive the brunt of the displaced snowfall , and has raised concerns among ecologists .
“ I was very surprised because [ the mayor ] never even asked us , ” says Alexei Yablokov , who sits on the mayor ’s ecological council and has concerns about the proposal , including the environmental effects and pressure on surrounding villages .
“ We never discussed it at all . ”
The city government says it still has n’t reached a decision .
But scientists at the Central Aerological Observatory say they are deep into negotiations with authorities and expect the cloud - seeding plan to go forward .
The city has hit upon a splendid idea , the scientists say .
Laboring against the uncomfortable sense that their observatory ’s import has waned since its Soviet heyday , they are eager to unleash their many and various technologies .
They already seed the clouds for political effect , clearing the skies over Moscow twice a year to ensure sun-drenched celebrations of patriotic holidays .
In Russia , nobody rains on the parade -- because the Russian government does n’t allow it .
“ Victory Day is the most sacred holiday for us , ” says Bagrat Danilian , deputy chief of cloud seeding at the observatory .
“ When veterans go out to celebrate in Moscow , we create good weather for them . ”
All it takes , he says , is sacks of cement -- 500 - grade , to be precise .
Drop the powder down into the clouds , and they vanish .
Soviet scientists learned how to disperse clouds by accident 40 years ago :
They had flown overhead and dropped powdered blue paint into the clouds to tag them for observation .
Instead , the powder melted the clouds away .
Danilian , 56 , a dark - haired , solid man with a quick grin , was born to an Armenian family in Soviet Georgia and studied physics at Tbilisi State University .
He moved to Moscow in 1979 to work for the observatory , and has been there ever since .
He is nostalgic for the Soviet era of experimentation .
In those days , when Danilian was younger and funding more plentiful , he was sent off to Vietnam , Cuba and Syria to study the clouds .
He has flown into hurricanes , bounced through airstreams like a pingpong ball and survived lightning strikes on turboprop planes .
“ You wo n’t find a more interesting profession , ” he says enthusiastically .
“ You ca n’t compare it with anything .
You just float on your own adrenaline . ”
There is something almost godlike about interfering with the weather .
It was a need to rationalize the whims of climate that inspired the notion of deities in ancient times , and there is still an inherent sense of helplessness before nature ’s force .
In much of the world , weather and cloud research is focused on preventing hailstorms , tornadoes , droughts and the like .
Not that Russia is the only country that has used it to ensure sunny public holidays .
In Beijing , clouds have been chased away from the Olympic ceremonies and other celebrations .
But there is a certain nonchalance to the way Russians regard cloud seeding .
For a people accustomed to displays of great power , changing the weather draws little interest .
“ It ’s true that the attitude here is more positive , of course , ” says Aleksandr Azarov , senior scientist at the observatory .
And why not , he shrugs .
“ If there ’s a drought , who would n’t pray to God for rain to fall ? ”
The cloud seeding is done in moderation , scientists insist .
“ You should n’t overstep the threshold over which the weather would change globally , ” Danilian says .
“ We ’re trying to look for that threshold in a very careful way . ”
Sometimes , despite their efforts , nature wins .
And in one instance , gravity .
As the Russian air force toiled to chase the clouds out of town for last year ’s independence day celebrations , a clump of cement tumbled to earth instead of dissipating into the clouds .
It crashed through the roof of a house on Moscow ’s outskirts .
Rather than accept the $ 2,000 compensation offered by the military , the homeowner huffed to reporters that she would file suit for “ moral suffering . ”
It ’s unlikely that Muscovites would ever agree to forgo snow altogether .
During the long , dark months of winter , the flicker of clean snowflakes against the sky is one of the few recurrent graces , creating a vast playground for children and briefly coating the drab days in sparkling white .
But Luzhkov , the mayor , is prepared to choke off any particularly massive snowfalls , which usually unleash battalions of plows , flanked by armies of workers hoisting ice picks and shovels .
The city government believes it can save more than $ 13 million with cloud seeding .
“ In the movies , the snow looks very beautiful with St. Basil ’s Cathedral in the background , ” says Azarov , the senior scientist .
“ But this snow costs a pretty penny to Moscow authorities . ”

The leaked text has overshadowed the first day 's upbeat speeches
Earth Watch - Richard Black 's blog Documents leaked at the UN climate summit reveal divisions between industrialised and developing countries over the shape of a possible new deal .
Campaigners say a draft text proposed by the Danish host government would disadvantage poorer nations .
It also sees everything coming under a single new deal , whereas an alternative text from developing countries wants an extension to the Kyoto Protocol .
Other blocs are expected to release their own texts in the next few days .
Chairmen of working groups will then have to turn the various documents into a political document that 100 - odd world leaders , plus delegates representing all other nations , could sign at the end of the conference .
The Danish document , plus the alternative text submitted by the BASIC group ( Brazil , South Africa , India and China ) were discussed by a small group of key countries in Copenhagen last week .
But the Danish proposal had remained under wraps until The Guardian newspaper published it on its website during the second afternoon of the conference .
More ambition
The documents show that at the broadest level , developed and developing worlds are split on several points : the level of cuts from developed countries
the establishment of a target date by which global emissions should peak and begin to fall
most fundamentally , the shape of any future deal .
The BASIC draft sees emission reductions from developed countries coming under the Kyoto Protocol , whereas the Danish draft envisages all measures coming under a single new agreement .
Although this might appear a technical point , developing countries have so far remained adamant on the retention of the protocol because of the measures it contains on financial assistance and technology transfer , and because it is the only legally binding treaty in existence that makes countries reduce emissions .
The only formal texts in the UN process are the ones tabled by the Chairs of this Copenhagen conference at the behest of the parties
Yvo de Boer ,
UNFCCC executive secretary
Copenhagen : Your questions
The Danish text sets out a vision of greenhouse gas emissions peaking globally by 2020 , then declining .
It specifies a 50 % emissions cut globally ( from 1990 levels ) by 2050 .
Most industrialised nations have already pledged an 80 % cut in their own emissions .
According to some calculations , those figures , when combined with projected population growth in the developing world , mean that per-capita emissions in developing countries will remain below those in the west , " locking in " inequality .
CLIMATE CHANGE GLOSSARY
Glossary in full Oxfam 's Antonio Hill said industrialised nations had to offer bigger cuts than are currently on the table .
" The targets need to rise in ambition and in line with what the science says , " he told BBC News .
" We think that at least 40 % ( from 1990 levels by 2020 ) is needed ; and even that is not enough to produce equity . "
However , Mr Hill suggested that measures on transferring finance from industrialised to developing countries - to help them curb their emissions and help them protect against the impacts of climate change - were " quite good " .
Impossible dream ?
Other observers , such as Sol Oyuela from the development agency CAFOD , were more damning .
" The document should not even exist , " she said .
Global warming : A future glimpse " There is a UN legal process which is the official negotiating text ; there is no need for any other texts .
" To be working on a rival text is a kick in the teeth to the UN process that has been negotiated for so long . "
Yvo de Boer , executive secretary of the UN climate convention , also said the document had no formal weight within the negotiations .
" This was an informal paper ahead of the conference given to a number of people for the purposes of consultations , " he said .
" The only formal texts in the UN process are the ones tabled by the Chairs of this Copenhagen conference at the behest of the parties . "
The UK government dissociated itself from the text .
" At this stage in the negotiation there 's inevitably all sorts of texts doing the rounds and more will no doubt appear over the next 10 days , " said a spokesman for the Department for Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) .
" The UK is continuing to strive for the most ambitious deal possible , as the prime minister has made clear again today . "
Gordon Brown declared earlier that he would favour the EU moving from its current 20 % target to 30 % , which governments have agreed to do if there is a global deal here .
Over the next few days , small island states , least developed countries , the African bloc and the overall G77 / China grouping are expected to present their own texts .
The small island states are expected to demand a legally binding outcome from Copenhagen , which many insiders say is impossible .

It is ironic that as the nation continues to suffer from the misallocation of risk by companies in the financial sector , some of the strongest supporters of free markets and critics of government action are urging a massive federal subsidy for nuclear power .
It is ironic that as the nation continues to suffer from the misallocation of risk by companies in the financial sector , some of the strongest supporters of free markets and critics of government action are urging a massive federal subsidy for nuclear power .
Most recently , the nuclear industry and its supporters want any climate bill that comes out of Congress to include more subsidies for the nuclear industry .
Both the House - passed American Clean Energy and Security Act and the Senate energy bill , the American Clean Energy Leadership
Act , would potentially allow for billions of dollars to be handed out for the development of new nuclear plants in the United States .
The Senate bill would literally give the nuclear industry a limitless blank check .
This is in addition to $ 18.5 billion in loan guarantees and a production tax credit of 1.8 cents per kilowatt - hour that the federal government already has allocated for nuclear energy in the 2005 Energy Policy Act .
All the while , the projected cost of nuclear reactor construction has escalated dramatically ( almost tripling in less than a decade ) , demand for electricity has declined , and the cost of natural gas has plummeted .
Considering these challenges , private capital markets , not surprisingly , have refused to extend loans to the nuclear industry .
In fact , they have lowered the financial ratings of utilities that are pursuing nuclear projects , which is why the industry is seeking further government support .
In particular , the industry would like new rules that allow it to gobble up funds earmarked for clean energy technologies ; elimination of conditions that protect taxpayers in the event of loan defaults ; dramatic increases in tax and insurance subsidies ; and accelerated and assured recovery of construction costs from ratepayers authorized by state regulators .
These direct subsidies would total in the hundreds of billions of dollars .
Yet believe it or not , the stakes for consumers would be still higher .
Nuclear subsidies would induce utilities to choose high capital - cost nuclear reactors that expand their rate base and forego much lower - cost alternatives , such as greater energy efficiency and renewable energy , imposing excessive costs on consumers that eventually could run into the trillions of dollars .
In an attempt to circumvent the sound judgment of capital markets , nuclear advocates erroneously claim that subsidies lower the financing costs for nuclear reactors and are good for consumers .
( For a more lengthy analysis of these risks see my full report . )
However , shifting risk does not eliminate it , and subsidies induce utilities and regulators to take greater risks that will cost taxpayers and ratepayers dearly .
These risks include :
When utilities skip over the lower - cost option , such as greater efficiency , wind power , and / or natural gas , costs rise , dramatically in the case of nuclear reactors .
Subsidies encourage risky behaviors that would leave taxpayers and ratepayers to pay associated costs when and if those unwise projects go bad and are abandoned .
Pre-approval for loan guarantees and / or construction work in progress reduces scrutiny over cost escalation and overruns .
Large , high - risk projects , such as nuclear plants , can have adverse impacts on utility financial ratings , which result in high interest charges on utility debt and substantial increases in rates .
The recent efforts by the nuclear industry call to mind the previous U.S. nuclear construction boom that resulted in what Forbes called the “ largest managerial failure in business history ” in the mid-1980s .
In that boom , one - half of all orders for nuclear plants were cancelled , reactors that were completed cost double their original estimates , four - fifths of utilities suffered large financial downgrades , and several firms went bankrupt .
Policy makers should refuse to hand out billions of dollars more to the nuclear power industry for widespread deployment of a costly technology and limit any such subsidies , if they are deemed necessary , for specific and narrow tasks of research , development , and demonstration .
To prevent history from repeating itself they should subject any projects that are funded by subsidies to rigorous fiscal , technological , and administrative oversight and make sure that projects are structured with maximum taxpayer protections and transparency built into the conditions of the loan guarantees .
Furthermore , states should reject guarantees ( and accelerated recovery ) for nuclear construction costs , demand binding fixed - cost contracts before construction begins , and impose strong incentive and penalty mechanisms to control cost overruns .
The financial difficulties facing nuclear power projects are not a market failure , but are a market success –the capital markets correctly understand the grim economic realities of nuclear power .
If policy makers override the judgment of the free market and force taxpayers and ratepayers to subsidize new reactors , consumers and the economy will pay a heavy price .
Discover What the Skin Care Industry Is n't Telling You !
There are literally 1000's of products to choose from , but without the right information , it can be difficult to find one that truly produces results , allowing years of aging and wrinkles to vanish from your face and body .
It is possible to find a good skin care product that can do all of the things that it should , like whiten age spots and even out pigmentation , all at a reasonable price .
Obviously , there are some quality products out there that will make your skin smoother , more radiant and younger looking .
The difficultly is in knowing beforehand which skin care products really work .
Paradoxically , it is usually the most expensive skin care products that are the least effective .
If you are anything like me , you are fed up with anti wrinkle creams that do n't perform as advertised .
Before you are done reading this page , I guarantee that you will be vastly more informed about what makes a quality , effective skin care product that produces the results you sincerely desire .
Everyone knows that you and I will spend enormous amounts of our hard earned money if we believe that we can look more youthful and beautiful .
The cosmetic companies know .
The plastic surgeons know .
People are suckers for products that are supposed to improve our appearance .
As an informed consumer , you do n't need to fall for these marketing gimmicks .
There will never be a shortage of people willing to pay top dollar for the latest skin care product in a fancy bottle , whether it works or not .
The truth is that most people will not take the time to research specific products and ingredients to help them understand which ingredients work and which ingredients can actually harm their skin !
And , that`s really why a tiny tube can cost a hundred dollars or more .
Not because what`s inside is expensive , but because of all the other things the company decided to spend money on are expensive .
There is something you might already know about marketing , it is VERY EXPENSIVE !
They can paint a convincing picture with the right bottle , a few full page magazine advertisements and a high - profile celebrity endorsement who more than likely has never tried the products they are endorsing .
Many of these products are produced haphazardly , put into fancy high - end bottles and pushed onto the market .
Instead of investing time and money to produce a quality , proven skin care product , most manufacturers will choose to spend their money on marketing and product presentation .
There is so much demand for effective anti-aging skin care products , that manufacturers are constantly flooding the marketplace with new products to capitalize on this demand .
That 's why there are so many different skin care products on the market today .
The topical skin care market is a multi-billion dollar industry .
Now that we have discussed harmful ingredients to avoid , let 's discuss some good ingredients to look for and some ingredients that might sound good , but are actually not .
Alcohols can be listed as ethyl alcohol , methanol , ethanol , SD alcohol , benzyl alcohol and isopropyl alcohol .
Each type of alcohol acts differently , but those used in skin care products cause dryness and irritation .
They strip the skin of naturally protective oils making it more vulnerable to infection .
Several studies have linked the use of parabens to various types of cancer .
They are known to hinder the endocrine system , cause allergies and irritation .
Read the label and if it`s in there , put it back on the shelf .
Parabens act as a preservative , extending the shelf life of creams and lotions .
No oneseemed to think about what would happen if you rubbed them into your skin every day .
These may be listed on the label as propyl , butyl , methyl or ethyl paraben .
In some countries , their use is completely banned , butmany skin care products and moisturizers still contain them .
I believe that a little dab of fragrance here and there is much better than massaging it into a large area of skin while applying a skin care product .
That is not to say that perfumes and colognes do n't also contain undesirable chemicals .
I know for a fact that many of them do .
But I am realistic enough to know that people want to smell nice and are going to use something .
It is important to remember that the skin is porous and anything put on it is quickly absorbed .
There is less chemical absorption into the skin when you dab a bit of perfume or cologne .
When you apply a skin care product you are massaging it into your face and body , covering a large area of the skin .
But when you apply a bit of perfume or body spray this is not the case .
Skin care products should not contain perfumes or fragrances .
If you want to smell nice , stick with a dab of perfume or body spray .
Everyone wants to smell nice , but there are literally thousands of different chemicals that can be listed on the label as " fragrance " .
Many of them contain toxins or known carcinogens .
It is scary to think that people pay top dollar to unknowingly put this stuff on their skin !
The chemical will pass through your pores and quickly enter your blood stream .
It is unregulated in most states and countries , but the state of California lists it as a known carcinogen and the attorney general hasbrought several lawsuits against so - called " organic " skin care products thatcontain it .
The synthetic derivative now used often contains high levels of 1,4 - dioxane , which is quickly absorbed through the skin .
Dioxane was originally derived from coconut .
Â
Knowing that , you might think it sounds pretty good , but it is the shell , not the flesh and the compound is now created synthetically and used in a number of skincare products .
This common ingredient in skin care products can actually cause you to look older rather than younger !
If you continue to use the product , your face can become chapped and dry , because your skin stops producing its own oils .
Â
It simply dries out .
When this natural process is blocked by thick waxyingredients , pimples form , blackheads multiply and rashes can develop over time .
Â
Your skin starts to feel bumpy and greasy .
After just one application of a product containing mineral oil , your pores will become clogged .
You may not realize it , but your skin " breathes " too .
Any product containing mineral oil will actually prevent your skin from " breathing " and trap toxins inside .
Mineral oil is found in 100's of products I have researched .
It may be listed as liquid paraffin , paraffin wax or petrolatum on the label of the product .
It does n't matter what they call it , it is bad for your skin .
Companies use mineral oil for one simple reason : it 's cheap !
It is hard to believe , but many skin care products contain a variety of ingredientsthat can actually damage your skin over time .
I am going to discuss some ingredients to avoid in this section .
Ingredients to Look For
Before we discuss some specific ingredients , it is important that we understand a little about how the skin ages and what type of product will be effective in reversing the signs of aging .
The main reason the skin starts to sag and / or form wrinkles is that elastin and collagen start to break down .
Elastin is a protein that helps the skin stay supple and firm .
When your skin is stretched , it is the elastin that returns it to its normal position .
Collagen is a fibrous protein .
Collagen is special among proteins because of its great tensile strength providing firmness to the skin .
Over time , our bodies produce less of the proteins collagen and elastin .
Without them , the skin loses its elasticity , starts to sag and form wrinkles .
This is why it is important to use ingredients effective at firming skin .
Exposure to the sun also causes changes in collagen fibers thatlead to wrinkles and lines .
Air pollution increases the production offree radicals , which further damage collagen fibers .
There are new , well researched compounds that can reverse and prevent this damage .
Nutrients for healthy skin that destroy free radicals .
There are unique products that your pores will absorb and use to produce new collagen and elastin .
When you use skin care products that contain these ingredients , your skin will start to look younger , healthier and more radiant .
When you are choosing a skin care product , it is important that you do not purchase one that is purely cosmetic in nature .
There are plenty of skin creams that will fill in the lines while they are on , temporarily giving the appearance of nicer skin , but as soon as you wash them off , reality returns .
In order for a skin firming creamto be truly effective , it must contain ingredients that nourish , nurture and stimulate your body ’s ability to heal itself .
If you want to prevent or reduce wrinkles , you want something that increases production of collagen , elastin and new skin cells .
If you do this , you will actually reverse the aging of your skin .
Now pay close attention to what I say next , because it is very important .
Several manufacturers of expensive products try to deceive the public by including some really good active ingredients .
The problem is that they do not contain enough of the active ingredients to be effective .
They contain just a small amount so that they can legally list the ingredient on their label .
The best ingredients are expensive , and as I mentioned before , most manufacturers spend the majority of their money on marketing .
So , it is not enough to look for the ingredients mentioned below , they must be high up on the list of ingredients .
Look for the highest concentration that you can find .
Xtend TK
This is a cutting edge substance recently developed by a research team in New Zealand .
Xtend TK will stimulate the body 's production of collagen fibers , because this natural substance can be " used " by the skin to create both collagen and elastin , thereby promoting firmness and elasticity .
With continued use , your face will look younger and healthier .
Wrinkles and fine lines will gradually lessen .
Xtend TK actually allows your skin to repair itself just as it did when you were a small child .
This ingredient also helps your skin retain much needed moisture .
Clinical research has shown a 14 % improvement in moisture and a 42 % increase in elasticity when Xtend TK was applied for 18 consecutive days .
Phytessence Wakame
Phytessence Wakame is an exotic kelp that has been used for hundreds of years in Japan , both as a food source and to promote younger healthier skin .
The reason it is healthy as a food , is due to the vitamins and minerals that it contains .
But , why is it good for your skin ?
Researchers have learned that this specific type of sea kelp blocks an enzymatic reaction that breaks down another of your skin`s natural proteins .
This one is called hyaluronic acid .
Wow , that`s a mouthful to be sure , but a simple way to look at is this .
It binds collagen and elastin fibers together , so that skin is firmer .
Collage
Collagen , as an ingredient , should really be back up there with the things to avoid .
Collagen when applied topically doesn`t do anything for your skin .
The molecules are much too large to be absorbed into the skin .
You may have heard of expensive collagen injections and when it is mentioned as an ingredient in a skin care product it makes you think , " Great !
That should work . "
When injected , collagen merely fattens up the lowest layers of your skin and " stretches " out the wrinkles .
When your rub it on your face , it does absolutely nothing .
Once again , you want to encourage and support your body`s natural ability to produce " new " collagen .
Now let`s finally get to the really good stuff .
Hyaluronic acid is sometimes referred to as Hyaluronan .
Its importance in repairing and replacing damaged skin cells is well documented .
CoQ10
You may recognize CoQ10 as a health supplement often referred to as Coenzyme Q10 .
You will frequently see it listed in the ingredients of some of the better skin care products .
CoQ10 is a vitamin like substance that is found in every cell of the body and in high levels in the cells of the skin .
It is a powerful antioxidant .
Â
An antioxidant is something that destroys free radicals .
It is precisely this antioxidant ability that allows CoQ10 to counter free radicals before they damage the skin .
Unfortunately , as with collagen and elastin , the levels of CoQ10 in our bodies decrease with age .
Exposure to UV radiation from the sun quickly depletes COQ10 levels in the skin .
The problem that most developers have run into is that lotions containing the CoQ10 are not readily absorbed through the pores and do not penetrate deep into the skin .
Not to worry , there is a form of CoQ10 that does penetrate deeply into the skin .
It is Nano - Lipobelle H-EQ10 .
Nano - Lipobelle H-EQ10
This is a ' nano - emulsion ' ( that`s like a combination ) of COQ10 and vitamin E that was created using a patented process that grinds the antioxidants down to a microscopic size that can easily enter the pores and penetrate all 7 layers of skin , absorbing free radicals as it goes .
The benefits of Nano - Lipobelle H-EQ10 include : Anti-wrinkle and wrinkle prevention
Increased production of collagen and elastin
Improved appearance
Noticeably firmer , smoother skin
These results have all been proven in clinical trials .
WASHINGTON
It ’s easy to dismiss Sarah Palin .
She ’s back on the trail , with the tumbling hair and tumbling thoughts .
The queen of the scenic strip mall known as Wasilla now reigns over thrilled subjects thronging to a politically strategic swath of American strip malls .
The conservative celebrity clearly has n’t boned up on anything , except her own endless odyssey of self - discovery .
And she still has that Yoda - like syntax .
“ And I think more of a concern has been not within the campaign the mistakes that were made , not being able to react to the circumstances that those mistakes created in a real positive and professional and helpful way for John McCain , ” she told Bill O’Reilly .
Yet Democrats would be foolish to write off her visceral power .
As Judith Doctor , a 69 - year - old spiritual therapist , told The Washington Post ’s Jason Horowitz at Palin ’s book signing in Grand Rapids , Mich . , “ She ’s alive inside , and that radiates energy , and people who are not psychologically alive inside are fascinated by that . ”

Your application is elegant and well designed .
It 's covered by unit tests , the domain is effectively modeled , and your key algorithms are scalable and optimized .
You know the methods like Jules Winfield knows Ezekiel 25:17 .
You may even be looking forward to pushing it to production , thinking , " Hey , we got it right for once ! "
However , unless you have littered your beautiful codebase with thousands of hacked - up log lines for the most trivial operations , you do n't stand a chance in hell of supporting this app .
What 's the biggest difference between how developers and QA use a system versus how actual production users use the system ?
It 's simple : developer and QA know what the hell they 're doing .
Production users are going to click every button at the wrong time , enter bizarre and incorrect information into forms , and fail to read any and all messaging from the system .
Not only will these barbarians be savaging your system , but there are thousands of them and they expect you to help them .
You can certainly try to support these users and fix the bugs they report without any logs .
After all , you have their data , you have your app , and you can just reproduce their errors manually .
That 's nice thinking , but you 're wrong .
Remember , you know how to use your system .
You 're not going to load 87,000 records into your grid , or try to delete 87,000 records at once , or type an 87,000 word stream - of - consciousness diatribe about gluten - free products into a memo field .
Good luck reproducing that big ball of insanity via the user 's data alone .
What are some of the benefits of excessive logging across your application ?
First , you know exactly what users were doing when something blew up .
This is always much more helpful than a user - submitted bug report ; the users submitting these bug reports have an imperfect knowledge of the system and they 're not going to remember exactly what they were doing when catastrophe struck .
You can reproduce erroneous conditions exactly if you 've been logging like a fiend , though .
Second , it 's much easier to determine if a production issue is an actual bug or if it 's some random hiccup in your production environment .
Databases crash , routers get rebooted , and third - party APIs go down for updates .
Maybe your production environment only experienced this hiccup for 1.5 seconds , but it could be the precise period where the CEO was hitting the Save button .
Good luck figuring that out without logs .
Third , voluminous , time - stamped logs can give you great insight into production performance .
If you write software like the rest of us , the load your system is under in the development and QA environment is nothing at all like the load it 's under in production .
Once under that load , trivial things can slow down ... a lot .
Think about a wooly mammoth , stuck in tar , dragging a Winnebago behind him , and know that 'll be some random part of your system that you never expected .
If you collect time - stamped logs like my great aunt collects stray cats , then it's a cinch to find these culprits and then begin to tune them appropriately .
I think we all agree now that logs are tremendously important .
If not , I encourage you to head over to check out the latest Ziggy comic and to leave the grown - up talk to the rest of us .
What exactly do we want to log then ?
First , log every time your system goes out of process .
Thus , log all database , filesystem , OS , API , and web service calls .
Since you typically do n't control these dependencies , you need to know exactly what you sent to them and what they sent back in order to troubleshoot any weirdness .
Second , log all user input .
It 's hard to overestimate the variance you 'll see when you start asking your users for information .
Do n't be s
hocked when you see that people are filling in the First Name prompt with ' hi my name is anthony and i am in the market for that crystal skull vodka that dan akroyd sells on the internet ' .
Real users can submit strange , strange stuff .
Third , log the input and output for any non-trivial algorithms in your code .
Sure , you 've tested this logic to Hades and back , but you 'll still find some weird edge cases in production .
For example , one of my beautiful scheduling algorithms one time blew up in production because of a weirdness with Argentinian timezones .
I certainly did n't anticipate that .
Adding all of this logging into your code is certainly going to ugly it up .
It 's a good kind of ugliness though , an ugliness that shows preparation for any and all crazy ass questions you 'll have to field once you have real users .
And this ugliness definitely beats the alternative , which is slowly being driven insane by trying to fix bugs you can't reproduce .
Think of it as logging as self defense .
Port - au - Prince , Haiti ( CNN ) --
Rescuers were still finding survivors trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings in earthquake - ravaged Haiti on Wednesday , and relief officials said efforts to get aid into the hands of survivors were improving .
A magnitude 5.9 aftershock rattled Port - au - Prince early Wednesday , the strongest since the original 7.0 - magnitude quake struck January 12 , the United States Geological Survey reported .
Meanwhile , complaints about bottlenecks that have hindered the delivery of food , water and medicine to survivors persisted even as U.S. and U.N. officials said the effort has begun to make progress .
" There 's big success in getting things into the port , " said Steve Hollingworth , chief operating officer of CARE .
" The real challenge now is following through and having a series of successful distributions going on all over the country , and that 's a challenge for a lot of reasons . "
Wednesday 's aftershock was centered about 35 miles ( 60 kilometers ) west - southwest of Port - au - Prince , and about 6.2 miles ( 10 kilometers ) deep , according to the USGS .
Patients at a hospital near Haiti's airport in the capital Port - au - Prince immediately started praying as the ground shook like a ship rocking back and forth .
They asked for forgiveness and protection , a nurse there said .
An aftershock that size can pose significant danger in an area where buildings already are damaged -- and one nonprofit organization , Save the Children , said its staff " heard already - weakened structures collapsing " as a result of the aftershock .
Engineering team heads to check buildings
Haiti's government put the confirmed death toll at more than 72,000 on Tuesday , with other estimates ranging as high as 200,000 .
The confirmed toll already puts Haiti 's quake among the 10 deadliest of the last century , according to USGS figures .
i Report : Search list for the missing and found
But survivors were still being discovered in the rubble of homes and other buildings in Port - au - Prince .
A 5 - year - old boy named Monley was pulled alive from a collapsed home on Wednesday and was taken to a hospital to be treated for severe dehydration .
His mother was killed and his father is missing , but doctors attributed Monley 's survival to resilience and the strength of his young body .
Relatives found the boy in a void beneath the ruins of his house as they searched for his father , his uncle said .
Four of the uncle 's friends helped pull the boy out as he cried out , over and over again , " I 'm thirsty . "
Others reported that the few signs of survivors in the wreckage of the Hotel Montana were fading Wednesday .
Some faint knocking that had lasted until early Wednesday morning stopped after the latest tremor , rescuers on the scene said .
The hotel , located in the more affluent suburb of Petionville , was popular with tourists and visiting officials .
In all , international rescue teams totaling about 1,700 people have rescued 121 people , the United Nations said .
But about 3 million people -- nearly a third of the Haitian population -- were still in need of food , water , shelter and medical assistance Wednesday , the United Nations estimated .
The aid effort has frustrated some , with a few organizations charging that bottlenecks at the airport and mismanagement in other areas have hampered efforts to get help to the 2 million residents in Port - au - Prince who need it .
" It 's very frustrating that it takes so long to get as many supplies , doctors and hospitals that are needed , " John Holmes , the U.N. emergency relief coordinator , told CNN's " American Morning . "

" But again , I think we 're making progress , " Holmes said .
" I think there is a major issue here of people with those injuries who got infected wounds , who need operations , who are not getting as many as they can .
That 's the major priority for the next few days . "
But Hollingworth said the devastation in Haiti was " so profound " that " I 'm personally getting more and more concerned by the day . "
" This has been a major body blow to Haiti , and , you know , we 're in now the second week of the response , " he said .
" The international community really is mobilizing very quickly , but the devastation has been so profound here , and it's hit in such critical areas for the country that I 'm getting worried . "

A leading relief agency , Doctors Without Borders , has complained that the bottlenecks are costing lives .
The group has blamed five deaths on the delays so far , telling reporters that flights carrying drugs , surgical supplies and dialysis machines have been diverted from Port - au - Prince to the neighboring Dominican Republic three times since Sunday , and injured at some sites may face a 10 - to 12 - day wait for full treatment .
More than 25 countries have contributed money , goods or people to the relief effort , while U.S. private donors have given more than $ 275 million .
Among them were President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama , who contributed $ 15,000 to the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund .
At least 11,000 U.S. troops are now in Haiti or on ships nearby , and the military said Wednesday that it plans to send an additional 4,000 sailors and Marines from the USS Nassau Amphibious Ready Group to Haiti .

In an effort to open the flow of aid , Pentagon officials said they have obtained landing rights at the Dominican Republic 's air base at San Isidro , about 150 miles ( 241 kilometers ) east of Port - au - Prince .
In addition , Washington is dispatching a ship equipped with cranes that could get the port of Port - au - Prince back into operation " within a week or two , perhaps , " Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters Wednesday during a visit to India .

Canadian troops are working to open an airfield in the southern city of Jacmel by Thursday , Canadian Defense Minster Peter Mackay announced in a statement from Ottawa , Ontario , and two warships are landing supplies by sea .
But while those efforts are being stepped up , scenes of desperation persisted around the capital .
At the city 's municipal nursing home , where six people died , the remainder of the elderly patients were outside .
Many suffer from terminal illnesses or dementia , and the only doctor treating them was a volunteer who showed up Tuesday , CNN's Gary Tuchman reported .
Watch how there is no plan to help the nursing home patients
Some parts of the city were home to scenes of " madness , " CNN 's Ivan Watson reported .
At the port , thousands of people lined a wharf where they had been sleeping for days , desperate to catch a ferry that the government had promised would give free passage to another port 100 miles west of the capital .
When the ferry appeared , they jumped into wooden rowboats , overloading them , and swarmed the ship , passing their children up and climbing aboard themselves .
The owner told Watson the boat 's capacity was 600 .
Many more tried to board for the trip , ignoring the fact that the boat held few life vests and fewer lifeboats .
Watch as Haitian try to flee the devastation
One ship that did arrive Wednesday was the American hospital ship USNS Comfort -- a seagoing , 1,000 - bed hospital that could give a boost to overloaded hospitals and clinics .
Capt .
Andy Johnson , its medical operations director , said the Comfort expects to handle a minimum of 100 patients a day , the vast majority of them with orthopedic injuries suffered in collapsed buildings .
The first two patients taken on board , flown to the ship before it reached Haitian waters , were a 6 - year - old boy with a crushed pelvis and 20 - year - old man with a broken skull and possibly fractured cervical vertebrae .
Cmdr .
Tim Donahue , the ship 's lead surgeon , said many of the staff have experience treating severe injuries among veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" They 're not shocked by what they 're seeing , " Donahue said .
" It 's very routine for them . "
The ship carries 40 doctors , including 13 surgeons , and enough medical supplies to operate for 60 days .
Its total medical staff of nearly 550 will be joined by another 350 people once the ship reaches Haiti , according to the U.S. Southern Command .
More than a week after the devastating earthquake , efforts to get hospitals back into working shape were seeing some results , but the injured were still streaming in .
Donahue said the number of people still emerging alive from collapsed buildings was surprising .
" We should n't expect to see people still around , " he said .
" It speaks to how resilient the human body is . "

The Wall Street Journal reports today on a temporary suspension of the estate tax ( what conservatives call the “ death tax ” ) , which will go into effect on January 1 , 2010 .
The lapse dates back to the bundle of tax cuts passed under the Bush Administration in 2001 :
Congress raised estate - tax exemptions , culminating with the tax ’s disappearance next year .
However , due to budget constraints , lawmakers did n’t make the change permanent .
So the estate tax is due to come back to life in 2011 – at a higher rate and lower exemption .
The WSJ piece is titled “ Rich Cling to Life to Beat Tax Man , ” and its interviews demonstrate , once again , that the rich really are different :
They ’re really creepy .
It seems quite a few of them are making end - of - life decisions based on how it will affect their inheritance taxes .
“ I have two clients on life support , and the families are struggling with whether to continue heroic measures for a few more days , ” says Joshua Rubenstein , a lawyer with Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP in New York .
“ Do they want to live for the rest of their lives having made serious medical decisions based on estate - tax law ? ” …
To make it easier on their heirs , some clients are putting provisions into their health - care proxies allowing whoever makes end - of - life medical decisions to consider changes in estate - tax law .
“ We have done this at least a dozen times , and have gotten more calls recently , ” says Andrew Katzenstein , a lawyer with Proskauer Rose LLP in Los Angeles .
The article focuses on people who are trying to keep their so - called loved ones alive until 2010 begins .
But you can just as easily imagine all the greedy bastards out there who are hoping their healthy old relatives will get really sick , really soon , so they can kick off before the year ends .
On the Atlantic ’s business blog today , Derek Thompson comments on the political implications of the year - long estate tax suspension .
He highlights the hypocrisy of Republican policymaking , which insists upon deficit reduction while simultaneously serving the interests of wealthy people like these , whose riches have to be wrested from their cold , dead hands :
A friend was walking in the desert when he found the telephone to God .
The setting was Burning Man , an electronic arts and music festival for which 50,000 people descend on Black Rock City , Nevada , for eight days of " radical self - expression " — dancing , socializing , meditating , and debauchery .
A phone booth in the middle of the desert with a sign that said " Talk to God " was a surreal sight even at Burning Man .
The idea was that you picked up the phone , and God — or someone claiming to be God — would be at the other end to ease your pain .
So when God came on the line asking how he could help , my friend was ready .
" How can I live more in the moment ? " he asked .
Too often , he felt , the beautiful moments of his life were drowned out by a cacophony of self - consciousness and anxiety .
What could he do to hush the buzzing of his mind ?
" Breathe , " replied a soothing male voice .
My friend flinched at the tired new - age mantra , then reminded himself to keep an open mind .
When God talks , you listen .
" Whenever you feel about your future or your past , just breathe , " continued God .
" Try it with me a few times right now .
Breathe in ... breathe out . "
And despite himself , my friend began to relax .
You Are Not Your Thoughts
Life unfolds in the present .
But so often , we let the present slip away , allowing time to rush past unobserved and unseized , and squandering the precious seconds of our lives as we worry about the future and ruminate about what 's past .
" We 're living in a world that contributes in a major way to mental fragmentation , disintegration , distraction , decoherence , " says Buddhist scholar B. Alan Wallace .
We 're always doing something , and we allow little time to practice stillness and calm .
When we 're at work , we about being on vacation ; on vacation , we worry about the work piling up on our desks .
We dwell on intrusive memories of the past or fret about what may or may not happen in the future .
We do n't appreciate the living present because our " monkey minds , " as Buddhists call them , vault from thought to thought like monkeys swinging from tree to tree .
Most of us do n't undertake our thoughts in awareness .
Rather , our thoughts control us .
" Ordinary thoughts course through our mind like a deafening waterfall , " writes Jon Kabat - Zinn , the biomedical scientist who introduced into mainstream medicine .
In order to feel more in control of our minds and our lives , to find the sense of balance that eludes us , we need to step out of this current , to pause , and , as Kabat - Zinn puts it , to " rest in stillness — to stop doing and focus on just being . "
We need to live more in the moment .
Living in the moment — also called — is a state of active , open , intentional attention on the present .
When you become mindful , you realize that you are not your thoughts ; you become an observer of your thoughts from moment to moment without judging them .
Mindfulness involves being with your thoughts as they are , neither grasping at them nor pushing them away .
Instead of letting your life go by without living it , you awaken to experience .
Cultivating a nonjudgmental awareness of the present bestows a host of benefits .
Mindfulness reduces stress , boosts immune functioning , reduces , lowers blood pressure , and helps patients cope with cancer .
By alleviating stress , spending a few minutes a day actively focusing on living in the moment reduces the risk of heart disease .
Mindfulness may even slow the progression of HIV .
Mindful people are happier , more exuberant , more , and more secure .
They have higher and are more accepting of their own weaknesses .
awareness in the here and now reduces the kinds of impulsivity and reactivity that underlie , , and attention problems .
Mindful people can hear negative feedback without feeling threatened .
They fight less with their romantic partners and are more accommodating and less defensive .
As a result , mindful couples have more satisfying relationships .
Mindfulness is at the root of Buddhism , Taoism , and many Native - American traditions , not to mention yoga .
It 's why Thoreau went to Walden Pond ; it 's what Emerson and Whitman wrote about in their essays and poems .
" Everyone agrees it 's important to live in the moment , but the problem is how , " says Ellen Langer , a psychologist at Harvard and author of Mindfulness .
" When people are not in the moment , they 're not there to know that they 're not there . "
Overriding the distraction reflex and awakening to the present takes intentionality and practice .
Living in the moment involves a profound paradox :
You can't pursue it for its benefits .
That 's because the expectation of reward launches a future - oriented mindset , which subverts the entire process .
Instead , you just have to trust that the rewards will come .
There are many paths to mindfulness — and at the core of each is a paradox .
Ironically , letting go of what you want is the only way to get it .
Here are a few tricks to help you along .
1 : To improve your performance , stop thinking about it ( unselfconsciousness ) .
I 've never felt comfortable on a dance floor .
My movements feel awkward .
I feel like people are judging me .
I never know what to do with my arms .
I want to let go , but I can't , because I know I look ridiculous .
" Loosen up , no one 's watching you , " people always say .
" Everyone 's too busy worrying about themselves . "
So how come they always make fun of my dancing the next day ?
The dance world has a term for people like me : " absolute beginner . "
Which is why my dance teacher , Jessica Hayden , the owner of Shockra Studio in Manhattan , started at the beginning , sitting me down on a bench and having me tap my feet to the beat as Jay - Z thumped away in the background .
We spent the rest of the class doing " isolations " — moving just our shoulders , ribs , or hips — to build " body awareness . "
But even more important than body awareness , Hayden said , was present - moment awareness .
" Be right here right now ! " she 'd say .
" Just let go and let yourself be in the moment . "
That 's the first paradox of living in the moment :
Thinking too hard about what you 're doing actually makes you do worse .
If you 're in a situation that makes you anxious — giving a speech , introducing yourself to a stranger , dancing — focusing on your anxiety tends to heighten it .
" When I say , 'be here with me now , ' I mean do n't zone out or get too in - your - head — instead , follow my energy , my movements , " says Hayden .
" Focus less on what 's going on in your mind and more on what 's going on in the room , less on your mental chatter and more on yourself as part of something . "
To be most myself , I needed to focus on things outside myself , like the music or the people around me .
Indeed , mindfulness blurs the line between self and other , explains Michael Kernis , a psychologist at the University of Georgia .
" When people are mindful , they 're more likely to experience themselves as part of humanity , as part of a greater universe . "
That 's why highly mindful people such as Buddhist monks talk about being " one with everything . "
By reducing self - consciousness , mindfulness allows you to witness the passing drama of feelings , social pressures , even of being esteemed or disparaged by others without taking their evaluations personally , explain Richard Ryan and K. W. Brown of the University of Rochester .
When you focus on your immediate experience without attaching it to your self - esteem , unpleasant events like social rejection — or your so - called friends making fun of your dancing — seem less threatening .
Focusing on the present moment also forces you to stop overthinking .
" Being present - minded takes away some of that self - evaluation and getting lost in your mind — and in the mind is where we make the evaluations that beat us up , " says Stephen Schueller , a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania .
Instead of getting stuck in your head and worrying , you can let yourself go .
2 : To avoid worrying about the future , focus on the present ( savoring ) .
In her memoir Eat , Pray , Love , Elizabeth Gilbert writes about a friend who , whenever she sees a beautiful place , exclaims in a near panic , " It 's so beautiful here !
I want to come back here someday ! "
" It takes all my persuasive powers , " writes Gilbert , " to try to convince her that she is already here . "
Often , we 're so trapped in thoughts of the future or the past that we forget to experience , let alone enjoy , what 's happening right now .
We sip coffee and think , " This is not as good as what I had last week . "
We eat a cookie and think , " I hope I do n't run out of cookies . "
Instead , relish or luxuriate in whatever you 're doing at the present moment — what psychologists call savoring .
" This could be while you 're eating a pastry , taking a shower , or basking in the sun .
You could be savoring a success or savoring music , " explains Sonja Lyubomirsky , a psychologist at the University of California at Riverside and author of The How of .
" Usually it involves your senses . "
When subjects in a study took a few minutes each day to actively savor something they usually hurried through — eating a meal , drinking a cup of tea , walking to the bus — they began experiencing more joy , happiness , and other positive emotions , and fewer depressive symptoms , Schueller found .
Why does living in the moment make people happier — not just at the moment they 're tasting molten chocolate pooling on their tongue , but lastingly ?
Because most negative thoughts concern the past or the future .
As Mark Twain said , " I have known a great many troubles , but most of them never happened . "
The hallmark of depression and anxiety is — worrying about something that has n't happened yet and might not happen at all .
Worry , by its very nature , means thinking about the future — and if you hoist yourself into awareness of the present moment , worrying melts away .
The flip side of worrying is ruminating , thinking bleakly about events in the past .
And again , if you press your focus into the now , rumination ceases .
Savoring forces you into the present , so you can't worry about things that are n't there .
3 : If you want a future with your significant other , inhabit the present ( breathe ) .
Living consciously with alert interest has a powerful effect on interpersonal life .
Mindfulness actually inoculates people against aggressive impulses , say Whitney Heppner and Michael Kernis of the University of Georgia .
In a study they conducted , each subject was told that other subjects were forming a group — and taking a vote on whether she could join .
Five minutes later , the experimenter announced the results — either the subject had gotten the least number of votes and been rejected or she 'd been accepted .
Beforehand , half the subjects had undergone a mindfulness exercise in which each slowly ate a raisin , savoring its taste and texture and focusing on each sensation .
Later , in what they thought was a separate experiment , subjects had the opportunity to deliver a painful blast of noise to another person .
Among subjects who had n't eaten the raisin , those who were told they 'd been rejected by the group became aggressive , inflicting long and painful sonic blasts without provocation .
Stung by social rejection , they took it out on other people .
But among those who'd eaten the raisin first , it did n't matter whether they 'd been ostracized or embraced .
Either way , they were serene and unwilling to inflict pain on others — exactly like those who were given word of social acceptance .
How does being in the moment make you less aggressive ?
" Mindfulness decreases ego involvement , " explains Kernis .
" So people are less likely to link their self - esteem to events and more likely to take things at face value . "
Mindfulness also makes people feel more connected to other people — that empathic feeling of being " at one with the universe . "
Mindfulness boosts your awareness of how you interpret and react to what 's happening in your mind .
It increases the gap between emotional impulse and action , allowing you to do what Buddhists call recognizing the spark before the flame .
Focusing on the present reboots your mind so you can respond thoughtfully rather than automatically .
Instead of lashing out in , backing down in , or mindlessly indulging a passing craving , you get the opportunity to say to yourself , " This is the emotion I 'm feeling .
How should I respond ? "
Mindfulness increases ; since you 're not getting thrown by threats to your self - esteem , you 're better able to regulate your behavior .
That 's the other irony : Inhabiting your own mind more fully has a powerful effect on your interactions with others .
Of course , during a flare - up with your significant other it 's rarely practical to duck out and savor a raisin .
But there 's a simple exercise you can do anywhere , anytime to induce mindfulness : Breathe .
As it turns out , the advice my friend got in the desert was spot-on .
There 's no better way to bring yourself into the present moment than to focus on your breathing .
Because you 're placing your awareness on what 's happening right now , you propel yourself powerfully into the present moment .
For many , focusing on the breath is the preferred method of orienting themselves to the now — not because the breath has some magical property , but because it 's always there with you .
4 : To make the most of time , lose track of it ( flow ) .
Perhaps the most complete way of living in the moment is the state of total absorption psychologists call flow .
Flow occurs when you 're so engrossed in a task that you lose track of everything else around you .
Flow embodies an apparent paradox :
How can you be living in the moment if you 're not even aware of the moment ?
The depth of engagement absorbs you powerfully , keeping attention so focused that distractions cannot penetrate .
You focus so intensely on what you 're doing that you 're unaware of the passage of time .
Hours can pass without you noticing .
Flow is an elusive state .
As with romance or sleep , you can't just will yourself into it — all you can do is set the stage , creating the optimal conditions for it to occur .
The first requirement for flow is to set a goal that 's challenging but not unattainable — something you have to marshal your resources and stretch yourself to achieve .
The task should be matched to your ability level — not so difficult that you 'll feel , but not so easy that you 'll get bored .
In flow , you 're firing on all cylinders to rise to a challenge .
To set the stage for flow , need to be clearly defined so that you always know your next step .
" It could be playing the next bar in a scroll of music , or finding the next foothold if you 're a rock climber , or turning the page if you 're reading a good novel , " says Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi , the psychologist who first defined the concept of flow .
" At the same time , you 're kind of anticipating . "
You also need to set up the task in such a way that you receive direct and immediate feedback ; with your successes and failures apparent , you can seamlessly adjust your behavior .
A climber on the mountain knows immediately if his foothold is secure ; a pianist knows instantly when she 's played the wrong note .
As your attentional focus narrows , self - consciousness evaporates .
You feel as if your awareness merges with the action you 're performing .
You feel a sense of personal mastery over the situation , and the activity is so intrinsically rewarding that although the task is difficult , action feels effortless .
5 : If something is bothering you , move toward it rather than away from it ( acceptance ) .
We all have pain in our lives , whether it 's the ex we still long for , the jackhammer snarling across the street , or the sudden wave of anxiety when we get up to give a speech .
If we let them , such irritants can distract us from the enjoyment of life .
Paradoxically , the obvious response — focusing on the problem in order to combat and overcome it — often makes it worse , argues Stephen Hayes , a psychologist at the University of Nevada .
The mind 's natural tendency when faced with pain is to attempt to avoid it — by trying to resist unpleasant thoughts , feelings , and sensations .
When we lose a love , for instance , we fight our feelings of heartbreak .
As we get older , we work feverishly to recapture our youth .
When we 're sitting in the dentist 's chair waiting for a painful root canal , we wish we were anywhere but there .
But in many cases , negative feelings and situations can't be avoided — and resisting them only magnifies the pain .
The problem is we have not just primary emotions but also secondary ones — emotions about other emotions .
We get stressed out and then think , " I wish I were n't so stressed out . "
The primary emotion is stress over your workload .
The secondary emotion is feeling , " I hate being stressed . "
It does n't have to be this way .
The solution is acceptance — letting the emotion be there .
That is , being open to the way things are in each moment without trying to manipulate or change the experience — without judging it , clinging to it , or pushing it away .
The present moment can only be as it is .
Trying to change it only frustrates and exhausts you .
Acceptance relieves you of this needless extra suffering .
Suppose you 've just broken up with your girlfriend or boyfriend ; you 're heartbroken , overwhelmed by feelings of sadness and longing .
You could try to fight these feelings , essentially saying , " I hate feeling this way ; I need to make this feeling go away . "
But by focusing on the pain — being sad about being sad — you only prolong the sadness .
You do yourself a favor by accepting your feelings , saying instead , " I 've just had a breakup .
Feelings of loss are normal and natural .
It 's OK for me to feel this way . "
Acceptance of an unpleasant state does n't mean you do n't have goals for the future .
It just means you accept that certain things are beyond your control .
The sadness , stress , pain , or anger is there whether you like it or not .
Better to embrace the feeling as it is .
Nor does acceptance mean you have to like what 's happening .
" Acceptance of the present moment has nothing to do with resignation , " writes Kabat - Zinn .
" Acceptance does n't tell you what to do .
What happens next , what you choose to do ; that has to come out of your understanding of this moment . "
If you feel anxiety , for instance , you can accept the feeling , label it as anxiety — then direct your attention to something else instead .
You watch your thoughts , perceptions , and emotions flit through your mind without getting involved .
Thoughts are just thoughts .
You do n't have to believe them and you do n't have to do what they say .
6 : Know that you do n't know ( engagement ) .
You 've probably had the experience of driving along a highway only to suddenly realize you have no or awareness of the previous 15 minutes .
Maybe you even missed your exit .
You just zoned out ; you were somewhere else , and it's as if you 've suddenly woken up at the wheel .
Or maybe it happens when you 're reading a book : " I know I just read that page , but I have no idea what it said . "
These autopilot moments are what Harvard 's Ellen Langer calls mindlessness — times when you 're so lost in your thoughts that you are n't aware of your present experience .
As a result , life passes you by without registering on you .
The best way to avoid such blackouts , Langer says , is to develop the habit of always noticing new things in whatever situation you 're in .
That process creates engagement with the present moment and releases a cascade of other benefits .
Noticing new things puts you emphatically in the here and now .
We become mindless , Langer explains , because once we think we know something , we stop paying attention to it .
We go about our morning commute in a haze because we 've trod the same route a hundred times before .
But if we see the world with fresh eyes , we realize almost everything is different each time — the pattern of light on the buildings , the faces of the people , even the sensations and feelings we experience along the way .
Noticing imbues each moment with a new , fresh quality .
Some people have termed this " beginner 's mind . "
By acquiring the habit of noticing new things , says Langer , we recognize that the world is actually changing constantly .
We really do n't know how the espresso is going to taste or how the commute will be — or at least , we 're not sure .
Orchestra musicians who are instructed to make their performance new in subtle ways not only enjoy themselves more but audiences actually prefer those performances .
" When we 're there at the moment , making it new , it leaves an imprint in the music we play , the things we write , the art we create , in everything we do , " says Langer .
" Once you recognize that you do n't know the things you 've always taken for granted , you set out of the house quite differently .
It becomes an adventure in noticing — and the more you notice , the more you see . "
And the more excitement you feel .
Do n't Just Do Something , Sit There
Living a consistently mindful life takes effort .
But mindfulness itself is easy .
" People set the goal of being mindful for the next 20 minutes or the next two weeks , then they think mindfulness is difficult because they have the wrong yardstick , " says Jay Winner , a California - based family physician and author of Take the Stress out of Your Life .
" The correct yardstick is just for this moment . "
Mindfulness is the only intentional , systematic activity that is not about trying to improve yourself or get anywhere else , explains Kabat - Zinn .
It is simply a matter of realizing where you already are .
A cartoon from The New Yorker sums it up :
Two monks are sitting side by side , meditating .
The younger one is giving the older one a quizzical look , to which the older one responds , " Nothing happens next .
This is it . "
You can become mindful at any moment just by paying attention to your immediate experience .
You can do it right now .
What 's happening this instant ?
Think of yourself as an eternal witness , and just observe the moment .
What do you see , hear , smell ?
It does n't matter how it feels — pleasant or unpleasant , good or bad — you roll with it because it's what 's present ; you 're not judging it .
And if you notice your , bring yourself back .
Just say to yourself , " Now . Now . Now . "
Here 's the most fundamental paradox of all : Mindfulness is n't a goal , because goals are about the future , but you do have to set the intention of paying attention to what 's happening at the present moment .
As you read the words printed on this page , as your eyes distinguish the black squiggles on white paper , as you feel gravity anchoring you to the planet , wake up .
Become aware of being alive .
And breathe .
As you draw your next breath , focus on the rise of your abdomen on the in - breath , the stream of heat through your nostrils on the out - breath .
If you 're aware of that feeling right now , as you 're reading this , you 're living in the moment .
Nothing happens next .
It 's not a destination .
This is it .
You 're already there .

In a surprising endorsement for 3D display technology , Sony Corp. of America , Discovery Communications and IMAX Corp. have announced plans to form a U.S. television network entirely devoted to 3D programming .
In a surprising endorsement for 3D display technology , Sony Corp. of America , Discovery Communications and IMAX Corp. have announced plans to form a U.S. television network entirely devoted to 3D programming .
The three parties have signed a letter of intent to form the unnamed venture , which is scheduled to launch in 2012 .
USA Today also reported Monday that ESPN plans its own 3D network , potentially testing the waters for an ABC / Disney 3D network of its own down the line .
ESPN 3D will show 80 or so events in 2010 , including the World Cup and some NBA and college basketball and football , the paper reported .
The new network is designed as a sort of carrot to lure buyers to purchase 3D - enabled TVs , suddenly a hot topic in the entertainment world .
Within the movie theater , 3D technology has offered up a fresh way for directors and cinemas to improve the movie experience ; now home electronics manufacturers want a piece of the action , too .
Sony said that it will license television rights to current and future 3D films , plus music - and game - related 3D content .
Discovery , meanwhile , will provide 3D rights to its television content while promoting the new channel across its 13 properties .
IMAX appears to be supplying image - enhancement and 3D technologies , while doing some cross-promotion across its own theater network .
" Sony is the only company with expertise in every part of the 3D value chain , " said Howard Stringer , chairman , chief executive and president of Sony , in a statement .
" We are delighted to be partnering with Discovery and IMAX , two premier companies also dedicated to leadership in 3D , in this groundbreaking new venture .
It is clear to us that consumers will always migrate to a better and richer entertainment experience , and together we are determined to be the leader in providing that around the world . "
In recent weeks , a number of 3D initiatives have taken root ; just Monday , for home 3D TVs .
That followed an announcement by the HDMI licensing organization to implement a 3D spec across the HDMI connector , and a .
Sony has , joining , among others .
The new venture will be run by a separate management team that will work independently from the three companies , yet report to a board of directors staffed from representatives from Sony , IMAX , and Discovery .
Editor 's Note :

As health care reform nears the finish line , there is much wailing and rending of garments among conservatives .
And I ’m not just talking about the tea partiers .
Even calmer conservatives have been issuing dire warnings that Obamacare will turn America into a European - style social democracy .
And everyone knows that Europe has lost all its economic dynamism .
Strange to say , however , what everyone knows is n’t true .
Europe has its economic troubles ; who does n’t ?
But the story you hear all the time  of a stagnant economy in which high taxes and generous social benefits have undermined incentives , stalling growth and innovation  bears little resemblance to the surprisingly positive facts .
The real lesson from Europe is actually the opposite of what conservatives claim : Europe is an economic success , and that success shows that social democracy works .
Actually , Europe ’s economic success should be obvious even without statistics .
For those Americans who have visited Paris : did it look poor and backward ?
What about Frankfurt or London ?
You should always bear in mind that when the question is which to believe  official economic statistics or your own lying eyes  the eyes have it .
In any case , the statistics confirm what the eyes see .
It ’s true that the U.S. economy has grown faster than that of Europe for the past generation .
Since 1980  when our politics took a sharp turn to the right , while Europe ’s did n’t  America ’s real G.D.P. has grown , on average , 3 percent per year .
Meanwhile , the E.U. 15  the bloc of 15 countries that were members of the European Union before it was enlarged to include a number of former Communist nations  has grown only 2.2 percent a year .
America rules !

Advertisement Police believe two men killed when a quad bike was hit by a train may have been fleeing the scene of a shop burglary .
Two hundred men's specialist outdoor jackets worth £ 40,000 were stolen from Go Outdoors in Newport Road , Cardiff .
Officers were called to the store just after 0400 GMT - around the time the men , both in their 20s , were hit on tracks in Rumney nearby .
Police are studying CCTV footage and are appealing for witnesses .
In a statement , South Wales Police said : " Police believe that the men who made off from the Go Outdoors store after committing the burglary may be the same men involved in the fatal incident at a nearby railway line .
" Although it is too early to be certain at this stage . "
Trevor Davies , 20 , was one of the two men who died British Transport Police said the dead men had been identified as Trevor Davies , 20 , and David Cooper , 24 , both from the Rumney area of Cardiff .
Detectives are searching for two other people who are thought to have fled the scene after the two quad bikers were killed .
It is believed the train that hit them was travelling at around 70 mph .
Two quad bikes were found but it is unclear if the victims were travelling on one or both vehicles .
British Transport Police said the quad bikes had been travelling east towards Newport when they were struck from behind .
The passenger train involved was not carrying members of the public at the time , and had been making its way from the Canton depot in Cardiff to Cheltenham for servicing .
Chief Inspector Sandra England said the two victims were pronounced dead at the scene , close to New Road in Rumney .
She confirmed that officers are also trying to trace two other individuals .
The incident happened on the line near the river bridge and New Road , Rumney " We now believe two other persons have made off from the accident and we would urge anyone with any information on that to please come forwards so we can trace these people and speak to them , " she said .
Ms England said the train driver was " pretty shaken up " .
" The investigation is in the early stages at the moment , " she added .
" It was dark , in the early hours , when the incident happened and my main plea is that if anybody did see what happened they should call us on 0800 40 50 40 .
Rail workers at the trackside following the fatalities " We will be following up all lines of inquiry to find out what the men were doing there at that time of night . "
The crash led to four rail lines being closed for some hours , disrupting morning commuters .
Three have since been reopened but continuing delays are likely .
A spokesperson for Network Rail said : " There was some damage to the track in the area of the collision .
" At the moment we are not able to give an accurate update on what repairs are needed or when they will be completed .
" Obviously at the moment , the clear - up operation is very much still under way there . "

Washington , DC –-( AmmoLand.com ) - Data released by the FBI ’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) for the year reported 14,033,824 NICS Checks for the year of 2009 , a 10 percent increase in gun purchases from the 12,709,023 reported in 2008 .
So far that is roughly 14,000,000 + guns bought last year !
The total is probably more as many NICS background checks cover the purchase of more than one gun at a time by individuals .
To put it in perspective that is more guns than the combined active armies of the top 21 countries in the world .
countries by number of troops
Of the NICS background checks preformed less than and average .005 % were denied , showing , overwhelmingly , that law abiding American citizens are the ones buying guns and that criminals are getting their guns elsewhere .
14,033,824,000 billions rounds of Ammo
Assuming each gun buyer bought 1000 rounds of ammo for each purchase , and you and I know that it is way , way more than that , that would be easily 14,033,824,000 + billions rounds of ammo fired by USA gun owners .
What percent of people were killed or injured by this ammo…it is just to infinitesimally small for me to calculate ?
Crime At Record Lows
This record year in firearms background checks show that Americans are solidly in - favor of exercising their civil right to Keep and Bear Arms .
In a year were crime has reached an all time record low what is plainly clear is that more guns equal LESS CRIME !

One of the most important steps you can take to prevent heart disease , cancer , Alzheimer 's , and Parkinson 's disease is to eat plenty of antioxidant - rich foods .
As discussed in a previous article on free radicals , antioxidants protect your health by preventing and repairing damage caused to your cells by excessive free radicals .
Antioxidants are plentiful in plant foods , particularly those that have bright colours .
As of May , 2005 , the most comprehensive study of the antioxidant content of common foods that I know of was published in the June 2004 edition of the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
According to this study , the 20 most antioxidant - rich foods are as follows :
Rank Food Serving Size Antioxidant Capacity per Serving 1
Small red beans , dried 1/2 cup 13727 2
Wild blueberries 1 cup 13427 3
Red kidney beans , dried 1/2 cup 13259 4 Pinto beans 1/2 cup 11864 5 Blueberries , cultivated 1 cup 9019 6 Cranberries 1 cup 8983 7 Artichoke hearts , cooked 1 cup 7904 8 Blackberries 1 cup 7701 9 Dried prunes 1/2 cup 7291 10 Raspberries 1 cup 6058 11 Strawberries 1 cup 5938 12 Red delicious apple One 5900 13 Granny Smith apple One 5381 14 Pecans 1 ounce 5095 15 Sweet cherries 1 cup 4873 16 Black plum One 4844 17 Russet potato , cooked One 4649 18 Black beans 1/2 cup 4181 19 Plum One 4118 20 Gala apple One 3903
The highest ranked foods in four major categories are as follows :
Fruits : blueberries , cranberries , and blackberries .
Vegetables : beans , artichoke hearts , and surprisingly , russet potatoes .
Nuts : pecans , walnuts , and hazelnuts .
Spices : cinnamon , oregano , and ground cloves .
Here are a few points to keep in mind when choosing antioxidant - rich foods :

Romulus , Michigan ( CNN ) --
Part of an explosive device that failed to take down a plane last week was sewn into the underwear of the Nigerian man accused of igniting it , a law enforcement official told CNN Monday .
Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab is being held for allegedly trying to blow up a flight carrying 300 passengers on Christmas Day .
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility Monday for the attack , saying it was in retaliation for alleged U.S. strikes on Yemeni soil .
In a message written in Arabic , dated Saturday and published Monday on radical Islamist Web sites , the group hailed the " brother " who carried out the " heroic attack . "
The group said it tested " new kind of explosives " in the attack and hailed the fact that the explosives " passed through security . "
" There was a technical problem that resulted in a non-complete explosion , " the message said .
A preliminary FBI analysis found that the device AbdulMutallab is said to have carried aboard the flight from Amsterdam , Netherlands , to Detroit , Michigan , contained pentaerythritol tetranitrate , an explosive also known as PETN .
The amount of explosive was sufficient to blow a hole in the aircraft , a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN Sunday .
In his first public comment since the Christmas Day incident , President Obama said he directed his national security team to " keep up the pressure on those who would attack our country . "
" We do not yet have all the answers about this latest attempt , but those who would slaughter innocent men , women and children must know that the United States will do more than simply strengthen our defenses , " Obama told reporters in a break from his Christmas holiday in Hawaii .
U.S. investigators have not determined whether the al Qaeda claim of responsibility was true , but one U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN on Monday that the group might have some involvement .
CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said that if al Qaeda operatives in Yemen were behind the Christmas plot , that would represent a significant advance for the group .
" Most of the attacks we have seen in the past have been in Yemen or Saudi Arabia , and the [ al Qaeda ] affiliate there has not been able to do out - of - the - area operation , " Bergen said .
A federal security bulletin obtained by CNN said AbdulMutallab claimed the explosive device used Friday " was acquired in Yemen along with instructions as to when it should be used . "
Yemen 's government launched airstrikes and other raids against al Qaeda operatives on its territory over the past two weeks , and Monday 's statement by al Qaeda accused the United States of assisting with cruise missile attacks launched from offshore .
U.S. officials privately acknowledge they have provided secret intelligence on several al Qaeda targets to Yemen 's government but wo n't say whether U.S. aircraft or drones took part in the strikes .
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula threatened further attacks in its statement , saying , " We have prepared men who love to die . "
" By God 's permission , we will come to you with more things that you have never seen before , " it said .
Yemen 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned Friday 's attempted attack in a statement released Monday .
" Yemen has long suffered from terrorism and condemns such criminal acts that kill innocent civilians .
Yemen is and remains an active partner of the international community in the war against terrorism .
Efforts of Yemeni security agencies to continue ongoing operations and prosecutions against terrorist operatives from al Qaeda will not falter , " it said .
Mohammed Albasha , spokesman for the Yemen Embassy in Washington , confirmed to CNN Monday that AbdulMutallab was in Yemen between August and December .
According to the ministry 's statement , AbdulMutallab had obtained a visa to study Arabic at a language institute in Yemen where he had previously studied .
Relatives of the suspect said Monday that they told authorities weeks ago about AbdulMutallab's " out of character " behavior and hoped authorities would intervene .
AbdulMutallab , 23 , was studying abroad when he " disappeared " and stopped communicating with his relatives , they said in a statement .
His father , Umaru AbdulMutallab , contacted Nigerian security agencies two months ago and foreign security agencies six weeks ago , the statement said .
A senior U.S. administration official said one of those agencies contacted was the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria .
The embassy , which has law enforcement , security and intelligence representatives on staff , reported the father 's concern to other agencies , the official said .
" We were hopeful that they would find and return him home , " the family said .
" It was while we were waiting for the outcome of their investigation that we arose to the shocking news of that day . "
AbdulMutallab , a Nigerian who had a multiple - entry visa to the United States , had been added to a watch list of 550,000 potential terrorist threats after the information provided by his father was forwarded to the National Counter - Terrorism Center , a senior administration official said .
But " the info on him was not deemed specific enough to pull his visa or put him on a no - fly list , " the official said .
Obama said Monday he has " ordered a thorough review , not only of how information related to the subject was handled , but of the overall watch - list system and how it can be strengthened . "
Do you feel safe in the skies ?
The father of the suspect contacted the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria with concerns his son had " become radicalized " and was planning something , a senior U.S. administration official said .
" After his father contacted the embassy recently , we coded his visa file so that , had he attempted to renew his visa months from now , it would have triggered an in - depth review of his application , " a U.S. official said .
Passengers on the Christmas Day flight described a chaotic scene that began with a popping sound as the plane was making its final approach , followed by flames erupting at AbdulMutallab 's seat .
The suspect was moved Sunday from a hospital , where he was treated for his burns , to an undisclosed location in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service .
He is charged with attempting to destroy the plane and placing a destructive device on the aircraft .
Authorities have focused their investigation on how AbdulMutallab , 23 , allegedly smuggled the explosives aboard the flight and who might have helped him .
" We 're ascertaining why it was that he was not flagged in a more specific way when he purchased his ticket , given the information that we think was available , allegedly was available , " Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told CNN's " American Morning " Monday .
Meanwhile , tighter security measures in the wake of the incident triggered long lines at security checkpoints at airports in the United States and abroad .
Airlines and their crews have been given discretion over implementation of a " one - hour rule , " which prohibits passengers from leaving their seats during the last hour of flight , sources said .
The Transportation Security Administration invoked the rule for international U.S. - bound flights after the botched attack .
Airline security will be the focus of hearings by the Senate committees on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Commerce , Science and Transportation ; the House Committee on Homeland Security is also slated to hold a hearing on the incident .
AbdulMutallab's trip originated in Lagos , Nigeria .
There , he did not check in a bag as he flew on a KLM flight to Amsterdam , said Harold Demuren , director - general of Nigeria 's Civil Aviation Authority .
Demuren said the suspect underwent regular screening -- walking through a metal detector and having his shoulder bag scanned through an X - ray machine .
He then underwent secondary screening at the boarding gate for the KLM flight , according to officials of the Dutch airline .
After arriving in Amsterdam , AbdulMutallab boarded the Northwest Airlines flight to the United States .
The Netherlands ' national coordinator for counterterrorism told CNN that AbdulMutallab had gone through " normal security procedures " in Amsterdam before boarding the flight to Detroit .
CNN 's Elise Labott , Jeanne Meserve , Carol Cratty , Richard Quest , Nic Robertson , Christian Purefoy , Tom Cohen , Mike Ahlers , Alona Rivord , Mohammed Jamjoom , Miguel Susana and Barbara Starr contributed to this report .

The lone Republican who voted for the Democrats ’ health care reform bill in November wo n’t support the final bill if it does n’t have the same abortion restrictions that passed in the House .
A spokeswoman for Rep. Anh “ Joseph ” Cao , Louisiana Republican , said Tuesday that the lawmaker is concerned the language in the final bill is going to be closer to what passed the Senate , which he does n’t support .
“ He would rather see some form of health reform done than not done , ” said spokeswoman Princella Smith .
“ But he ’s just not budging on the life issue . ”
Mr. Cao , who represents a New Orleans - area district with a 21 percent uninsured population , said in November that he broke ranks with Republicans to support the House bill because of the last - minute abortion restrictions , which had the backing of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops .
If those change , he ’s going to have a “ very hard time ” supporting the bill again , his spokeswoman said .
“ Congressman Cao has always been an ardent defender of life , ” Ms. Smith said .
“ He would not have voted for the [ House ] bill if it did n’t have sufficient language to protect the lives of the unborn . ”
Mr. Cao at one time studied to be a Catholic priest , is a member of the National Advisory Council of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and has voted with National Right to Life 100 percent of the time since he won his seat in 2008 .
A “ no ” vote from Mr. Cao would eliminate any appearance of bipartisanship in the health legislation , an issue that has already proven to be controversial with voters .
It became the defining issue in today ’s special election to fill Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ’s long - time seat in Massachusetts .
It would also slice Democrats ’ vote margin even further .
The health bill passed 220 - 215 , just two more than the 218 required for passage .
House and Senate Democrats are still hammering out differences in the two pieces of legislation , a list that includes abortion as well as taxes and whether to establish state or national exchanges .
The House ’s legislation would ban anyone who receives federal tax subsidies from buying an insurance plan that includes abortion coverage — if women want it , they would have to buy an additional side plan that includes it .
A group of House Democrats who oppose abortion , headed by Michigan Rep. Bart Stupak , said it was the only way to ensure their tax dollars do n’t cover the controversial procedure and the only way they ’d support the bill .
The Senate ’s plan would require women with insurance plans that cover abortion to pay entirely for their own abortion coverage , keeping any federal tax subsidies separate .
The insurance exchanges would have to have at least one plan that does n’t cover the procedure .
And states would be allowed to pass a law prohibiting any plan in the exchange from providing abortion coverage .

The mathematician who deciphered the final , encrypted page of a letter sent to President Thomas Jefferson in 1801 will visit the University of Oregon to tell how he did it .
The encrypted page -- a mystery to Jefferson and everyone else -- was solved in 2007 by Smithline , then 36 , an expert in code - breaking .
He detailed his solution in the American Scientist .
The letter was written by Jefferson 's colleague in the American Philosophical Society , Robert Patterson , a math professor at the University of Pennsylvania .
The ciphered page was devoid of capital letters or spaces and scrambled in a way that left no readable segments .
Preceding pages had described the nature of the code but not the specific key required to unlock this message .
The code was unlike any normally used at the time .
Patterson predicted it would never be broken .
" This is a fascinating topic for historians as well as puzzle enthusiasts , " says UO computer scientist Eugene Luks , who met Smithline in California , where Smithline described his solution to a group of cryptanalysts .
" Jefferson , an expert cryptographer himself , was enthusiastic about the code .
He recommended that it be used in diplomatic correspondence , but others did not appreciate his warnings about the weakness of the codes they were already using . "
The solution involved both linguistic intuition and a computer algorithm to find the digital key .
While the required 100,000 calculations would be easy on today 's computers , Smithline 's method could have been done over time in Patterson 's day .
In his talk , Smithline will tell how he was pulled into the mystery , how he broke the code and what was written on the page .
Lawren Smithline of the Center for Communications Research in Princeton , N.J. , will speak at 4 p.m. , Tuesday , Jan. 26 , in Room 100 of Willamette Hall , 1371 E. 13th Ave. Admission is free .
The talk is part of the Distinguished Lecture Series of the UO 's department of computer and information science and co-sponsored by the math department .

“ Still , to do what they ’re doing , you ’re more or less selling out , ” said Frank Sage , a Navajo and one of about 400 American Indian students at the university and one who says he finds the Fighting Sioux imagery hurtful and harmful .
“ They ’re just being used . ”
The lawsuit , filed last month by eight members of the Spirit Lake Tribe , is tangled , and grows out of a similarly tangled series of events that began in 2005 , when the N.C.A.A. warned the University of North Dakota and 17 other colleges to change their nicknames and mascots if they wished to show the images at N.C.A.A. - controlled championships or to host such events .
( Two other institutions were later added , according to the N.C.A.A. )
Since then , some colleges changed their logos , others sought and received permission from local tribes to keep them , and a few resolved the matter in other ways .
But the University of North Dakota is still at it .
The state ’s Board of Higher Education and the university sued the N.C.A.A. to preserve the nickname and logo , and in 2007 reached a settlement that let it keep them if the Sioux tribal councils in the state  at Spirit Lake and Standing Rock  agreed to the idea by the end of November 2010 .
Image Eunice Davidson , 57 , a full - blooded Sioux , is among those suing to preserve the nickname .

But some university officials said they began worrying that the debate was leading other institutions to avoid competing against them in sports .
Robert Kelley , the university ’s president , has taken no position on the nickname but said he found himself being asked about it almost constantly  at the supermarket , in meetings of the state ’s Congressional delegation  and wanted to ensure that the debate did not eclipse the university ’s academic focus .
Politics on the reservations have also turned tense .
In September , the tribal council in Spirit Lake , 100 miles west of Grand Forks , voted to allow the name .
But at Standing Rock , more than 300 miles southwest of here , a past tribal chairman was deeply opposed , and a new chairman brought no clear answer , noting in a letter to state officials this fall that he would prefer an “ open dialogue as opposed to a stipulated arrangement under deadline . ”
Life is complicated — especially when it comes to our health .
Once we reach a certain age , we start to realize that health is a variable , not a constant .
Our knees ache , our pace slows , and we ’re diagnosed with diabetes or even cancer .
And because the stakes are so high and the options so dizzying , we may stop engaging with our health altogether .
We let doctors and insurance companies decide on our care , and we focus our energies on what we can control — our bank accounts , our relationships , but not , alas , our health .
The Decision Tree tool is brought to you by www.TheDecisionTree.com.
Wired.com is not responsible for the content or actions of third party Web sites .
That ’s too bad , because health is really just a system of inputs and outputs .
The inputs include the choices we make : what we eat , whether we exercise , how much we sleep , whether we heed our doctors ’ orders .
These decisions combine with other inputs , things that we may not even consider information and that we probably know much more about than our doctors , like our family history , where we live , our jobs , our stress levels , and so on .
All of these inputs create one primary output unique to us alone : our health , for good or ill .
This means we have more control over our health than we might have thought .
By monitoring and tweaking our inputs , we can influence and even determine our well - being .
Taken all at once , our health may seem inscrutable ; laid out in a sequence , it becomes a series of decisions , each with risks , benefits , and trade - offs .
In other words , we can organize our health options into a decision tree , a method for factoring in our inputs , mapping out our options , and guiding us along the best possible path .
A decision tree is a simple idea — many of us learned to draw them ( in the form of flowcharts ) in elementary school .
And decision trees are already all around us .
They ’re common in engineering and industry , where they ’re known as algorithms .
The pharmaceutical industry uses them to plan safe clinical trials .
Financial - service quants use them to root out credit card fraud .
They ’re even used by city planners to design street patterns and map bus routes .
In these cases , decision trees can be complicated tools , laden with mathematics and computer science .
The Four Components of a Decision Tree Illustration : Borja Bonaque
But they need n’t be only for the experts .
In an age of too much information and too little illumination , a decision tree can be a tool that nudges any of us to think through our options and to act consciously and with consideration .
A decision tree can be as straightforward as a list of the pros and cons of a particular option that we complete before we act .
It can be a simple and useful way to turn the health data we already have into a system for better choices and better outcomes .
And auspiciously , we ’re at a moment when more data than ever lies within ready reach .
Whether it ’s personal genomics services like 23andMe or screening tests or self - tracking iPhone apps , each of us can draw on a wealth of personalized data sources that turn generic medical advice into customized health equations .
And this is always - on data : Instead of checking in on our health episodically — when we visit the doctor or get lab test results — we can now tap into a constant stream of information and opportunity .
We can minimize our uncertainty and maximize our control .
We can build ever more sophisticated , and useful , decision trees .
In the following pages , you ’ll meet three individuals , each facing a different medical quandary .
As their experiences show , the right decision tree can bear the fruit of a better life .
Should Teri Smieja have preemptive surgery to protect against breast and ovarian cancers ?
Teri Smieja had a choice to make .
A mother of two living in the small town of Ridgecrest , California , she learned in February 2009 that she has a much higher risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers than the typical American woman .
And she needed to figure out what to do about it .
It had happened very fast .
In late 2008 , her aunt went on a trip to Israel .
When she came back to the States , she explained to Smieja that Ashkenazi Jews like themselves were more likely to have mutations in two genes known as BRCA1 and BRCA2 .
Those mutations put women at a much higher risk for breast and ovarian cancers .
Sixty percent of women who have mutations in one or both of the genes will develop breast cancer , and up to 40 percent will develop ovarian cancer .
( The average American female has about a 12 percent risk of breast cancer , and a 1.4 percent chance of ovarian cancer . )
For Smieja , who did n’t really identify as Jewish , this was all new .
“ I had never heard of Ashkenazi anything before , ” she says , let alone BRCA genes .
But she did know that ovarian cancer ran in her family — her grandmother had it , her aunt had it , her mother has it .
“ I always figured I had a higher chance of getting cancer , ” she says , but she had n’t known there was a way to measure that risk .
So Smieja took a genetic test and learned that she was positive for the BRCA1 mutation .
That finding , combined with her family history , made it more than a possibility that she would develop breast or ovarian cancer — it became a likelihood .
In a term that reflects the age we live in , women like Smieja are known as previvors — they do n’t have a cancer yet , but they surely have something .
The question now was what to do next .
“ I had this paper in my hand that said I have up to an 87 percent risk of getting cancer by age 70 .
And , of course , I started crying ; I was really upset .
But then it hit me :
It did n’t say I had cancer ; it said I could get cancer .
So I said , ‘ Stop feeling sorry for yourself .
This is good news .
I can do something about this . ' ”
Teri ’s Decision Tree Teri Smieja had to determine whether the trauma of invasive surgery was outweighed by the reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancers .
Graph : Borja Bonaque
Slowly , her decision tree began to emerge .
Estrogen promotes cell division in women and therefore spurs the proliferation of cancer cells .
Since the ovaries produce most of the estrogen in the female body , it ’s often recommended that women with an increased risk have their ovaries and uteruses removed .
An oophorectomy and hysterectomy , then , not only brings the risk of ovarian cancer close to zero but also reduces the breast - cancer risk by about 50 percent .
After spending a lot of time on the Internet and visiting a genetic counselor ( “ They said I did it wrong .
I was supposed to go to the counselor first , ” she recalls ) , Smieja decided to have the oophorectomy and hysterectomy .
As far as surgeries go , oophorectomy with hysterectomy is relatively straightforward and can be performed laparoscopically in just a few hours .
One downside was that she would n’t be able to have any more children , but Smieja was n’t planning to anyway .
The next choice facing her was whether to have a preemptive double mastectomy ( also known as a bilateral prophylactic mastectomy ) .
This one was more difficult .
Some women with high risk opt for this procedure because estrogen receptors in the breasts make them susceptible to cancer .
But it is a more traumatic procedure , both in terms of recovering from the wounds and for social and psychological reasons .
( For Smieja , it meant she could no longer breast - feed her second child . )
And while it would further reduce the risk of breast cancer — by about 90 percent — the benefits were not as pronounced as with the oophorectomy .
For Smieja , the decision was traumatic to navigate .
But ultimately it came down to her desire to reduce her risk through all available means .
That meant waiting a few months to wean her baby , then having the procedures .
“ I ’m done with that decision , ” she says .
“ This is what I need to do .
I need to be around for my kids .
I am not my ovaries .
I am not my breasts . ”
Should Frank Kozik give up smoking , or does the pleasure of lighting up outweigh the consequences ?
Frank Kozik knows how hard it is to quit smoking .
He smoked for 39 years , off and on — and he ’s just 48 years old .
You read that right : Kozik , a renowned poster designer since the heyday of alternative rock , has been smoking since he was 8 years old .
Like so many smokers , Kozik has quit several times .
When he began bicycling in the 1980s , he kicked the habit for five years — until he started seeing a woman who smoked .
A few years later , when he started dating a more health - conscious woman , he quit again — only to resume after they broke up about a year later .
Kozik has always been well aware of the risks — but he also knows the benefits .
“ Smoking is a really pleasurable thing , ” he says .
“ It ’s like a little high every time you light up .
Of course , with every cigarette I also thought , ‘ Is this the one that ’s going to give me cancer ? ’
But that was an abstract thought , and that little high was so much more real . ”
Kozik ’s description is spot-on .
Of all our bad health habits , smoking is one of the worst of all possible worlds :
It ’s among the least healthy and the hardest to stop .
Half of all lifelong smokers will die of a smoking - related illness ; nearly a third of all cancer deaths are caused by smoking .
Very few health behaviors are so strongly associated with such lethal results .
So what keeps smokers puffing away ?
Neurologically , smoking activates the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system in the brain , which drives the reward circuit , the motivational circuit , and the learning / memory circuit .
( This means that smoking is a learned behavior , self - rewarding , and motivational all at the same time ! )
Each individual node in the smoker ’s decision tree pits an immediate tangible benefit against a longer - term abstract one .
This tension exemplifies the paradox of behavior change :
We know what we are supposed to do , but we find all sorts of reasons not to do it .
As a result , more than 85 percent of Americans do n’t eat enough fruits and vegetables , two - thirds are overweight — and 20 percent continue to smoke cigarettes .
We do n’t lack for information .
We lack for incentives .
For Kozik , those incentives finally started to register when he hit his mid-forties and he began to feel the effects of so many years of smoking .
“ All these health issues began to pop up , ” he says , and in early 2008 , when he found it “ harder to carry stuff up the stairs , ” he started to cut back from his two - pack - a - day habit to about 15 cigarettes a day .
But last year , Kozik faced a starker trade - off than a little shortness of breath .
His dentist told him that smoking had severely aggravated his gums .
If he did n’t quit smoking , he was likely to start losing his teeth .
“ Right there , it became something real , ” Kozik says .
“ What do I value more : my teeth or smoking cigarettes ?
I mean , cancer was always this vague thing ; you ca n’t see your lungs .
But you can see your teeth .
It was a pretty clear decision . ”
Kozik quit cold turkey last October and is resolved to never light up again .
“ My entire life has been motivated by the possibility of what comes next , ” Kozik explains .
“ I ’m a selfish person — we all are — and every decision I make comes down to which choice will benefit me more .
But most of these choices are totally abstract , toward some idealized goal .
Every once in a while , though , you ’ll hit a choice that ’s real .
Having your teeth fall out is real .
At that point , the value of a mild narcotic stimulant is zero . ”
Frank ’s Decision Tree Frank Kozik knew smoking could kill him but found the habit too pleasurable to quit for good , even though he had quit temporarily several times .
Then a potentially immediate and drastic consequence caused him to reconsider his choices .

Alexandra Carmichael has chronic pain .
What ’s causing it , and how should she treat it ?
There are roughly 50 million Americans living with chronic pain , and for them , the hardest thing may be identifying the true cause of their problem .
Scans and blood tests often only leave people in the dark and in distress .
Pain sufferers may want to build a decision tree , but discovering what the true inputs are can be a lengthy and frustrating process .
At 20 years old , all Alexandra Carmichael knew was that she was in pain .
Constant , steady pain — burning , stabbing , soreness — in her pelvis and genitals .
For the next 10 years , she bounced among gynecologists who told her not to worry and specialists who could n’t specify anything .
She endured endless tests , including an ultrasound to rule out polycystic ovary syndrome and blood panels to rule out hypothyroidism , adrenal fatigue , and a high testosterone level .
Time after time , the tests revealed nothing abnormal or conclusive .
As a diagnosis eluded her , she got married and had two children .
“ I just wanted some ideas , some clue , some information .
But there was n’t any that I could find , ” she says .
Finally , in 2006 , a new doctor gave her an accurate diagnosis : vulvodynia , a condition characterized by persistent pain in a woman ’s pelvis and genitals .
It can be intermittent or constant , and it makes many aspects of day - to - day life , including sex , seem almost impossible .
Despite the fact that about 16 percent of women will suffer from it during their lives , it is a woefully understudied condition .
“ It was a huge validation that it was not all in my head , that there was actually a name for what I had and that other women had had it , ” Carmichael recalls .
“ It freed me up to focus on how to treat my body rather than try to figure out what I had . ”
But her ordeal was n’t over .
She ’d spend another two years sorting through various treatments , each one a Hobson ’s choice between trying something or trying nothing .
After a battery of other tests — cholesterol , thyroid , blood panels — she discovered that her estrogen levels were low .
Eventually , she and her doctor came up with the right level of hormone replacement therapy to allow her to live “ 95 percent pain free . ”
Carmichael ’s experience led her to cofound CureTogether , an online health community where people can share their experience with more than 400 conditions and compare their symptoms , treatments , and results .
The information is robust enough that the site has actually advanced research into vulvodynia and several other conditions .
“ It took me 10 years to find out what I had , and it took two years to find the right treatment , ” she says .
“ That simply would n’t be the case anymore .
It would not take anywhere near that long for somebody who finds CureTogether .
Now there are other women like me , sharing ideas and data .
It shortens the decision tree considerably . ”
Alexandra ’s Decision Tree Alexandra Carmichael spent a decade looking for a diagnosis .
It took her another two years to determine the best treatment options .

From the Guardian :
Belgian prosecutors highlighted the massive losses faced by EU governments from VAT fraud today after they charged three Britons and a Dutchman with money - laundering following an investigation into a multimillion - pound scam involving carbon emissions permits .
The three Britons , who were arrested last month in Belgium , were accused of failing to pay VAT worth € 3 m ( £ 2.7 m ) on a series of carbon credit transactions .
European authorities believe the EU has lost at least € 5bn to carbon - trading VAT fraud in the last 18 months .
Europol , the EU ’s law - ­enforcement operation , fears the fraud will be used in other areas , especially gas and electricity trading markets , after criminals found VAT fraud was one of the most lucrative financial frauds .
“ Last month , the European police agency Europol reported that the European Union ’s Emissions Trading Scheme ( EU ETS ) had fallen victim to fraudulent trading activities over the past 18 months , worth € 5 billion for several national tax revenues .
It estimates that in some countries , up to 90 % of the whole market volume was caused by fraudulent activities . ”
Four charged with carbon trading fraud in Belgium

Former Swans frontman Michael Gira took to the band 's MySpace page on Saturday to announce that the pioneering New York postpunk band will reunite for a new album and " tour (s ) " .
Thanks to Shane Lange for the tip .
The band , which Gira started in the early 80s , began as a particularly dark and noisy product of New York 's clattering downtown art - punk scene .
Their early records had tremendous , widespread influence across the underground rock spectrum , making an impact on indie , goth , industrial , and metal .
Later on , the band 's sound became subtler , taking on ideas from pop and modern classical .
Swans broke up in 1997 , and Gira went on to lead the more pastoral and folk - influenced ( though still absolutely intense ) Angels of Light .
According to Gira 's MySpace announcement the new Swans lineup includes two original members , Gira and guitarist Norman Westberg , as well as guitarist Christoph Hahn and drummer Phil Puleo from later incarnations of the band .
Flux Information Sciences ' Chris Pravdica and Shearwater / Angels of Light member Thor Harris also join the new Swans .
Gira also promises " many special guests " .
Via his own Young God Records , Gira plans to release a limited edition CD / DVD package called I Am Not Insane , proceeds from which will " raise money for the swans recordings / offset the huge costs involved " .
The package will include two live shows on the DVD and a CD of rough versions of songs that may make the Swans reunion album .
Gira is only making 1000 copies of I Am Not Insane , and he 's handmaking all of them himself .
Gira posted one of those songs , a homemade acoustic demo of a track called " Jim " , to the band 's MySpace page .
If you 've been keeping up with the Angels of Light , it wo n't surprise you that Gira 's elemental baritone is still in fine form .
Gira also points out that the Angels of Light are now on hiatus so that he can concentrate on this Swans thing .

One of the main reasons Sony ditched the " George Foreman " build of the PS3 and went with the new " Slim " was to cut back on manufacturing costs .
Try and get back into the black .
But they 're not quite there .
Advertisement
According to a report on iSuppli - who have been doing this kind of thing for a while now - the total cost of manufacturing a PS3 Slim as of December 2009 is $ 336.27 .
And they sell for $ 299 .
Meaning
Sony are still slugged with a $ 37 loss for every console sold .
Sounds bad - and when you multiply that $ 37 by millions , it certainly seems that way - but it's a damn sight less money than they were losing this time last year .

With the cost of materials continually on the decline , provided Sony can stick at a $ 299 price point for a while to come , you 'd expect the PS3 to start generating a profit sometime next year .

No need to buy a Christmas tree this year , just get yourself a Tesla coil and you ’re all set for an electrifying experience .
Tesla-coil - enthusiast Peter Terren , from TeslaDownUnder.com , has posted some breathtaking photos of his 2009 Christmas tree , built using , you guessed it , a Tesla coil .
This is Peter ’s second Tesla Christmas tree .
The one he built in 2007 has been featured on the Discovery Channel and in the Metro newspaper , but he says his newest version is even more impressive .
I have to say I ’m not very familiar with Tesla coils myself , so I did n’t get all the details Peter Terren posted on his site , but I know beauty when I see it .

Of the remaining 198 inmates of the US military prison in Guantanamo Bay , nearly half are from Yemen , and it is their presence that most explains why President Barack Obama has found the prison more difficult to close than he envisaged .
Many of those already released , and not just Yemenis , have turned up in Yemen 's al - Qaeda camps , often after going through Prince Mohammed 's rehabilitation courses .
Fahd Saleh Suleiman al Jutayli , who was released from Guantanamo in 2006 , was killed in northern Yemen in a shoot - out with government forces in September : his family were informed by another former Guantanamo inmate , Yusuf Mohammed al - Shehri , who had also returned to Yemen .
Al - Shehri himself was killed by Saudi soldiers in a shoot - out at a checkpoint on the road from Yemen a couple of weeks later .
He and a colleague were dressed as women .
His brother , Said al - Shehri , may be the deputy leader of al - Qaeda in Yemen and it is possible that he was killed in an air raid two weeks ago .
Some customers are unsure who will help answer queries about the phone Google is being inundated with complaints about its Nexus One phone .
The touchscreen smartphone was launched on 5 January and can be bought directly from Google and used on almost any phone network .
But confusion over who should answer customer queries has led many to file complaints on support forums .
Many people are unhappy with Google only responding to questions by e-mail and are calling for it to set up phone - based support .
Phone frustration Americans can buy the Nexus One directly from Google for $ 529 ( £ 331 ) or on a contract with T - Mobile for $ 179 ( £ 112 ) .
In the UK the phone will be available via Vodafone but prices and launch dates have yet to be released .
The support forums that Google has set up for the Nexus One are filling up with complaints from many of the first to buy the phone who need help .
... we 're committed to sorting out the few kinks that do exist
Google spokesman
The top query , with more than 500 responses , is about how much people should pay for the phone and whether existing customers of T - Mobile can get the device at a reduced rate .
Only new customers of T - Mobile will be able to pay $ 179 .
Many are also trying to get more information about the phone they have placed an order for to see how long it will take to reach them .
Almost 500 people have logged problems with the Nexus One 's support for 3G wireless networks .
Others reported bugs when synchronising contacts or getting the handset to work with existing Google accounts .
Many are also complaining about the amount of time that it takes Google to respond to queries .
Google said it would answer problems via e-mail though any response may take a day or two to arrive .
Frustrations were also reported by those that had turned to either T - Mobile or HTC for help and had been bounced back and forth between the handset maker and the mobile operator .
Conflicting information about the phone , particularly if it supports 3G , is being given by Google 's partners .
A common sentiment on the support forum was that for the $ 500 people have paid for the phone they should be able to call a dedicated help line .
" Right now it 's a big mess , " said KseniaCoffman on the forum .
Google has answered a handful of the questions posted on the query but so far the vast majority lack a response from the search firm .
" We 've worked closely with our Nexus One launch partners to make support available through a variety of channels , " said a spokesman for Google .
" This is a new way to purchase and support a mobile phone , and we 're committed to sorting out the few kinks that do exist . "

Laura Dekker began sailing solo when she was 10 years old A Dutch teenager barred from sailing solo around the world because of her age has been found on a Caribbean island after disappearing , police say .
Laura Dekker , 14 , is in police custody on the Dutch Antilles island of St Maarten , three days after relatives in the Netherlands reported her missing .
A Dutch police spokesman said the girl had been found " safe and sound " .
Miss Dekker has been under supervision since a court blocked her bid to be the youngest person to sail the globe solo .
When did she leave the Netherlands ?
Why ?
How did she get to St Maarten ?
Did somebody help her and was she alone ?
Bernhard Jens
police spokesman Police said earlier they did not suspect any crime had been committed .
The court order in the city of Utrecht placed Miss Dekker under state supervision , while living with her father , until the end of her school year in July 2010 .
After she vanished on Friday , her boat was found moored at its berth and she appears to have left her father 's home on her own .
An unconfirmed Dutch newspaper report said she had withdrawn 3,500 euros ( $ 5,000 ) from her bank account .
Questions Utrecht police spokesman Bernhard Jens said the girl had been recognised by a woman living on the island who had been alerted to her disappearance by media coverage .
" We have lots more questions , " he told AFP news agency .
" When did she leave the Netherlands ?
Why ?
How did she get to St Maarten ?
Did somebody help her and was she alone ? "
At the time of the much - publicised court ruling in October , Miss Dekker 's spokeswoman said she was disappointed but that the teenager could still set the record if she were to sail next year .
Miss Dekker is a seasoned sailor who was born on a yacht off the coast of New Zealand during a seven - year world trip .
She had a yacht by the age of six and began sailing solo when she was 10 .
Her father , Dick Dekker , supports her attempt at the record , while her mother has expressed some concerns .
Miss Dekker had planned to spend about two years aboard her 8 m ( 26ft ) boat , Guppy , to break the record set in August by a 17 - year - old UK boy .
Mike Perham tackled 50ft waves , gale force winds and technical problems during the 45,000 - km ( 28,000 - mile ) circumnavigation , which took him nine months .

Racial epithets screamed at opposing players , vicious hits to the head , blatant attempts to injure and coaches threatening officials with violence .
Welcome to minor hockey night in the GTA .
Never - before - published records on critical violations in the Greater Toronto Hockey League reveal troubling undercurrents in youth hockey .
During the league 's 2008 - 09 season , players as young as 13 were assessed a dramatically increasing number of penalties for " discriminatory slurs " from insults about sexual orientation to players calling their opponents offensive racist terms .
League records also reveal startling cases of violence on the ice committed by repeat offenders .
Some teenage players have drawn dozens of major penalties over their minor hockey careers , including repeated offences for spearing , checking to the head , checking from behind , physical abuse of an official and spitting on opponents .
In most cases , they serve short suspensions before returning to the ice .
Experts say anti-social on - ice behaviour in minor hockey is rooted in deeper social problems – from stresses at school or at home to overly aggressive coaches and imitating National Hockey League heroes .
" This is about the way society is going , " says John Gardner , president of the GTHL , the largest and most competitive minor hockey organization in the world , with about 500 teams and 8,000 players .
" We do n't tolerate it in minor hockey .
...
It 's still a damn good game .
The benefits still outweigh the problems . "
Still , those problems are a growing concern among league officials , parents and coaches .
" The level of intensity has turned the arena into an unusual place , " says Pat Flatley , a 14 - year NHL veteran who played in the GTHL in the early ' 70s and now coaches the league 's Toronto Young Nationals minor peewee AAA team .
" There is gossip , innuendo , backstabbing and a place for taunts . "
The Toronto Star examined league data on 6,500 major penalties last season as well as 122 investigations by the GTHL into its most serious incidents , in which officials filed formal reports that led to suspensions .
The investigation found :
There were more than 475 penalties last year for checks to the head in the GTHL – a third more than a year earlier .
Players as young as 11 are suffering concussions serious enough to have lasting health effects and end their hockey careers .
Coaches and players lashing out at officials with verbal and physical abuse , including head - butting and death threats .
A tenfold increase in discriminatory slurs over the past three seasons .
The GTHL's own internal research into on - ice incidents , obtained by the Star , shows many of these problems are getting worse .
Consulting firm Justplay Sport Services Inc. , hired by the league to poll officials after each game between 2005 and 2008 , found the conduct of players , coaches and spectators had " worsened " and officials ' dissatisfaction with the state of the game had increased .
League on - ice officials have assessed about 6,500 major penalties over about 10,000 games during each of the past two seasons .
Some of the most serious penalty categories have risen .
In the 2006 - 07 season there were only nine penalties called all season for discriminatory slurs .
Two years ago there were 47 .
Last year , 96 .
Complaints about racial taunting suddenly took a leap about two years ago , says Scott Oakman , the league 's executive director .
In response , the league issued a directive to officials and clubs to be " on notice " about racial comments .
" Socially , this is unacceptable , " he says .
" With the nature of our demographics , we have an obligation to address it . "
League investigation reports into discriminatory slur incidents read , at times , like racist pamphlets .
In a January game of Midget A 16 - year - olds , a Toronto Avalanche player lined up for a faceoff in the offensive end when the game official heard him call the opposing goaltender a " dumb f--- Jew , " says a league investigation report on the incident .
It was the aggressor 's 14th major penalty between 2005 and 2008 including five for disputing officials ' calls ( one with added verbal abuse of an official ) , checking to the head , checking from behind and two for inciting .
He received a three - game suspension – the league 's standard response to the offence .
In another case , last November , a 14 - year - old AAA member of the Mississauga Reps disparaged an opposing player this way : " Should n't you be out blowing up buildings or something ? "

The verbal aggressor had 15 major penalties since 2003 and was suspended for three games .
Referee Carl Friday , a 27 - year veteran of the GTHL , remembers when he heard a youngster direct the n-word at him in 1997 , and it reverberated like an echo .
Only a week earlier , NHL player Chris Simon of the Washington Capitals had called then - Edmonton Oiler Mike Grier a " nigger " during an emotionally charged exchange on the ice .
( Simon was suspended for three games and later made an abject apology to Grier . )
While public debate over the Simon - Grier incident was still raging in the media , a 16 - year - old hurled the identical epithet at Friday before threatening the black referee 's life .
As with all such cases , the league handed out the standard three - game minimum suspension .
It 's hardly a sufficient deterrent , Friday says .
" I would like to see a five - game suspension , " Friday said .
" With a three - game suspension , it is like , `So I get a weekend off .
Big deal . ' "
The Ontario Hockey League imposes an automatic five - game suspension for racial slurs .
Kevin Weekes says the GTHL should go even further .
An NHL goalie for 11 years , the former Toronto Red Wing in the GTHL says the racial harassment he suffered in tournaments as a black youngster was never appropriately penalized .
He recalls parents of opposing players at one tournament yelling the n-word at him as he stood on the ice .
In some cases , a chorus would grow as young players joined their parents in the chants .
A three - game suspension is no remedy , says Weekes , who now works as a television commentator .
" It should be 10 or 15 ( games ) , " he says .
" We pride ourselves for being a multicultural city but we ... still tolerate this behaviour . "
The GTHL's Oakman says the league does issue longer suspensions in some cases .
But increasing the mandatory minimum beyond three games would be unfair , he says .
" There are degrees of discriminatory language .
When you increase ( the minimum suspension ) , the lowest common denominator moves up . "
The fact that a penalty for discriminatory slurs even exists speaks to an " insidious moral fibre within the social fabric that extends to the sport environment , " says Dr. Bill Montelpare , a sports researcher at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay .
" This behaviour is intolerable in society ; the hockey arena is not exempt . "
Of the GTHL 's approximately 300 officials , fewer than a dozen are visible minorities , say league officials .
Racist language in minor hockey does n't always come from players on the ice .
A non-Italian linesman claimed a parent called him a " f - -- ing wop " and a black referee who disallowed a couple of goals said the parent told him to go back to basketball and football .

At the Macy 's Thanksgiving Day Parade , the actor playing Santa is discovered to be drunk by a whiskered old man .
Doris
Walker , the no nonsense special events director , persuades him to take his place .
He proves to be a sensation and is quickly recruited to be the store Santa at the main store .
While he is successful , Doris learns that he calls himself Kris Kringle and he claims to be the actual Santa Claus .
Despite reassurances by his doctor that he is harmless , Doris still has misgivings , especially when she has cynically trained herself , and especially her daughter , Susan , to reject all notions of belief and fantasy .
And yet , people , especially Susan , begin to notice there is something special about Kris and his determination to advance the true spirit of Christmas among the rampant commercialism around him and succeeding in improbable ways .

To start off the proceedings , Frank Drake , the father of SETI , worried that the switch from analog television and radio signals to digital cable and satellite radio would render Earth invisible to aliens looking for other life .
Right now , the Earth is surrounded by a 50 - light - year thick cloud of radiation , starting with Hitler 's opening address at the 1936 Olympics , and ending with this morning 's broadcast of the Rachael Ray Show .
But as more and more people receive their media beamed down to them from digital satellites , not up to them from analog radio towers , that signal slowly fades away , drastically reducing the chance that aliens might detect our tiny blue rock .
Despite minimal exposure to the regular geometric objects found in developed countries , African tribal people perceive shapes as well as westerners , according to a new study .
The findings , recently published online in Psychological Science , suggested that the brain 's ability to understand shapes develops without the influence of immersion in simple , manufactured objects .
" In terms of perceiving the world … either genetics or the natural world will give you the right type of experiences , " said lead author Irving Biederman , an expert on perception who holds a named chair in neuroscience at the University of Southern California 's College of Letters , Arts and Sciences .
Biederman and his team specifically measured subjects ' sensitivity to " non-accidental " properties of objects , such as whether they have straight or curved edges .
A theory of shape recognition developed by Biederman holds that the brain is more sensitive to non-accidental properties -- which stay the same as an object rotates in space -- than to metric properties , such as degree of curvature , that do appear to vary with orientation .
In one experiment , subjects were asked to identify which of two geometric objects was an exact match to a sample object .
The one that did n't match differed either in a non-accidental or metric property .

The researchers found that Western college students and members of the semi-nomadic Himba tribe of northwestern Namibia , a rural area bordering Angola , both showed greater sensitivity to non-accidental properties .
The findings have an incidental implication : Parents can probably toss the beloved shape sorter on the large heap of educational toys toddlers do not really need .
Shape sorters may have other potential benefits such as fine motor training .
And some children simply enjoy them .
But Biederman questioned the main advertised benefit of the toys .
" Your kids will grow up being able to see shapes just fine without specific training , " he said .
Most members of the Himba have never seen a computer or television , do not use a phone and have only handmade tools , Biederman said .
advertisement
The Himba also lack words for many shapes , including squares , circles and triangles .
Nevertheless , Himba and university student volunteers responded virtually identically to variations in shape in sorting experiments on a laptop computer .
" The bottom line is that the Himba differ not at all from individuals living in what is , arguably , the most artifactual of environments [ Los Angeles ] , " the authors stated .
" The experiment offers , to our knowledge , the most rigorous assessment of the effects of exposure to modern artifacts on the representation of shape . "
The research team went deep into tribal territory to find nomadic groups that would have had almost no contact with manufactured objects .
Each six - day excursion in a four - wheel drive vehicle took the research team a full day 's drive or more from Opuwo , the last township on the edge of Himba lands .
Biederman 's collaborators were USC graduate students Xiaomin Yue and Mark Lescroart along with Jules Davidoff of the University of London .
The National Science Foundation funded the research .
Subscribers to this edition of Red Pepper will find as an insert the Democratic Audit pamphlet The Unspoken Constitution .
Many attempts have been made in recent years to draft a written constitution for the UK – by John MacDonald QC , Tony Benn and the Institute for Public Policy Research , to name but three – setting out the respective powers that government , parliament and the courts should have , and the rights that should be guaranteed to citizens .
And the case for a codification of Britain ’s system of government has most recently been made by Vernon Bogdanor , arguably the leading contemporary academic authority on the British constitution .
However , the prospect of achieving a written constitution looks more remote than ever , given the way that the major parties together block crucial constitutional issues and prevent them reaching the political agenda .
It seems we will continue to be one of only two countries in the world without one .
This is where our pamphlet comes in .
We thought it was time to write down or ‘ codify ’ not what should happen to make our system democratic , but what happens in practice ; and to do so from the standpoint of the governing elite that exercises power on our behalf but would prefer that its operation be mystified as much as possible .
They recognise how important it is that such a document should never see the light of day .
The constitution begins by extolling the virtues of being unwritten :
It is a collection of laws , fictions , powers left over from the old monarchy and powers that we make up as we go along .
It allows us to decide what governments can do ; and best of all , only we have the power to change it …
The great advantage of this flexibility is that once we have hit on a new way of behaving , it becomes part of the constitution .
And we can modernise easily .
So we have moved on from old - fashioned cabinet government to sofa government by the prime minister with trusted allies and special advisors .
Presidential , yes , but faster and more efficient .
This excellent state of affairs allows us to exercise executive power more or less as we please while the whole world admires us as a democracy .
There then follows a list of the ‘ unspoken articles ’ of what Jack Straw has termed our ‘ executive democracy ’ .
We understand that Sir Humphrey and his colleagues have chuckled particularly loudly at the following articles :
Government , like every subject , shall be free to do whatever is not unlawful .
The government shall decide what is unlawful .
The government shall have the power to enact ministerial edicts , known as statutory instruments or Orders in Council , this secondary legislation being in effect law - making that can almost wholly escape parliamentary scrutiny and debate .
In the event of controversy over government actions , the government may have recourse to carefully chosen judges or former civil servants to hold an inquiry that has due respect for government ’s need for support and discretion .
The government shall set the terms of reference for any inquiry , have powers to suspend it or restrict public access to it , and may censor an inquiry report to prevent any information emerging which we say may harm state economic and security interests .
Civil servants … shall be allowed to enhance generous pensions by taking advantage of their departmental experience and contacts through lucrative appointments in relevant private companies .
We hope you will read the whole document with similar amusement .
But we expect that it will also make you angry that this is the way we are governed in the 21st century .
We like to think that it makes an irresistible case for a written constitution , rooted in sound democratic principles and in popular sovereignty ; but we would urge proponents of the status quo to come forward and make their case for its defence , on democratic , or indeed any other , grounds .
Of course , debate is not enough in itself , and particularly not if it is limited to converts to the cause .
Some matters are simply too urgent to be left until the glorious day when our written constitution is unveiled .
At the same time , voters need to be offered more than a Hobson ’s choice at the 2010 election between political parties making rival claims about which areas of government spending they will cut .
The issues of how power is exercised , by whom and in whose interests , must be forced to the fore of the election debate .
Over the next six months , the Power 2010 initiative will seek to bring these issues back onto the political agenda .
It is a good job somebody is – the party conference season confirmed that it would be foolhardy to leave it to our political masters .

PALLADIUM , OFTEN OVERSHADOWED
BY FLASHIER precious metals like gold and platinum , could end up being this year 's star performer .
Palladium hit a 15 - month high Nov. 18 and has more than doubled since the end of 2008 , largely driven by overspill momentum from gold 's rally ; commodities in general have benefited from huge investor inflows to the sector and a weak U.S. dollar .
Palladium settled at $ 358 an ounce Friday , off just 0.6 % on the week .
True , demand for the metal has taken some hits as the auto industry has struggled ; more than half the world 's annual palladium output goes into catalytic converters , which filter pollutants out of exhaust emissions .
But palladium has an unusual wild card : secret Russian stockpiles -- which could be nearing their end , and which would lend further price support .
Back in the days of the Soviet Union , Moscow surreptitiously stockpiled palladium so that it could sell off its hoard when supplies ran out elsewhere .
Even now , Russia , the largest producer of the metal , wo n't reveal the size of its inventory , but outside estimates suggest that the stores could be nearly empty .
Industry specialist Johnson Matthey predicts that Russia will sell 960,000 troy ounces of palladium from the stockpiles in 2009 , similar to the amount sold last year .
But " from 2011 , stock sales from Russia should decline significantly , " says Peter Duncan , the company 's general manager .
EXCLUDING SALES FROM STOCKPILES , and despite a 3.8 % drop in demand , the market is in deficit .
But when Russian sales are included , palladium will be in a surplus of 655,000 troy ounces this year , and total supplies will be down just 1.8 % , Johnson Matthey says .
Warns Stephen Briggs , an analyst at RBS Global Banking & Markets in London : " We 're looking at a genuine tight market going forward .
There is the extra risk in the price with Russian stockpiles , which is not an issue for metals like silver . "
On top of that , palladium demand is forecast to rise next year , assuming that demand for autos does , too .
" The [ auto ] situation was so bad at times this year , it 's impossible not to see some improvement in 2010 , " maintains Peter Ryan , a senior consultant at GFMS .
Palladium is used mostly in catalytic converters for gasoline - engine cars , while platinum is the primary metal in diesel catalysts .
Worldwide , sales of smaller gas - powered cars have done better than those of larger diesel vehicles during the economic downturn .
As a result , platinum demand from car makers will end up being down by a third this year , whereas palladium will fare better , dipping by only 12.7 % .
Along with improving light - vehicle sales , more palladium will be used in the diesel sector , Johnson Matthey predicts .
Investors ' demand for the metal is also up .
Holdings in exchange - traded funds have almost doubled since the start of the year , to more than a million ounces , as the dollar fell and gold bolted to new highs .
But GFMS 's Ryan says that , in five years or so , palladium demand will be accelerating too , just as supplies are stalling .
So , while prices have moved up , another shining opportunity is ahead in this oft - overlooked metal .
COMEX DECEMBER GOLD , despite a slight setback Friday on Dubai debt worries and a stronger dollar , posted a 2.4 % weekly gain , ending at $ 1,174.20 an ounce .
DEVON MAYLIE is a reporter for Dow Jones Newswires in London .
Here is the text of an opinion piece released by Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff ( Etobicoke - Lakeshore ) :
The first duty of leaders in a democratic society like ours is to respect the institutions that put constraints on their power .
Messy .
Inconvenient .
Frustrating .
Democracy is all those things .
But as Churchill said , it is better than the alternatives .
A minority Parliament can be messy but it can work if the Prime Minister wants it too .
Last week the Harper government announced the shutting down of Parliament .
The fact that this was done in the media " black hole , " just hours before New Year 's Eve , says a good deal about Mr. Harper 's motivations .
It 's also a richly ironic statement about a government that was elected on the key plank of increasing transparency and accountability - but that 's another , equally sad , story .
Every newspaper in Canada - including this one - reported that the key factor in Mr. Harper 's decision was the barrage of criticism and tough questions his government has faced in Parliament over its handling - and apparent cover up - of the Afghan detainee torture issue .
Questions about the government 's truthfulness and its care of Canada 's reputation overseas .
Questions that go to the very heart of the government 's respect for democratic institutions and the rule of law .
Even more troubling , this shutting down of Parliament is not a rash or impetuous act .
It is part of a consistent pattern of behaviour on the part of Mr. Harper 's government .
Whenever Stephen Harper gets into political trouble , his first impulse is to steamroll over democratic institutions that get in his way .
Look at the record :
Just over a year ago , he prorogued Parliament just weeks after an election - in order to rescue himself from an unprecedented political and constitutional crisis of his own making .
He has lashed out at public servants - like Richard Colvin , in the case of the detainees - for daring to speak the truth , and cowed others into silence .
He fired Linda Keen , the head of the Nuclear Safety Commission , for blowing the whistle on the repairs needed at Chalk River to ensure the reactor 's safety .
He starved Kevin Page , the Parliamentary Budget Officer , of the necessary resources to do his job because he was critical of the poor management of our public finances under this Conservative government .
He let go the heads of both the RCMP 's Public Complaints Commission and the Military Police Complaints Commission .
Both were competent individuals , doing their job with distinction .
But both had a serious flaw in Stephen Harper 's eye : they were critical of the government .
He cut off public funding for the ecumenical charitable group KAIROS , despite their lauded work and broad public support , because , according to one of his ministers , they held dissenting views from the government on foreign policy .
This approach to government - intimidating all who stand in its way - can have severe and corrosive consequences .
Look at our nation 's capital today : a cowed and demoralized public service and a constantly bullied national press gallery , both trying to serve a disenchanted public .
The Government 's behaviour speaks to a deep cynicism .
Mr. Harper is gambling that the public does n't care how it is governed .
In fact , in many ways it furthers his political interest to fuel public distrust about politics and depress even further voter turnouts in elections , since this strengthens the electoral impact of his " base . "
Last week 's shutting down of Parliament was a key moment .
A turning point ?
Too dramatic .
In any case , too early to tell .
More important , it was one of those moments of supreme clarity .
The audacity .
The epic scale of the cynicism .
The arrogance of a regime that thinks it can get away with just about anything .
What 's to be done about it ?
Well , the sooner the House comes back , the better .
But between now and then , we have to share our concerns with Canadians .
Mr. Harper may not want to face the public , but we will get out there and meet Canadians in universities , in town hall meetings and other public events from coast to coast to coast .
We will seek their views and exchange ideas .
We will go on doing our job of holding the government to account on the Afghan detainee issue , but also on their failure to act on climate change , on the growing youth employment crisis and retirement security for older Canadians .

Shutting down Parliament has raised speculation about a spring election .
Certainly , there is no need for an early election .
Three in less than six years is enough for the next while .
In case anyone missed it , I got that message loud and clear from Canadians last fall .
And that message was not only addressed to me .
As I hear them , Canadians are saying : get back to work in Ottawa , make this Parliament work and do the job we elected you to do .
We are listening .
It is time that Stephen Harper did too .

Seinfeld Summed Up In One Picture
Read more posts by the author of Heroic Computer Problems ,
This is the real reason superheros prefer to punch things .
I always wondered why the computers that superheros used , were so big , or seemed to be controlled just by a few large buttons .
To see what I mean , take a look at this pic of the Superfriends and their computer in the Hall of Justice .
That thing is MASSIVE , and has very little in the way of a keyboard or mouse that would require them to touch it .
And looking at the picture , you can see how the are all too scared to even really approach it .
So , I am now convinced that this is one of the major causes of Superhero violence in the Marvel & DC universes .
Sure , it is great having powers and super strength .
But if you could not play WOW , or tweet , or facebook , or surf for porn , whatever , then how would you feel ?
I bet you would soon want to hit someone .
Really really hard .
Superpowered folk are not really fans of violence – they just really want to be able to play flash games & poke their friends on facebook like everyone else .
I think there is something in that for all of us , do n’t you ?
UPDATE : In response to this comic , to valiant twitterers have joined in the fun and linked me to their comics , which also make fun of Superheroes and computers .
These are great and I thank them both very much !

High levels of vitamin D can reduce the incidence of cancer by 60 % , according to a small study of older women in Nebraska published Thursday .
But the number of cancers observed in the four - year study , reported online in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , was small -- totaling only 50 -- leading some experts to question its conclusions .
The study , which tracked 1,179 subjects , also looked only at older white women , so it is not clear whether the findings apply to other population groups .
Dr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld , deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society , said the society found the results interesting but not sufficient to recommend that individuals increase their vitamin D intake .

Experience has shown , he said , that such reports about preventing cancer with a drug or vitamin did not pan out when they were subjected to randomized clinical trials .
In this case , he said , the number of cancers observed was too small to be conclusive .
But Dr. Cedric Garland of the Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego , who reported in 1989 that vitamin D reduces the incidence of colon cancer , said the results did not come out of left field .
Several large studies have suggested that vitamin D can reduce the risk of colon and breast cancers , and smaller studies have demonstrated a protective effect against prostate , lung and skin cancers .
The new study was conducted by Joan Lappe , a professor of medicine at the Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha .

The women in the study had been free of cancer for at least 10 years at the start .
Their average age was 67 .
A third of the women in the study , which was designed to assess bone health , received daily calcium supplements plus 1,100 international units ( IU ) of vitamin D3 , also known as cholecalciferol .
Current guidelines for daily vitamin D consumption range from 200 to 600 IU , increasing with age .
Another third received only the calcium supplements , while the rest received a placebo .
After four years , the group receiving calcium and vitamin D had 13 cancers , while the group receiving calcium alone had 17 , and the group receiving placebo had 20 .
Advertisement
On the assumption that some of the women entering the study might have had a cancer at enrollment , the team looked at the last three years of the study .
The results were more dramatic , with a 77 % reduction in cancer risk .
The women receiving vitamin D had eight cancers , the women receiving only calcium had 15 , and the women receiving placebo had 18 .
Most multivitamins contain vitamin D2 from plant sources .
Vitamin D3 , from meat sources , is generally considered to be more potent and is available separately as a supplement .
Humans make their own vitamin D3 from exposure to sunlight .
Lichtenberg conceded that some people may want to increase their daily intake of vitamin D based on the study : “ This should be done in consultation with a healthcare clinician , and in no case should exceed the recognized maximum safe dose of 2,000 IU per day . ”

Earlier this week I attended SBCL's 10th Anniversary Workshop at Goldsmiths , University of London .
It was great .
Monday started off with a status update from Nick Levine on his upcoming O'Reilly book called Lisp Outside the Box .
He talked about the difficulties of fitting so much material in relatively few pages and gave us printed copies of one of the draft chapters .
Everyone should go read the latest draft chapters and send Nick some feedback at his blog .
Later that morning , Martin Cracauer gave us a very juicy presentation about various technical details pertaining to ITA 's usage of SBCL for their high - performance flight search engine .
I scribbled down some notes :
Things like SBCL 's optimized struct layout and slot access and bitfield operations provide for space - and speed - efficient memory representations .
They seemed quite happy about SBCL 's fixnum efficient representation .
( E.g. , fixnum tags end in zeroes which among other things means some arithmetic can be performed directly with the CPU 's native instructions without prior untagging . )
I would expect other Lisps ( besides CMUCL , obviously ) to have similar characteristics but I 've never actually checked .
SBCL 's tremendously useful declaration semantics simultaneously provide important assertions when testing and high performance in production , e.g. when dealing with 32 - bit arithmetic .
They use mmap ( ) to directly use C - struct - like data from Lisp .
to directly use C - struct - like data from Lisp .
Array bounds - checking is left enabled since disabling it is not worth the enourmous trouble one might get into otherwise .
GC performance is good but they use pre-allocation where usage is predictable .
Earlier versions had a cons cache — which got a lot of laughs from the audience — which turned out to actually slow things down in SBCL for various reasons .
In summary , they seemed pretty happy with how things turned out with SBCL , after having used , IIUC , three other Lisp implementations in the past .
In an unrelated note , I found it nice that they do automated performance regression tests with customer datasets and queries .
I like that sort of stuff and I wish we had infrastructure to do this sort of thing with open - source CL libraries .
After a free lunch — the best kind of lunch — hacking and brainstorming started .
It was interesting to learn that all of the windows in that building could be used as whiteboards ( translucid boards ? ) .
In the afternoon some lightning talks took place .
I did n't take notes at this point but I recall that Christophe Rhodes talked a little bit about his recent Unicode - related work , James Knight described his initial attempt to hook the high - level bits of SBCL 's compiler into LLVM , Paul Khuong described his library for implementing lock - free algorithms , and Attila Lendvai and Levente Mészáros demoed their impressive DWIM web framework stuff .
We had dinner at a Turkish restaurant which was very good .
Surprinsingly so , perhaps , because their entrance prominently displayed a “ Fully Licensed ” sign .
Fun UK trivia : “ off licensed ” means an establishment may sell alcoholic drinks but they must be consumed elsewhere whereas a “ fully licensed ” establishment can both sell the drinks and , erm , harbour inebriates .
Hacking resumed tuesday morning and throughout the day , with some interruptions for more lightning talks .
Rudi Schlatte gave us a quick intro to the magnificent org- mode , Attila and Levente showed us some nice pieces of software like the Stefil test framework , cl-rdbms , perec , and a partial evaluator .
But , David Lichteblau won the gold medal of lightning talks by giving four or five talks about gencgc incremental allocation and dynamic - space relocation , his recent work on Hemlock ( including a brand new Qt backend ) , interfacing with C++ ( e.g. , his own CommonQT ) , and some other stuff I lost track of .
( See the workshop 's website for more details . )
Afterwards there was some discussion about the future of SBCL .
Among other things an official move to a git repository seems eminent , there was some discussion about using more of Launchpad 's functionalities ( e.g. for dealing with incoming patches ) , and the possibility of SBCL bundling some CL libraries was raised .
The day ended with everyone going to a local pub ( fully licensed , I hope ) where I had plenty of fun talking with Levente and Attila about life , the universe , and everything , pretty much .
Levente gave us some nice math / logic puzzles to exercise our brains ; it was a great evening .
Many thanks to Christophe Rhodes for organising this great workshop and to my employer for kindly sponsoring my participation and enabling my proud response to the question “ What do you do ? ” — “ I'm a Lisp programmer ! ” :-)
I was happy to meet lots of people I regularly interact with on - line and / or whose Lisp code I have used or read at some point .
Unfortunately I did n't get to chat with everyone but I hope we 'll have future opportunities .
Looking forward to ELS 2010 already which , quite conveniently for me , will take place right here in Portugal with less freezing temperatures ( London is rough ! ) and the right kind of electricity sockets and voltages .

A pest in the United States and pretty much everywhere else , Cuitlacoche , or Corn Smut , is considered a delicacy in Mexico .
Cuitlacoche is sold at a higher price than healthy corn and used to make tortillas .
The diseases attacks the kernels , turning them into spore - filled tumors that apparently taste way better than healthy corn .
The smut - infected corn is picked before it reaches maturity , so the kernels are still moist and taste sweet , savory , woody , and earthy .
After high - profile chefs and government officials tried to convince the American people to stop regarding Cuitlacoche as a disease and start treating it like food , cans of Cuitlacoche found their way on to store shelves .
But people are still reluctant to try it … I wonder why .

Padre is getting better by every release , but many people have not heard of it yet .
It needs some promotion so I am wondering which one of the social networks and other tools could be used for this ?
Blogging about it certainly helps .
Submitting those posts to Reddit also has its impact and there are number of other ways .
In any case it is you who can make the difference .
If you are using Padre already or if you think the Perl world would be better off if people used a Perl aware editor instead of Notepad + + and other generic programmers editors or even if you just think that the whole idea of building an open source IDE for Perl in Perl is a good cause , consider spending a few minutes in helping promoting it .
Some of the things you can do :
Mark yourself as a user of Padre on Ohloh ( there are 24 users currently ) .
Subscribe to Padre on Freshmeat ( there are now 16 subscriptions ) .
Join the Padre group on LinkedIn ( there are currently 17 members ) .
I recently setup a Padre group on Facebook ( there is 1 member now :-) . and Padre page of Facebook where you can become a fan .
( thanks to Bogdan Lucaciu )
I even setup a Twitter account for Padre you can follow .
I tried to search for a Perl IDE on Google .
Padre was in 8th place with the perlide.org site being number 5 .
It is not bad but moving up the ladder would be nice .
So if you have a web site , consider linking to Padre or to perlide.org from there .
Just to give it a shot I tried to search for Perl IDE on Bing as well .
It shows perlide.org on 3rd place and on the 9th place but padre .
perlide.org is only number 15 .
After doing all the above , let me know , what other ways do you think Padre could be promoted ?
During a match at Old Trafford in April 1996 , the Coventry defender David Busst collissioned with Manchester United defender Denis Irwin .
As a result , Busst got his leg broken so badly that the bone pierced the skin and his blood had to be cleared from the pitch .
He had a compound fracture of his tibia and fibula and could never play professionally again .
United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel , who witnessed the injury , required counseling afterwards .
For several years , it seemed as though the book industry was getting a reprieve .
As the music industry was ravaged by file sharing , and the film and TV industry were increasingly targeted by downloaders , book piracy was but a quaint cul de sac in the vast file sharing ecology .
The tide , however , may be changing .
Ereaders have become mainstream , making reading ebooks palatable to many more readers .
Meanwhile , technology for scanning physical books and breaking the DRM on ebooks has continued to advance .
A recent study by Attributor , a firm that specializes in monitoring content online , came to some spectacular conclusions , including the headline claim that book piracy costs the industry nearly $ 3 billion , or over 10 % of total revenue .
Of all the conclusions in the Attributor study , this one seemed the most outlandish , and the study itself might be met with some skepticism since Attributor is in the business of charging companies to protect their content from the threat of piracy .
Nonetheless , the study , which monitored 913 titles on several popular file hosting sites , did point to a level of activity that suggested illegal downloading of books was becoming more than just a niche pastime .
Even if the various extrapolations that led to the $ 3 - billion figure are easy to poke holes in , Attributor still directly counted 3.2 million downloaded books .
For some , however , the study may inspire more questions than answers .
Who are the people downloading these books ?
How are they doing it and where is it happening ?
And , perhaps most critical for the publishing industry , why are people deciding to download books and why now ?
I decided to find out , and after a few hours of searching – stalled by a number dead links and password protected sites – I found , on an online forum focused on sharing books via BitTorrent , someone willing to talk .
He lives in the Midwest , he ’s in his mid-30s and is a computer programmer by trade .
By some measures , he ’s the publishing industry ’s ideal customer , an avid reader who buys dozens of books a year and enthusiastically recommends his favorites to friends .
But he ’s also uploaded hundreds of books to file sharing sites and he ’s downloaded thousands .
We discussed his file sharing activity over the course of a weekend , via email , and in his answers lie a critical challenge facing the publishing industry : how to quash the emerging piracy threat without alienating their most enthusiastic customers .
As is typical of anonymous online communities , he has a peculiar handle : “ The Real Caterpillar . ”
This is what he told me :
The Millions : How active are you .
How many books have you uploaded or downloaded ?
The Real Caterpillar :
In the past month , I have uploaded approximately 50 books to the torrent site where you contacted me .
I am much less active then I once was .
I used to scan many books , but in the past two years I have only done a few .
Between 2002 - 2005
I created around 200 ebooks by scanning the physical copy , OCRing and proofing the output , and uploading them to USENET .
I generally only upload content that I have scanned , with some exceptions .
I have been out of the book scene for a while , concentrating on rare and out of print movies instead of books because it is much easier to rip a movie from VHS or DVD than to scan and proof a book .
I have downloaded a couple thousand ebooks via USENET and private torrent sites .
TM : Do you typically see scanned physical books or ebooks where the DRM has been broken ?
TRC : Most of what I have seen is scanned physical books .
Stephen King ’s Under the Dome was the first DRM - broken book I downloaded knowingly .
TM : Why have you gone this route as opposed to using a library or buying books ?
Do you consider this “ stealing ” or is it a gray area ?
TRC : I own around 1,600 physical books , maybe a third of which were bought new , the rest used .
I buy many hardcovers in a given year and generally purchase more books than I end up reading , so I have not chosen to collect electronic books as opposed to paper books but in addition to them .
My electronic library has about a 50 % crossover with my physical library , so that I can read the book on my electronic reader , “ loan ” the book without endangering my physical copy , or eventually rid myself of the paper copy if it is a book I do not have strong feelings about .
I do not buy DRM ’d ebooks that are priced at more than a few dollars , but would pay up to $ 10 for a clean file if it was a new release .
I do not pretend that uploading or downloading unpurchased electronic books is morally correct , but I do think it is more of a grey area than some of your readers may .
Perhaps this will change as the Kindle and other e-ink readers make electronic books more convenient , but the Baen Free Library is an interesting experiment that proves that at least in that case , their business was actually enhanced by giving away their product free .
That is probably not a business model that will work for everyone , but what is shows is that as a company they have their ear to the ground and are willing to think in new directions and take chances instead of putting their fingers in their ears , closing their eyes , and railing against their customers , as the
music industry is doing .
The world is changing and business models have to change with it .
Three additional points :
1 ) With digital copies , what is “ stolen ” is not as clear as with physical copies .
With physical copies , you can assign a cost to the physical product , and each unit costs x dollars to create .
Therefore , if the product is stolen , it is easy to say that an object was stolen that was worth x dollars .
With digital copies , it is more difficult to assign cost .
The initial file costs x dollars to create , but you can make a million copies of that file for no cost .
Therefore , it is hard to assign a specific value to a digital copy of a work except as it relates to lost sales .
2 ) Just because someone downloads a file , it does not mean they would have bought the product I think this is the key fact that many people in the music industry ignore – a download does not translate to a lost sale .
I own hundreds of paper copies of books I have e-copies of , many of which were bought after downloading the e-copy .
In other cases I have downloaded books I would never have purchased , simply because they were recommended or sounded interesting .
3 ) Just because someone downloads a file , it does n’t mean they will read it .
I realize that buying a book does n’t mean someone is going to read it either , but clicking a link and paying $ 10 - $ 30 is very different – many more people will download a book and not read it than buy a book and not read it .
In truth , I think it is clear that morally , the act of pirating a product is , in fact , the moral equivalent of stealing … although that nagging question of what the person who has been stolen from is missing still lingers .
Realistically and financially , however , I feel the impact of e-piracy is overrated , at least in terms of ebooks .
TM : How easy is it to go online and find a book you ’re looking for ?
How long does it take to download and how much technical expertise is required ?
TRC : I have specific tastes , so it is usually not very easy to find specifically what I am looking for .
The dearth of material I was interested in is what prompted me to scan in the past , in order to share some of my favorite , less popular authors with as many people as possible .
It does not take much time to download once something you want has been found , however , and little technical experience is required .
Since books are generally very small files , they can be downloaded in minutes .
You can then convert the file using one of many applications , for instance Mobipocket Creator , to PRC or another format that works with your reader .
You can then plug your Kindle into your computer and copy the file over .
The entire process typically takes 5 - 10 minutes .
BitTorrent technology is easy to install and use , and just about anyone can install the basic software needed and begin downloading their first torrent in less than an hour .
However , discovering and gaining access to private torrent sites ( invite only ) can take a lot of time – and of course , that is where the good stuff is .
Public sites ( no account needed ) and semi-private sites ( sites that require an account , but usually have open enrollment ) have a limited selection , but are easily accessible and anyone with basic computer skills can find and download very popular novels .
Usenet is an older technology , and is considered a safer place to pirate files .
For older users like me who were around at the beginning of the internet it seems very simple , but to newer computer users it may seem unnecessarily complex , and more expensive because you need an account separate from your regular internet connection to access it .
TM : Once you ’ve downloaded a book , what format is it in and how do you read it ?
On you computer ?
Printed out ?
TRC : My preferred format for distribution is RTF because it holds metadata such as italics , boldfaces , and special characters that TXT does not , is easily converted to other formats using Word , cannot contain a virus , and is an open format that will be readable forever .
Other popular formats are DOC , HTML , PDF , LIT ( Microsoft Reader ) , PRC ( Palm ) , MOBI ( Palm ) , CBR ( rar ’d image files ) – and there is a new format with each new reader that is released .
Most formats can be converted to your preferred format with enough ingenuity or the
correct software .
To read , I convert to PRC and load the books onto my Kindle .
Before I got that , I read on my Palm or laptop .
TM : How long does it take you to scan a physical book ?
TRC : The scanning process takes about 1 hour per 100 scans .
Mass market paperbacks can be scanned two pages at a time flat on the scanner bed , while large trades and hardcovers usually need to be scanned one page at a time .
I ’m sure that some of the more hardcore scanners disassemble the book and run it through an automatic feeder or something , but I prefer the manual approach because I ’d like to save the book , and do n’t want to invest in the tools .
Usually I can scan a book while watching a movie or two .
Once scanned , the output needs to be OCR ’d – this is a fairly quick process using a tool like ABBYY FineReader .
The final step is the longest and most grueling .
I ’ve spent anywhere from 5 to 40 hours proofing the OCR output , depending on the size of the book and the quality of type in the original .
This can be done in your OCR tool side - by - side with the scan of the original image or separately in your final output type ( RTF , DOC , HTML , etc. ) .
If there are few errors on the first few pages of text my preference is to proof in RTF , otherwise I do the proof within Finereader itself .
TM : What types of books do you look for ?
What is generally available ?
Is any fiction or popular non-fiction available ?
TRC : I restrict my downloads to books I will likely read – this includes some popular novels , literary novels , and general non-fiction such as humor , biography , science , sociology , etc .
Unlike DVD rips , the newest releases are not typically available two weeks before the product is released , if at all .
I ’m assuming that this is due to the smaller devoted audience books have , as well as the increased difficulty of sharing a book .
TM : Do you have a sense of where these books are coming from and who is putting them online ?
TRC : I assume they are primarily produced by individuals like me – bibliophiles who want to share their favorite books with others .
They likely own hundreds of books , and when asked what their favorite book is look at you like you are crazy before rattling of 10 - 15 authors , and then emailing you later with several more .
The next time you see them , they have a bag of 5 - 10 books for you to borrow .
I ’m sure that there are others – the compulsive collectors who download and re-share without ever reading one , the habitual pirates who want to be the first to upload a new release , and people with some other weird agenda that only they understand .
TM : Is it your sense that a lot of people are out there looking to get books this way ?
Or is it just a tiny group ?
TRC : I would say that there is a small unaffiliated “ group ” of people responsible for sourcing the material .
Also , keep in mind that everything I ’m saying applies mostly to fiction and general - interest non-fiction .
Textbook , programming and technical manuals are all over the place and its very easy to obtain almost anything you want .
I assume there are more sources for that material , and that their high price is a larger factor in people deciding to pirate them .
Similarly , there are many communities creating comic , graphic novel and magazine content of whom I am only vaguely aware .
TM : Do you worry at all about getting in trouble for scanning and uploading ebooks ?
TRC : A little , but the books I do are typically not bestsellers and are rarely new .
I figure I have a bit of a buffer if trouble comes down because the Stephen King or Nora Roberts or “ whoever the latest bestseller is ” scanners would be the ones to get hit first .
I ’ve done a lot of out - of - print stuff , and when it is not out of print it ’s books by authors like John Barth – someone who no longer sells very well , I imagine .
I ’ve debated doing some newer authors and books , but I would need to protect myself better and resolve the moral dilemma of actually causing noticeable financial harm to the author whose work I love enough to spend so much time working on getting a nice e-copy if I were to do so .
TM : What changes in the ebook industry would inspire you to stop participating in ebook file sharing ?
TRC : This is a tough question .
I guess if every book was available in electronic format with no DRM for reasonable prices ( $ 10 max for new / bestseller / omnibus , scaling downwards for popularity and value ) it just would n’t be worth the time , effort , and risk to find , download , convert and load the book when the same thing could be accomplished with a single click on your Kindle .
Even in this situation , I would probably still grab a book if I stumbled across the file and thought it might interest me – or if I wanted to check it out before buying a paper copy .
I was impressed by the Indie filmmakers of the movie “ Ink ” – when their movie leaked before the DVD was released , they put a donation button on their site doubleedgefilms.com .
I donated even though I have n’t watched the movie yet , just because of their thoughtfulness and sincerity .
This did n’t seem to work for King ’s “ The Plant “ , but I think that had a lot to do with the lack of reading technology at the time .
I would like to see the experiment tried again by someone like Eggers or Murakami – someone with a very devoted fanbase .
Perhaps if readers were more confident that the majority of the money went to the author , people would feel more guilty about depriving the author of payment .
I think most of the filesharing community feels that the record industry is a vestigal organ that will slowly fall off and die – I do n’t know to what extent that feeling would extend to publishing houses since they are to some extent a different animal .
In the end , I think that regular people will never feel very guilty “ stealing ” from a faceless corporation , or to a lesser extent , a multi-millionaire like King .
One thing that will definitely not change anyone ’s mind or inspire them to stop are polemics from people like Mark Helprin and Harlan Ellison – attitudes like that ensure that all of their works are available online all of the time .

We 're in a cool decade

Fluctuations in weather patterns are normal .
Data shows that the last ten years have been cooler than normal .
It was far warmer during the Medieval period - without hydrocarbons - than it is now .
There is no question that burning oil and coal is dirty , wasteful , and harmful to human beings , but in spite of all the government and media - generated hysteria human activity has little meaningful impact on weather patterns .
Who 's behind the carefully orchestrated global warming hysteria ?
It 's hard to say , but it is a very , very lucrative racquet for all involved .
For example , in the UK it was behind " the most expensive piece of legislation ever passed " in that country 's history .
The cast of supporting characters include lazy journalists , grandstanding politicians , and corrupt scientists .
Saying that the battery will last " for about one week , " as Panasonic 's president has , is pretty arbitrary it seems , as different households have vastly different energy needs .
Even so , batteries can be strung together into arrays , and something that could last the average homestead even a few days would open the door for more solar panels on roofs , and that can't be bad .
Firefighters work at the scene of a bomb blast in northern Tehran Tuesday .
( ( Associated Press ) )
A Tehran University nuclear physics professor killed Tuesday by a remote - controlled bomb outside his home had publicly backed Iranian opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi but was not considered a political figure , state media reported .
Massoud Ali Mohammadi , 50 , had just left his house on his way to work when the remote - controlled explosion went off , state - run Press TV said .
Iran 's semi-official ISNA news agency quoted Tehran prosecutor Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi as confirming the killing and saying no one has been arrested .
Iran 's Foreign Ministry accused Israel and the U.S. of involvement , according to the state TV website .
" In initial investigations , there are some indications of vices of the Zionist regime , the U.S. and their mercenaries in Iran in the terrorist incident , " ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast was quoted as saying in the report .
Before last summer 's hotly disputed presidential elections , Ali Mohammadi 's name was among a list of 240 Tehran University teachers who threw their support behind reformist leader Mousavi .
Nuclear physics professor Masoud Ali Mohammadi was killed after a bomb blast in front of his house , in northern Tehran 's Qeytariyeh neighbourhood , state media reported .
(( Fars News Agency / Associated Press ) )
Although Ali Mohammadi was among a list of opposition supporters , a Tehran University official told the Mehr news agency he was not actively involved in politics .
" The prominent professor was not a political figure and had no activity in the field of politics , " Mehr quoted Ali Moqari , head of the university 's science department , as saying .
Ali Mohammadi also had no involvement in Iran 's atomic agency , according to spokesman Ali Shirzadian .
Iran has faced increased scrutiny from the United States and the United Nations over its pursuit of a nuclear enrichment program .
In 1992 , Ali Mohammadi received the first doctorate in nuclear physics to be awarded in Iran , from Tehran 's Sharif University of Technology .
Officials at both Tehran University and Iran 's nuclear agency said his work was primarily in the realm of quantum and theoretical physics .
WINNIPEG , Manitoba , Dec. 15 ( UPI ) --
A newborn boy in Winnipeg , Manitoba , is expected to fully recover after being born into a toilet by his mother who says she did n't know she was pregnant .
The child was born in the home of Heather Richards , 33 , Sunday morning while she was sitting on the toilet in pain , the Winnipeg Free Press reported Tuesday .

" I did n't know what it was at first , " she said of her first delivery .
" I thought I was dying . "
Police officers were in the home on an unrelated matter when they heard Richards ' screams .
They found the infant without vital signs in the bowl and a policewoman began resuscitation that revived him .
" When he started to cry , it was the best thing I 've ever heard , " Richards told the newspaper .
She said the baby had a small skull fracture from hitting the toilet bowl , but doctors told her the 4 - pound , 9 - ounce child would fully recover .
There are heartbreaking scenes amid the picnic tables and golf tees of a former haven for elites
US ARMY specialist Juan Valencia stood on the hillside above the Haitian capital , watching the teeming camp below with binoculars .
“ I ’m just making sure they do n’t have any weapons .
They ’re allowed to have weapons , but not within range of our guys , ” said the spotter for the 82nd Airborne Division .
If one could for a moment forget the earthquake of January 12th , the 200,000 dead people and millions of Haitians in distress , the Pétionville golf club would be a beautiful place , with immaculate landscaping and vistas over the Caribbean .
In the wake of the catastrophe , an estimated 60,000 Haitians rushed to its slopes , where they languish in tents fashioned from tree branches , bedsheets and rope .
Some 300 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division occupy the heights above the displaced Haitians , bivouacked in the clubhouse and tennis courts .
The American actor Sean Penn , who with a former Bosnian refugee - turned - millionairess founded an instant NGO , is camping on one of the tennis courts .
There are army lorries , Humvees painted desert tan from Iraq , and tonnes of food and water , waiting for distribution .
But crowd control remains an almost insurmountable problem .
Word has gone out that the impoverished masses at the Pétionville Club will receive food and water , and the camp grows daily , with some aid workers saying it now numbers 100,000 .
Oxfam has done a heroic job of installing giant water bladders with taps , but this is insufficient .
The US Catholic Relief Service ( CRS ) was able to distribute 1,300 food kits late last week , but full - scale distribution has repeatedly been delayed for fear of food riots , while CRS divides the camp into A , B , C and D blocks and distributes a voucher to the mother of each family , in the hope of organising an orderly distribution .
If all goes well , CRS will begin its distribution today .
“ If it takes an extra day to do it right , it ’s worth it , ” says Donal Reilly , the Dubliner in charge of food distribution for CRS .
The camp , one of the largest of some 500 in Port - au - Prince , is becoming infamous as a place where the displaced can find water and a modicum of security , provided by the US military , but no food .
It ’s not entirely true ; the 82nd Airborne gave away 10,000 meals each day until Saturday , making this camp the US military ’s largest distribution point in Port - au - Prince .
But the Americans decided the food attracted too many people to a volatile site , and temporarily stopped it .
“ The crowd has calmed down , ” Lt Brad Kerfoot said as he surveyed the tent city below us .
Fights broke out the previous day when CRS tried to distribute vouchers – not even food , just vouchers .
“ We told them we would n’t give any food away today , because of the way they behaved yesterday , ” says Kerfoot .
The military and CRS officials say there are no signs of starvation in the camp .
Some of its inhabitants have enough money to buy food in the local market .
And the soldiers say they see ration boxes hoarded in what they call “ the village ” .
“ Yesterday , they threw water bottles back at us and said , ‘ We do n’t want your water ’ , ” Lt Kerfoot says .
“ When we gave out high energy biscuits , they threw them on the ground and stomped on them when they saw they were cookies .
My soldiers and I think they ’re ungrateful . ”
The displaced Haitians want food , not water , a Haitian woman explained to me .
And in their culture , biscuits are not real food , but something given to children .
During the day , Lt Kerfoot positions two riflemen armed with M4s above the camp .
After nightfall , there ’s an entire squadron .
“ There ’s people in the camp with guns , ” explains Donal Reilly of CRS .
“ There ’ve been knife fights .
The Americans told me last night the Haitians were selling drugs .
It ’s turning into a typical Port - au - Prince slum , and there ’s not one policeman down there . ”
Nor is there a single toilet or shower , for 60,000 people .
Piles of rubbish smoulder between the tents .
Women fry fritters and fish on charcoal stoves beside their shelters .
Reilly worries about sanitation and the fire hazard .
There are no fire breaks , and the bedsheet tents are highly flammable .
Amid the picnic tables and golf tees in this refuge of Haiti ’s pre-quake elite , there are heart - breaking scenes .
In dozens of tents , people told me they were hungry , thirsty and had nowhere to go .
Several said they expected to die in the Pétionville Club .
But even in the worst deprivation , Haitians have maintained a sense of humour .
One bedsheet tent bore a cardboard sign declaring it to be “ Tikay O Beach ” .
Louissant Banningchton ( 26 ) , a painter who wears his dreadlocks in a knitted snood , constructed a “ Presidential Palace ” of cardboard boxes stamped “ Humanitarian daily rations .
Food gift from the people of the United States of America ” .
“ Thank you Jesus , ” “ Haiti 4 America ” and “ God Bless America ” are slogans Banningchton painted on the “ palace ” before declaring himself president .
A few miles away , at Turgeau , the Irish aid group Goal was carrying out its second distribution of basic food supplies .
By last night Goal was to have given a 15 - day food supply to 9,000 peoples .
Goal ’s emergency co-ordinator , Brian Casey , had carefully assessed the neighbourhood ’s needs , and co-ordinated the distribution with local leaders .
The hand - out nonetheless started tensely , with Haitians from other neighbourhoods clamouring for food being held back by Sri Lankan UN troops .
For John O’Shea , the head of Goal who visited Port - au - Prince at the weekend , the Haitian relief effort is still too little , too slowly .
“ Up to 1.5 million people need all of their basic requirements seen to , ” O ’Shea said .
“ There is n’t an entity on the planet that can satisfy the needs of 1.5 million people .
We do n’t have it because the international community has n’t established an international fire brigade . ”
O’Shea believes Ireland is the nation best qualified to established such an organisation .
In the meantime , he wants President Barack Obama , who has sent $ 100 million in aid and 12,000 military personnel , to be given overall authority – not the UN .
“ The one phrase I heard most here was : ‘ Who in God ’s name is in charge ? ’ ” says O’Shea .
These stories are made up .
They are also supposed to be funny .
Many people fear making workers ’ compensation claim because they think their boss will retaliate or that they will be fired .
But by law , you have the right to make a claim .
An attorney can help protect those rights , especially if you fear employer retaliation .

I have this friend .
My friend loves cupcakes .
I mean , really loves cupcakes .
Her name is Julie .
I like to call her Cupcake Julie .
She does n’t know that though .
Well , maybe now she does .
When she invited me to her Christmas Party this year , I was really excited because I knew she would have some sweet decorations .
But , never … never did I expect to see such a visual delight .
Let ’s just say , when I walked in …
I felt right at home … and I did n’t want to leave… ever .
Each room was filled with candy and sweets and yes , cupcakes !
And I ’m not just talking about what there was to eat .
I ’m talking about the decorations .
Here are some of the pictures I took … in low light .
Sorry , they do n’t come close to doing the decorations justice , but they ’ll give you a good idea .
This is Julie ’s tree .
It is stunning .
And it ’s guarded by her very own Colonel Cupcake .
I think I ’m in love .
Another view .
I think I want to cry .
This is the sweetest thing I ’ve ever seen .
Until I saw this .
This is her dessert table .
It ’s gorgeous !
Gorgeous !
Gorgeous !
She made lots and lots of sweets .
Including cake pops !
Oh yeah – one tiny little detail .
She also made the house .
She needed a little something to serve her brownies on .
She ’s crafty like that .
Stunning !
Lollipops and cupcakes and candy canes and all .
She did all of the decorating down to every last detail .
Julie ’s collected many of these decorations over the years , but she also makes a lot of them .
She made these stockings , too .
I do n’t think she made this .
But seriously , where does someone find sugar cone castles ?
And chocolate covered strawberries …
… and sparkling chocolate cake ornaments ?
She will be getting a full interrogation soon .
Look at these Gingerbread men !
Ummm … she made them , too .
They were shipping boxes in their former lives .
They are much happier now .
I love the colors .
So cheerful and fun and the inspiration for the cupcakes I made last weekend .
This was a sweet surprise .
She also has a Lollidoll figurine like the one I have from the Lollipop Workshop .
She even has some Jenny Holiday artwork .
Okay , now I ’m going to have to get one of these paintings , too .
I ’ve been trying to resist , but no longer .
Having fun yet ?
Well , prepare yourself for this .
Julie has a miniature play cupcake bakery .
It ’s completely as cute as it looks .
Get this …
Julie and her husband made it .
The stand , the awning , everything .
And Julie made all of the cupcakes on display , too .
They are made of felt and they are beautiful .
Right about here , I started to feel like a real slacker .
I mean seriously .
I ’ve got to learn how to sew or something .
Sugar cookies and cakes … oh my .
By the way .
Julie does n’t do any of this for a living .
Not a bit .
Her day job is the complete opposite of her passion .
She does all of this for fun and because she really loves cupcakes and making people smile .
She ’s the sweetest .
In front of the bakery is the cutest little table with wood block ice cream sundaes .
I ’m definitely shopping in the wrong places .
Okay , just a few more decorations .
The sugar coma will be over soon , I promise .
In her kitchen is a display of glass jars filled with the brightest candies .
I think this made me smile the biggest …
The jars and the candy stay on display all year long .
That just makes me happy .
Here ’s something else that makes me happy .
See this toy soldier nutcracker guy ?
Well , he ’s really tall .
And he ’s not alone … there ’s two of them .
They guard the outside of the house .
And , ummmm … she and her hubby made them , too … from scratch .
They ’re not quite done yet .
The hats will be finished off … as cupcakes no less – and they ’ll either be holding candy canes or lollipops .
Love that !
I hope you enjoyed the tour .
I just had to share .
I love learning about people ’s untapped talents and Julie has many of them .
Now , if you ’ll excuse me , I have to go make a two - story toy soldier .
I ’ll see you in a couple of weeks or ten .
NOTE : A lot of you have asked if Julie has a blog .
I ’m sorry to say , no she does n’t .
And no etsy store either .
I told ya … she really just does this kind of stuff because she loves it .
But , maybe I can convince her to show us a few things in the future .
I ’ll work on her .
Jean Simmons was one of Hollywood 's most popular leading ladies
British film actress Jean Simmons , who played Ophelia in Laurence Olivier 's Hamlet and sang with Marlon Brando in Guys and Dolls , has died aged 80 .
Simmons , who won an Emmy Award for her role in The Thorn Birds in the 1980s , died at her home in Santa Monica on Friday , her agent told the LA Times .
She had been suffering from lung cancer for some time .
The actress , who moved to Hollywood in 1950 , first made her name playing Estella in 1946's Great Expectations .
She went on to become one of Hollywood 's leading ladies , starring alongside Gregory Peck , Paul Newman and Kirk Douglas .
Born in London in 1929 , Simmons began her career at the age of 14 , when she was plucked from a dance class to make her movie debut in the 1944 British production Give Us the Moon .
She then appeared in several minor British films before her breakthrough role in Great Expectations , followed by Black Narcissus and then Hamlet in 1948 , where she earned an Oscar nomination .
The actress also proved her mettle playing Desiree to Marlon Brando 's Napoleon , appearing alongside him again in Guys and Dolls in 1955 .
She picked up a second Oscar nomination for 1969's The Happy Ending , before moving largely to television roles in the 1970s , 1980s and 1990s .
Simmons ' first marriage was to fellow British film star Stewart Granger , who she met on the set of Caesar and Cleopatra .
The couple had been befriended by reclusive tycoon Howard Hughes in LA , who arranged their marriage in Tucson , Arizona .
Simmons and Granger had a daughter , Tracy , and starred in several films together .
However the pair divorced in 1960 , with Simmons going on to marry Richard Brooks , who had directed her in Elmer Gantry .
Their marriage , which produced a daughter , Kate , ended in divorce in 1977 .
Mr Elbegdorj has already commuted several death sentences
Mongolian President Tsakhia Elbegdorj has announced a moratorium on the death penalty , and called for the punishment to be abolished .
Mr Elbegdorj told parliament that the punishment degraded Mongolia 's dignity .
He is known to have commuted at least three death sentences since taking power last year .
Exact figures on capital punishment in Mongolia are hard to establish , but at least one man was executed in 2008 , and nine are believed to be on death row .
Challenge ahead
" The majority of the world 's countries have chosen to abolish the death penalty .
We should follow this path , " Mr Elbegdorj told parliament .
As president , he has the power to commute any death sentences , but changing the law is likely to be much more of a challenge .
He will need help from members of Mongolia 's opposition - dominated parliament , many of whom still favour harsh punishments .
According to Amnesty International , 95 countries have so far banned the death penalty , but in much of Asia the death penalty is still an important part of the judicial system .
All of Dubai Underwater With Climate Change
January 16th , 2010 by Susan Kraemer
All of this infrastructure could be out of commission in a century .
Nearly all the infrastructure in Dubai could be underwater by 2100 .
[ social_buttons ]
Up to 85 % of the population and 90 % of the infrastructure of coastal zones throughout the UAE is at risk from climate change , a new study by researchers from the Stockholm Environment Institute finds in : “ Climate Change – Impacts , Vulnerability and Adaptation in UAE . ”
Despite uncertainty about to what extent , some degree of global warming is already happening and will only continue , resulting in an unavoidable increase in sea levels .
How much that will be is uncertain .
The uncertainty comes from not being able to predict whether and how fast and how effectively political actions will be taken to reduce greenhouse gases .
There is no uncertainty about the science of climate change itself .
The very best case scenario had originally seen a one or two foot rise , which it is almost impossible to achieve now .
Now , higher rises and worse case scenarios are more likely .
We can now only control how much worse those scenarios are .
The speed of implementing renewable energy to replace fossil energy depends on legislation at the global level and national level , especially in China , India and the US where the climate bill is due to be voted on in the US Senate .
But time is running out , with most scientists seeing a tipping point by 2017 .
Even a rise of ten feet ( three metres ) would see Abu Dhabi lose more than 800 sq km under water , and Dubai would lose important infrastructure as well , the report said .
But once sea levels rise thirty feet ( nine metres ) , all of the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi and the city of Dubai would be entirely submerged .
That could happen as soon as 2100 , ( and almost certainly by 2200 or 2300 ) , making the city ’s elaborate infrastructure probably the shortest - lived in human history .
Unlike Venice , which was built in the middle ages , modern cities have key electrical infrastructure at ground level and below , making it almost impossible to inhabit a modern city with skyscrapers submerged up to the first or second floor .

Ted Nestor 's WWII diary is full of cartoons , diagrams and stories of his time in Stalag Luft III .
The airman drew a map showing where he was shot down in Germany , his route to the camp in Poland and his journey home after release .
Ted was billeted next to the hut used by 77 British and American officers who dug an escape tunnel , made famous by the film the Great Escape .
He drew a diagram of their escape plan , which he referred to as the Spring Handicap .
Ted 's diary also displays a rich sense of humour , capturing what life was like as a prisoner of war .
His sketches show how his fellow " Kriegies " survived and how they dreamed of and plotted their escape .
One of the key ingredients to their survival was " Kriegie brew " - alcohol distilled from raisins taken from prisoners ' Red Cross parcels .
One of Ted 's sketches shows the great care and effort that went into its creation .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT Coded plans for " The Great Escape " have been found in the diary of a World War II airman from Greater Manchester .
Ted Nestor was a prisoner of war ( POW ) at the camp where 77 Allied officers managed to dig a tunnel and escape .
His journal includes stories of camp life , cartoons and even a coded reference to the mass breakout .
Now , 20 years after his death , his daughter Sharon Cottam has visited Stalag Luft III in Poland and learned that her father was a war hero .
Audio slideshow of Flt Lt Nestor 's diary " My dad never talked about anything to do with the war when I was younger , " said Ms Cottam , from Stockport .
" But I remember as a child picking up dad 's diary and being fascinated by all these little drawings of planes and little stick figures and at that time , I did n't realise the significance of what my dad had done in the war . "
With the help of BBC Inside Out North West , she embarked on an emotional journey to find out what her father did in the war .
On the night of 28 August 1943 , Flt Lt Ted Nestor was on an RAF raid to bomb Nuremberg when the Stirling bomber he was navigating was shot down .
Despite suffering severe burns , he parachuted to safety but was soon captured and taken to Stalag Luft III , the POW camp made famous in the film The Great Escape .
Flt Lt Nestor was billeted in the hut next to the one where 77 British and other Allied officers worked secretly to dig a tunnel under the perimeter fence .
' The Spring Handicap ' " Dad talked about the escape in his diary but , obviously he wrote about it in code , " explained Ms Cottam .
" He called it the start of " The Spring Handicap " and said there were " 100 under starters ' orders . "
" Sadly , of the 77 who actually escaped , 50 were shot , " she added .
I just wish I could have taken dad back to camp , or just to sit and talk to him now and say just how incredibly proud I am of him
Sharon Cottam
" They cremated the bodies and brought the ashes back to camp and dad talks about that in his diary .
" You can tell it was a very sad time for all those who knew them . "
There are lighter moments in the war diary , which is infused with a rich vein of humour and a sense of British " stiff upper lip " .
The diary gives a colourful account of camp life including the bartering system called " Foodacco " and plays performed by his fellow " Kriegies " to entertain themselves .
He also kept meticulous records of the bitter cold they experienced in the Polish winter .
And he documented the effects of " Kriegie brew ' " - a potent alcohol distilled from raisins taken from their Red Cross parcels ( " Hell of a good Kriegie brew - passed out at 10.30 pm " ) .
Even the entry about his own capture by German troops is titled , " For You The War is Over ! "
As part of the programme , Ms Cottam was taken to meet the last surviving member of her father 's flight crew .
Howard Bailey - also known as Bill - was the crew 's wireless operator and told her that , instead of quickly jumping to safety , Flt Lt Nestor went back to hand the pilot his parachute as he struggled with the controls .
" This whole journey for me , meeting up with Bill and going over to Poland , has absolutely brought dad 's diary to life , " said Ms Cottam .
" He saved somebody 's life .
I just wish I could have taken dad back to camp , or just to sit and talk to him now and say just how incredibly proud I am of him . "
The story of Ted Nestor 's War Diary is shown in two parts on Inside Out North West on BBC One at 1930 GMT on Monday 23 and 30 November 2009 .

A ST KILDA man purporting to be a ' ' North American Indian shaman healer ' ' with the power to cure cancer has failed in a Supreme Court bid to stop the Health Services Commissioner naming him in a report to State Parliament .
Commissioner Beth Wilson warned Shamir Narra Avorham Djuwani Kiefa Israel Marlon Wati Dakota Jessie Malakhi - Zion - Angel - Shalom - who was born Peter Marlon de Angelis - of her intention to name him because he had falsely represented himself as a shaman healer and had breached professional boundaries by initiating sexual relationships with female clients .
Named ... Shamir Shalom .
Credit : Justin McManus
Ms Wilson said he had not complied with her requests to cease acting as a healer and that naming him was necessary to warn vulnerable members of the public about him .
In March last year Mr Shalom , 52 , '' pressed on chakra points to remove toxins ' ' from one of his clients , '' Mr C ' ' and in June did a ' ' tantric dance ' ' ending with his belly touching the belly of '' Ms E '' - telling both of them he could cure cancer .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- A Californian company , SolarReserve , is developing a solar power system that can store seven hours ' worth of solar energy by focusing mirrors onto millions of gallons of molten salt , allowing the plant to provide electricity 24 hours a day .
The company has applied to regulators in California for permission to build the 150 - megawatt Rice Solar Energy Project solar farm near the abandoned town of Rice in San Bernadino County , California .
The solar energy is stored using a massive circular array of up to 17,500 mirrors ( heliostats ) , each measuring 24 by 28 feet and attached to a 12 - foot pedestal .
The heliostat field encircles a concrete Solar Power Tower 538 feet high , with a 100 - foot high receiver on top , which holds 4.4 million gallons of molten salt .
When the heliostats focus the sunlight onto the receiver the salt is heated to over 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit .
When it is needed , such as at night or at peak times , the heat is released by passing the molten salt through a steam generator that drives a turbine to produce electricity .
The cooled salt is then recirculated to the receiver for re-heating .
The project brings the dream of a solar system that generates electricity in the dark to a reality , and avoids the need to use fossil fuel plants for backup electricity generation .
A diagram of the SolarReserve process .
The salt used is a mixture of sodium and potassium nitrate ( the same as that used in fertilizers ) , which is cheap , reliable , and environmentally friendly .
It will be mixed on site with no additives .
Apart from a few unique components such as the high heat flux hardware in the tower , the system uses existing technologies such as turbines and steam generators .
This means SolarReserve can produce electricity at prices equivalent to or below fossil fuel burning plants .
The system was proven over a four - year period in the 1990s at the 10 - megawatt Solar Two demonstration project near Barstow in California .
The solar salt technology was originally developed by Rocketdyne , a subsidiary of United Technologies , and many of SolarReserve 's scientists are former employees of Rocketdyne .
United Technologies has licensed the system to SolarReserve and guarantees its performance .
Chief Executive at SolarReserve , Kevin Smith , said other solar systems also use salt as storage , but they use synthetic oil in the steam generation .
Using salt for both means the system is more efficient , since it can produce steam at higher temperatures and can harvest three times as much energy for the same amount of salt .
The Rice Solar Energy Project solar farm will be constructed on now privately - owned land that used to belong to a World War II Army air base to the east of Palm Springs .
The system will be air cooled , thus avoiding criticisms about water use , but its height , at 653 feet ( with a maintenance crane on top ) , could spark other criticisms , as did a previously proposed SolarReserve project in Nevada .
SolarReserve expects the solar farm to go online late in 2013 , and is in negotiations with utility companies in California to buy the generated electricity .

newsflash : you are not god
This blog 's creationist readers appear to need a reminder the criticizing their statements is not the same thing as disagreeing with a deity .
Over the last week , I got a good share of feedback from creationists and religious zealots that centers around their tried and true criticism of atheists and scientifically minded skeptics .
Why do we spend so much time on fighting something we do n’t even believe exists in the first place ?
Why even bother arguing with nothing more than a phantom ?
The people who ask this questions seem to exude the kind of confidence you expect from a general who just surrounded your forces and can taste his victory cigar as he awaits for you to capitulate your position as null and void .
But there ’s a problem with their arguments .
They seem to have forgotten that we ’re criticizing them and their methods , and last time I checked , none of them were fully fledged , certified deities .
The whole concept is actually pretty amazing .
After saying something we know to be wrong , or using a circular argument spiced up with appeals to emotion or theological platitudes that have nothing to do with the facts in question , they find themselves on the receiving end of a critique and ask how we dare deny God .
Note how finding a zealot ’s mistake suddenly morphs into blasphemy and by finding the arguments insufficient , we ’re in fact on a warpath against God himself .
And that means either of two things happened .
Either the creator of the universe descended to the comment section of our blogs and articles and decided to narrate an authoritative response to our ideas , or someone caught making terrible arguments is using the specter of his or her deity as a shield against criticism and a justification for ignorance .
Which seems more likely here ?
That the supernatural entity in charge of everything in existence is so vain , he has a universal Google alert to know every time someone might be badmouthing him and hordes of humans to use for arguing with skeptics , or there are a lot of very passionate people with very strong opinions about a whole range of topics they do n’t understand because do n’t care to understand them ?
Here ’s a good example of the latter in action from a certain Cindy LeSieur …
I ’d like to know why creationism is so wrong to you and scientific facts appear to you to be so right .
I had ’ science ’ pushed down my throat as a kid , as well as black history , and then my parents took me to church …
I would just like the people who do n’t agree with what I believe to just shut up , and leave my beliefs alone , and what i want to teach my children , without interfering with their science hocus pocus .
That comment was so passionate , it was left on a post that had nothing to do with creationism or science .
It ’s actually not even a comment .
It ’s a mandate to shut up , let her believe whatever she wants and be allowed to spread her beliefs without having to be questioned on her rationale .
Crank this attitude up another notch , and we get the invocations of God and accusations of denying the world of the deity .
It ’s incredibly self - serving and if there really is a God out there , incredibly disrespectful to him to shield yourself from criticism by invoking his name .
You are not God .
You do n’t get to invoke his name when we take issue with your statements and claim divine privilege and infallibility .
Those who do seem to have forgotten the role they advocate for humanity in the grand scope of things , the role of humble , fallible , imperfect servants who err by virtue of being only human .

CLEVELAND , Ohio -- Images of a South Vietnamese village being burned and dozens of its civilian residents left dead ran exclusively in The Plain Dealer on Nov. 20,1969 .
The photographs brought world attention to the My Lai massacre .
They were taken by Ronald Haeberle , a U.S. Army sergeant and public information staffer , who witnessed the killings by U.S. soldiers in March of 1968 while on a military assignment with them .
Haeberle 's photos eventually were used by the Army to investigate the event .
The Plain Dealer chose to publish these photos against the urging of the U.S. Army .
In an interview with Plain Dealer reporter Joseph Eszterhas in November 1969 , Haeberle described what he witnessed as a military combat photographer .
Below is Haeberle 's published account of what happened in My Lai .
The ( above ) photograph will shock Americans as it shocked the editors and the staff of The Plain Dealer .
It was taken by a young Cleveland area man while serving as a photographer with the U.S. Army in South Vietnam .
It was taken during the attack by American soldiers on the South Vietnamese village of My Lai , an attack which has made world headlines in recent days with disclosures of mass killings allegedly at the hands of American soldiers .
This photograph and others on two special pages are the first to be published anywhere of the killings .
The above picture shows a clump of bodies of South Vietnamese civilians which includes women and children .
Why they were killed raises one of the most momentous questions of the war in Vietnam .
Cameraman Saw GIs Slay 100 Villagers
By JOSEPH ESZTERHAS
( c ) 1969 , The Plain Dealer
U.S. Army troops " indiscriminately and wantonly mowed down " civilian residents of a tiny South Vietnamese hamlet on March 16 , 1968 , a former Army photographer has told The Plain Dealer .
Along with his eye - witness account , the former photographer has made available to The Plain Dealer a set of photographs taken at the village .
They are being reproduced today on two pages of The Plain Dealer .
This is the first publication of the photos , which also are in the hands of U.S. Army authorities investigating the sensational accounts of the village deaths .
RONALD L. HAEBERLE , 28 , of Cleveland , then a sergeant and an Army public information staff member , was attached to C Company , 1st Battalion , 20th Infantry Regiment , 11th Light Infantry Brigade when the troops entered the hamlet of My Lai No. 4 .
In an exclusive Plain Dealer interview , Haeberle described how U.S. soldiers " recklessly , wantonly and without any provocation " carried out the mass murder of South Vietnamese civilians .
In August of this year , Haeberle provided the Army 's Criminal Investigation Department ( CID ) , an arm of the Army Security Agency , with prints of the exclusive pictures he shot in the village during the operation and gave investigators a six - page statement .
Since then , 1st Lt. William L. Calley Jr. , 26 , of Miami , Fla. , and Staff Sgt. David Mitchell , 29 , of St. Francisville , La. , have been charged in the case - Calley with murder and Mitchell with assault with intent to murder .
On Tuesday Capt .
Aubrey Daniel , a lawyer with the adjutant general 's office at Ft. Benning , Ga. , confirmed to The Plain Dealer that Haeberle was present in the hamlet as an Army photographer March 16 , 1968 .
The mission that Haeberle witnessed and photographed with C Company in the little " Pinkville " village was his last mission in Vietnam .
He was honorably discharged at the end of that same March .
Haeberle said U.S. forces did not engage in a firefight with Viet Cong while in the village .
No Viet Cong were sighted ; there were no reports of Viet Cong fire , he said .
U. S. FORCES , he related , mechanically killed the civilians , some in their bed in huts .
The murders were carried out , he said , with M16 rifles and machine guns .
He said he saw as many as 30 American soldiers murder as many as 100 South Vietnamese civilians , many of them women and babies , many left in lifeless clumps .
The only U.S. casualty he saw was a soldier who shot himself in the foot accidentally .
Afterwards , he said he heard the soldier shot himself purposefully .
" He could n't stand what was going on and wanted out of there , " Haeberle said .
He told his story firmly , without emotion , recounting scenes vividly .
" I was shocked .
I 've never been able to forget what I saw there , " he said .
HE DESCRIBED HIMSELF as " just an average American with an upper middle - class background who was drafted . "
He said he is not against the war in Vietnam but was appalled by the kind of brutality he witnessed .
" I never saw U.S. GIs act like that before , " he said .
He describes the soldiers who did the shooting as " intent on what they were trying to accomplish .
There was no feeling , nothing human about it .
It was , for the most part , grim , though later some of the men tried to be humorous about leaving the bodies for the dogs and the rats . "
He emphasized he does not know whether the men were ordered to kill the civilians .
" All I know is that I saw it happening and I had a camera with me . "
He said he made no effort , as an Army person , to photograph actual killings .
His description : " At about 5:30 in the morning of March 16 , I left where I was stationed , Duc Pho , by helicopter for Task Force Barker .
That is an outlying area for the base camp .
I was supposed to hook up here with C Company .
I hooked up with C Company 6 or 6:30 - I 'm not sure - around sunrise .
" No one really explained the mission , but from what I heard from the men , it was suspected that these villagers were Viet Cong sympathizers and it was thought there Viet Cong there .
" I came in on the second lift ; which came about a half hour after the first .
We landed in the rice paddies and I heard gunfire from the village itself , but we were still on the outside of the village .
" There were some South Vietnamese people , maybe 15 of them , women and children included ; walking on a dirt road maybe 100 yards away .
All of a sudden the GIs just opened up with M16's .
Besides the M16 fire , they were shooting at the people with M79 grenade launchers .
I could n't believe what I was seeing .
" Off to the right , I noticed a woman appeared from some cover and this one GI fired first at her , then they all started shooting at her , aiming at her head .
The bones were flying in the air chip by chip .
I 'd never seen American shoot civilians like that .
" As they moved in , closer to the village , they just kept shooting at people .
I remember this man distincly , holding a small child in one arm and another child in the other , walking toward us .
They saw us and were pleading .
The little girl was saying " No , no " in English .
Then all a sudden a burst of fire and they were cut down .
They were about 20 feet away .
One machine gunner did it .
He 'd opened up .
" There was no reaction on the guy doing the shooting .
That 's the part that really got me - this little girl pleading and they were just cut down .
" I had been on the ground maybe 45 minutes at this point .
Off to the left , a group of people - women , children , and babies - were standing around .
The machine gunner was standing in front of them with the ammo bearer and all of a sudden I heard this fire and here the machine gunner had opened up on all these people in the big circle , and they were trying to run .
I do n't know how many got out .
" There were two small children , a very young boy and a smaller boy , maybe 4 or 5 years old .
A guy with an M16 fired at them , at the first boy , and the older boy fell over to protect the smaller boy .
The GI fired some more shots with a tracer and the tip somehow seemed to be still burning the boy 's flesh .
Then they fired six more shots and just let them lie .
" The GIs found a group of people - mothers , children , and their daughters .
This GI grabbed one of the girls , in her teens , and started stripping her , playing around .
They said they wanted to see what she was made of and stuff like that .
" I remember they were keeping the mother away from protecting her daughter - she must have been around 13 - by kicking the mother in the rear and slapping her around .
" They were getting ready to shoot these people and I said hold it - I wanted to take a picture .
They were pleading for their lives .
The looks on their faces , the mothers were crying , they were trembling .
" I turned my back because I could n't look .
They opened up with two M16's .
On automatic fire , they went through the whole clip -- 35 , 40 shots - and I remember actually seeing the smoke come from the rifle .
The automatic weapons fire cut them down .
" I could n't take a picture of it , it was too much .
One minute you see people alive and the next minute they 're dead .
" I came up to a clump of bodies and I saw this small child .
Part of his foot had been shot off , and he went up to this pile of bodies and just looked at it , like he was looking for somebody .
A GI knelt down beside me and shot the little kid .
His body flew backwards into the pile .
" I had emotional feelings .
I felt nauseated to see people treated this way .
American
GIs were supposed to be protecting people and rehabilitating them and I had seen that .
But this was incredible .
I watched it and it would n't sink in .
" I left the village around 11 o'clock that morning .
I saw clumps of bodies , and I must have seen as many as a hundred killed .
It was done very businesslike . "
Haeberle said he later saw a news story of C Company 's operation in the tiny hamlet listing a large number of Viet Cong killed .
" There were no Viet Cong , " he said .
" They were just poor , innocent illiterate peasants . "

Robert Johnson can make all Alabamans proud ; Bill Johnson is another sleazy Republican bottom feeder
Just ask Alabama attorney Jill Simpson , a former Republican operative who revealed a GOP conspiracy to initiate a political prosecution against former Democratic Governor Don Siegelman .
In the weeks and months after her revelations , Simpson experienced a mysterious house fire and saw her vehicle run off the road .
I 've called the GOP tactics financial terrorism .
And I 've experienced them personally .
I 've received more threatening anonymous comments on my blog than I can count .
And they have not been idle threats .
After a February 2008 post about connections between U.S. Attorney Alice Martin and Alabama GOP political consultant Dax Swatek , we received an anonymous comment : " Nut case , yours is comong ( sic ) . "
After an April 2008 post , we received an anonymous comment claiming that I was blogging at work , and my employer , UAB , needed to be notified .
On the date in question , I was taking a vacation day , so I was not blogging at work -- then or any other time .
Roughly a month later , I was fired at UAB , after 19 years on the job , amid vague allegations that I was blogging at work .
For the record , UAB 's own IT expert testified at my grievance hearing that those allegations were not true .
But did someone with GOP political ties get in the ears of UAB leaders and pressure them to unlawfully fire me ?
Sure looks that way .
And evidence suggests it was all because I was writing a blog that was critical of the Bush Justice Department and it's handling of various political prosecutions , including the Siegelman case .
Before you start getting all sentimental about Bill Johnson , one of the Republican hopefuls for the party 's Alabama gubernatorial nomination , let me remind you that he 's a right - wing extremist who thinks any woman who gets an abortion should serve time in prison ( as should the doctor who performs the constitutionally protected procedure ) .
The other 6 Republicans in the race also are fanatically anti-choice and the two Democrats -- Ron Sparks and Artur Davis -- wo n't say how they feel about it .
Johnson goes further than some of the other Republicans by calling for a constitutional amendment that prohibits abortion even if it means life or death for the mother or the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest , which is a far bigger problem in Alabama than in most states .
Get the picture ?
Johnson , a former member of Governor Bob Riley 's cabinet -- he headed the Department of Economic and Community Affairs for the past six years -- blew the whistle on Riley for being in cahoots with Jack Abramoff and accepted $ 13 million in bribes and payoffs from the Choctaw Indians , Now that this is touching the entire GOP leadership in Alabama , Johnson has been getting a series of death threats Yesterday , Alabama blog Legal Schnauzer gives the threats a look over in the murky context of Alabama Republican politics and finds the whole thing pretty par for the course .
If I can't quite get all that sympathetic for someone who feels a woman raped and impregnated by her grandpa needs to carry the pregnancy to term , Jill Simpson says she is very worried for Johnson .
" He bravely spoke out about Alabama Republican corruption and now has received a death threat .
I know what that is like .
It is my belief that the DOJ should give him and others protection from this gang of thugs , but as of yet , have not done so ...
I take the threat to him very seriously and hope law enforcement does as well .
I once was proud to be a Republican , but these actions sadden me .
Then again , you only have to look at the current leadership to understand these are thugs , not Republicans . "
There must be some fine point I 'm missing in that distinction !

The parents of a teenage girl who committed suicide last year are suing the girl 's ex-boyfriend and several other former high school classmates who circulated a nude photo of her and harassed her about the image .
The suit was filed in Ohio by Cynthia and Albert Logan who say that the students ' " degrading sexual insults " caused their 18 - year - old daughter Jessica , their only child , severe emotional distress , which led her to kill herself in July 2008 , a month after graduating from high school .
The suit names Ryan Salyers , Sara Jane Ramsey , Courtney Richardson and Emily Stachler , as well as a minor identified only as A.R. for severe infliction of emotional distress .
Salyers is further accused of invading Jessica 's privacy .
It also names the Sycamore Community Schools Board of Education and Montgomery police officer Paul Payne for being negligent in not ending the " severe , pervasive , and objectively offensive harassment " of their daughter and for violating her 14th Amendment rights of equal protection and due process of law .
It names the Montgomery municipality for failing to ensure that Payne would take steps to halt the harassment .
The suit seeks unspecified damages and aims to force the school district to amend its policies and procedures for responding to harassment claims .
According to the complaint ( .pdf ) , toward the end of her senior year , Jessica sent a digital photo of herself to her boyfriend , Ryan Salyers , which showed her in the nude from her neck down .
Shortly thereafter , the two broke up , and Salyers allegedly showed the photo to a handful of other students who in turn distributed it widely throughout Sycamore High School and Loveland High School .
On May 5 , Jessica reported the incident to school authorities in the hope of preventing students from sharing the image further and forcing students to delete the image from their phones .
The school referred her to police officer Paul Payne , who was assigned to the school as its resource officer .
Payne told her he could ask students to delete the image but could do nothing beyond this , since she was 18 .
In a previous sexting incident at the school involving a minor , Payne had opened a criminal investigation and spoken with the parents of the students distributing the image .
Payne encouraged Jessica to consent to an interview with a local television reporter doing a story on " sexting . "
Jessica appeared on the program anonymously to talk about the harassment she faced as a result of the picture .
Her face was blurred and her voice altered , but students knew it was her .
When students discovered that Jessica had reported them to school authorities , they allegedly escalated their harassment , calling her a " whore , " " slut " and " skank . "
They also made harassing calls to her phone and sent her derogatory text messages , according to the complaint .
Though it was close to the end of the school year , Jessica 's parents say her grades and attendance suffered .
She stopped going to school , and administrators threatened to bar her from graduating .
Her mother , Cynthia , told NBC earlier this year that she had no idea their daughter was being harassed until she started receiving daily letters from the school about her daughter 's truancy .
Logan told NBC that she had gone to at least six lawyers with the aim of suing the school .
Her parents say that because the school failed to stop the harassment , Jessica was denied her education .
Jessica managed to complete her coursework and on June 1 graduated from Sycamore High School .
But the harassment did n't end .
Students bombarded her with objects during the graduation ceremony and at an after party , and continued to harass her by phone and online .
On July 3 , she attended a funeral for a close friend who had committed suicide , and that evening she hanged herself in her bedroom .

A police officer who used a stun gun on an unruly 10 - year - old girl after he said her mother gave him permission has been suspended not for using the weapon but for not having a video camera attached when he used it .
Ozark mayor Vernon McDaniel said officer Dustin Bradshaw was suspended today for seven days with pay for not following department procedures , because he did n't have the camera on .
McDaniel wants Arkansas state police or the FBI to look into whether the use of the Taser was proper .
The girl , who has n't been identified , was n't injured and is now at youth shelter .
Police were called to the home on 11 November after the girl 's mother could n't get her to take a shower .
Bradshaw 's report says the girl was " violently kicking and verbally combative " when Bradshaw tried to take her into custody , and she kicked him in the groin .
He said he delivered " a very brief drive stun to her back " .
" Her mother told me to tase her if I needed to , " Bradshaw wrote .
Police chief Jim Noggle said today that Taser stun guns are a safe way to subdue people who are a danger to themselves or others .
" We did n't use the Taser to punish the child just to bring the child under control so she would n't hurt herself or somebody else , " Noggle said , referring to the stun gun 's brand .
If the officer tried to forcefully put the girl in handcuffs , he could have accidentally broken her arm or leg , Noggle said .
Noggle said the girl will face disorderly conduct charges as a juvenile in the incident .
The girl 's father , Anthony Medlock , told the Arkansas Democrat - Gazette that his daughter has emotional problems , but that she did n't have a weapon and should n't have been stunned .
" My daughter does not deserve to be tased and be treated like an animal , " said Medlock , who is divorced from the girl 's mother and does not have custody .

It ’s no secret ...
Studies have shown that excessive mouse usage can cause repetitive stress injuries .
Unfortunately for most of us , “ excessive ” can mean anything more than a few hours a day .
Fortunately , however , there are alternative styles of mice out there designed to be easier on the hands and arms .
One of the more interesting ones to come along in a while is the AirMouse , made by Canadian firm Deanmark Ltd .
What makes it unique is the fact that you wear it like a glove .
Deanmark founders Mark Bajramovic and Oren Tessler met in university , where Mark learned first - hand ( no pun intended ) what it ’s like to OD on mousing .
“ Half way through our first year , I developed a computer mouse related RSI ( Repetitive Stress Injury ) and lost the use of my right hand and arm for several weeks , ” he tells us .
“ Numbness , pain , most things that you hear about with RSI ’s , I had it . ”
Later that semester , Mark and Oren heard about an ergonomic mouse being marketed in Europe .
While they thought that particular product was n’t perfect , it got them thinking about designing their own .
The AirMouse is the result .
The wireless mouse utilizes an optical laser , and can run for a week without recharging .
According to the company website , the clinically - tested product works by aligning itself with the ligaments of your hand and wrist .
This lets you keep your hand in a neutral position , and transmits more of your vector force than would be possible with a regular mouse .
Not only does this make it easier on your hand , but it increases your mousing speed and accuracy as well .
The mouse is also designed to remain inactive until your hand is placed in a neutral , flat position , so you can easily go back and forth between typing and mousing .
Other ergonomic designs have strayed from the AirMouse ’s style of traditional flat , one - dimensional mousing , but Mark and Oren ’s market research indicated that consumers tend to reject such products .
The AirMouse should be available for purchase within the next 6 to 12 months , at a price of $ US129 .

NLTK Regular Expression Parser ( RegexpParser )
The Natural Language Toolkit ( NLTK ) provides a variety of tools for dealing with natural language .
One such tool is the Regular Expression Parser .
If you ’re familiar with regular expressions , it can be a useful tool in natural language processing .
Background Information
You must first be familiar with regular expressions to be able to fully utilize the RegexpParser / RegexpChunkParser .
If you need to learn about regular expressions , here is a site with an abundance of information to get you started : http://www.regular-expressions.info.
It is also necessary to know how to use a tagger , and what the tags mean .
A tagger is a tool that marks each word in a sentence with its part of speech .
Here is a small comparison I did of python taggers : NLTK vs MontyLingua Part of Speech Taggers .
The NLTK RegexpParser works by running regular expressions on top of the part of speech tags added by a tagger .
The Brown Corpus tags will be the tags used throughout the rest of this post , and are commonly used by taggers in general .
On a side note , the RegexpParser can be used with either the NLTK or MontyLingua tagger .
Basic RegexpParser Usage
Let me start by going over the “ how to ” provided in the NLTK documentation .
The source of this information is here : NLTK RegexParser HowTo .
The documentation goes through how you could use the RegexParser / RegexpChunkParser to do a traditional parse of a sentence .
The RegexParser / RegexChunkParser works by defining rules for grouping different words together .
A simple example would be : “ NP : {< DT >? < JJ >* < NN >*} ” .
This is a definition for a rule to group of words into a noun phrase .
It will group one determinant ( usually an article ) , then zero or more adjectives followed by zero or more nouns .
In the how to , they go over prepositions and creating prepositional phrases from a preposition and noun phrase .
It ’s important to note that earlier regular expressions can be used in later ones .
Also , the regular expression syntax can occur within the tags or apply to the tags themselves .
Here is the example from the NLTK website :
parser = RegexpParser ( ''' NP : {< DT >? < JJ >* < NN>*} # NP P : {< IN>} # Preposition V : {< V.*>} # Verb PP : {< P> < NP >} # PP ->
P NP VP : {< V > < NP|PP >*} # VP -> V ( NP|PP ) * ''' ) parser = RegexpParser (''' NP : {< DT >? < JJ >* < NN>*} # NP P : {< IN>} # Preposition V : {< V.*>} # Verb PP : {< P> < NP >} # PP ->
P NP VP : {< V > < NP|PP >*} # VP -> V ( NP|PP ) * ''')
Alternative RegexpParser Usage
I call this an alternate usage because it can be used to find patterns that are n’t necessarily related to grammatical phrases in English .
It can be used to find any pattern in a sentence .
Let me start by showing the regular expression grammar from my program .
grammar = " " " NP : {< PRP >?< JJ.*>*< NN .*>+} CP : {< JJR|JJS >} VERB : {< VB .*>} THAN : {< IN>} COMP : {< DT >?< NP >< RB >?< VERB><DT >?< CP>< THAN >< DT >?< NP>} " " " self .
chunker = RegexpParser ( grammar ) grammar = " " " NP : {< PRP >?< JJ.*>*< NN .*>+} CP : {< JJR|JJS >} VERB : {< VB .*>} THAN : {< IN>} COMP : {< DT >?< NP >< RB >?< VERB><DT >?< CP>< THAN >< DT >?< NP>} " " " self.
chunker = RegexpParser ( grammar )
I was using it to look for a specific pattern in a sentence .
The first part , NP , is looking for a noun phrase .
The < PRP >?
is there because of a bug found in the tagger I was using .
It was marking An with a capital ‘ A ’ as a PRP ( Pronoun ) rather than a DT ( Determinant / Article ) .
I found another workaround for the bug , but left the PRP in there to catch anything that might have slipped through .
Then it moves onto the CP , which is the comparison word .
JJR tagged words are comparative adjectives .
They include words bigger , smaller , and larger .
JJS words are words that signify the most or chief .
JJS words include biggest , smallest , and largest .
The next two a simply the VERB and the word THAN .
The VERB could be a compound verb , so there would be one or more verbs present .
The IN tag denotes a preposition .
In this case , I was looking specifically for the word than .
The last line is COMP .
This is the regular expression that puts it all together .
This was looking for a size comparison of two objects .
It might be easier to look at the output of this part of the expression than trying to explain it piece by piece .
The only tag not explained above is RB , which is an adverb .
Here is the parse for the sentence “ Everyone knows an elephant is larger than a dog . ” :
( S ( NP everyone / NN ) ( VERB knows / VBZ ) ( COMP an / DT ( NP elephant / NN ) ( VERB is / VBZ ) ( CP larger / JJR ) ( THAN than / IN ) a / DT ( NP dog / NN ) ) ./.)
The output is a simple tree , that makes to easy data extraction .
It ’s easy to see there are many possibilities that open up when looking for patterns in English text .
May this help you in your data mining endeavors .
It ’s been one hell of a week for all of us .
I ’m exhausted and I need a nap .
I do have a question , though .
And it is only a question , so simma down , Internet .
The question is this :
Is Google making search too complex and moving in the wrong direction with things like default personalization and real - time updates ?
Or , is it simply keeping itself one step ahead of users and their needs ?
I think it ’s a fine line .
I thought maybe we ’d look at a few things .
The Simple , Intuitive Google
Google ’s cycled through a few mission statements over the years .
First we had the “ do n’t be evil ” mantra that was doomed to fail from the start ( business is evil ) .
Then Google was going to “ organize the world ’s information ” .
It sounded good but it got kind of muddled .
For me , through it all , Google was about ease of use .
It was easier to find what you were looking for on Google because the algorithm was better .
It was easier to search because the interface was simpler and more scaled down ( as opposed to , say , Yahoo ) .
It was easier to be a business owner because Google had these free products that kicked ass .
Google was about taking the strain off doing whatever it was you wanted to do .
That ’s what I liked .
Back in October , Vice President of Technology for Core Search Udi Manber was interviewed by Business Week and discussed how search is about people , not just data .
The interview focused on how Google was improving search for users , the methods they would employ to do that and how search has changed over the past 20 years .
It was actually a pretty revealing interview .
Here ’s a question I lifted .
[ Emphasis mine ]
Q : How important is the user interface for search today vs. a few years ago ?
… One conflict I run against is that people want simplicity .
But to have really powerful interfaces , you have to have some complexity .
So how do you introduce complexity in such a way that you do n’t keep people out of that ?
It has to be optional .
And it has to be something you run into slowly or can get it intuitively .
That pretty much nailed it for me .
To be successful , your interface has to be simple , it must be intuitive , and when it ’s not you have to give people an easy way to get out .
Google Goes on the Announcement Warpath
We ’ve seen a lot of announcements from Google over the past seven days .
The ones that most caught my eye are listed below :
With the exception of mobile , none of these new additions are simple .
None of them allow me to easily opt out .
They ’re all in my face and they ’re not intuitive .
As a searcher , they give me more to worry about and to consider .
Not less .
So …the question
As search gets more complicated , as I trust the information they ’re giving me less – are we going backwards ?
It feels a little like we are .
Over at Search Engine Land yesterday , Danny commented that Google ’s “ instant add ” feature was effectively going back to the InfoSeek days of 1997 .
Instead of figuring out a way to make real - time search valuable , they just threw the whole mess into the search results and left it for us to figure out .
I want a simpler Google .
Today ’s Google is n’t better .
It ’s an example of Web design hell .
[ I love you , Matt Inman ]
Give people options .
Give them lots and lots of options – but let them get out of those options .
As Udi stated backed in October , complexity needs to be optional .
Personalized search should be an option .
Search has not been made simpler because the sites I prefer are ranking closer to the top .
It just makes search more biased .
Can you opt out ?
Yes .
But if the majority of searchers can’t define a browser , they wo n’t even realize something ’s changed .
Ignorance does n’t equal a good experience .
Also , in case you forgot Google sucks at intent .
Google also sucks at not associating kids and adult behavior .
I ’d rather them be as hands off as possible with my results .
Real - time search is a great option for people who want an unfiltered window into the mind of the Internet .
I ’m not one of those people and right now it ’s a mess that does nothing but put a live feed of rotating crap blogs , news and Twitter updates directly in my face .
Why do it ?
In the same interview linked to above , Udi says that if you want to follow someone on Twitter , you should follow them on Twitter .
They do n’t need to bring that into the SERPs .
He ’s right .
So stop .
Until you find a way to make real - time search useful , do n’t force it on me .
There ’s a point where throwing stuff out to see what “ sticks ” is a great way to test things and see what users respond to .
There ’s also a point where you throw so much in their face that the complexity scares them away or turns them off .
For me Google ’s walking that line .
Do I have any interest in a SERP that “ pops ” with rotating information and flashy scrolls ?
No . I really do n’t .
Are you adding the midis next ?
I want a search that ’s simple , one that ’s intuitive and a userface that makes things easier .
Google used to be that .
Sarindi arrived at the annual migration from Arctic Russia with a new partner Experts have told of their surprise after witnessing a rare " divorce " between a pair of swans at a Gloucestershire wildfowl sanctuary .
The Bewick 's swans have returned to winter at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust centre at Slimbridge - but both have brought new partners .
It is only the second time in more than 40 years that a " separation " has been recorded at the centre .
Staff have described the new couplings as " bizarre " .
It is not unheard of for the birds , which usually mate for life , to find a new mate but it tends to be because one of the pair has died , they said .
During the past four decades 4,000 pairs of Bewick 's swans have been studied at Slimbridge , with only one previous couple moving on to find new partners .
Normally loyal
First suspicions of the rare event were raised when male swan Sarindi turned up in the annual migration from Arctic Russia without his partner of two years Saruni and with a new female - newly - named Sarind - in tow .
The pair 's arrival led conservationists to fear the worst for Saruni .
But shortly afterwards Saruni arrived at the wetlands site - also with a new mate , Surune .
And after observing them , the experts discovered the old relationship had ended and new ones had begun .
Failure to breed could be a possible reason , as they had been together for a couple of years but had never brought back a cygnet
Julia Newth
Wildlife health research officer Julia Newth , wildlife health research officer at Slimbridge , said the situation had taken staff by surprise .
She said swans tended to have " real loyalties to one another " and long partnerships .
" As long as they are both still alive , they will try to stay together .
If they have a change of mate it is perhaps because of mortality , not necessarily through choice , " she said .
In this case , however , both swans and their new partners are now over - wintering in close proximity on the lake at Slimbridge .
Ms Newth said the old pair had not acknowledged each other with any signs of recognition or greeting - even though they are occupying the same part of the small lake .
As for why they may have split , she said : " Failure to breed could be a possible reason , as they had been together for a couple of years but had never brought back a cygnet , but it is difficult to say for sure . "
Bewick 's swans are the smallest and rarest of the three species found in the UK and each individual can be identified by their unique bill pattern .

The design is one of many used by the Kerusso company that parodies logos of popular products and television shows .

 Christian stores have just the Christmas gift for Facebook fans : A " Jesus Christ wants to be your friend " T - shirt that mimics the design of the popular social networking site .
Do you like shirts from teen retailer Abercrombie & Fitch ?
How about a Christian copycat that transforms the chain 's name to " Abreadcrumb & Fish , " a reference to the biblical story of Jesus miraculously feeding the multitudes with bread and a few fish ?
PAST SPOOFS : Faith & Reason looks at Facebook Haggadah American retailers sell about $ 4.6 billion worth of Christian products annually , and some are spoofs or spinoffs of commercial logos or brand names .
Many such goods are illegal , trademark attorneys say , but companies often are unaware their names are being copied or do n't put up a fight for fear of being labeled anti-faith .
There are " iPray " hats to wear while listening to your iPod , and the logo for the popular " Rock Band " video game was tweaked for a Christian necklace with a pendant shaped like a guitar pick .
Preachers are even in on the act :
They can buy materials for sermons based on popular TV shows including " Lost " and " Survivor . "
Imitators include Christian versions of the Subway restaurant logo , the " got milk ? " advertising campaign , and the " intel inside " sticker that 's on millions of computers .
The " HOPE " poster from Barack Obama 's presidential campaign — which itself was the subject of a copyright fight between an artist and The Associated Press over the use of an Obama photo — was Christianized , with an image of Jesus replacing the president .
Church marketing consultant Brad Abare has seen tons of such stuff and does n't like it .
He 's even come up with a name for some of it : " Jesus Junk . "
" We think it 's just dumb .
It 's not a true reflection of creativity , " said Abare , of the nonprofit Center for Church Communication in Los Angeles .
Trademark attorney Michael G. Atkins of Seattle said legal parodies of commercial trademarks are protected under the First Amendment , but such religious products generally do n't fall into that category .
" You could take Microsoft and change their logo around to make fun of Microsoft , and that would be legal , " he said .
" But I ca n't use the Microsoft logo to promote my Christian theme because there 's no real connection there .
That 's illegal . "
Marjorie Koval of the Association for Christian Retail said it 's hard to say how much of the Christian merchandise market is made up of parody items .
The gift and specialty sector , which includes apparel , comprises about one - third of the industry 's total sales , she said .
It 's also impossible to say how many manufacturers produce such merchandise :
Anyone with a screen printing machine and a computer can make a T - shirt design .
Atkins said that 's one reason companies have such a hard time policing their brands .
But there are a few major players in the Christian merchandise industry .
Based in Berryville , Ark. , Kerusso sells Christian - themed items including T - shirts , dolls and jewelry , and it asks customers to report anyone that rips off their designs , many of which are original .
Its products are available in more than 7,000 stores nationwide .
Yet some of Kerusso's popular products are copycats of corporate brands and logos known worldwide .
The company makes the Facebook shirt for $ 17.99 , plus one where Apple 's iPod is tweaked into " iPray . "
For the same price you can buy an " Amazing Grace " shirt that resembles the " American Idol " TV logo .
Kerusso's Abercrombie & Fitch copycat is labeled a " classic " on its website .
Kerusso CEO
Vic Kennett said he occasionally gets complaints from companies whose logos are parodied , and Kerusso generally changes those designs or discontinues merchandise .
Kerusso altered its red " Jesus Christ — Eternally Refreshing " T - shirt after Coca - Cola complained the design too closely resembled its well - known script logo .
But other designs that might raise lawyers ' eyebrows actually are legal .
Kerusso licensed the " iPray " design from a Chicago organization that sought and received a trademark for the word , he said .
Kinnett views the commercial spoofs — which only make up 15 % or so of Kerusso 's merchandise — as modern - day parables .
" If Jesus were here today would he make parody T - shirts ?
I doubt it , " Kinnett said .
" But in his day , he did use parables .
He used things that were common and recognized in everyday life to make a point or say something with a deeper meaning . "
Perhaps .
But Abercrombie & Fitch attorney Reid Wilson said the " Abreadcrumb & Fish " design is a blatant trademark ripoff , and the clothing chain sends cease - and - desist letters anytime such products show up .
" We view that type of use of our trademark as an absolute infringement , " he said .
Atkins , the trademark expert , said few companies are willing to make a stink over the issue .
" I think you have a real tension between the legal department and the PR department , " he said .
" ( Large companies ) are very sensitive to looking like they are anti-Christian , so they are very restrained in going after the wrongdoers . "
Baxter Chism , a United Methodist pastor in Dadeville , Ala. , understands the idea of Christians using pop culture references to be relevant , even if he does n't always think of it that way .
He bought a shirt that pictures Jesus dressed as a hockey goalie with the words " Jesus Saves ! " because it was funny , not to be hip .
Children are bombarded by advertising from a young age , he said , and many adults can quote from commercials far easier than from the Bible .
" I consider this a window of opportunity to proclaim Christ to people by using a topic they understand , " he said .
" Jesus spoke to us in stories that were culturally relevant to those listening . "
Abare , the church marketing consultant , just wishes Christians would pay more attention to the commandment " Thou shall not steal . "
" The whole claim for Christians in general is that God is the source of all creativity , " he said .
" I think there 's something to being original that will speak to people in a way that we do n't have to copy . "

A shop clerk rescued after 11 days trapped .
“ I was hungry , ” Exantus told The Associated Press from his hospital bed soon after the rescue .
“ But every night I thought about the revelation that I would survive . ”
He , Exantus , who is in his 20s , survived initially by diving under a desk when the rubble started to fall around him .
Trapped in such a small space , he had lie on his back the entire time and survived by drinking cola , beer and cookies .
“ It was God who was tucking me away in his arms .
It gave me strength , ” he added .
Exantus worked as a cashier in the grocery store on the ground floor of the Hotel Napoli .
Earlier Saturday , the United Nations announced the Haitian government had declared an end to rescue operations .
Still , dozens of international teams continued to pick through rubble of the Jan. 12 quake .
Saturday ’s rescue effort started when one of the man ’s brothers helped get a Greek search team to the site after hearing Exantus ’ voice , said Apostolos Dedas , a mission leader for the Greek team .
“ It is very emotional .
It is the best thing that can happen to you when you are a rescuer , ” Dedas said .
Chain saws , heavy duty drills and hand saws used by rescuers to dig a narrow tunnel .
Lt. Col. Christophe Renou , a French Civil Protection official said the man was buried under 16 1 / 2 to 20 feet ( 5 to 6 meters ) of debris , mostly wood and concrete .
The rescue teams said they sent two women , Carmen Michalska and a French female rescuers , into the tunnel because only they could fit .
Exantus was smilling and he was just really happy to get out .
He said , ‘ Thank you . ”
What happened in that spot there is a miracle .
Experts say the chance of saving trapped people begins diminishing after 72 hours .
Haiti earthquake killing an estimated 200,000 people .
Before the latest rescue , U.N. spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs said 132 people had been pulled alive from collapsed buildings .

An edict by the king of the Zulus to bring back circumcision for thousands of teenage boys is causing alarm in South Africa , amid record numbers of deaths from the traditional manhood ritual .
On Tuesday , at a meeting called in Durban by the government of KwaZulu - Natal , traditional leaders in the province will outline how they wish to implement King Goodwill Zwelithini 's decision to reintroduce circumcision 200 years after it was scrapped by King Shaka .
But health officials working with South Africa 's second largest tribe , the Xhosa – who never gave up the practice – say the move could put thousands of lives at risk .
" We have had a disastrous year , with 80 deaths , including two suicides , " said Sizwe Kupela , a Xhosa who is health spokesman for the Eastern Cape .
Each year , 50,000 Xhosa boys descend on the vast province to undergo the secretive ritual – including circumcision by a " traditional surgeon " and one month 's seclusion in nakedness .
" We see horrific cases of rotting penises , septicaemia and inadvertent castrations , " he said .
" Others die from dehydration and hypothermia .
HIV is spread because the same knife is used on large groups of boys .
My personal view is that if the Zulus go back to circumcision , they must do it the western way , in hospital . ''
Last Saturday , wrapped in a blanket , 19 - year - old Andile Ngcolomba ended his month in seclusion by walking off the aloe - covered slopes of Peddie into his mother 's impoverished village in Qamini Location .
He remembered very little about the visit he received in his mountain shelter on 7 December from the traditional surgeon : " He arrives covered in clay and animal pelts .
He is so ugly you do n't want to look at him .
I never even saw the knife .
You just black out .
When you wake up , it is done , and there is some powder there to help the healing .
" I did not sleep for seven nights for the pain .
To help the pain and healing , they gave me dagga [ marijuana ] to smoke and I was not allowed to drink water or have salt in my food for a week after the cutting .''­
During his time " on the mountain " , Ngcolomba and other initiates in adjacent shelters received visits every other day from an ikangata ( teacher ) , Mazinyanwana Mkhongi .
The teacher , in his 70s , said : " My role is to check that the wound is healing and to explain the duties and responsibilities of a man .
He must be able to survive in the wild , fight , but also resolve conflicts . ''
Ngcolomba , who lives with his mother and elder sister in the Cape township of Khayelitsha , had gained a warrior name , Nasayi , and been briefed by his teacher on the terrible dangers of the witches of Peddie , said to be among the most fearsome anywhere .
After enduring the process , he was more convinced than ever of its virtues : " To us Xhosas , circumcision is what makes you a man .
All my friends are doing it .
Without it you are inkwenkwe – a boy – and you are not allowed to mix with men .
Hospital circumcision does not count .
You are not a man unless you have survived what I went through .
No man can be a leader without it .
To me , now , President Jacob Zuma is a boy because he is an uncircumcised Zulu . "
Former presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki and Archbishop Desmond Tutu are all circumcised Xhosas .
Whenever prominent South African figures misbehave , Xhosa title - tattle centres on whether they have been ­circumcised .
Xhosas frequently denigrate Julius Malema – the outspoken leader of the African National Congress Youth League – because he is an uncircumcised Zulu .
In 2008 , ANC politician Fikile Mbalula succumbed to peer pressure and , aged 37 , entered an initiation school .
He later became deputy minister of police .
King Zwelithini claims to be reintroducing circumcision for Zulu boys because there is evidence that the practice sharply reduces HIV transmission .
However , with a Zulu president in power , it is likely that the king is equally motivated by a desire to bolster his nation .
Critics of initiation say traditional leaders have failed to update their teachings from the times when the ritual was put in place to select and grade warriors .
Despite undergoing government training courses , teachers largely do not address burning South African concerns such as HIV prevention or sexual violence .
The tradition also places a tremendous financial burden on poor families .
Goats , blankets and bottles of Viceroy brandy and Smirnoff vodka must be bought .
After initiation , a young man must be bought a suit and cap and must throw away his entire wardrobe , including underwear , shoes , school uniform and school bag from his boyhood .
Even his mobile phone must go .
During Ngcolomba 's seclusion , he was not allowed to see women .
His aunt , Nobhukulu , cooked him two meals a day on her hearth and they were taken to him by local boys .
Only on emerging from seclusion were women 's concerns briefly addressed .
Ngcolomba sat in a hut to which his aunts were invited , to present him with gifts and impart views such as " please do not spend all your time in the shebeen " .
Aids campaigner Vuyiseka Dubula , secretary general of the Treatment Action Campaign , is concerned that the Zulu king 's decision to reintroduce circumcision could put thousands more lives in danger .
But she said it was not too late for King Zwelithini to use his decree to mark a revolutionary step forward for both Zulu and Xhosa men .
" Most new incidences of HIV are among women , " said Dubula , secretary general of the Treatment Action ­Campaign .
" Initiation should be about education , including respecting women .
I am a Xhosa woman and I know the initiates are taught how to use their power , not how to control it .
If this could be changed , while not alienating the traditional leaders , we could see a new generation of men emerge , circumcised and more responsible . ''
Sizwe Kupela was less optimistic .
" I have a two - year - old son and I will never allow him to go through what I endured , " he said .
" I am talking to his mother about a hospital circumcision now .
My personal view is that the king needs to order Zulu infants to be circumcised under sterile conditions .
If the king wants to reduce HIV , it is no good waiting until boys are 18 and already sexually active . "
A member of the KwaZulu - Natal health department , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the department hoped to convince Zulu traditional leaders of the virtues of medical circumcision over the Xhosa approach .
Circumcision and health
A key factor in the decision by King Goodwill Zwelithini to bring back circumcision has been the disproportionate impact of HIV on the Zulu people .
" Bacteria can linger under the foreskin and the resulting infections can make glands more susceptible to the transmission of HIV , " says Tim Oliver , an emeritus professor at Queen Mary University , London .
" Statistics indicate that circumcision has helped to halt the spread of HIV in southern Africa . "
Other health benefits linked to circumcision include reduced rates for penile , cervical and possibly prostate cancer .
In people of Jewish and Arab origin , who traditionally circumcise their boys and young men , rates of the first two diseases are generally very low .
However , the connection between circumcision and disease prevention is not straightforward .
" Studies that have compared disease rates in circumcised and uncircumcised men have not fully teased out the possible roles of other variables , " adds Oliver .
" Instead of circumcising , it may be just as effective to provide good sexual education and make sure fresh water is available to communities so good hygiene can be practised . "
Certainly the risks of circumcision as practised by people such as the Xhosa are substantial and include the danger of developing septicaemia and other infections .
In his autobiography , Nelson Mandela says his circumcision , part of his coming - of - age ceremony , left him feeling " as if fire was shooting " through his veins .
" Today with modern local anaesthetic this need not be the case , " says Oliver .
" It worries me that the Zulu king intends this to be a test of courage . "
Thus the question facing Africa is whether more circumcision is needed , or whether the same investment – spent on improving access to running water and on education at puberty about foreskin and general sexual hygiene – would provide a greater all - round health gain .

Igneous , the remarkably pretty and well - paced student project I highlighted a few months back , is finally complete and can be downloaded for free right here .
To summarize : Igneous is a 3D platformer where you guide a rotund tiki totem through a collapsing volcano .
I thought the pre-IGF version was spectacularly intense and satisfying , and my opinion has n't changed any in regards to the final version : Igneous was , and still is , a must - download for anyone who loves platformers and / or chase sequences and / or purdy graphics .
Granted , this new version cut out one of my favorite levels involving a rising lava flow and a circular chamber , and it can be really hard to figure out where you are and where you need to go in the orgasmically explosive final level , but the game 's so briskly paced and just plain exciting that I find it hard to complain too much .
Get it here .
Between Jen and Brad 's sexting , multiple Jolie - Pitts who never materialized , and the Obamas ' baby , this was an exciting year in the tabloids .
Too bad those stories were totally fake !
Let 's take a look back at all " news " that never was .

In the fall OK ! , the runt of the tabloid litter , decided to cash in on the anticipation for New Moon with full month of fake Kristen Stewart / Robert Pattinson covers .
Basically an OK !
scribe sat up all night with copies of the Twilight books and theorized that , to quote the September 2 issue , " Life might just imitate art . "
Though , the Twilight twosome are n't actually engaged or married , and we 're pretty sure Kristen does n't " read aloud from the volume of Virgil 's Doomed Love that [ Rob ] gave her this year . "
Advertisement
At one point , the mag actually declared " each stage of the twosome 's love story mirrors Stephenie Meyer 's cult vampire saga . "
A joke about Robert Pattinson delivering Kristen Stewart 's vampire baby would be appropriate here , but OK !
already told fans they should be on a " bump watch " because Kristen may soon be delivering a baby which , if all goes according to plan , will be named " Clules Pattinson . "

KStew and RPatz were n't the only celebs to tie the knot ( in the minds of tabloid editors ) .
Jason Trawick proposed to Britney Spears in the Bahamas with a ring he bought in the gift shop of the Atlantis Resort & Casino .
( If anyone can appreciate a glittery plastic ring with dolphins on it , it 's Britney . )
The mag said the wedding would take place this month in Louisiana , with Jamie Lynn as Brit 's maid of honor and her boys as ring bearers .
Britney and Jason better get cracking — they only have two more weeks to throw together their " old - fashioned Southern wedding . "
Hey , maybe they can get Reverend Sun Myoung Moon of South Korea to perform the ceremony over the internet , just like he did for Nicole Richie and Joel Madden !
Truthfully , living room nuptials were not what we dreamed of for Nicole and Joel , but at least their wedding was better than Chris Brown and Rihanna 's sexy domestic violence - themed wedding .
Yes , Star actually tried to make Chris assaulting Rihanna sound romantic with lines like , " He tenderly wiped [ her tears ] away and kissed her face , which was still slightly bruised .
He just kept whispering , ' I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry . ' "
Thank god their beach wedding only took place in the pages of Star .

Several stars walked past the newsstands this year and were surprised to learn that their marriages were crumbling .
The only source in this story about Sarah and Todd Palin 's divorce was Mercede Johnston , Levi's 17 - year - old sister .
After all , who understands the inner workings of their marriage better than the teenage sister of their daughter 's ex-boyfriend ?

Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick split too , and James " Wilke " ( whose name is actually spelled " Wilkie " ) was caught in the middle ... right between his two new baby sisters .

But , no one split more this year than Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie .
It seems Brad has only one method of transportation : storming off .
While regular men might ride their motorcycle or go to their movie premiere , Brad can only " storm off " on his bike or " storm off " to the San Sebastian International Film Festival .
This year Brangelina started living in opposite ends of their French mansion , because it was n't enough to just sleep in different bedrooms .
There was one good thing that came out of their sparring .
In Touch claims that Brad and Angie felt so guilty about their " crumbling relationship " that they spoiled the kids with theme days .
All the Jolie - Pitts would dress up as characters from movies or books like James Bond or Harry Potter .
We could probably tolerate Brangie 's bickering if we got to have a " Wizard Day " with Maddox , Pax , Zahara , and Shiloh involving " magic potion punch to drink , and they had to solve clues to go to wizard college . "
Advertisement
The only person Brad could vent to about he and Angelina 's various " fights to end all fights " was , of course , the woman he humiliated and left for Angie .
Jennifer Aniston had plenty of time to devote to Brad , since all she 's done in the past five years is sit around and think about how she 's " so lonely . "
Brad and Jen kept their love alive via text messages and drunk dials this year , and even managed to sneak past the paparazzi on numerous occasions to hook up in hotels or just take a leisurely two hour drive around New York City .
Mostly they talked about what a handful Angie is , but Brad also provided beauty advice .
Jen was thinking about cutting her hair , but a " friend " told In Touch , " He talked her out of it .
He told her to just trim it and go blonder . "
Advertisement
Of course , Brad and Jen also talked about her becoming a " mom at last , " which is particularly creepy when you recall that they split because they could n't agree on whether or not to have kids ( or so the tabloids claimed at the time ) .
Jen was desperate to get pregnant because she was turned 40 this year , so she tried get every man she came in contact with to be her baby daddy .
Apparently she could n't convince John Mayer or Gerard Butler to spawn with her , because Star reported in April that she had completed paperwork ( with Brad 's help ) to adopt an American baby boy that she would name Nicholas John .
Fickle Jen must have changed her mind about little Nick at the last minute , since Star reported in December that she was adopting a Mexican toddler ( with Brad 's help ) .
Advertisement
Clearly , the only way for Angie to win Brad back from Jen was to get pregnant with ( or perhaps adopt ) her 7th child .
After all , a man can walk out on six kids , but not seven .
Star reported that Angie was two and a half months along on April 15 , so we must have missed when she gave birth in late October .
We 'll have to keep our eyes peeled for the arrival of the other 7th baby she 's currently pregnant with and the African and / or Eastern European baby she 's adopting .
Advertisement
Sometimes it 's just so hard to keep tabs on all the famous uteri , especially when the mags keep forgetting to write the word " someday " and the end of those coverlines about celebs who see babies in their future .
Also , let 's just make a rule that no female star is allowed to touch her belly and smile coyly ever again .

We got so wrapped up in the goings on in Katie 's uterus that we almost forgot about the biggest pregnancy news of the year :
White .
House .
Baby .
In this inauguration story , Star claimed that 45 - year - old Michelle Obama , who had difficulty conceiving Malia , decided to give in vitro a go because she and Barack had nothing else going on in 2009 .
If the procedure did n't work , they planned to adopt a learning - disabled child , or perhaps an African - American boy that Barack could " play hoops with . "
Unless they 've cleverly disguised their adopted son in a Portuguese Water Dog costume , this never happened .

Looking back , we 've had a lot of fun with the tabloids this year , from stories about Jessica Simpson keeping a framed picture of Tiger Woods in her bedroom , to Suri and Shiloh 's 100 % Photoshopped playdate .
Who knows what the stars will do in 2010 , or rather , what adventures the tabloids will concoct ?
Jennifer Aniston could adopt a brood of Bolivian orphans , Britney could get pregnant with sextuplets , or Michelle Obama could start sexting Brad Pitt .
Think about what stories you 'd like to see , because , as we 've learned from the editors of Star , Us , In Touch , Life & Style , and OK ! , the only limit is your imagination .

NEW YORK - The Obama administration gave up on its plan to try the alleged Sept. 11 plotters in Lower Manhattan yesterday , bowing to almost unanimous pressure from New York officials and business leaders to move the terrorism trial elsewhere .
“ I think I can acknowledge the obvious , ’’ an administration official said .
“ We ’re considering other options . ’’
The reversal on trying the accused Sept. 11 terrorists blocks from the former World Trade Center site seemed to come suddenly this week , after New York ’s mayor , Michael R. Bloomberg , abandoned his strong support for the plan and said the cost and disruption would be too great .
But behind the brave face that many New Yorkers had put on for weeks , resistance had been gathering steam .
After a dinner in New York on Dec. 14 , Steven Spinola , president of the Real Estate Board of New York , pulled aside David Axelrod , President Obama ’s closest adviser , to convey an urgent plea : move the planned trial for the Sept. 11 suspects out of Manhattan .
In a series of presentations in recent weeks - to business leaders , local elected officials , and community representatives of Chinatown - New York ’s police commissioner , Raymond W. Kelly , laid out his plan for securing the trial : blanketing lower Manhattan with police checkpoints , vehicle searches , rooftop snipers , and canine patrols .
“ They were not well received , ’’ said one city official .
On Tuesday , in a meeting Bloomberg had with at least two dozen federal judges in their Manhattan courthouse , one judge raised the question of security .
The mayor , according to several people present , said he was sure the courthouse could be made safe , but that it would be costly and difficult .
The next day , Bloomberg , who in November hailed the idea of trying Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other alleged Sept. 11 plotters in the heart of downtown Manhattan , made clear that he had changed his mind .
Told of the Obama administration ’s decision last night , a spokesman for Kelly said , “ We were not aware of that . ’’
But the spokesman , Paul J. Browne , said of Kelly : “ He is of the mind that such a decision would give us some breathing room , but that New York has to remain vigilant because it remains at the top of the terrorist target list . ’’
Bloomberg ’s remarks Wednesday set off a stampede of New York City officials , most of them Democrats well - disposed toward Obama , who suddenly declared that a civilian trial for the Sept. 11 suspects was a great idea - as long as it did n’t happen in their city .
By yesterday , Justice Department officials were studying other locations , focusing especially on military bases and prison complexes , and no obvious new choice had emerged .
The story of how prominent New York officials seemed to have so quickly moved from a kind of “ bring it on ’’ bravado to an “ anywhere but here ’’ stance involves many factors , including a new anxiety about terrorism after the attempted airliner bombing on Christmas Day .
It appears New York officials could not tolerate ceding much of the city to a set of trials that could last for years .
“ The administration is in a tricky political and legal position , ’’ Julie Menin , a lawyer who is chairwoman of the 50 - member Community Board 1 that represents lower Manhattan , including the federal courthouse and ground zero , said of Obama and his Justice Department .
“ But it means shutting down our Financial District .
It could cost $ 1 billion .
It ’s absolutely crazy . ’’
Menin said the turning point for her came when she heard Kelly ’s security plan and cost estimates : hundreds of millions of dollars a year .
“ It was an absolute game - changer , ’’ she said .
She wrote a Jan. 17 op - ed article for The New York Times proposing moving the trial to Governor ’s Island , off Manhattan ; that idea did not catch hold , but the article escalated the outcry to relocate .
When the Justice Department announced in November its plans to try Mohammed and four alleged accomplices blocks from where the World Trade Center stood , Bloomberg hailed the location as not only workable but as a powerful symbol .
“ It is fitting that 9/11 suspects face justice near the World Trade Center site where so many New Yorkers were murdered , ’’ the mayor said at the time .
It is possible the reversal will call into question the calibrated effort of Obama and his attorney general , Eric Holder , to bring the handling of suspected terrorists out of the realm of military emergency and into the halls of civilian justice .
If the message to Al Qaeda in November was that New York City was able to bring justice to those who plotted mass murder , the message of January is far less confident .
“ This will be one more stroke for Al Qaeda propaganda , ’’ said Bruce Hoffman , a terrorism analyst at Georgetown University .
He said the terrorist group may portray the flap over a trial site as “ a sign of American weakness , ’’ though he said it would be a “ debating point rather than a real recruiting tool . ’’

The Australian federal government has released a discussion paper summarising the key arguments for and against an R18 + classification for computer games .
You can download the full report from the federal Attorney - General 's department Web site .
As the paper states , submissions are currently being sought from the community on whether the Australian National Classification Scheme should include an R18 + classification category for computer and video games .
" This is your opportunity to tell the Australian and the State and Territory Governments your views before they consider whether the current situation should be changed , " states the paper .
“ The ministers responsible for censorship have considered the issue [ of an R18 + rating for games ] on a number of occasions .
Before these ministers consider the matter further , it is timely to consider the views of the community . ”
Because Australia lacks an R18 + classification for games , any title deemed " adults only " cannot legally be sold .
The lack of an R rating for games in Australia has been a cause of mounting frustration among gamers , but all that may be about to change .
While this does not necessarily mean that Australia will receive an R18 + classification for games , it is the first encouraging sign to come out of the Attorney - General 's department in some time .
As early as last month , South Australian Attorney - General Michael Atkinson stated his intention to appeal against Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2’s MA15 +
Classification because the game awarded points for “ massacring civilians . ”
( As anyone who has played the game will know , Modern Warfare 2 does not allow players to gain points by massacring civilians . )
Two weeks ago , the hotly anticipated Aliens Vs. Predator was refused classification in Australia due to ' violence that is high in impact ' .
In explaining its decision , the Classification Board cited a long list of objectionable material , including " explicit decapitation and dismemberment " , " spinal columns dangling from severed necks " and " stabbing through the chest , throat , mouth and eyes " .
It was the latest in a long list of games to run afoul of the Classification Operations Board , including Left 4 Dead 2 ( ' Left 4 Dead 2 Banned In Australia ' ) , Silent Hill : Homecoming ( ' Silent Hill : Homecoming banned in Australia ' ) , and Fallout 3 ( ' Fallout 3 banned in Australia ' ) .
Interested parties have until close of business 28 February 2010 to lodge submissions .
You can make a submission by downloading and completing the submission template .
Submissions may also be mailed to the following address :

If you have an interest in seeing an R18 +
Classification for video games in Australia , now is the time to have your voice heard .

Most arguments in favor of net neutrality regulation focus on fairness to the public .
Definitions of " net neutrality " often characterize it as a principle that fosters free speech on the Internet .
But a new study contends that barring ISPs from favoring certain content providers is more than a good concept — it 's also sound economic policy .
" Without net neutrality rules , new technologies could lead to pricing practices that transfer wealth from content providers to ISPs , " warns the Institute for Policy Integrity , " a form of price discrimination that would reduce the return on investment for Internet content — meaning website owners , bloggers , newspapers , and businesses would have less incentive to expand their sites and applications . "
Such a reallocation of resources would hobble investment in the ' Net overall , concludes Free to Invest : The Economic Benefits of Preserving Net Neutrality ( cheat sheet version here ) .
IPI is a New York University - based think tank that looks closely at environmental issues .
But as the group 's executive director Michael Livermore told us , the outfit also focuses on what it sees as a missing element in much pro-environmental regulation policy , the use of cost - benefit analysis .
Generally , this kind of thinking is used to oppose government intervention on the grounds that some specific regulation actually has more costs than it produces in benefits .
But it does n't have to be that way .
" Americans are willing to support regulation that solves significant failures of the marketplace , and cost - benefit analysis can show where new or strengthened regulations are justified on economic terms , " Livermore writes .
So when Consumers Union encouraged IPI to take a look at broadband - related issues , the institute adjusted its work from climate change to the ' Net .
Here 's what it saw .
Market failure in cyberspace
Free to Invest begins by outlining the ' Net 's simultaneous strength and weakness .
The big strength , as any Web user knows , is vast amounts of cheap or free content — news , blogs , music , video , games , social networks .
It 's all out there for " free , " in the sense that once you 've paid for a device and an ISP subscription , the rest of the ride is gratis .
But , while all these goodies provide billions of dollars in " free value " for the public , " websites are not compensated when their content is repurposed or passed on , " the study notes , which means " fewer subscriptions to paid services , fewer direct page views , and a loss of advertising dollars . "
As a consequence , " the Internet is more useful to everyone on it , but Internet Service
Providers ( ISPs ) and content providers are at a disadvantage since they are not compensated for all the information they disseminate , " according to the report .
" This leads to systematic underinvestment in the Internet : if that income could be accessed , it would encourage investment in infrastructure and content . "
Source : Institute for Policy Integrity
There is a way that the big ISPs could generate additional income .
They could do more than just charge content providers to upload their data to the Web .
They could tithe them in various ways for priority subscriber access , which is what both AT&T and the cable companies say they want .
The telcos and cable call this " value added " or " enhanced delivery " service — but basically it would involve content makers paying the ISPs more money for faster subscriber access .
Free to Invest warns that this kind of marketing would cost the Internet economy overall .
Price discrimination " would reduce the return on investment for Internet content — meaning website owners , bloggers , newspapers , and businesses would have less incentive to expand their sites and applications , " IPI argues .
" Smaller websites might not be able to afford the fees leading them to close up shop .
Start - ups might not actually start up because it costs too much or the profits are n’t worth the investment .
If too many sites decide it ’s just not worth the price of entry , the Internet loses value to the people who use it . "
Critics decry the Federal Communications Commission 's proposals to bar priority access deals .
They call net neutrality " a solution in search of a problem . "
But , as IPI notes , that 's because the Internet in the United States is currently running under de facto net neutrality rules already .
The ISPs have voluntarily , albeit reluctantly , refrained from cutting priority access deals with content providers .
The FCC's net neutrality proposals would codify many of these voluntary practices into law .
Zero sum transfer
Were the big ISPs allowed to offer priority access tiers , it would represent a siphoning of money from the Internet 's content sector to its infrastructure sector .
Free to Invest 's cost - benefit analysis calls this transfer bad economics .
Competition in the Internet content market is much stronger than it is in the market for broadband service , the report contends .
In content - land , the situation is constantly changing , " with new product and players emerging at a furious pace — content providers must adapt ( and invest in changing and adapting ) to keep up with other content providers . "
On the other hand , in ISP - land , most consumers have access to two viable high speed providers , at most .
" Thus , ISPs do not need to be as vigilant about competition or use their investments to compete with potential new entrants into the market , " the paper argues .
" Instead , they are free to use their additional revenue to generate proprietary content , invest in other parts of their business , pay dividends to shareholders , or reward managers with bonuses . "
And so abandoning net neutrality would transfer money from the most competitive parts of the Internet and actively reinvest it in the least competitive , IPI warns .
But the study acknowledges that more needs to be done to boost investment in the ' Net overall , especially to make broadband available to more of the country .
That 's why the group favors direct government support .
It 's hard for the government to subsidize content , which requires making subjective decisions about which kinds of content to help financially .
But it 's easier to underwrite infrastructure — something the US has been doing for over a century via support to railroads , rural electricity , federal highways , and ( most recently ) the White House 's $ 7.2 billion broadband stimulus program .
" A policy that encourages content investment through a favorable pricing structure [ net neutrality ] , while directly supporting infrastructure , then , is likely to be the best available option to achieve more efficient levels of investment , " the paper concludes .
Of course , while government broadband investment might be easier on a policy level , it 's not so easy on a political level .
Most observers agree that the amount of federal infrastructure money allocated so far wo n't get the job done , with one outfit predicting a broadband gap of 40 million households through 2014 , even at present levels of public and private investment .
And it 's unclear whether the Obama administration has any plans for a second big stimulus package .
But in our conversation with IPI director Livermore , he seemed guardedly optimistic about future prospects .
" The ' Net as we currently know it is only about 15 years old , " he pointed out .
Speaking of money , we did ask where IPI gets theirs .
The think tank has received project grants from the Hewlett Foundation and the Rockefeller fund , we were told .
It 's also backed by NYU .
As for this net neutrality report , the Institute produced it on its own dime .

Subjects were shown faces with the same features but with different distances between the eyes and between the eyes and mouth .
Faces with an average length or width ratio - which were chosen as most attractive - are framed in black .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder but also in the relationship of the eyes and mouth of the beholden .
The distance between a woman 's eyes and the distance between her eyes and her mouth are key factors in determining how attractive she is to others , according to new psychology research from the University of California , San Diego and the University of Toronto .
Pamela Pallett and Stephen Link of UC San Diego and Kang Lee of the University of Toronto tested the existence of an ideal facial feature arrangement .
They successfully identified the optimal relation between the eyes , the mouth and the edge of the face for individual beauty .
In four separate experiments , the researchers asked university students to make paired comparisons of attractiveness between female faces with identical facial features but different eye - mouth distances and different distances between the eyes .
They discovered two " golden ratios , " one for length and one for width .
Female faces were judged more attractive when the vertical distance between their eyes and the mouth was approximately 36 percent of the face 's length , and the horizontal distance between their eyes was approximately 46 percent of the face 's width .
Interestingly , these proportions correspond with those of an average face .
" People have tried and failed to find these ratios since antiquity .
The ancient Greeks found what they believed was a ' golden ratio ' - also known as ' phi ' or the ' divine proportion ' - and used it in their architecture and art .
Some even suggest that Leonardo Da Vinci used the golden ratio when painting his ' Mona Lisa . '
But there was never any proof that the golden ratio was special .
As it turns out , it is n't .
Instead of phi , we showed that average distances between the eyes , mouth and face contour form the true golden ratios , " said Pallett , a post - doctoral fellow in psychology at UC San Diego and also an alumna of the department .
" We already know that different facial features make a female face attractive - large eyes , for example , or full lips , " said Lee , a professor at University of Toronto and the director of the Institute of Child Study at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education .
" Our study conclusively proves that the structure of faces - the relation between our face contour and the eyes , mouth and nose - also contributes to our perception of facial attractiveness .
Our finding also explains why sometimes an attractive person looks unattractive or vice versa after a haircut , because hairdos change the ratios . "
The researchers suggest that the perception of facial attractiveness is a result of a cognitive averaging process by which people take in all the faces they see and average them to get an ideal width ratio and an ideal length ratio .
They also posit that " averageness " ( like symmetry ) is a proxy for health , and that we may be predisposed by biology and evolution to find average faces attractive .

DWI or driving while intoxicated is considered a serious crime in Richmond VA , just as any other country in US .
A first DWI offense is always considered a misdemeanor .
Under certain circumstances , second drunk driving offense is also considered a misdemeanor .
Third , fourth and any other following driving under influence offense will often be felony charged .
Third or subsequent offense will also lead to harsher penalties in case of conviction .
If you are arrested for a third DWI in Richmond , you will face a felony charge .
In order to reduce your penalties that can range from driver license suspension and hefty fines to probation and imprisonment , you must hire an experienced criminal defense lawyer .
Only a qualified attorney that has handled DWI felony cases before can properly assist you .
When a DWI Becomes a Felony Offense ?
Laws of Richmond define the crime of driving while intoxicated as a felony when the driver has committed three or more DWI offenses .
Apart from the mentioned , a drunk driving charge can evolve into a felony if the driver has caused serious injuries or death .
In case of death , you will also be charged with manslaughter and a vehicular homicide .
In order to take the first proper steps in a felony DWI case , it is of utmost importance to consult with a local lawyer .
An attorney will help you understand what your rights are , as well as the possible penalties you may be facing .
Have in mind that a felony charge cannot be dropped .
The only thing you can hope for in this severe situation is have your penalties decreased .
A number of issues make a felony DWI different from a misdemeanor DWI or regular drunk driving charge .
The process of a felony DWI case is also quite different from a regular driving under the influence charge .
For example , a first drunk driving offense that is usually considered a misdemeanor will be finalized in General District Court .
Every state around the country has specific laws when it comes to being charged with drinking and driving including Washington DC .
It is advisable to speak with an attorney in your area , and more specific , the county in which you were arrested when you are reviewing possible candidates to represent you on your charges .
An exceptional DUI defense starts with hiring the right lawyer in the right location , again , including Washington DC .
On the other hand , a felony DWI is finalized in circuit court .
If you do n’t have a professional by your side , it wo n’t be possible to reach the most favorable outcome in the case .
Hire a Richmond DWI Attorney
Felony DWI cases are very difficult to defend in court without having a qualified lawyer to assist you .
Have in mind that in case of conviction , a felony DWI can will leave a permanent mark on your name that will inevitably almost every aspect of your life .
Apart from losing your driver ’s license , you may also lose your professional license .
Hefty fines and court expenses may completely empty your wallet , and lastly , depending on your professional occupation , you may even lose your job .
A felony DWI charge means that you have n’t taken VA law and judiciary advice seriously .
Since you have been charged with multiple DWI offenses before , you will no longer be able to convince the jury you have simply made a mistake and that you are sorry for your actions .
The only thing you can rely on in this delicate situation is your attorney .
A lawyer will know how to challenge a felony DUI and negotiate with the prosecutors to get you the best result possible .
Ha’aretz says U.S. officials face ‘ pro - Israel ’ background check
There is an amazing story in Ha’aretz today on the " pro-Israel " litmus test that determines who is permitted to serve in the United States government .
Here ’s the sort of lede you ’re not likely to read in the New York Times or Washington Post :
Every appointee to the American government must endure a thorough background check by the American Jewish community .
In the case of Obama ’s government in particular , every criticism against Israel made by a potential government appointee has become a catalyst for debate about whether appointing " another leftist " offers proof that Obama does not truly support Israel . "
The story goes on to rehearse what happened to Chas Freeman ( whose appointment was derailed by the Israel lobby because he voiced a few mild criticisms of Israel ’s behavior ) and reports that similar complaints are now being raised against the appointment of former Senator Chuck Hagel .
Even more bizarrely , the Zionist Organization of America and other rightwing Jewish groups are complaining about the appointment of Hannah Rosenthal to direct the Office to Combat and Monitor Anti-Semitism .
Why ?
Apparently she ’s been involved with J Street and other " leftwing " organizations that ZOA et al deem insufficiently ardent in their support for the Jewish state , and has suggested that progressive forces need to be more vocal in advancing the peace process .
One has to feel a certain sympathy for Ms. Rosenthal , who is forced to defend her own appointment by telling an interviewer :
I love Israel .
I have lived in Israel .
I go back and visit every chance I can .
I consider it part of my heart .
And because I love it so much , I want to see it safe and secure and free and democratic and living safely . "
These are fine sentiments , but is n’t it odd that she has to defend her qualifications for a position in the U.S. government by saying how much she " loves " a foreign country ?
For an American official in her position , what matters is that she loves America , and that she believes anti-semitism is a hateful philosophy that should be opposed vigorously .
Whether she loves Israel or France or Thailand or Namibia , etc. , is irrelevant .
( And yes , it ’s entirely possible to loathe anti-Semitism and not love Israel ) .
But the real lesson of all these episodes is the effect of this litmus test on the foreign policy community more broadly .
Groups in the lobby target public servants like Freeman , Hagel , and Rosenthal because they want to make sure that no one with even a mildly independent view on Middle East affairs gets appointed .
By making an example of them , they seek to discourage independent - minded people from expressing their views openly , lest doing so derail their own career prospects later on .
And it works .
Even if the lobby does n’t manage to block every single appointment , they can make any administration think twice about a potentially " controversial " choice and use the threat to stifle open discourse among virtually all members of the mainstream foreign policy community ( and certainly anyone who aspires to public service in Washington ) .
The result , of course , is the U.S. Middle East policy ( and U.S. foreign policy more generally ) is reserved for those who are either steadfastly devoted to the " special relationship " or who have been intimidated into silence .
The result ?
U.S. policy remains in the hands of the same set of " experts " whose policies for the past seventeen years ( or more ) have been a steady recipe for failure .
If a few more Americans read Ha’aretz , they might start to figure this out .

IN CONVENTION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THIS STATE OF NEW YORK ,
Kingston , 20th April , 1777 .
Whereas the many tyrannical and oppressive usurpations of the King and Parliament of Great Britain on the rights and liberties of the people of the American colonies had reduced them to the necessity of introducing a government by congresses and committees , as temporary expedients , and to exist no longer than the grievances of the people should remain without redress ;
And whereas the congress of the colony of New York did , on the thirty - first day of May now last past , resolve as follows , viz :
" Whereas the present government of this colony , by congress and committees , was instituted while the former government , under the Crown of Great Britain , existed in full force , and was established for the sole purpose of opposing the usurpation of the British Parliament , and was intended to expire on a reconciliation with Great Britain , which it was then apprehended would soon take place , but is now considered as remote and uncertain ;
" And whereas many and great inconveniences attend the said mode of government by congress and committees , as of necessity , in many instances , legislative , judicial , and executive popovers have been vested therein , especially since the dissolution of the former government by the abdication of the late governor and the exclusion of this colony from the protection of the King of Great Britain ;
" And whereas the Continental Congress did resolve as followeth , to wit :
" ' Whereas His Britannic Majesty , in conjunction with the lords and commons of Great Britain , has , by a late act of Parliament , excluded the inhabitants of these united colonies from the protection of his Crown ; and whereas no answers whatever to the humble petition of the colonies for redress of grievances end reconciliation with Great Britain has been , or is likely to be , given , but the whole force of that kingdom , aided by foreign mercenaries , is to be exerted for the destruction of the good people of these colonies ; and whereas it appears absolutely irreconcilable to reason and good conscience for the people of these colonies now to take the oaths and affirmations necessary for the support of any government under the Crown of Great Britain , and it is necessary that the exercise of every kind of authority under the said Crown should be totally suppressed , and all the popovers of government exerted under the authority of the people of the colonies for the preservation of internal peace , virtue , and good order , as well as for the defense of our lives , liberties , and properties , against the hostile invasions and cruel depredations of our enemies :
Therefore ,
" ' Resolved , That it be recommended to the respective assemblies and conventions of the United colonies , where no government sufficient to the exigencies of their affairs has been hitherto established , to adopt such government as shall , in the opinion of the representatives of the people , best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular , and America in general . '
" And whereas doubts have arisen whether this congress are invested with sufficient power and authority to deliberate and determine on so important a subject as the necessity of erecting and constituting a new form of government and internal police , to the exclusion of all foreign jurisdiction , dominion , and control whatever ; and whereas it appertains of right solely to the people of this colony to determine the said doubts :
Therefore
" Resolved , That it be recommended to the electors in the several counties in this colony , by election , in the manner and form prescribed for the election of the present congress , either to authorize ( in addition to the powers vested in this congress ) their present deputies , or others in the stead of their present deputies , or either of them , to take into consideration the necessity and propriety of instituting such new government as in and by the said resolution of the Continental Congress is described and recommended ; and if the majority of the counties , by their deputies in provincial congress , shall be of opinion that such new government ought to be instituted and established , then to institute and establish such a government as they shall deem best calculated to secure the rights , liberties , and happiness of the good people of this colony ; and to continue in force until a future peace w ith Great Britain shall render the same unnecessary ; and
" Resolved , That the said elections in the several counties ought to be had on such day , and at such place or places , as by the committee of each county respectively shall be determined .
And it is recommended to the said committees to fix such early days for the said elections as that all the deputies to be elected have sufficient time to repair to the city of New York by the second Monday in July next ; on which day all the said deputies ought punctually to give their attendance .
" And whereas the object of the Foregoing resolutions is of the utmost importance to the good people of this colony :
" Resolved , That it be , and it is hereby , earnestly recommended to the committees , freeholders , and other electors in the different counties in this colony diligently to carry the same into execution . "
And whereas the good people of the said colony , in pursuance of the said resolution , and reposing special trust and confidence in the members of this convention , have appointed , authorized , and empowered them for the purposes , and in the manner , and with the powers in and by the said resolve specified , declared , and mentioned .
And whereas the Delegates of the United American States , in general Congress convened , did , on the fourth day of July now last past , solemnly publish and declare , in the words following ; viz :
" When , in the course of human events , it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another , and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature 's
God entitle them , a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation .
" We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal ; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights ; that among these are , life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness ; that to secure these rights , governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed ; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new government , laying its foundation on such principles , and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to edect their safety and happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes , and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations ; pursuing invariably the same object , evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such government , and to provide new guards for their future security .
Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies ; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former system of government .
The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations , all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these States .
To prove this , let facts be submitted to a candid world .
" He has refused his assent to laws , the most wholesome and necessary for the public good .
" He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance , unless suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained ; and when so suspended , he has utterly neglected to attend to them .
" He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people , unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature ; a right inestimable to them , and formidable to tyrants only .
" He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual , uncomfortable , and distant from the depository of their public records , for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures .
" He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly , for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people .
" He has refused for a long time , after such dissolutions , to cause others to be elected , whereby the legislative powers , incapable of annihilation , have returned to the people at large , for their exercise ; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without , and convulsions within .
" He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States ; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners , refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither , and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands .
" He has obstructed the administration of justice , by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers .
" He has made judges dependent on his will alone , for the tenure of their offices , and the amount and payment of their salaries .
" He has erected a multitude of new offices , and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance .
" He has kept among us , in times of peace , standing armies , without the consent of our legislatures .
" He has affected to render the military independent of , and superior to , the civil power .
" He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution , and unacknowledged by our laws ; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation :
" For quartering large bodies of troops among us :
" For protecting them , by a mock trial , from punishment for any murders they should commit on the inhabitants of these States :
" For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world :
" For imposing taxes on us without our consent :
" For depriving us , in many cases , of the benefits of trial by jury :
" For transporting us beyond seas , to be tried for pretended offences :
" For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province , establishing therein an arbitrary government , and enlargiIlg itS boundaries , so as to render it at once an example and fit instrumellt for introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies :
" For taking away our charters , abolishing our most valuable laws , and altering fundamentally the forms of our governments :
" For suspending our own legislatures , and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever .
" He has abdicated government here , by declaring us out of his protection , and waging war against us .
" He has plundered our seas , ravaged our coasts , burnt our towns , and destroyed the lives of our people .
" He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the work of death , desolation , and tyranny , already lies on with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages , and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation .
" He has constrained our fellow - citizens , taken captive on the high seas , to bear arms against their country , to become the executioners of their friends and brethren , or to fall themselves by their Lands .
" He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us , and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages , whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages , sexes and conditions .
" In every stage of these oppressions , we have petitioned for redress m the most humble terms .
Our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury .
A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant , is unfit to be the ruler of a free people .
Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren .
We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us .
We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here .
We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity , and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations , which would inevitably interrupt our connection and correspondence .
They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity .
We must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation , and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind , enemies in war ; in peace , friends .
" We therefore , the Representatives of the United States of America , in general Congress assembled , appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions , do , in the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies , solemnly publish and declare , That these united colonies are , and of right ought to be , free and independent States ; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown , and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is , and ought to be , totally dissolved ; and that as free and independent States they have full power to levy war , conclude peace , contract alliances , establish commerce , and to do all other acts and things which independent States may of right do .
And for the support of this declaration , with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence , we mutually pledge to each other our lives , our fortunes , and our sacred honor . "
And whereas this convention , having taken this declaration into their most serious consideration , did , on the ninth day of July last past , unanimously resolve that the reasons assigned by the Continental Congress for declaring the united colonies free and independent States are cogent and conclusive ; and that while we lament the cruel necessity which has rendered that measure unavoidable , we approve the same , and will , at the risk of our lives and fortunes , join with the other colonies in supporting it
By virtue of which several acts , declarations , and proceedings mentioned and contained in the afore - cited resolves or resolutions of the general Congress of the United American States , and of the congresses or conventions of this State , all power whatever therein hath reverted to the people thereof , and this convention hath by their suffrages and free choice been appointed , and among other things authorized to institute and establish such a government as they shall deem best calculated to secure the rights and liberties of the good people of this State , most conducive of the happiness and safety of their constituents in particular , and of America in general .
I . This convention , therefore , in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State , doth ordain , determine , and declare that no authority shall , on any presence whatever , be exercised over the people or members of this State but such as shall be derived from and granted by them .
II .
This convention doth further , in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State , ordain , determine , and declare that the supreme legislative power within this State shall be vested in two separate and distinct bodies of men ; the one to be called the assembly of the State of New York , the other to be called the senate of the State of New York ; who together shall form the legislature , and meet once at least in every year for the despatch of business .
III .
And whereas laws inconsistent with the spirit of this constitution , or with the public good , may be hastily and unadvisedly passed :
Be it ordained , that the governor for the time being , the chancellor , and the judges of the supreme court , or any two of them , together with the governor , shall be , and hereby are , constituted a council to revise all bills about to be passed into laws by the legislature ; and for that purpose shall assemble themselves from time to time , when the legislature shall be convened ; for which , nevertheless they shall not receive any salary or consideration , under any presence whatever .
And that all bills which have passed the senate and assembly shall , before they become laws , be presented to the said council for their revisal and consideration ; and if , upon such revision and consideration , it should appear improper to the said council , or a majority of them , that the said bill should become a law of this State , that they return the same , together with their objections thereto in writing , to the senate or house of assembly ( in which soever the same shall have originated ) who shall enter the objection sent down by the council at large in their minutes , and proceed to reconsider the said bill .
But if , after such reconsideration , two - thirds of the said senate or house of assembly shall , notwithstanding the said objections , agree to pass the same , it shall together with the objections , be sent to the other branch of the legislature , where it shall also be reconsidered , and , if approved by two - thirds of the members present , shall be a law .
And in order to prevent any unnecessary delays , be it further ordained , that if any bill shall not be returned by the council within ten days after it shall have been presented , the same shall be a law , unless the legislature shall , by their adjournment , render a return of the said bill within ten days impracticable ; in which case the bill shall be returned on the first day of the meeting of the legislature after the expiration of the said ten days .
IV .
That the assembly shall consist of at least seventy members , to be annually chosen in the several counties , in the proportions following , viz :
For the city and county of New York , nine .
The city and county of Albany , ten .
The county of Dutchess , seven .
The county of Westchester , six .
The county of Ulster , six .
The county of Suffolk , five .
The county of Queens , four .
The county of Orange , four .
The county of Kings , two .
The county of Richmond , two .
Tryon County , six .
Charlotte County , four .
Cumberland County , three .
Gloucester County , two .
V. That as soon after the expiration of seven years ( subsequent to the termination of the present war ) as may be a census of the electors and inhabitants in this State be taken , under the direction of the legislature .
And if , on such census , it shall appear that the number of representatives in assembly from the said counties is not justly proportioned to the number of electors in the said counties respectively , that the legislature do adjust and apportion the same by that rule .
And further , that once in ever seven years , after the taking of the said first census , a just account of the electors resident in each county shall be taken , and if it shall thereupon appear that the member of electors in any county shall have increased or diminished one or more seventieth parts of the whole number of electors , which , on the said first census , shall be found in this State , the number of representatives for such county shall be increased or diminished accordingly , that is to say , fine representative for every seventieth part as aforesaid .
VI .
And whereas an opinion hath long prevailed among divers of the good people of this State that voting at elections by ballot would tend more to preserve the liberty and equal freedom of the people than voting viva voce :
To the end , therefore , that a fair experiment be made , which of those two methods of voting is to be preferred --
Be it ordained , That as soon as may be after the termination of the present war between the United States of America and Great Britain , an act or acts be passed by the legislature of this State for causing all elections thereafter to be held in this State for senators and representatives in assembly to be by ballot , and directing the manner in which the same shall be conducted .
And whereas it is possible that , after all the care of the legislature in framing the said act or acts , certain inconveniences and mischiefs , unforseen at this day , may be found to attend the said mode of electing by ballot :
It is further ordained , That if , after a full and fair experiment shall be made of voting by ballot aforesaid , the same shall be found less conducive to the safety or interest of the State than the method of voting viva voce , it shall be lawful and constitutional for the legislature to abolish the same , provided two - thirds of the members present in each house , respectively , shall concur therein .
And further , that , during the continuance of the present war , and until the legislature of this State shall provide for the election of senators and representatives in assembly by ballot , the said election shall be made viva voce .
VII .
That every male inhabitant of full age , who shall have personally resided within one of the counties of this State for six months immediately preceding the day of election , shall , at such election , be entitled to vote for representatives of the said county in assembly ; if , during the time aforesaid , he shall have been a freeholder , possessing a freehold of the value of twenty pounds , within the said county , or have rented a tenement therein of the yearly value of forty shillings , and been rated and actually paid taxes to this State : Provided always , That every person who now is a freeman of the city of Albany , or who was made a freeman of the city of New York on or before the fourteenth day of October , in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy - five , and shall be actually and usually resident in the said cities , respectively , shall be entitled to vote for representatives in assembly within his said place of residence .
VIII .
That every elector , before he is admitted to vote , shall , if required by the returning - officer or either of the inspectors , take an oath , or , if of the people called Quakers , an affirmation , of allegiance to the State .
IX .
That the assembly , thus constituted , shall choose their own speaker , be judges of their own members , and enjoy the same privileges , and proceed in doing business in like manner as the assemblies of the colony of New York of right formerly did ; and that a majority of the said members shall , from time to time , constitute a house , to proceed upon business .
X . And this convention doth further , in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State , ordain , determine , and declare , that the senate of the State of New York shall consist of twenty - four freeholders to be chosen out of the body of the freeholders ; and that they be chosen by the freeholders of this State , possessed of freeholds of the value of one hundred pounds , over and above all debts charged thereon .
XI .
That the members of the senate be elected for four years ; and , immediately after the first election , they be divided by lot into four classes , six in each class , and numbered one , two , three , and four ; that the seats of the members of the first class shall be vacated at the expiration of the first year , the second class the second year , and so on continually ; to the end that the fourth part of the senate , as nearly as possible , may be annually chosen .
XII .
That the election of senators shall be after this manner :
That so much of this State as is now parcelled into counties be divided into four great districts ; the southern district to comprehend the city and county of New York , Suffolk , Westchester , Kings , Queens , and Richmond Counties ; the middle district to comprehend the counties of Dutchess , Ulster , and Orange ; the western district , the city and county of Albany , and Tryon County ; and the eastern district , the counties of Charlotte , Cumberland , and Gloucester .
That the senators shall be elected by the freeholders of the said districts , qualified as aforesaid , in the proportions following , to wit : in the southern district , nine ; in the middle district , six ; in the western district , six ; and in the eastern district , three .
And be it ordained , that a census shall be taken , as soon as may be after the expiration of seven years from the termination of the present war , under the direction of the legislature ; and if , on such census , it shall appear that the number of senators is not justly proportioned to the several districts , that the legislature adjust the proportion , as near as may be , to the number of freeholders , qualified as aforesaid , in each district .
(9 ) That when the number of electors , within any of the said districts , shall have increased one twenty - fourth part of the whole number of electors , which .
by the said census , shall be found to be in this State , an additional senator shall be chosen by the electors of such district .
That a majority of the number of senators to be chosen aforesaid shall be necessary to constitute a senate sufficient to proceed upon business ; and that the senate shall , in like manner with the assembly , be the judges of its own members .
And be it ordained , that it shall be in the power of the future legislatures of this State , for the convenience and advantage of the good people thereof , to divide the same into such further and other counties and districts as shall to them appear necessary .
XIII .
And this convention doth further , in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State , ordain , determine , and declare , that no member of this State shall be disfranchised , or deprived of any the rights or privileges secured to the subjects of this State by this constitution , unless by the law of the land , or the judgment of his peers .
XIV .
That neither the assembly or the senate shall have the power to adjourn themselves , for any longer time than two days , without the mutual consent of both .
XV .
That whenever the assembly and senate disagree , a conference shall be held , in the preference of both , and be managed by committees , to be by them respectively chosen by ballot .
That the doors , both of the senate and assembly , shall at all times be kept open to all persons , except when the welfare of the State shall require their debates to be kept secret .
And the journals of all their proceedings shall be kept in the manner heretofore accustomed by the general assembly of the colony of New York ; and except such parts as they shall , as aforesaid , respectively determine not to make public be from day to day ( if the business of the legislature will permit ) published .
XVI .
It is nevertheless provided , that the number of senators shall never exceed one hundred , nor the number of the assembly three hundred ; but that whenever the number of senators shall amount to one hundred , or of the assembly to three hundred , then and in such case the legislature shall , from time to time thereafter , by laws for that purpose , apportion and distribute the said one hundred senators and three hundred representatives among the great districts and counties of this State , in proportion to the number of their respective electors ; so that the representation of the good people of this State , both in the senate and assembly , shall forever remain proportionate and adequate .
XVII .
And this convention doth further , in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State , ordain , determine , and declare that the supreme executive power and authority of this State shall be vested in a governor ; and that statedly , once in every three years , and as often as the seat of government shall become vacant , a wise and descreet freeholder of this State shall be , by ballot , elected governor , by the freeholders of this State , qualified , as before described , to elect senators ; which elections shall be always held at the times and places of choosing representatives in assembly for each respective county ; and that the person who hath the greatest number of votes within the said State shall be governor thereof .

XX .
That a lieutenant - governor shall , at every election of a governor , and as often as the lieutenant - governor shall die , resign , or be removed from office , be elected in the same manner with the governor , to continue in office until the next election of a governor ; and such lieutenant - governor shall , by virtue of his office , be president of the senate , and , upon an equal division , have a casting voice in their decisions , but not vote on any other occasion .
And in case of the impeachment of the governor , or his removal from office , death , resignation , or absence from the State , the lieutenant - governor shall exercise all the power and authority appertaining to the office of governor until another be chosen , or the governor absent or impeached shall return or lie acquitted : Provided , That where the governor shall , with the consent of the legislature , be out of the State , in time of war , at the head of a military force thereof , he shall still continue in his command of all the military force of this State both by sea and land .

XXVI .
That sheriffs and coroners be annually appointed ; and that no person shall be capable of holding either of the said offices more than four years successively ; nor the sheriff of holding any other office at the same time .

XL .
And whereas it is of the utmost importance to the safety of every State that it should always be in a condition of defence ; and it is the duty of every man who enjoys the protection of society to be prepared and willing to defend it ; this convention therefore , in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State , doth ordain , determine , and declare that the militia of this State , at all times hereafter , as well in peace as in war , shall be armed and disciplined , and in readiness for service .
That all such of the inhabitants of this State being of the people called Quakers as , from scruples of conscience , may be averse to the bearing of arms , be therefrom excused by the legislature ; and do pay to the State such sums of money , in lieu of their personal service , as the same ; may , in the judgment of the legislature , be worth .
And that a proper magazine of warlike stores , proportionate to the number of inhabitants , be , forever hereafter , at the expense of this State , and by acts of the legislature , established , maintained , and continued in every county in this State .
XLI .

The Dutch , who began in 1613 to establish trading - posts on the Hudson River claimed jurisdiction over the territory between the Connecticut and the Delaware Rivers , which they called New Netherlands .
The government was vested in " The United New Netherland Company , " chartered in 1616 , and then in " The Dutch West India Company , " chartered in 1621 .
In 1649 a convention of the settlers petitioned the " Lords States - General of the United Netherlands " to grant them " suitable burgher government , " such as their High Mightinesses shall consider adapted to this province , and resembling somewhat the government of our Fatherland , " with certain permanent privileges and exemptions , that they might pursue " the trade of our country , as well along the coast from Terra Nova to Cape Florida as to the West Indies and Europe , whenever our Lord God shall be pleased to permit . "
The directors of the West India Company resented this attempt to shake off their rule , and wrote their director and council at New Amsterdam : " We have already connived as much as possible at the many impertinences of some restless spirits , in the hope that they might be shamed by our discreetness and benevolence , but , perceiving that all kindnesses do not avail , we must , therefore , have recourse to God to Nature and the Law .
We accordingly hereby charge and command your Honors whenever you shall certainly discover any Clandestine Meetings , Conventicles or machinations against our States government or that of our country that you proceed against such malignants in proportion to their crimes . "
These grants embraced all the lands between the w est bank of the Connecticut River and the east bank of Delaware say .
The Duke of York had previously purchased in 1663 the grant of Long Island and other islands on the New E:ngland coast made in 1635 to the Marl of Stirling , and in 1664 he equipped an armed expedition which tool possession of New Amsterdam which was thenceforth called New York .
This conquest was confirmed by the treaty of Credo , in July 1667 .
In July 1673 a Dutch fleet recaptured New York and held it until it was restored to the E:nglish by the treaty of Westminster in February , 1674 .
The second grant was obtained by the Duke of York in July , 1674 to perfect his title .
The original grants are in the New York state Library .
This constitution was framed by a convention which assembled at White Plains July 10 , 1776 , and after repeated adjournments and changes of location terminated its labors at Kingston Sunday evening April 20 1777 , when the constitution was adopted with but one dissenting vote .

The boxes containing the ballots for governor , lieutenant - governor , and senators were returned by the sheriffs to the secretary of state , to be canvassed by a joint committee of the legislature , until March 27 , 1799 , when the system of inspection and canvassing by local wards was introduced . –

The custom of naturalizing aliens by special act was first introduced by the colonial general assembly in 1717 , and was continued by the State legislature until the adoption of the Federal Constitution in 1789 .

Okay , we obviously can't confirm this , but we just got two very interesting images of what certainly looks like a prototype Apple tablet , or what could be the tablet bolted down to a table .
It 's big -- really big -- and it's running what clearly looks like an iPhone app , although we 've never seen an iPhone app with that interface or at that resolution before .
We also see a WiFi icon and a cell service indicator , although tragically there 's no carrier listed .
As far as fakes go , this is as convincing as it gets , so either this is the real deal or someone deserves a hearty congratulations .
On a totally separate note , we also received a tip claiming to have some specs -- we can't verify any of this either , but we 're told that the device will have a 10 - inch screen and look like a larger iPhone with a MacBook - like aluminum back , and that pricing will run $ 800 on contract with Verizon and $ 1000 without when it arrives in March .
We 're also told that the official name remains a secret and that Apple employees are still calling it by the codename of " K48 " -- a name we last heard in May from the same source that pegged the iPhone 3GS exactly .
This source also tells us that the iPhone will be coming to Verizon as well and that we 'll see iLife ' 10 tomorrow , but there wo n't be any MacBook updates .
A relatively safe set of predictions -- which is why we sort of believe them .
Just 13 hours to go -- we 'll find out if any of this is the real deal soon enough .
Based on some rough measurements , that screen does appear to be between 9 - and 10 - inches diagonal .
Additionally , it looks as though there could be a front - facing camera on the opposite side of the home button ( up top in these photos ) due to that cutout section , though the images are really too grainy to know for certain . :
Our source has shared another photograph , this time showing an iPhone resting on the tablet for comparison .
Check it out after the break ( bigger image for inspection available in the gallery ) . :
Gizmodo managed to snag some images of what appears to be the back of the tablet from Chinese forum WeiPhone before they were mysteriously yanked .
WeiPhone is the same forum that leaked the K48 name way back when , so who knows -- the image shows what could be RF testing , but one of them feels kind of render -y to us .
Check 'em all in the gallery !

The hearing of the Commissioner - designate for trade Karel de Gucht started a while ago .
The former Belgian foreign minister and member of the European Parliament puts as his first priority in his written replies to the Parliament the conclusion of the Doha Round negotiations .
The EU has for decades been one of the strongest supporters of the multilateral trade architecture and this is the reason why Mr. De Gucht intends to continue to support the creation of a global , effective and enforceable system of rules for open trade .
According to the Belgian candidate , this would prevent the protectionist spiral seen in the Great Depression .
Secondly , the former Belgian foreign minister points out the conclusion of free trade agreement with India , the ASEAN countries ( South - Eastern Asia and the Pacific coast ) , Ukraine , Canada , the Mediterranean .
In addition , according to Karel de Gucht , relations with key economic players , such as , for instance , the US , China , Japan or Russia also need to be reinforced .
The third priority , enlisted by the Belgian candidate , will be to ensure that trade policy becomes an integral part of this Commission 's vision of Europe in 2020 and to be integrated in most European policies so that citizens can benefit from it too .
13:45 Karel de Gucht was asked very interesting questions and he replied well and relatively well prepared .
One of the hardest questions was related to the conclusion of a trade agreement with Russia , as it is described in the second priority of the Belgian candidate .
The question was whether such an agreement would mark the beginning of a new strategic partnership with Moscow and about the non-tariff barriers .
The Commissioner - designate for trade answered a little bit eloquently regarding the agreement with Russia but recalled that when concluding agreements the EU always puts conditions .
And regarding the non-tariff barriers , Karel de Gucht said that this was one of the most serious problems of international trade and that this issue can be solved best on a bilateral basis .
De Gucht supports Russia 's membership to the WTO ( World Trade Organisation ) but he added that this would depend on Russia itself .
He said that currently Moscow was acting in contradiction to the responsibilities and commitments it took with the EU about its membership to the WTO .
According to De Gucht , this is a very sensitive issue .
However , he could not finish his reply because his 2 minutes for reply expired .
The Belgian candidate was also asked about his opinion what was the reason for the lack of success at the Doha Round so far and what his plans were to take the negotiations to a reasonable conclusion .
According to De Gucht , 90 % of the topics , discussed in the Doha Round would end with an agreement in 2011 .
Without mentioning any further details Karel De Gucht said that the main problem in these negotiations were the agriculture subsidies : " ... it 's just that there are still differences in opinion on some issues , predominantly in the field of agriculture " .
This is related to the requirement of the poor and developing countries the rich ones to remove their agriculture subsidies because this makes the farmers ' production from the developing world uncompetitive on the markets of the developed nations like the US , the EU , Japan , Canada and the rest of the rich countries .
Asked whether the EU should not change its position in the Doha Round because of the new realities - the crisis , climate change , poverty , human rights , etc. the Commissioner - designate said that the EU had always supported development and that climate change was a very important issue which might best be addressed within the WTO .
Karel de Gucht was asked a very interesting question by a British MEP about how the Commissioner - designate would manage to represent internationally the interests of 27 member states which have different interests and different levels of development .
Mr. De Gucht explained that nevertheless the difficulties , the single representation in all cases was better than 27 representatives .
The Bulgarian MEP from ALDE Metin Kazak asked the candidate about the link between the common foreign policy and the common trade and about the cooperation between Karel de Gucht and the new representative for external relations .
According to the Belgian candidate , the common trade policy is an integral part of the common foreign policy , although it has its own peculiarities and specifics .
He added , that there could not be a problem between him and Lady Ashton at least because until recently she was in his chair as a Commissioner for trade .
13:53 The hearing of Karel de Gucht ended after a little more than 3 hours of questioning on many and different issues , related to international trade , anti-dumping measures , support for ailing industries , bilateral agreements and the combination of protection of interests and human rights violations by some countries with which the EU has or intends to conclude trade agreements .
According to the chairmanship of the parliamentary Committee on International Trade , Mr. De Gucht appeared to be a very well prepared Commissioner - designate .
The hearing was a remarkable example of European democracy - open questions , clear answers , the chairman of the Committee Vital Moreira from Portugal said at the end of the hearing .
However , although most of the members of the Committee were satisfied with his presentation , there was criticism that he was not very convincing in explaining how he would bring to an end the Doha Round negotiations and what his plans were regarding anti-dumping measures .
Brendan Shanahan tells a story , which he repeated Thursday on NHL commissioner Gary Bettman ’s satellite radio show , about growing up as a Maple Leafs fan and meeting former Toronto captain Rick Vaive during the summer of 1983 .
“ When I was 14 years old I was skating in the summertime at a rink in Toronto , ” Shahanan recalled .
“ Rick Vaive happened to be skating at an adjoining rink and we were actually in dressing rooms that were right next to each other .
“ I went in when he was sort of settled and asked him for an autograph .
I did n’t get the best response from Rick Vaive at that time . ”
It was not a moment Shanahan would forget .
The Devils made him their first selection and the second overall pick in the 1987 entry draft and he went straight to the NHL as a rookie with the team in 1987 - 88 .
“ Fast forward four years later and Rick Vaive is waiting for a meaningless faceoff in Buffalo , ” Shanahan said .
“ He ’s now playing for the Sabres .
He ’s lined up next to some 18 - year - old kid from New Jersey .
When the puck dropped , I attacked Rick Vaive .
“ It was a quiet , uneventful game .
He could n’t believe the rage I had , not only in attacking him , but it took two ( linesmen ) to restrain me afterwards and throw me in the penalty box . ”
Vaive was dumbfounded .
“ He said to one of my teammates at the time , Jim Korn , ‘ By the way , what ’s wrong with that kid and why was he coming after me ? ’ ” Shanahan recounted .
“ Jim Korn said , ‘ Apparently he asked you for an autograph when he was a little kid and you were n’t that friendly to him .
So he ’s harbored those feelings since then . ’ ”
Now that Shahanan is working for the league as vice - president of hockey and business development , the Devils can only hope he does n’t still hold grudges , because the way he was cut loose from the team just before the regular season began left him somewhat stunned .
“ I would be lying if I said it did n’t come as a little bit of a shock , ” Shanahan said in a conference call with reporters .
“ Looking back now , I can say that , although it was just another exhibition game that sort of goes under the radar , I got the puck late in the third period and scored a goal on the last shot I took on net .
“ So that ’s not the worst way to finish .
But I was disappointed .
At the same time , I immediately tried to focus on the future and moving ahead .
You know , I ’ve reached out to my teammates there , obviously , to thank them and tell them what a good experience I had there .
But I think very shortly after getting over that initial shock , I started moving forward and thinking ahead . ”
Shanahan said he had a chance to hook on somewhere else .
“ I think I did take some time away from the game to sort of really reflect on whether I wanted to go somewhere else and play a 22nd season , ” he said .
“ There were a couple of teams I was in contact that had expressed some interest to my agent with that were a little further away . ”
So he decided to take a position with the league .
At some point he might consider a role as general manager or coach , but not likely .
“ It has not been that long since I left the ice , ” he said .
“ Right now I ’m just really excited about doing my job here at the NHL and having an opportunity to work on the hockey side , but also learn the business side .
There is so much to be learned and I am really excited about the opportunity .
I ’ll be seeing a lot of the off - ice business , but I ’ll be watching a lot of games and it ’s also my intention to be at a lot of games . ”
The league certainly knows that his memory is good .
There is a postscript to the Vaive story .
“ Three years ago , he came up to me at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto and introduced me to his 14 - year - old son , ” Shanahan said .
“ I signed the autograph , took a picture and gave him a piggy - back .
I did n’t want karma to come back and get me . ”

Kommentar Ressidenzpflicht : Ohne Passierschein nach Berlin
Für viele waren Verstöße gegen die Ressidenzpflicht eine passende Gelegenheit , Asylbewerber zu kriminalisieren und so ihren Aufenthalt hier zu erschweren .
Die geplante Abschaffung der Residenzpflicht ist ein erfreulicher Einstieg in die gemeinsame Politik der nun beide rot -rot regierten Nachbarländer Berlin und Brandenburg .
Die Residenzpflicht zwingt Asylbewerber und geduldete Flüchtlinge bei Androhung von Strafe , den ihnen als Aufenthaltsort zugeteilten Bezirk oder Landkreis nicht ohne behördliche Genehmigung zu verlassen .
Als Teil des Asylverfahrensgesetzes ist sie Bundesrecht .
Gerade in ländlichen Gebieten wie Brandenburg bringt sie oft handfeste Nachteile : Beratungsstellen oder kompetente FachanwältInnen sind so nur mit immer wieder einzuholender Erlaubnis erreichbar .
Besuche bei bereits in Deutschland lebenden Freunden und Familienangehörigen oder Anlaufstellen der Community werden erschwert - und damit genau das Andocken bei denjenigen , die als integrative Brücke in die Mehrheitsgesellschaft dienen könnten .
Kein Wunder , dass Verstöße gegen die Residenzpflicht die Mehrzahl der Rechtsverstöße von Asylbewerbern darstellen .
Das kann für diese böse Folgen haben :
Wer auf diese Weise zum " Mehrfachkriminellen " wird , vermasselt sich als langjährig geduldeter Flüchtling etwa das Recht auf sicheren Aufenthalt nach der Altfallregelung .
Doch die Folgen der von Flüchtlingsorganisationen als Menschenrechtsverstoß bewerteten Residenzpflicht kommen manchen auch zupass : Bietet sich ihnen doch die Möglichkeit , auf die " hohe Kriminalitätsrate " von Flüchtlingen und Asylsuchern hinzuweisen .
Länder können diese aus Bundesrecht entstehende Schikane durch eigene Verordnungen aufheben , so das Ergebnis eines juristischen Gutachtens des Flüchtlingsrates Brandenburg .
Schön wäre , wenn andere Länder dem Beispiel folgten - auf die Abschaffung auf Bundesebene darf derzeit wohl kaum gehofft werden .

One of the most important political stories next year will be the way high unemployment affects voter attitudes and behavior .
Some new estimates from the economic analysts at IHS Global Insight indicate just how big a factor unemployment figures to be — and how unevenly its effects may be felt , in the real world and in the political realm .
In a new report , IHS projects that a year from now — that is , just about at the time of the 2010 mid-term election – “ payrolls will be rising in most metros for consecutive quarters . ”
Payrolls up :
That sounds like good news .
But here ’s the kicker : Despite this likely rise in payrolls , “ the unemployment rate will have shown little improvement , as employment gains will not be sufficient to absorb enough job seekers . ”
That means an economically stressed electorate , raising questions of whether voters will be inclined to take out their anxieties on Democrats now in charge in Washington , or on incumbents running for re-election in general .
Yet the effects of this lingering unemployment — and , presumably , its political fallout — will hardly be uniform .
IHS forecasts that a third of the nation ’s metropolitan areas will have jobless rates in double digits in the fourth quarter of next year , and that 16 metro areas will have jobless rates exceeding 15 % .
The pain figures to be worst in California , which will have nine metro areas with jobless rates exceeding 15 % .
Michigan will have three , and Arizona , Florida , Illinois and Indiana one each .
Things figure to be better by time President Barack Obama runs for re-election , but far from perfect : “ By the end of 2012 , the jobless rate will still be above historic norms , but it will finally slip below 8 % in more than half of metro areas , ” IHS says .
To celebrate the release of the Iron Man 2 movie , Superherohype - forums member Masterle 247 is building a replica of War Machine ’s costume , complete with all his gadgets .
Masterle 247 posted some cool photos of his work so far , and I have to say it already looks very impressive .
The suit is made up of high impact urethane pieces , held together by around 600 rivets , it features a shoulder minigun and rockets , an arc reactor , light - up eyes and even repulsor gauntlets .
But Masterle 247 says his creation is far from finished .
He wants to make his war Machine costume bulkier , more tank - like , so every part of his body is covered when he wears it .
I ’m really glad War Machine and Iron Man will be able to get together in real life soon .
Oh , if you guys really meet , make sure you take some photos and send them over .
Research from The National Institute of Mental Health has revealed that popular Attention Deficit Disorder ( ADD ) drugs like Ritalin are responsible for causing sudden death in many children .
Study numbers indicate a 500 percent increased risk in childhood death from taking such mental health drugs .
For years , many experts , scientists , and health practitioners have speculated that ADD drugs are dangerous and can cause serious injury and death .
Etta Brown , a licensed educational psychologist and author of Learning Disabilities : Understanding the Problem and Managing the Challenges , explained in response to the study that drugs like Ritalin actually destroy the neural function in children 's brains .
As a result , children who have undergone treatment with Ritalin will actually have a much more difficult time processing information and learning new things .
Brown also notes that Ritalin is responsible for causing a permanent tic in the face , neck , and head of many of the children who have taken or are taking it .
Ironically , Ritalin is responsible for causing far more serious neurological damage than the problems it is alleged to treat .
Comprehensive studies over the years have revealed that while drugs like Ritalin visibly calm children , these drugs destroy their delicate , developing nervous systems and can permanently cripple their ability to function as normal human beings .
Ritalin remains one of the primary drugs prescribed for children with supposed behavioral problems .
Rather than be encouraged to modify diet and increase exercise , children are being given drugs by their doctors instead .
Increases in behavioral and learning problems among children have been increasing right alongside escalating levels of environmental toxins .
Children are also spending more time at home alone while their parents work , eating greater amounts of junk food , and not getting adequate sleep .
Etta Brown , and others , suggest better nutrition , adequate sleep , and increased exercise and physical activity as a proper treatment for children with behavioral and learning disabilities .
Nutrition alone is of vital importance since inadequate nutrient intake is arguably the most significant factor in children 's inability to behave and learn .
Proper brain function cannot be achieved if the brain is not being fed what it needs to process information and grow .
Parental guidance in regulating and maintaining a proper lifestyle for their children is also vital if true improvement is ever to be achieved .
Medical professionals , child psychologists , and others will have to come to grips with the fact that drugs are not the answer to childhood developmental problems .
In a film - making career spanning almost 40 years , Oliver Stone has turned political controversy in America into an art form .
He has upset financiers with his caustic portrayal of Wall Street ; conservatives with his depiction of Fidel Castro , Hugo Chávez and George Bush ; and Democrats with his conspiracy theories about the assassination of John F Kennedy .
All of which may come to look like a tea party – of the social as opposed to right - wing protest variety – when his next big venture hits the screens .
Stone announced yesterday that a 10 - hour crash course in the history of the 20th century he is putting together for American TV is designed as an antidote to the inaccuracies and biases he believes exist in the conventional historical narrative dished out in American schools and mainstream media .
The title alone gives an inkling of what lies ahead : Oliver Stone 's Secret History of America .
The thrice - Oscar winning director gave a further glimpse into his thinking at a gathering of TV critics in Pasadena on Saturday , when he did n't so much open up a can of worms as unleash an entire supermarket shelf - load .
He began by startling the panel by bringing up the H word .
" Hitler is an easy scapegoat throughout history and it's been used cheaply , " he said .
Then he mentioned the S word .
" Stalin has a complete other story .
Not to paint him as a hero , but to tell a more factual representation .
He fought the German war machine more than any person . "
Then he went on to mention two M words – Chairman Mao and Joseph McCarthy , architect of the 1950s anti-communist purges in Washington , and the T word – Harry Truman 's dropping of the atom bomb in 1945 .
Of the many potential storms that could be brewing over his Secret History , which will be broadcast by the cable channel Showtime later this year , Hitler promises to be the most incendiary .
Stone told the Television Critics Association that " we can't judge people as only ' bad ' or ' good ' .
[ Hitler ] is the product of a series of actions .
It 's cause and effect .
People in America do n't know the connection between WWI and WWII . "
The implication that Stone is seeking to put forward a good side of the German dictator hitherto not seen by Americans is , even by Stone 's own accomplished record of stirring up stinks , pretty radical .
The comment inspired Stone 's collaborator on his Secret History , Peter Kuznick , a history professor at the Washington - based American University , to tell the audience of television critics and , in an apparent damage - limitation exercise : " He 's not saying we 're going to come out with a more positive view of Hitler .
But we 're going to describe him as a historical phenomenon . "
Even so , such a relativist approach to Hitler as a product of his time as much as an individual embodiment of evil is likely to prove hot material .
Stone said he would similarly put Stalin " in context " .
" I 've been able to walk in Stalin 's shoes and Hitler 's shoes , to understand their point of view .
You cannot approach history unless you have empathy for the person you may hate . "
Within hours of the comments being made , they had begun , in the predictable pattern of such things , to effervesce on the internet like yeast in dough .
A blogger by the pen name Orphia Nay summed up the billowing emotion : " Ohhhhhh , this is not going to end well , " she wrote .
Others were less temperate .
" Again , another ' blame America first ' person .
If he / they hate it , just leave it .
We 'll all have a party and help you pack .
You wo n't even have a full body scan . "
Say what you will about Stone , he can't be accused of opting for the easy life .
His 2006 film on 9/11 , World Trade Center , was both critically acclaimed and a box office hit , with an appeal to all political persuasions .
Next he bounced back with a sharp portrait of George Bush in W .
Then he made South of the Border , his glowing portrayal of Chávez as champion of the poor which premiered at the Venice film festival in September where Stone appeared with Chávez on his arm .
His Wall Street 2 , with Michael Douglas reprising Gordon Gekko , is in post - production ; it 's a fair bet that the money men will come off no better this time than they did the last .
Now his Secret History .
" Obviously , Rush Limbaugh is not going to like this history , " Stone told the TV critics , which may go down as one of the great understatements of all time .
Courting controversy
• JFK ( 1990 ) Caused a furore by asserting that JF Kennedy 's vice - president and successor , Lyndon B Johnson , was involved in the president 's assassination in Dallas in 1963 along with CIA agents and anti-Castro exiles .
One critic called it " a monstrous charade ' '
• Natural Born Killers ( 1994 )
A savage portrayal of a young couple 's killing spree .
Intended as a satire on the media 's obsession with violence , the film was subsequently linked with a series of copycat murders
• Comandante ( 2003 ) A US network postponed Stone 's documentary on Fidel Castro , following a crackdown on dissidents by the Cuban leader .
Stone spent three days with him n 2002 to make the film but was accused of being too sympathetic
• W ( 2008 ) Even before release , Stone 's portrayal of former president George W Bush had rightwing columnists and bloggers condemning it as a vicious smear although the New York Times was among those who thought " he ( Stone ) goes easier on Mr. Bush on screen than some of his off - screen remarks suggest

Having already won the coveted “ Lie of the Year ” award from PolitiFact , it is time that we recognize Sarah Palin for the truly superlative accomplishment of her brief public tenure .
It is an achievement for which she has no peer .
She has masterfully positioned herself as the undisputed champion in this highly specialized calling .
Congratulations Sarah Palin , for being this year ’s most “ Pitiful , Sniveling , Coward . ”
The path to victory for Palin was characterized by her trademarked apprehension of , and disdain for , the press .
Palin ’s fear of the media is an all - consuming neurosis .
She has exhibited these tendencies beginning with her initial introduction to the national stage .
After being tapped by John McCain as his vice - presidential running mate , Palin immediately ducked for cover .
From the earliest days of the campaign , Palin sought the refuge of friendly inquisitors like Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren .
Needless to say , Fox News had a virtually exclusive relationship with Palin .
That was smart strategy on the part of Palin and her handlers with the McCain staff .
On the rare occasions that she strayed from the protective cocoon of Fox she was stymied by brain twisters like “ What do you read ? ”
Nevertheless , she pretends to have an interest in being accessible .
At least that ’s what she told Carl Cameron of Fox News :
Palin ,
10/3/08 : “ I look forward to speaking to the media more and more everyday and providing whatever access the media would want .
My life is certainly an open book . ”
For something she claims to look forward to , she sure did avoid it like the plague .
Palin ’s fear is palpable .
She runs from the press like a Tea Bagger from a library ( the Teadiots really hate that “ socialist ” style distribution of elitist books containing “ information ” ) .
Throughout the campaign , and to this day more than a year later , Palin has declined to appear on any of the Sunday news programs .
Not even Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace .
She has not held a single press conference .
And in a fit of uncharacteristic candor , she even admitted that she resigned her governorship to avoid further press scrutiny .
Quitting , of course , is just another manifestation of her renowned chicken - heartedness .
So how does a media - phobe like Palin conduct herself in a public sphere that demands access and fresh bones on which to chew ?
By hiding behind a curtain of social media , an online version of a one - way mirror .
Palin tweets and posts updates on her Facebook account as a means to communicate with her legion of fans .
The problem is that the press seems to regard this as an appropriate method of interaction and they faithfully regurgitate every keystroke as if it were newsworthy .
It is n’t .
The media seems to be oblivious to the absurdity of reporting Palin ’s tweets .
First of all , they do n’t even know if they are from Palin or her ghostwriter .
Secondly , there is no opportunity to question her about her comments .
These postings are nothing more ( and actually something much less ) than press releases .
Why do newsrooms on television and in print feel the least bit obligated to pass them on ?
And when they do so , why do n’t bother to at least fact - check them ?
By cowering behind an Internet firewall , Palin can shoot spitballs at the press and quickly duck back into her shelter .
For that she deserves to be the Pitiful , Sniveling , Coward Of The Year .
But what award do we give the news media ?
They present an even bigger problem by letting Palin get away with her cheap shots and cheesy antics .
In some respects you can hardly blame Palin .
She must know deep down that she ’s a woefully unprepared dimwit who was elevated to national prominence by a fluke of political desperation .
She has to behave this way now or risk further embarrassment .
But the press has no such excuse .
So far this month , Palin has criticized Nancy Pelosi , Eugene Robinson , Arnold Schwarzenegger , Al Gore , and of course , President Obama , from the safety of her Facebook page .
This sort of attack plan assures that she is shielded from return fire .
It is a sterile battlefield that she controls and from which she need not worry about pesky rebuttals or corrections .
She also took a couple of swipes at the press who still , for some reason , obediently yield to her siren ’s call .
If the media is to preserve whatever crumbs of credibility they are clinging to , they need to start exhibiting signs of life .
They need to start acting like professionals .
And that means that they need to ignore Sarah Palin .
If Palin will not stand before them and engage in a substantive dialogue , then let her tweet to her followers and enjoy her fame the same way other celebrities like Ashton Kutcher and Lindsay Lohan do .
Let her sign books at church picnics .
Let her go on Dancing with the Stars .
But do n’t under any circumstances patronize her contempt for the practice of journalism .
Do n’t be played for suckers .
Do n’t be seduced by the short - term attention rush you get from recounting Sarah ’s latest online insipidness .
That ’s not reporting .
That ’s just repeating .
And the public deserves more than that from the press .
Palin ’s tweets , books and fluff pieces on Fox do nothing to contribute to the public ’s understanding of her or her positions .
If she persists in ignoring the media , then the media must ignore her back .
When she wants to behave like an adult public figure and political leader who will address the issues of the day , then the press can pay her some attention .
Until then , who cares ?
Twitter is not proxy for honest , informative discourse .
Facebook does n’t replace old fashioned newsgathering .
If Palin wo n’t or ca n’t interact with news people , then she is n’t news .
Walk away .
Do n’t look back .
You ’re not missing anything .

Today 's entry by Anthony Vukojevich is no exception , melding " Fantastic Four " # 26 with retro video game classic " Donkey Kong . "
Featuring the combined might of the Avengers and the FF , the 8 - bit rendition both captures and enhances the spirit of its source with the Hulk standing in for DK and his contemporaries taking the place of Mario .
It 's interesting to note Wasp 's apparent death only costs the theoretical player ten points , but I guess the relative lack of fan outcry after her " Secret Invasion " explosion can pretty much be summed up the same way .

Israeli Study Finds Marijuana May Help Alleviate PTSD Synptoms
A recent scientific study in Israel has found marijuana may help alleviate PTSD and reverse the effects of stress on memory processes .
The study was conducted by members of the psychology department at Israel 's University of Haifa .
It was published in The Journal of Neuroscience .
Together , our findings may support a wide therapeutic application for cannabinoids in the treatment of conditions associated with the inappropriate retention of aversive memories and stress - related disorders .

How al Qaeda Dupes Its Followers
Last week , five young men from northern Virginia and Washington , D.C. , were arrested in Pakistan , alleged to have been eager volunteers for a terrorist - linked militant group in a region rife with insurgency .
The facts remain sparse so far , but this would not be the first time since the Sept. 11 attacks that Americans have left their country to heed al Qaeda ’s call to arms .
These men , however , look different — at least from the outside .
The FBI explained that the five do n’t fit the typical profile of a militant supporter of al Qaeda , the Christian Science Monitor reported .
They were from the middle class , educated , and not visibly marginalized from American society .
Their grievances were not readily apparent .
In fact , these men fit exactly the profile that the FBI and the world should now come to expect : no profile at all .
A militant ’s profile lies not in his age , race , culture , or education ; anyone can join or be adopted by the al Qaeda network , the only prerequisite being a willingness to accept the group ’s radical , cult like ideology .
So if there is a lesson to be learned from these recent arrests , it is that profiling wo n’t work .
We need something better .
According to family members and those who knew them , the five were hooked in by radical messages of precisely the sort that al Qaeda is known for .
They are thought to have watched the militant rhetoric on YouTube , enough to encourage them to take the trip abroad .
Across the world , al Qaeda encourages could - be recruits to do exactly the same — to become muhajiroun or " émigrés " who move away from non militant communities , families , and friends to join the brotherhood of armed jihadists .
Indeed , one of the young men abandoned his career in dental school ; another left his family only a farewell video promising to defend Islam .
Such a desertion seems at first unfathomable .
But al Qaeda succeeds because , for more than two decades , the network has waged a successful information campaign that pushes its message out to the world as effectively asymmetrical as its use of suicide bombers on the battlefield .
Al Qaeda has dominated the battlefield of the soul among the disaffected , disenfranchised , and dissatisfied .
It promises action instead of discussion .
It avows to defend Islam through suicide bombings and mass murder .
( Recovered jihadists are often horrified to learn , with the help of mainstream clerics , that they have been duped by a fantastical corruption of Islam , best called bin Ladenism . )
Indeed , so persuasive is the rhetoric that al Qaeda regularly convinces converts to reject 1,431 years of Islamic teachings in favor of a mission whose intention is the destruction and re-engineering of Islam itself .
Osama bin Laden has managed to replace fear of God and adherence to the Quran with his philosophy of jihad above all else .
What ’s behind that facade is the true philosophical intentions of al Qaeda : the establishment of a new Islamic caliphate that will defeat democracy as the greater of the two political orders .
Al Qaeda ’s leaders seek to reverse what they claim are corrupt Islamic practices bookended by the Mongol invasions in 1256 and Ataturk ’s ending the caliphate in 1924 .
Theirs is a fight to turn Islam ’s clock back to the time of Prophet Muhammad ’s original followers .
How does al Qaeda do it ?
The network has perfected the art of turning fantastically corrupt ideas into mainstream , cultist philosophy .
Back when al Qaeda first began its campaign , it targeted individuals though face - to - face distribution of militant lectures on cassette tapes , locally produced books , and pamphlets .
The network leapt at the opportunity to harness the Internet beginning around 1995 , which al Qaeda used to spread its word unencumbered until 2001 .
The Web ’s endless reach magnified a once - localized message .
Meanwhile , the message also became more universally appealing to the dispossessed : Come fight in a brotherhood of men who give up their homes , families , and lives to live as a nomadic knights .
Be part of something .
Return Islam to its seventh - century origins .
Recruits would embody the mythology they were being told .
And all they needed was a few household chemicals , a soft target , and the desire to die .
But bin Laden can be defeated by his own game .
Saudi Arabia , Jordan , Libya , Algeria , and Indonesia have successfully broken up al Qaeda wings using appeals to save the souls of the misguided , breaking recruitment and logistics support from within the community .
These countries have realized that bullets cannot kill terror in their midst , and their rehabilitation programs are focused on training the militants with a counterideology .
Mentors and counselors show deep concern for the physical and spiritual well - being of the former militants , asking them to debate with Islamic scholars who bring the ex-terrorists to see the cause itself as so un-Islamic that the end result in the next life could only be damnation .
Militants meet with others who have renounced terrorism , and their redemption and forgiveness are linked with accepting a new worldview .
The arrest of these five in Pakistan is just one of several recent examples of the stakes .
Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan , the Fort Hood shooter , may also have found a path to militancy through Internet - disseminated rhetoric .
Every such arrest should go one step further to disproving terrorist stereotypes .
What ’s really at work here is not any one man ’s disposition ; it ’s an ideology packaged to kill .

House and Senate negotiations for the 2010 Appropriations bill have been completed .
This is the huge federal budget bill and it just so happens that Washington DC is a federal district and its spending is controlled by Congress .
In 1998 , DC passed a medical marijuana bill overwhelmingly , but Congressional drug warriors led by Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia prevented DC from spending any federal money to count the votes ( that ’s right , in our democracy ’s capital , our leaders conspired to prevent citizens from counting votes in a legal election ) .
When that was deemed unconstitutional , they spent the money to count the votes , showing that 69 % of DC supported medical marijuana .
So Rep .
Barr created the “ Barr Amendment ” that prevented DC from spending any money to implement the medical marijuana program they had voted in .
Well , today ’s 2010 Appropriations bill changes all that .
In addition to removing bans on abortion , domestic partnerships , and needle exchange , Congress has given the go - ahead to begin implementing DC medical marijuana !
( US Senate ) Removing Special Restrictions on the District of Columbia : Eliminates a prohibition on the use of local tax funds for abortion , thereby putting the District in the same position as the 50 states .
Also allows the District to implement a referendum on use of marijuana for medical purposes as has been done in other states , allows use of Federal funds for needle exchange programs except in locations considered inappropriate by District authorities , and discontinues a ban on the use of funds in the bill for domestic partnership registration and benefits .
DC ’s medical marijuana bill was written with the same sort of open language as was passed in California … will we be seeing marijuana dispensaries on K Street anytime soon ?

In its basic concept , capitalism should be about people making things for other people , and making a decent wage for doing so .
Then the people for whom the goods are made sell them for more than it cost to make them .
Some of those sales will be to the people who made the stuff , and some will be to third parties unrelated to the manufacturing process .
Now , if I ’m the guy who owns the company that makes the stuff , I ’ve probably invested my own money ; or I ’m at least responsible for repaying funds loaned to me by someone else .
That means I ’ve taken some personal risk , and the reward I can achieve for assuming that risk is called profit .
So far , so good .
But it has never quite worked that way , for one reason and only one reason – greed .
Economists have thousands of fancy charts and graphs to deflect us from this reality , and a litany of arcane explanations ; but the simple reason is greed .
The main problem for us , though , is that capitalism is the only choice we have .
How do I know that ?
Because a world of experts tells me so – nearly every day .
Typically , those experts are among the group most likely to benefit from having me believe this .
They are the business class , along with their functionaries and apologists , who infest the universities , mainstream media , and politics .
Capitalism is not a choice , they inform us ; it is the proper natural condition of the world .
And we are reassured that those who argue against capitalism are , well , bewildered , or confused , or maybe just plain crazy .
Capitalism is what we ’re told we have ; corporatism is what we really have .
It ’s predatory , it ’s vicious , it ’s driven by the overbearing impulse to manufacture crap we do n’t need , to build obsolescence and short life into most of the stuff we buy .
It ’s driven not by those people who were willing to put their own hearts and souls into a business for which they accept the personal risks and rewards ; instead , it ’s in the thrall of soulless and morally insufficient corporations .
The people who run those corporations are shielded from any personal risk , personal responsibility , or moral imperative .
Their sole goals are to line the pockets of shareholders , and themselves .
And capitalism as we live it and practice it today is failing .
So if this is the best we have , can the end for us all be very far behind ?
Capitalism ( even when wearing a corporatist hat ) is incredibly productive .
It produces a flood of goods , although no one questions whether that ’s a good thing .
But it is also a system that is fundamentally anti-democratic , unsustainable , and inhuman .
What capitalism gives those of us in the arrogantly - named First World is lots of stuff , in exchange for any hope of progressive government , the possibility of a livable future for our children , and our very souls .
So how is capitalism anti-democratic ?
Well , we have to remember that democracy ’s promise is that it gives ordinary people a meaningful way to participate in the formation of public policy , rather than a mere subsidiary role in ratifying decisions made by the powerful .
But capitalism is a wealth - concentrating system , and common sense tells us that when you concentrate wealth , you concentrate power .
And we all understand that the wealthy and powerful dictate public policy to politicians .
Clearly , then , capitalism and democracy are mutually exclusive .
Average Betty may have the same number of votes as Bill Gates , but no one seriously believes she has as much influence on public and social policy as Bill .
The unsustainability of capitalism should be obvious to anyone with more than half a brain .
In case you had n’t noticed , this is the only planet we have .
And all the stuff that ’s on it , and in it , will eventually run out .
Despite wild - eyed dreams to the contrary , this is the only place we are ever going to live , and there is nothing much we can do about the limited resources .
Oh sure , some technology improvements might squeeze a little more out of what we have ; but eventually it ’ll all be gone .
It is completely delusional not to accept this reality .
Now , capitalism may not be the only unsustainable system that humans have developed , but it ’s the most obviously unsustainable and it appears to be what we ’re stuck with – because there is no other way , right ?
Because it ’s natural , and inevitable , like the air , right ?
The inhumanity of capitalism is a little harder to prove , but it is rather obvious .
The theory of contemporary capitalism is that we are greedy , self - interested creatures – homo economicus .
Well , are we greedy ?
Of course we are – all of us , to some degree .
But we are also capable of selflessness , of compassion .
We can engage in aggressive and passionate competition , but we also have a capacity for cooperation and solidarity .
So if our own acts and actions are so widely varied , why must we have the choice only of an economic system that deliberately strengthens our most inhumane traits and undermines the most decent aspects of our nature ?
No matter where you look , you ’ll find greed and the pursuit of self - interest .
Which leads us to accept the proposition that the greedy , self - interested aspects of our nature are dominant .
But that ’s because we ’re forced into a system that rewards greed and self - interested behaviour .
It ’s a circular argument – if greed and self - interest are n’t rewarded , they do n’t tend to rise to the surface ; where they are rewarded , it ’s like leading pigs to a trough .
We appear to have lost sight of the fact that an economic system does n’t just produce goods and services .
It also produces people , because we are all shaped by our work experiences and the goods we consume .
If we spend all our time and money consuming cheap crap in a desperate effort to dull the pain of unfulfilling work , where are we going to end up ?
The first step in our rehabilitation is calling the capitalist system what it is : anti-democratic , unsustainable , inhuman .
Once we ’ve accepted that reality , it ’ll make it easier to begin a move to a system that is less predatory .
It can not be true that the only way to run this world is with a system in which the slime rises to the top while half the world lives in abject poverty .
Fighting against capitalism is not crazy ; struggling for a sustainable future and democratic societies is not crazy .
And it is certainly not crazy to work toward holding on to our humanity .

Paul Richard Harris , Editor , Axis of Logic
I thought about noding this after reading evidence for lack of intelligent design in humans .
I thought about adding this as a w/u there , but it does n't quite fit in with what I want to say .
The human body has several organs that do n't make sense .
The two most obvious are the appendix and the sacral bone .
The appendix , as you may or may not know , is a " pocket " at the end of your large intestine .
Stuff acummulates in it .
If you 're lucky , you never know it 's there .
If you 're unlucky , doctors have to take it out , because it becomes inflamed .
If you 're very unlucky , it explodes , and you die .
( Seriously , my dad 's appendix burst .
He almost died . )
So what is it good for ?
In cows , it help with digestion .
In humans , it is mostly good for interns who need to practice simple operations .
It has no useful function .
It is proof humans evolved from cows .
( kidding ) .
The sacrum , or tail bone , is just what it is .
It 's what really hurts what you bang the top of your bum .
It serves no purpose , other than looking funny on X - rays .
Unless you are a devout non-believer in evolution , you 'll agree it's a remnant of a tail .
Proof humans evolved from lemurs .
( kidding again ) .
And now to my personal favourite : the palmaris longus muscle .
This is a muscle in your forearm .
Actually , it 's a muscle that 90 % of people have in both forearms .
It 's a flexor muscle for the hand .
It lies just under the flexor carpi radialis .
Bunch your hand up into a fist .
Now flex your hand ( this means that , palm up , bring your hand towards you ) .
How many tendons do you see ?
If you see just one , that 's the flexor carpi radialis .
If you see two , that 's the fcr and the palmaris longus .
We do n't need it .
It 's a weak muscle that is not useful .
Less and less people have it every generation .
Like I said , 10 % of the population have it missing in one or both arms .
There is also a similar muscle in the leg .
And the foot has too many muscles for its function .
The foot has about as many muscles as the hand .
See what you can do with your hand , compared to what you can do with your foot .
It does n't make sense .
Unless we developed from creatures who use their feet much like they use their hands .
Proof humans evolved from koala bears .
( I 'm kidding , enough already ) .
We do n't need to look very far for proof for evolution .
It 's right here .
Azure Monk :
You are right , of course .
Then again , evidence might even be too strong a word .
I chose the word " proof " because it goes well with my bad jokes in the middle .
An URL - shortening service that appears to be tied to the Republican Party is generating , as you might expect , an inordinate amount of political satire .
GOP .am offers the ability to shorten a URL , like Bit.ly or is.gd , for the purposes of Twitter , Facebook , or some other blog .
The site has launched as more well - known Web sites , such as , either launch or test their own URL - shortening services .
There 's one difference , though - the resulting page is framed by a massive banner , on the top and bottom , with a GOP .am logo and the site 's tagline , " Making Long URLs ... Conservative " .
The service is not formally tied to the GOP ; instead , the service is run by Political Media.com , which bills itself as providing political marketing services , among others .
Naturally , Internet wits are busy conflating the GOP and its family - friendly message with all sorts of debauchery .
Balloon - Juice.com is the source of much of it , although I would expect a landrush as more and more sites pile on .
It should be noted that GOP .am does some filtering , either manually or via automated keywords ; " If you use it for spamming , illegal purposes or to promote lude [ sic [ content , your GOP .
AM URL will be disabled , " the site warns .
Somehow , I do n't think that 's going to stop anyone .

SEVEN DAYS A WEEK CLOSED JULY 4TH
THE niece of a British government minister has told a court she drunkenly plunged a knife into the naked body of a Frenchman she picked up in a bar , but had no idea why she did it .
Jessica Davies told her murder trial she had blacked out and had no recollection of the killing except " the sensation of the knife going in " .
" I am horrified by what I have done , " said the 30 - year - old niece of Britain 's multi-millionaire junior defence minister , Quentin Davies .
" I remember telling the police that I was a monster , " she said .
" I do n't remember killing Olivier , but I take responsibility for killing him . "
She said she no longer remembered making a statement on the day of the November 2007 murder that said : " I just wanted to cut him a little , but the knife went in by itself . "
The blood - stained kitchen knife with a 15 cm blade that killed 24 - year - old Olivier Mugnier was passed round for inspection by the three judges and the five women and four men of the jury at the court in Versailles .
Ms Davies , looking pale and drawn and dressed in jeans and a grey top , was giving evidence on the first day of her two - day trial at which the court heard of her dysfunctional family and her troubled adolescence .
Ms Davies , who was born in London to a British father and a French mother and grew up mostly in France , faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison if convicted of voluntary homicide without premeditation .
She said she had begun the weekend that Mugnier died by sleeping with an ex-boyfriend on the Friday night .
She spent most of the Saturday drinking in a series of bars and cafes with friends before going alone to O'Sullivan 's Irish pub near her home , where she met and began flirting with Mugnier .
They had several drinks and when the bar closed decided to go to Davies 's flat in Saint - Germain - en - Laye , a chic Paris suburb .
" I opened a bottle of wine .
He rolled a joint ...
We started undressing , making love , " she told the court .
" He could n't have a proper erection , but that was understandable given how much we 'd drunk .
We stopped making love .
He took off the condom . "
She said the next thing she knew Mugnier was lying on the bed bleeding from the neck , and she was trying to stem the blood with one hand and with the other was calling emergency services .
They arrived around 2.40 am on the Sunday morning but within an hour Mugnier had succumbed to the two knife wounds , one of which went right through his body and touched his spine .
Ms Davies said the knife that killed Mugnier was the one she had used to slash her own wrists and legs in her bathtub just a few months earlier when she was depressed after splitting up with her boyfriend .
Police told the court there was no sign of a struggle in the one - bedroom flat and neighbours had heard nothing .
They said Ms Davies was four times over the drink - drive alcohol limit and had traces of anti-depressants in her blood .
Earlier the court heard how Ms Davies developed behavioural problems after the acrimonious divorce of her parents when she was 14 and how she was badly affected by her maternal grandmother 's repeated suicide attempts .
She started drinking heavily as a teenager and by the time she was in university , " I was drunk six days out of seven " she said , adding that she had also developed a cocaine habit .
Her mother broke down in tears at one point as she detailed her daughter 's difficult adolescent and university years .
Her uncle , Quentin Davies , hit the headlines in 2007 when he defected from Britain 's Conservatives to the ruling Labour party , just before Gordon Brown was named the new prime minister .
He has since been appointed Mr Brown 's junior defence minister .

The figures , compiled by the publisher Thomson Reuters for the Financial Times , showed that Chinese scientists had increased their output at a far faster rate than counterparts in rival “ emerging ” nations such as India , Russia and Brazil .
Although India has long been tipped as the most likely threat to US academic supremacy , the study found it now lags well behind China .

FREE ebook — " 9/11 Unveiled " ( Arabic , Chinese )
American Patriots —
Muslims did n't do it
The FBI 's " Most Wanted Terrorists " web page does not state that Bin Laden is wanted for the September 11 , 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
The FBI page states : " Usama Bin Laden is wanted in connection with the August 7 , 1998 , bombings of the United States Embassies in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , and Nairobi , Kenya .
These attacks killed over 200 people .
In addition , Bin Laden is a suspect in other terrorist attacks throughout the world . "
When asked why there is no mention of 9/11 on the FBI 's web page , Rex Tomb , the FBI 's Chief of Investigative Publicity , is reported to have said , " The reason why 9/11 is not mentioned on Usama Bin Laden 's Most Wanted page is because the FBI has no hard evidence connecting Bin Laden to 9/11 . "
In the months leading up to the Septmber 11 , 2001 attack , it is reported , the Taliban " outlined various ways bin Laden could be dealt with .
He could be turned over to the EU , killed by the Taliban , or made available as a target for Cruise missiles . "
The Bush administration did not accept the Taliban 's offer .
On September 16 , 2001 , CNN reported that in a statement issued to Al Jazeera , bin Laden said , " I would like to assure the world that I did not plan the recent attacks " .
" On September 20 , 2001 , " according to the Guardian , " the Taliban offered to hand Osama bin Laden to a neutral Islamic country for trial if the US presented them with evidence that he was responsible for the attacks on New York and Washington .
The US rejected the offer . "
On September 23 , 2001 the BBC reported that four of the hijack " suspects " - Waleed Al Shehri , Abdulaziz Al Omari , Saeed Alghamdi , and possibly Khalid Al Midhar - were alive , and that FBI Director Robert Mueller acknowledged " the identity of several of the suicide hijackers is in doubt . "
Bin Laden , in a September 28 , 2001 interview with the Pakistani newspaper Ummat , is reported to have said :
I have already said that I am not involved in the 11 September attacks in the United States .
As a Muslim , I try my best to avoid telling a lie .
I had no knowledge of these attacks , nor do I consider the killing of innocent women , children and other humans as an appreciable act .
Islam strictly forbids causing harm to innocent women , children and other people .
Such a practice is forbidden even in the course of a battle .
Experts dismiss the video tape " found in a house in Jalalabad " , Afghanistan , which allegedly shows Bin Laden confessing to the September 11 attacks .
In a December 20 , 2001 , broadcast by German TV channel Das Erste " two independent translators and an expert on oriental studies found the White House 's translation not only to be inaccurate , but manipulative . "
FBI Director Robert Mueller , in a speech at the Commonwealth Club on April 19 , 2002 , said : " In our investigation , we have not uncovered a single piece of paper - either here in the United States , or in the treasure trove of information that has turned up in Afghanistan and elsewhere - that mentioned any aspect of the September 11 plot . "
In fact there are no Arab names on the list of passengers on the 9/11 flights ( AA11 , AA77 , UA93 , UA175 ) .
Yet on September 12 , 2001 ABC News reported that " investigators have identified all the hijackers " .
Among those identified was " Satan Suqami , a Saudi national on American Airlines Flight 11 , whose passport was recovered in the rubble . "
Bin Laden is the " prime suspect " in the September 11 attacks , said President Bush on September 17 , 2001 , and he pledged to capture him " dead or alive . "
" I am absolutely convinced that the al - Qaida network , which he heads , was responsible for this attack , " Secretary of State Colin Powell said on NBC's " Meet the Press . "
Powell said the government would " put before the world , the American people , a persuasive case that ... it is al - Qaida , led by Osama bin Laden , who has been responsible . "
On October 7 , 2001 , the U.S. military began operation Operation Enduring Freedom - a war on Afghanistan .
The evidence against Bin Laden , promised by Secretary of State Colin Powell on September 23 , 2001 , has yet to be made available to the public .
On March 29 , 2006 , on The Tony Snow Show , Vice President Dick Cheney stated : " We 've never made the case , or argued the case , that somehow Osama Bin Laden was directly involved in 9/11 .
That evidence has never been forthcoming . "
Back on September 16 , 2001 , Cheney had said he would willingly accept bin Laden 's " head on a platter " .

[ Even after Sept. 11 , Rumsfeld , Wolfowitz , and Vice President Dick Cheney continued to resist any military engagement in Afghanistan , because they were hoping for war against Iraq instead .
Bush 's top secret order of Sept. 17 for war with Afghanistan also directed the Pentagon to begin planning for an invasion of Iraq , according to journalist James Bamford 's book Pretext for War .
Cheney and Rumsfeld pushed for a quick victory in Afghanistan in NSC meetings in October , as recounted by both Woodward and Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith .
Lost in the eagerness to wrap up the Taliban and get on with the Iraq War was any possibility of preventing bin Laden 's escape to Pakistan .

This leads naturally to the question : if Osama bin Laden did indeed die in 2001 , how and why have dozens of messages from bin Laden appeared since then ?

Its entire report is based on the assumption that bin Laden was behind the attacks .
However , the report 's evidence to support this premise has been disowned by the Commission 's own co-chairs , Thomas Kean and Lee Hamilton .

It is still widely thought to have been established beyond question that the attacks were carried out by members of al - Qaeda .
The truth , however , is that the evidence entirely falls apart upon examination , and this fact suggests that 9/11 was instead a false - flag attack - an attack that people within our own government orchestrated while planting evidence to implicate Muslims .

A founding member of the Taliban , Zaeef doubted bin Laden was behind the 9/11 attacks , and he denounced the American intervention .

EP .
Refresh here all weekend long for reports from the 2007 Pitchfork Music Festival , and — if we ’re lucky — fashion tips from Bradford Cox .
I agree with most posts here , which tend towards null .
My reasoning is that generating an empty object with non-nullable properties may cause bugs .
For example , an entity with an int ID property would have an initial value of ID = 0 , which is an entirely valid value .
Should that object , under some circumstance , get saved to database , it would be a bad thing .
For anything with an iterator I would always use the empty collection .
Something like
foreach ( var eachValue in collection ?? new List < Type >( 0 ) )
is code smell in my opinion .
Collection properties should n't be null , ever .
An edge case is String .
Many people say , String .
IsNullOrEmpty is n't really necessary , but you cannot always distinguish between an empty string and null .
Furthermore , some database systems ( Oracle ) wo n't distinguish between them at all ( '' gets stored as DBNULL ) , so you 're forced to handle them equally .
The reason for that is , most string values either come from user input or from external systems , while neither textboxes nor most exchange formats have different representations for '' and null .
So even if the user wants to remove a value , he cannot do anything more than clearing the input control .
Also the distinction of nullable and non-nullable nvarchar database fields is more than questionable , if your DBMS is not oracle - a mandatory field that allows '' is weird , your UI would never allow this , so your constraints do not map .
So the answer here , in my opinion is , handle them equally , always .
The law of unintended consequences has seldom been more clearly illustrated than by the catfight unfolding from San Francisco to Los Angeles .
Veterinarians who did not want cities meddling in their business persuaded the state Legislature to bar local governments from banning the practice of declawing cats -- beginning in 2010 .
Not wanting to be pushed around themselves , nearly half a dozen cities are rushing to prohibit the controversial procedure before the January deadline , striking a blow for rights both animal and municipal .
This week alone , the score was Cities 3 , Vets 0 .
Advertisement
The Los Angeles City Council voted 11 to 0 on Friday to ban declawing .
Beverly Hills voted 5 to 0 on Thursday , and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors voted 9 to 2 on Tuesday .
The cities must finalize their votes in coming weeks .
In the process , city council chambers have rung with testimony about “ litter box avoidance ” and kitty press - on nails , knuckle amputation and bullying big government .
Just listen to John A. Mirisch of Beverly Hills , where the council voted to ban onychectomy and flexor tendonectomy within its city limits unless the procedures are medically necessary .
“ Onychectomy , commonly known as declawing , is the practice of amputating a cat ’s first paw joints , including the claw at the first knuckle , ” said Mirisch , the councilman who introduced the measure .
“ Indeed , I find this practice to be a prima facie instance of animal cruelty , and I do n’t need Big Brother in Sacramento or a veterinary board to tell me otherwise . ”
Advertisement
Mirisch ’s sentiments were echoed at the Los Angeles City Council meeting by Paul Koretz , who co-sponsored the Los Angeles motion : “ I do n’t think we should allow people at the state level to dictate to us our local actions . ”
The Santa Monica City Council voted 6 to 1 in favor of a ban on Oct. 27 .
Such a prohibition is scheduled for a vote in Berkeley on Nov. 10 .
Malibu stopped short of banning the procedure but is working on a measure signaling its opposition .
Jennifer Conrad , founder of the Paw Project , which seeks an end to declawing , said California is at the forefront nationwide in banning the procedure .
It has been prohibited or condemned in a number of European countries .
About the only thing both sides in the declawing controversy agree on is what the procedure entails :
Using a scalpel , clippers or a laser , a veterinarian cuts off the last bone on each toe on a cat ’s feet .
Advertisement
“ Because each digit is amputated through the joint , this procedure is painful and requires the appropriate treatment of pain before , during and after the procedure , ” according to the American College of Veterinary Surgeons ’ website .
Said Koretz , the Los Angeles councilman : “ It is an amputation . . . .
It often leaves cats crippled and in pain for the rest of their lives . ”
Such pain , he said , can cause cats to avoid their litter boxes because it hurts them to dig .
As a result , they often are sent to shelters by frustrated owners .
But the California Veterinary Medical Assn. said that with modern medical techniques -- especially laser surgery -- and appropriate pain management , cats are often up and walking shortly after awakening from anesthesia .
Advertisement
“ If it comes down to a cat being euthanized , losing its home or losing its claws , ” said association president Mark Nunez , “ being euthanized or losing its home is a worse outcome . ”
Californians can thank -- or blame , depending on their perspective -- a Persian cat named Alexis Carrington for all the fuss .
Alexis , named after the “ Dynasty ” character , belonged to West Hollywood City Councilman John Duran , who had her declawed “ because I did n’t want my furniture ruined . ”
It seemed like a good idea , he said , but “ I had no idea what I had actually done to my cat . ”
Advertisement
Six years ago , Hernan Molina , his City Hall deputy and an “ avid cat person , ” explained the procedure and asked Duran to push for a ban in their small city .
In 2003 , West Hollywood became the first city in America to ban declawing , spurred in part by Duran ’s “ guilt and remorse ” over Alexis ’ missing toes .
“ Cats have claws and fangs for protection from hunting .
Dogs bark because they ’re pack animals .
Birds fly , ” Duran said in a recent interview .
“ Why would we want to debark a dog , declaw a cat or clip the wings of a bird ?
But then , I ’m a lefty . ”
Advertisement
The California Veterinary Medical Assn. took West Hollywood to court to overturn the ban , which was eventually upheld .
This summer , the Legislature passed Senate Bill 762 , a law pushed by the veterinarians association to stop cities and counties from regulating the practice of health professionals .
In letters to Santa Monica and San Francisco officials , the association said , “ The decision to declaw a cat should remain between the owner in consultation with his , or her , veterinarian on a case - by - case basis . ”
Veterinary association officials believe that there are times when “ declawing may be the only option for a cat owner ” and that it should be a “ last resort ” for destructive cats .
Advertisement
But on Thursday night , a past president of the group told the Beverly Hills City Council that he had second thoughts about his organization ’s efforts on behalf of SB 762 .
“ I regret it , ” said William A. Grant II , a second - generation Orange County veterinarian .
“ Because it ’s now forcing a lot of local communities to make decisions in a very short time frame that I think are uninformed decisions . ”

A Perspective on Unemployment
Yesterday brought some sobering news that the Great Recession is still far from over .
Unemployment crawled past the 10 percent barrier for the first time since 1983 , hitting a rate of 10.2 percent .
Despite this , there are some reasons for optimism in the historical context , and signs that things will soon turn around .
According to the Associated Press : “ The Labor Department , using a survey of company payrolls , said the economy shed 190,000 jobs in October .
A separate survey of households found 558,000 more people were unemployed last month than in September .
Some 15.7 million Americans are out of work . ”
This rise in joblessness is a continuation of the global financial meltdown of the Great Recession .
According to Bloomberg , the economy has shed 7.3 million jobs since the recession began in December 2007 , 3.49 million of those since Obama took the oath of office late January 2009 .
The unemployment rate has climbed from 4.9 percent then ( not accounting for those no longer seeking employment and those with only part time work ) to 7.8 percent on January 20 , 2009 to 10.2 percent today .
The unemployment rate is expected to hit 11 percent by mid 2010 before it begins to drop .
Despite this , there are some reasons for optimism .
The Dow Jones industrial average has topped 10,000 , worker productivity rose at an annual rate of 9.5 percent , and unemployment claims have declined for the 9th straight month .
“ The four - week average of jobless claims , which smooths fluctuations , dropped to 523,750 , its ninth straight decline .
That ’s 135,000 below the peak for the recession , reached in early April . ”
Another article by Bloomberg : “ U.S. durable goods orders rose for a second month and new home sales were the second - highest on record in July .
Consumers gained confidence in August , a sign they might increase spending and help the economy accelerate . ”
NPR points out that there are new signs of growth in the economy , ending a year of contraction , but that job growth is a lagging indicator .
Thus , although the recovery has begun in the American economy , the current unemployment rate will not reflect this .
Recent data that have surfaced have shown that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ( economic stimulus ) has saved or created at least 640,000 jobs so far .
Due to at least 350,000 additional jobs saved by tax cuts in the ARRA , the real value is likely to top 1 million .
This has softened the blow of what would otherwise have been far more staggering jobless statistics .
To put a little historical perspective on this , we must employ some charts .
Here is the 10 - year trend .
The explosion in the jobless rate following the recession hitting is striking .
A longer term chart demonstrates many fluctuations in the rate since 1890 .
Zoom in on these numbers a little bit , and we see the rates displayed by year ( colored to represent which party had the presidency ) .
This last chart brings up the final reason not to be too concerned about the current rates .
Democratic presidents tend to have a much better track record in terms of job creation .
Here we have an annual rate of job gain or loss by presidency .
In the end , Democratic presidents are responsible for 64.2 percent of the jobs created since 1939 .
Under Bill Clinton , 22 million jobs were created in 8 years .
There is a shock of the double - digit barrier being broken at the moment , but this will soon wear off .
An unemployment rate of 10.2 percent that might grow into 11 percent is bad news , but by all accounts , this should be a temporary bump in the road to recovery that could take years .
At least there is a historical reason to believe that the team behind the wheel are the best ones equipped to turn this situation around .
Update : CompTIA has backed down .
Original story : CompTIA is the computer industry group that oversees common certifications such as A+ , Network + , and Server+ , and its certifications have always been good indefinitely .
Not anymore .
In a policy change announced this month , CompTIA dropped a bombshell on the hundreds of thousands of people who hold its certifications : those credentials are now good for only three years — and the change in policy is retroactive .
Damage control
CompTIA announced the change earlier this month .
Over the last several years , CompTIA has had its certs accredited by the US - focused ANSI and then the internationally oriented ISO ( yes , both groups actually " certify the certifiers " ) .
Such accreditation means that CompTIA certs are more valuable to holders , but ANSI and ISO want to make sure that cert holders stay up to date .
That meant changing CompTIA 's longstanding policy that certs were good forever — and the move has enraged many who spent several hundred dollars on what they believed was a lifetime qualification .
The policy applies only to the A+ , Network + , and Security + exams ; others are not affected " at this time . "
Exam certifications now carry a " valid through " date that is good for three years from the exam date .
Keeping current does n't mean taking a complete test every three years , though .
CompTIA has launched a new continuing education program , much like those in many other industries , to ensure that its holders keep current with their skills .
Continuing ed credits can be gained by taking classes , writing whitepapers , earning other certs , writing books , giving conference presentations , etc .
Once someone earns enough credits , their certification is extended for another three years .
CompTIA charges a $ 25 or $ 49 annual fee to remain certified .
Dig a little deeper , however , and you will find that holders of older certifications may in fact have to take a new exam after all .
According to CompTIA 's FAQ on the new program , it covers only those " who are certified in the latest version of the CompTIA Network + or CompTIA Security + exams , as well as those certified in the CompTIA A+ 700 and 600 series exams . "
If you passed a previous version of the test , you 'll need to take " the most current applicable exam to be eligible to enroll in the continuing education program . "
The policy change has not gone over well with many existing cert holders .
CompTIA quickly recorded a brief podcast addressing the wrath directed at the organization , and the host noted that the issue had " elicited a lot of comments , " most of which were ... " concerned " about the move .
You say " concern , " I say " rage "
An Ars reader who spoke with us about the issue explained why it bothered him so much .
" Maybe it will make the exams more valuable , " he said , " but the fact still remains that CompTIA clearly promised lifetime certs .
In my opinion , a done deal is a done deal .
If I was promised a lifetime cert , then I want a lifetime cert — period .
It should be up the cert holder if the cert holder wants a more updated cert .
It should up to the employers whether an updated cert is needed . "
Another
Ars reader , who holds 15 certs at the moment , is even more upset .
" When I took my CompTIA certifications I knew they were of low value , both to myself and to the industry in general , but I thought even low value certifications may help win an interview one day and since they were ' for life , ' the time and cost involved could be seen as reasonable , " he wrote in an e-mail exchange .
" This is the agreement I entered into , which has now fundamentally changed , it is not an agreement I would now knowingly have entered into , yet I have no recourse or right of refund . "
Not anymore
CompTIA stresses that continuing ed credits should be easy enough for most active professionals to earn without extra work , but that 's now how our correspondents see it .
" There are extra costs now involved , " says one .
" A fairly simple proposition of one - off payment , one - off test and certification for life has now changed dramatically .
I now must pay for the CEU system , I must follow the system , I must get involved in the bureaucracy , none of this directly adds to my bottom line as a freelance consultant / programmer . "
In the blogosphere , such thoughtful comments quickly morph into ... this : " What the hell !
Are you f***ing kidding me ?
How can you tell hundreds of thousands of people that when you certify with CompTIA that its good for life , and then pull this s***...
If you do decide to change the rules , then the people who certified before you changed the rules should be grandfathered in .
You know what you are doing is complete BULLS ***!
Oh sure you have other ways that we can renew our certifications , but we still have to pay a yearly maintenance fee for our certifications ?
... I hope you realize your stupidity before your company goes bankrupt ! "
On CompTIA 's own blog , the comments have been coming fast and ( mostly ) furious .
( Comments have not been edited for spelling or grammar ) .
" Propanganda , wat a cheap way of doing damage control . "
" talk is cheap .. now comptia ’s intergrity is in question .. all the podcast says are just craps because it does not solve our problems ...
I sense some despotic ways of doing things to justify higher profits .
" The reputation of comptia is going down the drain .
Period .
I never thought why would anyone wanna shoot on their own foot . "
" Comptia is now adding additional stress to the recession .
All the schools offering comptia ’s certifications will see drastic drop in enrollment .
All the certifications book for comptia will be left on the shelves in book stores . "
" My God .
I just discovered that my ' lifetime ' A+ certification will expire .
Time to get an attorney because that is not what was advertised by CompTia when I got certified .
I still have all the original web pages and advertising literature .
Seems like Republicans are behind this — you know , the unilateral contract changers who are really corporate raiders masquerading as politicians . "
" I had to go put on my boots while listing to the podcast cause the crap was getting too deep , they must take us all for fools . "
" So I just took the most current 2008 Sercuity + exam in September .
Now my ' lifetime certification ' is only valid for 3 years ?
Wait , no according to your renewal policy it is only valid until Dec 31 , 2011 .
So for my money I get 2 years and 3 months ?
What a bunch of crooks ! "
" Congratulations Comptia , you ’ve chopped off three of your cash cow ’s legs . "
On the podcast , CompTIA 's VP for certifications talked up the value of the ANSI / ISO accreditation and said that the policy change was " very much in response to their evolving requirements . "
It does n't make CompTIA much money ( and the group is a nonprofit in any event ) , especially since it requires more backend work by CompTIA to track and verify continuing ed credits .
" If we do n't keep this thing rigorous and certified at the ISO level , " he said , " it loses some of its shine . "
As for why the change was retroactive , it was " easier " to apply the policy to everyone than to have various classes of cert holders .
Those answers do n't seem to be placating the masses , who have turned to Facebook groups and forums to vent their outrage .
Whole Body Imaging Technology and Body Scanners ( " Backscatter " X - Ray and Millimeter Wave Screening )
Introduction
EPIC has filed a lawsuit to suspend the deployment of body scanners at US airports , pending an independent review .
Body scanners produce detailed , three - dimensional images of individuals .
Security experts have described whole body scanners as the equivalent of " a physically invasive strip - search . "
The Transportation Security Administration operates the body scanner devices at airports throughout the United States .
On July 2 , 2010 , EPIC filed a petition for review and motion for an emergency stay , urging the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to suspend the Transportation Security Administration 's ( TSA ) full body scanner program .
EPIC said that the program is " unlawful , invasive , and ineffective . "
EPIC argued that the federal agency has violated the Administrative Procedures Act , the Privacy Act , the Religious Freedom Restoration Act , and the Fourth Amendment .
EPIC cited the invasive nature of the devices , the TSA 's disregard of public opinion , and the impact on religious freedom .

Background
Post - September 11 , airline travel security has invoked the increased use of technology and better training of security personnel as a means of improving travel security .
Some of these proposals , such as improved training for airport screeners , checking all bags for bombs , strengthening cockpit doors , and placing air marshals on flights , do not implicate privacy interests and are sound security measures .
Others , however , present privacy and security risks to air travelers because they might create data files directly linked to the identity of air travelers .
These files if retained could provide the basis for a database of air traveler profiles .
The Transportation Security Administration utilizes two technologies to capture naked images of air travelers - backscatter x-ray technology and millimeter wave technology .
In 1895 x-rays1 were discovered by Wilhelm Röntgen .
2
This discovery of how to look through an object to observe details beneath has advanced to include new techniques .
One such technique called " backscatter " X - Ray is based on " the emergence of radiation from that surface of a material through which it entered .
Also used to denote the actual backscattered radiation .
3 "
The application of this new x-ray technology to airport screening uses high energy x-rays that are more likely to scatter than penetrate materials as compared to lower - energy x-rays used in medical applications .
Although this type of x-ray is said to be harmless it can move through other materials , such as clothing .
A passenger is scanned by rastering or moving a single high energy x-ray beam rapidly over their form .
The signal strength of detected backscattered x-rays from a known position then allows a highly realistic image to be reconstructed .
Since only Compton scattered x-rays4 are used , the registered image is mainly that of the surface of the object / person being imaged .
In the case of airline passenger screening it is her nude form .
The image resolution of the technology is high , so details of the human form of airline passengers present privacy challenges .
Airport security has undergone significant changes since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Recently , the Transportation Security Administration ( TSA ) announced a proposal to purchase and deploy " Whole Body Imaging " X - ray machines to search air travelers at all airports .
TSA said it believes that use of the machines is less invasive than pat - down searches .
However , these machines , which show detailed images of a person 's naked body , are equivalent to a " digital strip search " for all air travelers .
This proposal , along with the agency 's controversial plan to profile air travelers , shows extraordinary disregard for the privacy rights of air travelers .
The Department of Homeland Security is requesting $ 72 million to invest in detection systems , which includes funding for the backscatter machines , which cost between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 each .
The backscatter machines use high - energy X - rays that are more likely to scatter than penetrate materials as compared to lower - energy X - rays used in medical applications .
Although this type of X - ray is said to be harmless , it can move through other materials , such as clothing .
When being screened , a passenger is scanned by high - energy X - ray beam moving rapidly over her body .
The signal strength of detected backscattered X - rays from a known position then allows a highly realistic image to be reconstructed .
In the case of airline - passenger screening , the image is of the traveler 's nude form .
The image resolution of the technology is high , so the picture of the body presented to screeners is detailed enough to show genitalia .
These images are not necessarily temporary - screeners can save the body images to the system 's hard disk or floppy disk for subsequent viewing on either " the system monitor or on any IBM compatible personal computer with color graphics . "
Backscatter X - Rays and Transportation Screening
The Transportation Security Administration claims that is not storing detailed images of passengers screened by the system .
The agency also states that it is providing a screening option for passengers who object to screening by the technology .
However , the technology is designed to accomplish what has been described on this page , and until the process of assuring that the claims of the agency are enforced -- questions will remain about the use of the technology .
EPIC will make available on this page aviation security and privacy - related documents it obtains from the government under the Freedom of Information
Act law about the adoption of " backscatter " x-ray technology intended for use in screening air travelers .
The stated goal of these new proposals is to rely on technology to reduce the " hassle factor " in airports and to reduce security threats .
The core idea is to focus security resources on suspicious travelers , while ensuring that most people are not inconvenienced by heightened security .
Terrorists , however , have been known to go to great lengths to look like most people .
Will a technology that will capture detailed images of potentially all airline travel passengers lead to greater safety ?
Current technology can successfully detect dangerous substances , firearms and other weapons without backscatter x-ray imaging of passengers .
Can the goal of safe air travel be reached without reproducing a digital image of a passenger 's body ?
It has long been recognized by security experts that it is impossible to eliminate all threats to airline travel .
Is the application of " backscatter " x-ray technology a deterrent and not a solution to perfect airline travel safety ?
If this is true , then is the trade off in passenger privacy worth the effort to deter terrorists ?
The application of security technology and increased passenger screening has also resulted in an increased detection of non-violent criminal offenses .
Is the application of " backscatter " x-ray technology to screen airline passengers more than just a means of detecting terrorists ?
In 2009 , the TSA announced that Whole Body Imaging would replace metal detectors at airport security check points .
This is a marked departure from the earlier promises by the agency that the technology would only be used for secondary screening of air travel passengers .

Many of you may have seen my post on Tokyo Live Bloggers via dannychoo.com yesterday about the missing ( stolen ) statue in Shibuya outside of the station .
The statue was stolen ( taken ) as part of the Lupin Steal Japan promotion project .
The aim of the project is said to be giving people back some “ genki ” in their lives .
The official site for the project can be found at steal - japan.jp .
It lists details of objects that have been stolen and asks users to submit ideas for what should be stolen next .
I hope they do n’t put in things like “ Tokyo Tower ” or “ Tokyo Dome ” ^^ .
Lupin was originally written as a manga series in Japan by Monkey Punch ( Kazuhiko Kato ) , who I met years ago .
NTV produced a series on TV and Toho studios was involved in a later movie .
“ The Castle of Cagliostro ” ( Lupin III ) directed by Hayao Miyazaki is definitely worth a look if you have n’t see it before .
Until recently there were copyright issues involving the use of the name Lupin , particularly overseas .
The time limit to these rights has now expired and maybe NTV are planning a new release or re-release of some Lupin material some time soon ?
This clip was put together by HeadBangXter on YouTube showing The Castle of Cagliostro clips with music from the Foo Fighters .
Interesting combination ^^ .
and something a bit more traditional
I had a few questions about what the Moyai statue looked like , so for those who do n’t remember , here is what got stolen by Lupin .
Thanks to Nemo ’s Great Uncle on flickr for this .
What would you like to see Lupin Steal Japan steal next ?

Update
OK it just ended , but you will see this replayed over and over tonight and on the Sunday talk shoes .
RIYADH , Saudi Arabia - Saudi Arabia said yesterday that 73 Saudis have been killed and 26 have gone missing since the kingdom launched an offensive against Yemeni Shi’ite rebels along the border last month .
The announcement was the first indication that the US ally had suffered such heavy losses in the remote area , where it is difficult to independently confirm details of the fighting .
The rebels , known as Hawthis , have alleged dozens of civilian deaths in Saudi air assaults .
Prince Khaled bin Sultan , the Saudi assistant defense minister , also said during a border tour that Yemeni rebels who seized the border village of al - Jabiri have 48 hours to vacate it or surrender .
Saudi forces have tried to retake al - Jabiri , a tiny outpost surrounded by Yemeni territory on three sides .
The prince said in remarks carried by the official Saudi Press Agency that the conflict “ was almost finished , ’’ but did not elaborate on that claim .
He referred to the dead as “ martyrs , ’’ a term used to describe slain troops .
Saudi Arabia launched an air and ground offensive against the Yemeni rebels on Nov. 5 , after skirmishes along the border .
Both Saudi Arabia and Yemen have accused Shi’ite Iran of backing the rebels , a charge Tehran has denied .

The Lemonade Cleanse Diet has multiple names : the Master Cleanse , The Lemonade Diet– and more recently , the Beyonce Lemonade Diet .
This diet has been around since 1941 when it was known as the Burroughs Master Cleanse after its inventor , Stanley Burroughs .
It 's now referred to as the Beyonce Lemonade Diet because super model and singer Beyonce , certainly a gorgeous woman , used this famous diet to lose weight .
This diet was n't created primarily for weight loss , but for health .
Burrough 's goal was to create a diet that would rapidly detox and cleanse the system .
Weight loss is only a side benefit .
To detox our bodies periodically becomes more and more important as the years go by .
We desperately need to get rid of the poisons that have accumulated and that is what this diet is meant to do because during the diet you are not to eat ANY FOOD AT ALL !
Instead , you drink a special lemonade mixture , along with herbal laxative teas and / or a salt water flush .
The Lemonade Detox diet duration is 7 - 40 days and during this time your body will heal itself because :
1 . You will not be taking in any more toxins , but will instead give your body a much - needed rest from solid food …
2 . The ingredients are especially for cleaning out the system
…
Burroughs claimed that all the nutrition we need is in this diet – at least for the short term .
Master Cleanse Lemonade Recipe
2 Tablespoons lemon or lime juice
2 Tablespoons genuine maple syrup
1/10 teaspoon cayenne pepper ( or to taste )
8 ounces of water
About Your Master Cleanse Ingredients …
It 's important to use genuine lemon or lime juice – not bottled .
If possible , all ingredients should be organic .
Some nutritionists and doctors recommend using molasses , rather than maple syrup , because of concerns about blood sugar .
Ideally , mix your Master Cleanse ingredients in glass , not plastic , because there is no doubt that some kinds of plastic leech chemicals into the water and the lemonade cleansing diet is first and foremost about health .
The more frequently you make your lemonade , the better .
The lemon or lime will lose its strength over time .
How To " Do " The Lemonade Cleansing Diet
Some practitioners insist we must limit ourselves to 6 - 12 glasses of lemonade each day .
Others say that we should drink more lemonade whenever we 're hungry .
Personally , I think drinking more liquid when we need it – rather than abandoning the whole effort because of hunger – makes more sense .
In addition , plan to drink some laxative teas in the morning and evening , or alternatively , use a salt flush in the morning .
The Master Cleanse Salt Water Flush
Mix 2 teaspoons of high quality sea salt – NOT ordinary table salt – into a quart of warm water .
It 's important that your water be warm or else the salt wo n't dissolve .
Drink all of this down on an empty stomach in the morning before you 've had any lemonade .
Some people have reported using salt tablets with water instead although I personally doubt that is as effective .
Lots of people have called this beverage ' nasty ' but that depends on how much you personally like salt .
I actually like it .
Be warned : you need to hang out near the bathroom for the next couple of hours .
What To Expect On The Lemonade Detox Diet
Let 's be honest : the first couple of days are rough .
Experts in detoxing warn us that billions of organisms will be dying off and they are n't happy about this .
You might feel sick and will most likely have a headache .
Most people do n't make it through this rough time .
BUT … if you can stick it out , there will be a surge of energy and well being that is almost unbelievable !
It is euphoric and enchanting .
You may see better , smell more and have more vitality and stamina than you 've had in years or even decades , depending on your age .
Some folks love this high so much that they stick it out a full 40 days and then do periodic fasts throughout the year .
We celebrate the 20th anniversary of The Simpsons the only way we know how with a roundup of our favorite tech moments .
There 's nothing like the anniversary of a pop culture phenomenon to make you feel old .
It 's hard to believe , but this week marks 20 years of The Simpsons .
America 's favorite animated family ( sorry , Griffins ) debuted on Sunday , December 17 , 1989 with the now - classic Christmas special , " Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire . "
As a staff infused with pop culture nerds , it 's impossible to encapsulate all of the ways in which The Simpsons has affected us over the years , so we 've opted to celebrate the event the only way we know how : with a tech roundup .
We asked members of our staff to pull together their favorite techy Simpson moments from the past two decades .
Here 's what they sent .
10 . Moment : The Simpsons Buy an Ultrahouse
Episode : " Treehouse of Horror XII " November 6 , 2001
Moment : A salesbot convinces Marge to buy a new house that requires no human maintenance .
The Simpsons buy the house , which quickly falls in love with Marge and attempts to murder Homer .
D'oh , indeed .
9. Moment : Bart Battles Marge in Earthland Realms
Episode : " Marge Gamer " April 22 , 2007
What Happened : Marge gets addicted to a World of Warcraft - esque MMORPG called Earthland Realms , only to encounter a town populated by virtual versions of Simpsons characters being terrorized by the Shadow Knight .
Marge ventures to the Shadow Knight 's castle and discovers that the knight is really Bart .
8. Moment : Homer Launches a Website
Episode : " The Computer Wore Menace Shoes " December 3 , 2000
What Happened : After missing out on valuable information due to a lack of e-mail access , Homer mortgages his house for a fifth time in order to buy an expensive new computer .
He then launches his own Web page under the pseudonym " Mister X , " a name adopted in order to avoid litigation over the copyrighted material he 's stolen .
No one actually visits Homer 's site , so he quickly transforms it into a resource for Springfield gossip .
Move over , Perez .
7. Moment : Lisa Visits Steve Mobs's Underwater Mapple Fortress
Episode : " Mypods and Boomsticks " November 30 , 2008
What Happened : Lisa buys a MyPod on a trip to the newly - opened Mapple Store in the Springfield Mall .
Unable to pay for all of the music she 's downloaded to her new MP3 player , she takes a trip to Steve Mobs 's underwater glass cube office via a USB - shaped submarine to ask the Mapple founder if she can get a reduced payment plan .
Classic Quote : Steve Mobs , " I know our posters say , think differently , but our real slogan is no refunds . "
6. Moment : Homer Installs a Cell Tower in Lisa Room .
Episode : " Make Room for Lisa " February 28 , 1999
What Happened :
Over the years , Homer and Lisa have shared a very special paternal relationship , which has largely revolved around him doing awful things to her .
While visiting a traveling Smithsonian exhibit , Homer accidentally covers the Bill of Rights in chocolate finger prints , accidentally licking off the cruel and unusual punishment portion in an attempt to cover his tracks .
To pay back the $ 10,000 in damages , Homer agrees to install an OmniTouch cell tower on the roof of the family 's house .
It 's Lisa 's bedroom , naturally , which is turned into the control room . 
5. Moment : Homer Infects the World with a Computer Virus
Episode : " Treehouse of Horror X " October 31 , 1999
Moment : The Springfield Nuclear Power Plant is completely prepared for Y2 K , save for one computer in sector 7G .
Homer 's computer spreads a virus around the globe , which leads to mass hysteriaplanes fall from the sky and people run screaming from the local McDonald 's whose burger count has just dropped to zero .
Chaos ensues and mankind 's " best & brightest " are launched into space to populate Mars .
4. Moment : Homer 's Brother Creates a Baby Translator
Episode : " Brother , Can You Spare Two Dimes " August 27 , 1992
Moment : Homer 's brother Herb , voice by Danny DeVito , shows up at the Simpsons ' , asking for a loan .
Homer reluctantly gives him the $ 2,000 he was awarded for winning the " First Annual Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence . "
Herb , now destitute , invests the money in a new invention , a baby translator .
The invention pays off , and Herb buys gifts for the Simpson family , including a massage chair for Homer and an NRA membership for Bart .
Classic Quote : Homer , " Why did this have to happen now during prime time , when TV's brightest stars come out to shine ? "
3. Moment : Homer Founds an Internet Company
Episode : " Das Bus " February 15 , 1998
What Happened : Ned Flanders first demonstrated his skills as an entrepreneur , with the launch of the Leftorium , back in the early 90s .
Seven years later , the Simpsons ' overly cheerful neighbor rode the first dot - com boom , launching his own Internet business , Flancrest Enterprises .
Homer , naturally , wanted a piece of that action , launching Compu - Global - Hyper - Mega - Net , only to be bought by Bill Gates , whose goons later popped by 742 Evergreen Terrace to snap all of Homer 's pencils .
Classic Quote : Homer , " Oh , they have the Internet on computers now ! "
2. Moment : Homer Becomes an Astronaut
Episode : " Deep Space Homer " February 24 , 1994
What Happened :
In one of the all - time classic Simpsons episodes , Homer calls NASA , complaining about its " boring space launches . "
NASA , searching for average schlubs to boost ratings , picks up Homer and Barney as candidates for its next space launch .
Naturally , havoc ensues .
The day , ultimately , is saved by Homer 's newly - minted arch nemesis , the inanimate carbon rod .
Classic Quote : Kent Brockman , " And I , for one , welcome our new insect overlords . "
1. Moment : Homer Goes 3D
Episode : " Treehouse of Horror VI " October 29 , 1995
Moment : Hiding from Marge 's sisters , Homer discovers a secret portal behind a bookcase where the whole world is in 3D .
Jumping inside , Homer transforms into a CGI 3D version of himself .
Classic Quote : Homer , " Mmmm erotic cakes . "
Honorable Mention :
Moment : Marge Goes to the Prom With Artie Ziff
Episode : " The Way We Was " January 31 , 1991
What Happened :
All right , this one may be a bit of a cheat .
Animator David Silverman insists that the Jon Lovitz character Artie Ziff was actually based on a high school friend of his , but , given his * ahem * familiar - sounding last name , we could n't help but notice some similarities between the character and a certain former editor - in - chief .
More accurately the title is Ten Foods , Drinks , and Destinations to Try Before You Die .
I do n’t presume that you are about to die , but let ’s consider our mortality with a generous measure of humor .
As Marcus Aurelius said , “ Death smiles at us all .
What can a man do , but smile back ? ”
Or , as Seneca said , “ Bibamus .
Moriendum est , ” “ Dying is unavoidable .
So let ’s go get wasted . ”
A Christmas Bucket List !
10 Macallan 25 - year - old Scotch Speyside , Scotland
I ’ve had one shot .
In a New York scotch bar . $ 30 .
Which is overpriced .
A fifth of 25 - year - old Macallan will run you about $ 600 , but if you ever taste it , you ’ll want more , never mind the price .
It ’s like drinking a campfire that hugs you and wants to be your friend .
If you want scenery , I recommend Loch Morlich in winter .
It ’s southeast of Aviemore .
Snowy , with plenty of shallow streams to listen to ( where do you think the distilleries bottle their whiskys ? ) .
9 Spotted Dick London , England
It has nothing to do with the clap .
It is also called Plum Duff , and it is a dessert pudding with dried currants , custard , and rum .
In the best restaurants , they add a generous douse of your favorite rum on top .
As Robert Newton ’s Long John Silver says , “ That be what gives it the flavor !
Ha haargh ! ”
8 Churrasco Belem , Brazil
Churrasco is no one dish , but a particularly Brazilian and Argentinian style of serving meat .
These two countries are internationally known for great steaks , but have equally great pork , lamb , mutton , chicken and seafood .
Some restaurants serve all you can eat , sliced fresh off the grill , along with corn , rice , and fresh fruits , especially mangoes .
Belem is nicknamed “ City of the Mango Trees . ”
If you ’ve always wanted to see the Amazon Jungle but do n’t want to get eaten when you go into it , Belem is perfect .
It is on the coast , but only 20 to 30 miles inland , you can charter cheap ferries down the Para and Tocantins Rivers .
They are not technically tributaries of the Amazon River , but they are part of its estuary , and with just a short jaunt in a schooner , you can see all the jungle you ever wanted .
And you ca n’t imagine how deep , dark , and wild it is .
Familiar with the Goliath Bird- eating Spider ?
You can see them climbing the trees at the edge of the water , from 50 feet away .
You can be assured of seeing the Amazon macaw , one of the most famous parrots in the world .
Flocks of them flying over the rivers all the time , from jungle to jungle .
7 Pizza Napoli , Italy
Pizza was invented in Napoli ( Naples ) , by the poor class who had money only for bread dough , tomatoes , and cheese .
So they put it all together and baked it .
Today , the most traditional pizza in America is still in New York City , but if you want it truly traditional , Napoli is the only choice .
Any quaint , family - owned - and - operated restaurant in the city will serve you pizza to die for .
The reason pizza is the best in Napoli is because the tomatoes are San Marzano , grown on the south slopes of Vesuvius , in extremely fertile , volcanic soil , and the mozzarella cheese is made from the milk of the Campanian water buffalo , or “ Mozzarella di Bufala Campana . ”
How do you make pizza better ?

6 Fire - Roasted Lamb Stavros , Crete
The Greeks know how to have fun , and if you ca n’t decide which you like more , mountains or a beach , just settle for both .
Photographers have noted that they rarely employ their polarizing filters to enhance the colors of their photographs in the Aegean Sea .
The ocean is nowhere bluer than it is around Greece .
The woods and hills have their colors , and you ’ll need sunglasses to handle them .
Lamb roasted on a spit outside is a Grecian tradition , and you have n’t lived until you ’ve tried it cooked by Grecian grandmothers .
It is typically rubbed with apples several times during cooking , and served with ghanoush , vegetable - stuffed grape leaves , Greek red wine , and homemade baklava ( not that junk you ’ve eaten in most American restaurants ) .
There are plenty of quaint beachfront restaurants in Stavros , in the shadow of the Akrotirian mountains .
You ’re free to climb them and see the ruins of the 5th or 6th Century Catholic monastery founded by St. John the Hermit .
Before , during and after supper , as you will be eating with friendly strangers , locals and tourists , you ’ll be encouraged to drink ouzo , a Greek liquor that tastes like aniseed .
Then you can join everyone in a dance around the fire on the beach in the sirtaki , the famous dance at the end of Zorba the Greek , with Anthony Quinn , which was filmed in Stavros .
5 Sachertorte Vienna , Austria
Vienna is world famous for its desserts , and sachertorte , at the Sacher Hotel , is world famous among the world famous desserts .
It is dry chocolate cake , with apricot jam between layers , and dark chocolate icing on the top and sides .
The only place outside Vienna where you can find it is a Sacher shop in Bolzano , Italy .
It is served with whipped , heavy cream , which balances its dry flavor .
While you ’re there , pay your respects to Mozart , Beethoven , Schubert , Brahms , Strauss , et al. at the Central Cemetery .
Mozart is buried somewhere in St. Marx Cemetery , but has a monument near Beethoven and Schubert ’s graves .
Go see an opera or a symphony .
Beethoven ’s Ninth , or Mozart ’s “ Don Giovanni . ”
4 Trockenbeerenauslese Bavarian Alps
Germany has its fair share of a claim to the world ’s wines .
Trockenbeerenauslese is extraordinarily sweet , white wine , with so much sugar in it that it ’s syrupy .
If you ’ve had a taste of bad wine and lost your liking for it , this will get you back on track .
It is expensive , but can have as much as 300 grams of sugar per bottle , which will give you diabetes if you want it to .
Alcohol content is therefore quite low as wines go , which means you can drink quite a lot before you get drunk .
It makes a great dessert in itself , and goes very well with a local pretzel , a fresh , big one , with salt to cut the wine ’s sweetness .
And if you ’re looking for grand scenery , the Bavarian Alps might give you diabetes , too .
Try the Black Forest , for starters .
3 Lobster and Cracked Crab Pink Beaches of Harbor Island , Bahamas
Perhaps you are n’t as big a fan of mountains as you are of the tropics .
Harbor Island is world famous for its pink - sand beaches , and Dunmore Town caters to tourists with outstanding seafood restaurants .
Have your fruit of the sea brought out to you on the beach in the late afternoon , and the sunset will be behind you , over the palm and coconut trees .
There is a lot of quartz in the sand , and the sunlight makes it glow , lighter where it ’s dry , and darker in the surf .
If you ’re lucky , the wild horses will walk up out of the surf and give you a sniff .
2 Romanee - Conti France
At least one supper you eat should have the greatest wine in the world .
Domaine de la Romanee - Conti is a very small vineyard , only 4 acres , and only produces about 5,000 bottles a year , but those 5,000 have a taste beyond comprehension .
Rather than try to describe the taste , since I have n’t had any , suffice to say , a very good vintage will be 20 to 30 years old and cost about $ 900 a glass .
Or about $ 3,600 a bottle .
Some vintages have sold at auction for $ 14,000 a bottle .
If you have the money , you have to try it .
I prefer natural scenery with my suppers , but if you prefer art , Paris is a given .
Plenty of restaurants there serve Romanee - Conti .
Or you could go southeast to Grenoble , find a great restaurant , then hike into the Chartreuse Mountains .
Spectacular .
1 Spaghetti Bolognese Bologna , Italy
For good and all , now and forever , the greatest spaghetti in the world is in Italy , and the finest restaurants are in Bologna .
Its nickname is “ di Grassa , ” “ Bologna the Fat . ”
Sure , the Chinese invented the noodles , but tomato sauces are expressly Italian .
New York City ai n’t got nothin’ on Bologna .
I ’ve been there , I ’ve had several spaghetti recipes , but the best by far , you will find at Clorofilla , Strada Maggiore , 64 , 40125 Bologna , Bologne .
It ’s almost as good as my recipe .
Bologna is a magnificently beautiful city , and not far north of some good mountain vistas .
Or you could take a leisurely drive over the Appennines to Firenze ( Florence ) and see the original Statue of David , among other works of art .
While you ’re in Bologna or Florence , be sure to catch Verdi ’s Requiem Mass .
When you leave , you ’ll go to confession , I ai n’t kiddin ’ ya .
MSNBC ’s Dylan Ratigan shouted down Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( D - FL ) after she could n’t answer why insurance stocks have increased since major reforms have been stripped from health care legislation .
The health care reform bill “ does very little to bring real choice and competition to the insurance market place , ” explained Ratigan .
“ It does very little to reform the insurance monopolies .
It does very little to create more choices for everybody in America for their health care but at the same time it mandates that everybody in America face penalties if they do n’t buy health care . ”

“ The result of that has been the following , ” continued Ratigan .
“ You know the monopoly scenario .
I want you to take a look at the insurance stocks in this country on news of the creation of millions of new customers but the bill does n’t reform the monopoly structure . ”
WellPoint stocks are up 12.6 % since November 17 .
United Health Group , Aetna and Humana are also up significantly .
Ratigan continued his rant , demanding an explanation for the increased stock prices .
“ Those health insurance companies are up because being an unreformed oligopoly monopoly and having now the benefit of a government who is assigning the expense of covering the uninsured to the taxpayer without reforming the monopoly .
It basically allows the taxpayer to take the hit for the uninsured but does not deal with the underlying symptom of why there are so many uninsured which is we have an unreformed private insurance monopoly in this country that is now being guaranteed more customers by the government , ” said Ratigan .
“ Why is that a good thing for America ? ” he asked .
“ Dylan , when this bill passes and becomes law , life in America for insurance companies is going to be very different than it is today , ” said Wasserman Schultz .

Ratigan interrupted , “ Apparently so .
Apparently it ’s worth another 10 % [ in their stock price . ] ”
“ Why are the stocks up ? ” he continued to demand .
“ I ’d love an opportunity to answer your question , ” Wasserman Schultz implored .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Go nuts , ” said Ratigan .
“ Because we are going to shift the insurance company focus health care reform system to a consumer focus system , ” Wasserman Schultz explained .
But that explanation was n’t good enough for Ratigan .
“ Hold on .
How is it a consumer focus system for you to mandate by law that people buy health insurance without giving them more choices ?
That is business driven . ”

“ If I can pass a law to force everyone to watch my TV show and not let them change — and have the government make it so you ca n’t change the channel .
That ’s what we ’re doing with health insurance , ” said Ratigan .

Holy yikes : an iceberg 25 kilometers across that broke off of Antarctica in 2000 has made a break for it and is headed toward Australia !
Check this out :
Whoa .
The berg has been monitored from space by NASA since November .
Usually , they circulate around Antarctica due to currents there but this one managed to escape , and is drifting northeast toward Australia 's south - southwest coast .
Since it broke off the main ice mass it shrank from 140 square kilometers ( and may I say HOLY CRAP 140 SQUARE KILOMETERS !
That 's 54 square miles ! ) down to 115 square km .
If you 're not sure how big that is , then think on this : Manhattan is 88 sq km .
It would fit comfortably inside that iceberg .
NASA is monitoring this berg using the Terra and Aqua satellites designed for just this purpose .
A shipping warning has been issued -- though it may be hard to miss a chunk of ice 20 freaking kilometers across , the berg itself is calving , and smaller shards could be a hazard to ships in the area .
That is a whole lot of ice .
I can't help thinking : it 's actually bigger than the Kuiper Belt Object spotted by Hubble which I wrote about earlier .
And it 's a whole lot closer .
Wow .
Once again , the Washington Post has given Sarah Palin the chance to harness herself to the political story of the hour .
The former Alaska governor has written an op -ed , published Wednesday , about the " Climate - gate " controversy at East Anglia University .
Palin calls on President Obama to boycott the Copenhagen climate summit because the leaked e-mails allegedly cast significant doubt on the scientific consensus about global warming .
With the publication of damaging e-mails from a climate research center in Britain , the radical environmental movement appears to face a tipping point .
By " radical , " Palin means the overwhelming scientific consensus ; virtually every major science academy in the country ; " tipping point " is a curious construction .
It implies that there is momentum behind their cause .
I gather Palin means to suggest the opposite .
The revelation of appalling actions by so - called climate change experts allows the American public to finally understand the concerns so many of us have articulated on this issue .
Remember , the " revelation " was born from an potentially illegal e-mail hack .
" So - called " -- untrue .
These are experts .
Their science has been validated , independently .
Their " actions " here consist of insulting climate change skeptics , immature name - calling , and , at worst , devising a strategy to keep the climate change deniers out of debates and peer - reviewed journals .
The " concerns " that Palin speaks of are the result of years of accumulated science denialism that now , conveniently , has been seemingly " validated " by the fog of a grand conspiracy , suddenly revealed .
" Climate - gate , " as the e-mails and other documents from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia have become known , exposes a highly politicized scientific circle -- the same circle whose work underlies efforts at the Copenhagen climate change conference .
True -- although the politicization came about as a response to an extremely well - funded political campaign by those whose bottom lines would be most harmed by carbon taxes , cap and trade schemes and the like .
The agenda - driven policies being pushed in Copenhagen wo n't change the weather , but they would change our economy for the worse .
A classic conflation here of " weather " and climate ; it 's ridiculous to try and change the weather , of course -- weather is so variable and unpredictable .
What the Copenhagen negotiators want to change is humanity 's contribution to global climate change .
Two different things .
The e-mails reveal that leading climate " experts " deliberately destroyed records , manipulated data to " hide the decline " in global temperatures , and tried to silence their critics by preventing them from publishing in peer - reviewed journals .
What 's more , the documents show that there was no real consensus even within the CRU crowd .
Some scientists had strong doubts about the accuracy of estimates of temperatures from centuries ago , estimates used to back claims that more recent temperatures are rising at an alarming rate .
For a sensible take on what the e-mails actually show , see here .
A few quick points : some of the e-mails discuss deleting data ; there are investigations underway to determine whether data was deleted ; there is no evidence that data was manipulated , aside from words deliberately taken out of context , like " trick " and " contain . "
Now -- the scientists may be guilty of misconduct for manipulating the UK 's freedom of information act procedures .
There is no excuse for that ; that is not how normal science works .
Let 's assume , for the moment , that their actions do cast doubt on their data , because , perhaps , their motivations are suspect .
The global warming consensus minus the East Anglia contributions is still a strong consensus , one that has been regularly , repeatedly and independently verified .
This scandal obviously calls into question the proposals being pushed in Copenhagen .
I 've always believed that policy should be based on sound science , not politics .
As governor of Alaska , I took a stand against politicized science when I sued the federal government over its decision to list the polar bear as an endangered species despite the fact that the polar bear population had more than doubled .
I got clobbered for my actions by radical environmentalists nationwide , but I stood by my view that adding a healthy species to the endangered list under the guise of " climate change impacts " was an abuse of the Endangered Species Act .
This would have irreversibly hurt both Alaska 's economy and the nation 's , while also reducing opportunities for responsible development .
Except that politics is motivating the critics as much as it is the " radical environmental " crowd .
And the " science " against AGW -- anthropogenic global warning -- is based on fitting into a grand theory the bits of data noise and occasionally unconventional results that scientists do get .
In other words , AGW is supported by the research -- it is a theory of probability ( not certainty ) that is large enough to account for discrepancies , too .
The case against AGW is supported by a theory that seizes on the discrepancies , magnifies them , and disregards the overwhelming weight of the evidence .
Our representatives in Copenhagen should remember that good environmental policymaking is about weighing real - world costs and benefits -- not pursuing a political agenda .
That 's not to say I deny the reality of some changes in climate -- far from it .
I saw the impact of changing weather patterns firsthand while serving as governor of our only Arctic state .
I was one of the first governors to create a subcabinet to deal specifically with the issue and to recommend common - sense policies to respond to the coastal erosion , thawing permafrost and retreating sea ice that affect Alaska 's communities and infrastructure .
Of course , that 's what politics is -- figuring out who gets what and who pays for it .
The language Palin is using -- cost and benefits -- is generally associated with opponents of environmental legislation .
But while it 's fair enough to call for a more rigorous debate about what our response to global warming should be , it 's difficult to get beyond Palin 's general dismissal of the science .
But while we recognize the occurrence of these natural , cyclical environmental trends , we can't say with assurance that man 's activities cause weather changes .
The " natural variation " canard ; the fact is that the trends we 're seeing now are n't natural and do n't seem cyclical , and AGW , as noted above , is a theory of probability ; based on the evidence , it is virtually certain that humans are causing a significant amount of climate ( not weather ! ) change over time .
As Grist 's experts put it ,
For something as critical as food , it is common sense that society should design for resilience .
Reliability in food production in the face of change requires a system capable of rapid evolution .
Resilience is therefore a core principle of sustainability .
Unfortunately , our daily bread relies on a food system that is not resilient .
As I have explained before , this state of affairs is an outcome of government policies , financial pressures , cheap fossil fuels , and market forces in play over the past several decades .
The result is a food system dominated by relatively few large actors , which creates conditions of rigidity and brittleness .
This post is a brief review of :
Note :
This is my second post based on a portion of my presentations at the recent Association for the Study of Peak Oil conference in Denver .
The first post is here .
Go to the ASPO web site for the complete slide deck .
Readers may also appreciate this article by Stoneleigh for more theoretical background .
Food Webs
Resilence is a concept from the science of ecology .
Ecologists study what are called food webs , which are feeding relationships among populations .
A simple food web might be a plant eaten by a browsing animal , which is eaten by predator .
When animals die a scavenger eats those bodies .
And the poop is eaten by microbes that make the nutrients available to the plants again .
Diagram of a simple food web with lines indicated feeding relationships among populations of plants , herbivores and carnivores .
A low diversity food web has strong connectivity between parts .
Therefore , the loss of one part ( as shown by the red cross mark through the herbivore ) has big effects on other parts of the food web .
Ecologists have found some important relationships between food web structures and their properties .
When food webs are very simple , meaning they have few parts that are connected to each other in straightforward ways , the system often shows unstable dynamics , such as widely fluctuating population sizes .
It is easy to see how this happens .
If a predator is dependent upon one prey , a decline in that prey will starve the predators .
An early and classic study of a low diversity food web .
With only a few , strong connections , volatile dynamics result .
By contrast , diverse food webs have many parts , and often the relationships among parts are weak and not so simple .
For example , instead of a few plant species there are many , and there are several herbivores that have a choice of feeding on different plants .
The same is true all the way up the food chain , with predators being able to feed on a variety of prey .
More diverse systems are more stable because if any particular plant or animal population goes into decline , feeding relationships are plastic and can adjust so that the loss of one part does n’t cause havoc with others .
High diversity food webs have weaker connectivity among parts and therefore built in redundancy .
This permits parts to adjust to losses , effectively buffering against volatility .
The Low Diversity Food System
Farms in the U.S. have become highly specialized to produce a narrow range of products .
In the Midwest , for example , corn and soy dominate .
In the Willamette Valley of Oregon , grass seed is king .
In 2009 , 71 % of U.S. cropland consisted of just three species ( source USDA ) .
Low diversity at the farm level is magnified by low diversity all along the input and supply chains .
Because of consolidation , few seed companies remain .
And when it comes to getting paid after harvest , there are fewer buyers for farm commodities , and fewer distributors and retailers too .
Few parts with strong connections among them preconditions the system for high volatility .
Seed industry consolidation 1996 - 2008 from Phil Howard of Michigan State University .
Reaction to this issue via antitrust litigation is now occurring .
A Context for the Future
The fundamental emergent properties and core functions of a resilient system remain stable even as rapid change is occurring , whether from external forces or the ebb and flow of individuals and populations that make up an ecosystem .
For the food system this means being able to produce , store and distribute food even when critical conditions alter dramatically , such as a credit crisis , energy shortfalls , or extremes in weather .
Cheap transportation fuels have obviously been key in the development of our current food system , which emphasizes producing crops with high regional comparative advantages in yields , labor , or mechanization , and exporting them .
If we foresee a future with continued and possibly greater economic , resource and environmental volatility , then reconfiguring the food system for resilience is a smart strategy .
Principles for doing so can be found by studying the structure of ecosystems .
The Resilient Farm Strategy
Natural systems are inherently resilient but just as their capacity to cope with disturbance can be degraded , so can it be enhanced .
The key to resilience in social - ecological systems is diversity .
Biodiversity plays a crucial role by providing functional redundancy .
For example , in a grassland ecosystem , several different species will commonly perform nitrogen fixation , but each species may respond differently to climatic events , thus ensuring that even though some species may be lost , the process of nitrogen fixation within the grassland ecosystem will continue .
Resilience Alliance
A resilient farm has diversified operations to buffer against volatility .
The benefits of diversity accrue in many ways .
Organic and especially agroecological farms are less dependent upon outside inputs that can change in price rapidly and unpredictably .
Crop rotation plans include many species of plants and animals that are complementary in functions , such as legumes fixing nitrogen , grasses building soil carbon , and animal manures making nutrients more readily available to plants .
Instead of buying mechanized services or fertility inputs , the farm integrates the functional diversity of life to create synergies .
A farm layout and field rotation pattern based on agroecological principles .
Colors represent different classes of production : green is pasture , brown is legumes , yellow is grains , red is cover crop , and blue is other seed crop .
Each image shows a different year of land - use .
Inherent diversity means no single crop failure will ruin the farm , and soil imbalances are prevented .
The focus is on soil health , with all fields going through periods of planting in perennial and deeply rooted species to build soil organic matter and mobilize minerals such as phosphorus from deep layers .
Fungi associating with roots locate source rock and solubilize minerals that are trans - located to leaves .
Topsoil fertility is therefore built from below .
Plant breeder Wes Jackson of the Land Institute ( right ) compares the root system of wheat ( left ) with that of a perennial wheat under development ( right ) .
Landscape structure is created to provide habitat for native and naturalized species that participate positively in the farm food web , such as pollinators and predators .
No need to buy pesticides when raptors have homes in the trees , predatory wasps have nectar sources , frogs can breed in clean water , and ground beetles have zones of refuge from tillage , for example .
While the emphasis is on letting the biology do the work , renewable energy infrastructure also creates resilience .
Farms are often ideal places for wind and solar technologies , and on - farm biofuels are likely to have positive energy returns .
The many differences between conventional and sustainable farming systems are compared .
Food System Resilience
Most farms in the U.S. operate for purposes of exchange , not self - reliance .
A resilient farm therefore needs to consider how it connects to the rest of the economy .
Do farms have few or multiple choices in the sources of seeds , fertilizers and other inputs ?
Do these inputs come from far away mines and seed companies , or from local businesses ?
Are farmers beholden to a dominant buyer or do many potential buyers exist for their products ?
To have a resilient food system the associative farm economy needs diversity too .
Since this is typically not the case anymore , transforming the food system , both on and off farm , takes time , coordination among actors , patient financial investment , and the ability to adapt .
Different economic arrangements are competitive at different periods of history .
I believe we are entering a time when the diminishing returns on previous investments will open up opportunities for new actors .
Because of economic volatility , what works going forward will be different than what worked in the past .
This is an age of great innovation where agroecological farming and local food system development will emerge as a natural and smart response to pressures of resource depletion , protection and enhancement of natural capital , and financial and job insecurity .
What will this new food system look like ?
It will be organized akin to an ecosystem , or food web .
Farms and renewable energy infrastructure occupy the level of primary producers , with businesses acting as conduits for feeding omnivorous humans .
In contrast to our current food system , which is linear in structure , the future food system will cycle nutrients back to the farm .
This structural constraint will mean that much more food is grown for local populations .
Nutrients will still leak from landscapes , and so maintaining long - term fertility will require replacing what is lost .
In forests of the Pacific Northwest , salmon migrations brought the mineral wealth of the ocean back to the land .
Restoring migratory fish habitat therefore aligns with the needs of agriculture .
Harvesting of kelp deposits on beaches and salt deposits from tidal zones and transporting them inland is another viable means of supporting the mineral richness in soils .
Bernie Winters of Clare Island , Ireland , harvests kelp from rocky beaches to remineralize the soils on his farm .
I hope this post has clearly framed the issue of food system resilience and the general principles involved .
Many examples exist that align with the goals of resilience , including novel distribution systems , farmer training programs , and specialists on soil restoration .
Please share other examples you know of , and discuss aspects of the challenges involved in more detail .
MIAMI -- Imagine for a moment that there was an alternate universe , where almost everything that was up was down in the Cavaliers ' expensive and multifaceted plan to re-sign LeBron James .
Say , for example , that last summer instead of trading for Shaquille O'Neal and signing three free agents to bolster the team 's depth that they did nearly nothing .
Even with James wanting improvements to the team more than ever .
Envision that , in defending this maneuver , they pointed the finger at James , saying the team cannot plan for the future until he gives it an answer on the contract extension offer he declined .
What if , citing a hit to his core business from the recession , owner Dan Gilbert said that now was the time to be fiscally responsible .
Consider the reaction if the Cavs had allowed a quality role player leave as a restricted free agent , declining to match a reasonable offer from a rival team simply because they did n't want to pay him at all .
Suppose that instead of adding a couple of support staffers that Gilbert slashed his coaches ' salaries and reduced the staff size in general .
With the trade deadline approaching , presume that instead having lots of talks with other teams about adding another starter - quality player to the roster -- at the cost of going deeper into the luxury tax this season and blowing up potential cap space for next summer -- that the Cavs instead were talking about deals that would get rid of players to get under the luxury tax .
Would GM Danny
Ferry be getting hate mail ?
Would Gilbert be blasted on local talk radio daily ?
Would columnists and commentators from across the country be taking turns berating the Cavs for what seems like a strategy to drive their top asset away ?
Yes , yes and probably yes .
Well , this situation does exist , about a 1,200 miles south and , apparently , a world away .
The way the Cavs and Heat are handling the impending free agency of their resident superstars are as opposite as their winter average temperatures .
The Cavs are , to use Gilbert 's phrase , going " all in " as they attempt to win a championship this season and convince James to stay .
They spent money on free agents , made a trade for a $ 20 million - a - year player , are active in trade talks and have added to their support staff to help convince James his best option is to stay home .
The Heat , meanwhile , are virtually folding their cards on this season and instead betting long - term with Dwyane Wade .
There are merits to both thought processes , as well as circumstances that do n't put both teams in the same situation .
But their different handling of the risk could lead to very different results in five months .
Last summer , armed with more than $ 25 million in expiring contracts -- not including Wade -- plus money to sign players , Heat President Pat Riley stared Wade down and told him to make the first move .
There was a contract extension on the table and Riley wanted Wade to sign it before he did anything to his roster .
" There can't be any major franchise changes made without his commitment , " Riley told the Miami Herald at the time .
" He knows this .
I 'm going to do the best sales job I can .
Whatever we do going forward is going to be predicated on that . "
From a business perspective , this is probably the proper move .
Why should the Heat commit long - term with Wade if he wo n't do the same ?
The Cavs made the same extension offer to James , who did n't commit either , then made moves that could potentially set them way back if James leaves .
But this is n't regular business , it is a star - dominated league where keeping the top players and keeping them happy is often the top priority .
Which is why Wade reacted in kind after Riley made those statements .
" I'm in my prime right now , playing the best basketball I 've ever played , and I feel as good as I ever felt , " Wade said last summer to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel .
" So let 's not wait .
Let 's do it now if we can do it .
So it 's not about me signing a contract . "
Riley did n't budge and Wade did n't sign , which led Wade to later say : " I always have the best interest of the basketball team every time I take the court .
But in this stage , where you 're talking about contracts and free agency , you have to think about yourself and what 's best . "
If this exchange had taken place between Ferry and James last summer there may have been picketing outside
The Q by furious and fearful fans .
It certainly would have made the back pages of the tabloids in New York .
Later , Heat owner Micky Arison , who is one of the richest men in America and has deeper pockets than Gilbert , expressed disappointment in Wade .
With his Carnival Cruise Lines feeling the effects of the economy , he laid off numerous Heat employees and rolled back all coaches ' salaries as much as 20 percent .
Recently there have been reports that the Heat , who are 23 - 20 and struggling to get Wade enough support many nights , are considering giving away a player to get under the luxury tax .
They let Jamario Moon leave last summer when the Cavs signed him to a two - year offer sheet .
" The reality is I do n't have his signature on a contract , " Arison told Miami media .
" We 've talked about an extension [ and ] I was disappointed we could n't come to a decision .
...
We 're trying to create a climate of fiscal discipline like every other business . "
Riley sort of followed through on his statements .
He did try to sign Lamar Odom as a free agent last summer -- but was offering way less than the Los Angeles Lakers and lost out , as expected .
He did trade for Quentin Richardson .
But Riley has refused to seriously consider trading Jermaine O'Neal , who has an expiring contract worth $ 22 million that would serve as a massive trade chip for a blockbuster move .
There is a method to this tactic .
By refusing to add to future payrolls by trading expiring contracts , the Heat will have a massive amount of cap space this summer .
If the Knicks were in the same position , they could realistically dream of getting Chris Bosh and James to come to New York .
The Knicks would have significant space , but not nearly as much as the Heat .
In a desirable city with a favorable state income tax structure , Riley is figuring Miami can be a destination for free agents .
The idea is they have Wade already and , by biting the bullet now , they save and offer the chance for Bosh , Amare Stoudemire or even James himself to head for the wonderful sights in South Beach .
With five championship rings , including one he won with Wade , Riley has the cache to attempt something like this .
Ferry and Cavs coach Mike Brown , who both have championship rings but not Riley 's rep , can't run the same risk in a cold - weather town without a history of championships .
But then all of Riley 's plan is one massive gamble .
The Knicks will beckon to Wade if they lose out on James .
Plus Wade 's hometown team , the Chicago Bulls , will also have salary cap space to sign him and pair him with young star and fellow Chicago native Derrick Rose for the hometown mother lode .
Which strategy will work ?
The Cavs ' big - spending , keep the big man happy as possible attitude ?
Or the Heat 's planned , responsible and leveraged approach ?
Most of the time in the NBA , the home team keeps the stars in free agency , the rules favor it , so they both could win .
But if one or both lose , there is sure going to be a lot of explaining to do .

I just got off the phone with T - Mobile who transferred me over to HTC Technical Support because I was not receiving data on my phone , opening the Android Browser indicated I needed to contact T - Mobile and add a DataConnect Plan in order to receive data on my phone .
T - Mobile check everything on my account & appeared ok then transferred me to HTC Technical Support who indicated there currently is a problem with most Nexus One devices connecting to Data Services on the T - Mobile Network and they hope to have it fixed sometime this morning .
Frustrating to say the least !
This seems to be the common experience :
The prompt to buy a new data plan , the call to T - Mobile , the transfer to HTC support , then the claim that everything will be fixed soon .
Some users are reporting HTC reps saying all HTC devices are having issues on T - Mobile , but the evidence — the growing thread of reports from users — does n't seem to bear that out .
This looks like a Nexus One problem , and a strange one : Without a carrier fault or software update , why would a phone just stop working ?

I 'll let you know when the dust settles — throw your theories in the comments .
— Thanks , tipsters !
UPDATE : The issue has been fixed .
Nexus
One owners were the only ones affected , though the blame seems to fall at T - Mobile 's feet .
To anyone still having issues : just restart your super phones .
She and her friends had not noticed the suspect , identified by the police as Geraldo Sanchez , 37 , an exterminator from the Bronx , when he boarded at Rockefeller Center .
Nor had they realized that he had gone on a rampage at the other end of the car , spilling food and demanding that a passenger , Dwight Johnson , 36 , vacate a seat beside one of the doors .
Mr. Johnson said there were other seats .
Mr. Sanchez said he wanted that seat .
Soon he pulled out a knife and slashed Mr. Johnson ’s hands and neck , witnesses said .
Ms. Nuñez said Mr. Johnson staggered through the car , bleeding , with Mr. Sanchez right behind him .
“ We did n’t know what to do , ” Ms. Nuñez said , and she and her friends realized they might be in danger : “ We were stuck with the killer . ”
The fear behind that thought deepened when someone pulled the emergency brake cord , freezing the train between Rockefeller Center and the Seventh Avenue station .
The passengers were trapped in the car with the suspect and the dying victim longer than if the train had gone on to the station and had been met by the police .
As the train sat in the tunnel , the terrified passengers huddled together .
Mr. Sanchez walked by and began trying to open the locked door leading to the next car .
“ We did n’t know what to do , ” Ms. Nuñez said .
“ A guy standing with us said , ‘ Do n’t move . ’ ”
Another passenger , a woman , fainted .
The man with her tried to revive her , Ms. Nuñez said .
After several long minutes , the train started moving again .
It pulled into the next station , at Seventh Avenue , but the doors remained closed .
One of Ms. Nuñez ’s friends said it appeared that the two officers on the platform were waiting for backups to arrive .
That left the passengers in the car feeling vulnerable anew .
“ People were looking at us like we were in the zoo , ” said the friend , who asked not to be identified because she had not told her father that she had been at the scene .

Massively increased computing power , large , high - resolution monitors , and relatively cheap and fast download rates have turned the computer into a threat to traditional TV broadcasting , both pay and free to air .
To save itself , TV is having to become a lot more like the web .
'' It 's becoming a semantic question whether television is a URL on the internet or the internet is a channel on the television set , '' says Jeff Cole , a futurist and the director of the Centre for the Digital Future at the University of Southern California .
'' The key word is convergence . ''
Dr Cole says the old model of television broadcasting is almost irrelevant already : '' Teenagers barely understand the concept of watching television on a broadcast network 's schedule , '' he says .
'' If you talk to them about the days when you used to have a favourite show and you had to be home before it started and you could n't leave the house until after it aired …''
He lets the absurdity of that proposition hang in the air , even though most Australians grew up with it .
But the ability to record now and watch later - which began with the introduction of the VCR to living rooms in the late 1970s - has fundamentally changed the game .
The industry calls it '' time - shifting ' ' , and it poses a major threat to the business model of free - to - air broadcasting .
The free - to - air model relies on a network being able to deliver an audience of a certain size and demographic at a set time .
That guarantee allows commercial networks to sell advertising spaces at a set rate - hence the importance of TV ratings .
Advertisers are , effectively , buying eyeballs .
But when those eyeballs have the opportunity to record and watch later - at a time when they are less inclined to make grocery - buying decisions , for instance - or to fast - forward through the ads entirely , the business model falters .
The problem has become so serious that from December 27 , OzTAM - which collects ratings for the networks - will for the first time begin tracking time - shift audiences .
Anyone in the ratings sample group who records a program to a personal video recorder and watches it within seven days will , for the first time , be counted as a viewer .
In the US , where Nielsen has been tracking time - shift audiences within three days of broadcast , ratings have been boosted by as much as 25 per cent for some programs .
That 's great news for traditional broadcasters .
But time - shifting is just one of the fronts on which they are vulnerable .
Video on demand is another .
Whether legally or illegally , the tech - savvy have been able to search for programming online for years , and download to watch on their computers .
Now the same service is downloaded or streamed over the internet and watched on the television screen .
In the last three weeks alone , Australian viewers have been promised the following : Telstra 's T - Box , which will allow paid content to be streamed or recorded , with unmetered downloads from BigPond 's libraries ; the ABC iView player , which can now play content on the TV via Sony 's PlayStation 3 ; and a hook - up between iiNet and TiVo to stream free , unmetered content to the television .
In the US , the shift is even more advanced .
Hulu - a joint venture between News Corp and NBC - allows subscribers to stream a vast array of content legally and free ( for now at least ; Hulu is expected to start charging next year ) .
Originally , that content could only be watched on the computer , but software recently released allows it to be relayed to the TV via the PlayStation , X - Box and Wii gaming consoles .
Hulu was launched in 2008 and already has more than 42 million users .
In October , it delivered 856 million downloads , almost twice as many as the preceding month .
According to the head of digital marketing at IBM Australia , Martin Walsh , '' the Australian TV networks had the opportunity to joint venture to bring Hulu to Australia , but they turned it down ' ' .
While they may rue that decision , another US service provider , Netflix , is rumoured to be working with TV manufacturers to develop a set that would eliminate the need for peripheral devices such as game consoles or computer hard drives .
In Ericsson 's Asia -Pacific TV Centre in Port Melbourne , a '' techspert ' ' is talking through the company 's vision of the future .
He 's demonstrating a set - up that will allow multiple TVs or computers or other devices scattered throughout a household to stream content individually while remaining networked so that each user can send messages to the others - '' dinner 's ready , come to the table ' ' , for instance - or even to keep tabs on the household energy use or grandma 's medical records .
As for entertainment , he says , '' everything that 's ever been made could quite feasibly be stored on servers , for you to download instantly , whenever you want ' ' .
'' It 's bringing the web and internet experience into one , '' says Kursten Leins , Ericsson 's strategic marketing manager .
'' The vision has been there for a long time .
The reality is it 's actually happening now . ''
That reality is called Internet Protocol Television , or IPTV .
It is , many believe , where everything is heading , though Leins argues there are significant hurdles .
First , it will not become fully realised until the national broadband network is rolled out - we need fast download rates to make full use of the offerings - and that 's at least five years off .
And second , there are issues of governance .
'' The biggest stumbling block is regulation , '' Leins says .
'' At the moment you have a separate regime for telecommunications and another for broadcasting .
When you 're talking about the blending of all these services , it 's the regulation that will get in the way , not the technology . ''
But those issues are certain to be resolved because the Federal Government is committed to the digital future .
It is the key to giving Australia a ' ' competitive edge ' ' , in the Government 's view , and will enable cheaper and faster delivery of everything from health care to education .
And , of course , it will also facilitate an explosion of choice in entertainment .
So , with the viewer liberated from the tyranny of the TV programmer , will the networks and pay TV operators cease to exist ?
Maybe , says futurist Jeff Cole .
'' We 're still going to have scheduling for people over the age of 50 or 60 , but that 's gradually going to diminish .
It will go mostly to on - demand . ''
IAN LYNCH SMITH , a shaggy - haired ball of energy in his late 30s , beams as he ticks off some of the games that Freeverse , his little Brooklyn software company , has landed on the iPhone App Store ’s coveted ( and ever - changing ) list of best - selling downloads : Moto Chaser , Flick Fishing , Flick Bowling and Skee - ball .
Skee - ball , Mr. Smith says , took about two months to develop and deploy and then raked in $ 181,000 for Freeverse in one month .
The company ’s latest bid for App Store fame ?
A game featuring a Jane Austen character in a lacy dress who karate - chops her way through hordes of advancing zombies .
“ There ’s never been anything like this experience for mobile software , ” Mr. Smith says of the App Store boom .
“ This is the future of digital distribution for everything : software , games , entertainment , all kinds of content . ”
As the App Store evolves from a kitschy catalog of novelty applications into what analysts and aficionados describe as a platform that is rapidly transforming mobile computing and telephony , it is changing the goals and testing the patience of developers , bolstering sales of the Apple motherships the applications ride upon  the iPhone and iPod Touch  and causing Apple ’s competitors to overhaul their product lines and business models .
It even threatens to open chinks in Apple ’s own corporate armor .
In a striking scene of civil disobedience , dozens of students barricaded themselves inside a UC - Berkeley building for more than 11 hours Friday to protest a 32 percent increase in student fees .
The dramatic display ended Friday evening with dozens of arrests , climaxing a week of civil unrest mirrored at other campuses around the state , including Davis and Santa Cruz , where hundreds marched for the third day Friday to decry one of the biggest fee hikes in UC history .
But it seemed unlikely that the protests are having any impact .
Repeated budget cuts to the 10 - campus system forced UC regents this week to raise the cost of an undergraduate education above $ 10,000 a year by next fall , triple the cost of a decade ago .
The move followed a 10 percent hike earlier this year , employee furloughs and other cuts that UC leaders say are necessary because of a 20 percent drop in state funding .
Still , students continued to try to make their voices heard .
“ We have tried going to Sacramento , we ’ve tried less direct and less confrontational ways of getting our voices heard , ” said UC - Davis student Laura Mitchell of Palo Alto , who on Thursday joined a march of hundreds of students to the campus administration building , Mrak Hall .
On Wednesday , police arrested 51 protesters there .
About 7:30 a.m. Friday , about 50 students stormed the second floor of Wheeler Hall on the Berkeley campus , hunkering inside the building into the night as they used Twitter posts and a bullhorn to communicate with a growing number of demonstrators gathered outside .
About 11 hours later , police arrested 41 demonstrators on trespassing charges , including some nonstudents .
During the standoff , one of the protesters leaned out a second - floor window , telling the crowd below that the demonstrators would not relent until the university repealed the fee hike , made the budget more transparent and agreed not to charge the protesters .
They also called for the firing of UC President Mark Yudof , who students blamed for the spiraling cost of an education .
As the day wore on , the scene became more unruly as protesters pushed through steel barricades , and dozens of police and sheriff ’s deputies in riot gear held them back using batons that set off chants against the officers .
At least one officer was taken to the hospital , but the extent and cause of his injuries were unknown .
Police , meanwhile , refuted claims that officers used unnecessary force .
Friday ’s protests at Berkeley forced the cancellation of classes at Wheeler .
Several other campus buildings also were shut down as a routine precaution .
Outside Wheeler Hall , dozens of supporters gathered throughout the day as word of the protest spread .
The demonstrators hung a sign out of a window that read , “ 32 Percent Hike , 900 layoffs , ” with the word “ Class ” crossed out in red .
At UC - Santa Cruz , hundreds of students , staff and faculty crowded Clark Kerr Hall — the administration building — in a third day of protests Friday , forcing the campus to shut down the building .
Students also occupied Kresge Town Hall , where they stayed overnight .
“ We need to keep mobilizing and keep coming out here , ” graduate student Mark Paschal yelled into a bullhorn .
“ It ’s the only way — if we join together . ”
Speaking to the Academic Senate on Friday , UC - Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal said he understands why students are angry , but he said the outrage should be directed toward lawmakers who made historic cuts to education this year .
As students held protest signs in the audience , Blumenthal told them that occupying buildings is a waste of resources .
“ An occupation is an act of civil disobedience , and such actions have consequences , ” Blumenthal said , adding that lost employee time and repairing property damage just adds to UC ’s financial problems .
“ Basically , the university will incur more costs at a time when we cannot afford to have more costs . ”
Anthropology professor Shelly Errington , president of the Santa Cruz Faculty Association , urged professors to find a way to empathize with students .
“ Students are suffering terribly , ” Errington said .
“ They are taking on more and more jobs and debt , which means they are able to study less .
Therefore , it makes our own jobs less satisfying . ”

Ever since the Falklands wolf was described by Darwin himself , the origin of this now - extinct canid found only on the Falkland Islands far off the east coast of Argentina has remained a mystery .
Now , researchers reporting in the November 3rd issue of Current Biology who have compared DNA from four of the world 's dozen or so known Falklands wolf museum specimens to that of living canids offer new insight into the evolutionary ancestry of these enigmatic carnivores .
" One of the big draws for an evolutionary biologist is that this species had a big influence on Darwin 's ideas about how species evolve , " said Graham Slater of the University of California , Los Angeles , noting that Darwin recognized differences between the East Falkland and West Falkland wolves as evidence that species are not fixed entities .
But the wolves ' circumstances were also just downright puzzling .
" It 's really strange that the only native mammal on an island would be a large canid , " Slater explained .
" There are no other native terrestrial mammals - - not even a mouse .
It 's even stranger when you consider that the Falklands are some 480 kilometers from the South American mainland .
The question is , how did they get there ? "
Possible explanations for the wolves ' presence on the islands , which have never been connected to the South American mainland , range from dispersal by ice or logs to domestication and subsequent transport by Native Americans .
Ultimately , the Falklands wolf died out because it was perceived as a threat to settlers and their sheep , although fur traders took out a lot of the population as well .
Biologists have also puzzled over the Falklands wolf 's ancestry .
It had been suggested that they were related to domestic dogs , North American coyotes , or South American foxes .
Slater said the wolves were the size of a coyote , but much stockier , with fur the color of a red fox .
They had short muzzles , just like gray wolves , and thick , wooly fur .
Slater 's team now reports that the Falklands wolf 's closest living relative is actually the maned wolf -- an unusually long - legged , fox - like South American canid .
The researchers also found that the four Falklands wolf samples that they examined shared a common ancestor at least 70,000 years ago , which suggests that they arrived on the islands before the end of the last ice age and before humans ever made it into the New World .
That rules out the prevailing theory that Native Americans had anything to do with their presence on the islands .
" The biggest surprise was that the divergence of the Falklands wolf from its closest living relative , the maned wolf , occurred over 6 million years ago , " Slater said .
" Canids do n't show up in the South American fossil record until 2.5 million years ago , which means these lineages must have evolved in North America .
The problem is that there are no good fossils that can be assigned to the Falklands wolf lineage in North America . "
Given that maned and Falklands wolves split so long ago , there should be fossils of their close relatives in South America , Slater said .
And in fact , the researchers may have a candidate : a species from Patagonia called Dusicyon avus , which went extinct 6,000 to 8,000 years ago .
Slater says that 's a possibility that study coauthor Alan Cooper at the University of Adelaide in Australia is further investigating now .

This file is provided for the purposes of amusement , and the actual use of any of these methods is not recommended without first considering other possibilities , such as dying of old age .
Please do not pass it onto people whom you know to be actively suicidal .. you may find yourself in jail for considerable periods .
I have a small amount of info on British law regarding assisting suicides ; feel free to ask me for a copy .
Basically , distribution to a number of unknown people is fine , but giving it to someone whom you know is actively considering suicide can get you into jail for up to 14 years .
I should also point out that this file is distributed world - wide , and there will be significant differences in the legal aspects in other countries .
Calle :
For example , in Sweden the distribution of this file is completely legal , according to a lawyer I know .
As long as you do n't physically help someone to commit suicide , you 're safe .
According to the lawyer mentioned above , Dr. Kevorkian 's suicide machine would probably be legal in Sweden .

I will try to add an index in the next days -- erik Methods : POISON [ 1 ] makes most of these points : * Most drugs cause vomiting .
To help stop this , take one or two anti- histamine tablets ( travel sickness , allergy , hayfever tablets etc ) about0 an hour before , on a fairly empty stomach .
*
If the drugs are in tablet form , take the first 20 % as they are , and the rest crushed and dissolved / mixed in with strong alcohol / food .
This helps the drugs to hit at the same time .
* Alcohol helps dissolve the drugs .
Do n't drink any beforehand , but wash the tablets down with vodka or similar , and then drink afterwards while you 're still conscious .
*
Use a large airtight plastic bag over your head , + something around your neck to hold it on .
This transforms a 90 % certainty method into a 99 % ... * Friday night is a good time if you life alone - nobody will miss you until Monday if you work .
Bolt all the doors you can .
Say you 'll be out over the weekend visiting someone , so people do n't expect a reply to telephone .
*
Some painkillers etc have less effect if you use them normally ( tolerance ) . *
In general , you need to stay away from medical help until you actually die , but there are exceptions to this ( that have been pointed out in the text ) .
Common drugs : * Cyanide ( HCN , KCN ) Dosage : 50 mg Hydrogen Cyanide gas , 200-300 mg Cyanide salts
Time : seconds for HC , minutes Cs ( empty stomach ) hours ( full s ) Available : very difficult to get hold of Certainty : very certain Notes :
It helps to have an empty stomach ( since the salts react with the stomach acids to form H.C. ) .
A full stomach can delay death for up to four hours with the salts .
Antidotes to cyanide poisoning exist , but they have serious side effects .
What you can do , is instead of taking the salts directly , drop 500 mg or so into a strong acid , and inhale the fumes .
This will be pure Hydrogen Cyanide , and you should die in 10 to 20 seconds . [ 3 ] : " Hydrocyanic acid is one of the most poisonous substances known ; the inhalation of its fumes in high concentration will cause almost immediate death .
Hydrogen cyanide acts by preventing the normal process of tissue oxidation and paralyzing the respiratory center in the brain .
Most of the accidental cases are due to inhaling the fumes during a fumigating process .
In the pure state it kills with great rapidity .
Crystalline cyanides , such as potassium or sodium cyanide are equally poisonous , since they interact with the hydrochloric acid in the stomach to liberate hydrocyanic acid .
This poison has been used for both homicide and suicide ; in recent history , a number of European political figures carried vials of cyanide salt for emergency self - destruction and some used them .
Death resulted from amounts of only a fraction of a gram .
A concentration of 1 part in 500 of hydrogen cyanide gas is fatal .
Allowable working concentration in most of the United States is 20 ppm .
Two and one - half grains of liquid acid has killed .
The acid acts fatally in about 15 minutes .
The cyanide salts kill in several hours .
The average dose of solution is 0.1 cc. [ 1 , DGHS talking about KCN ] : on an empty stomach , take a small glass of cold tap water .
( Not mineral water nor any sort of juice or soda water because of it's acidity ) .
Stir 1 -> 1.5 grammes of KCN into the water .
More than that causes irritation to the throat .
Wait 5 minutes to dissolve .
It should be drunk within several hours .
Consciousness will be lost in about a minute .
Death will follow 15 -> 45 minutes later .
* Aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) Dosage : 20 - 30 + grammes ( too many cause vomitting )
Time : hours to days , variable Available : easy to get hold of ( get soluble ones , & dissolve them ) Certainty : unreliable Notes :
Not recommended , fatal dose varies wildly , could cause liver & kidney damage instead of death .
OD causes strange noises in your ears ( like a video arcade ) & projectile vomiting after about 10 hours .
Medical help generally effective , so stay out of hospital for a couple of days .
May cause bleeding in your stomach / upper intestines .
Take with sodium bicarbinate ( eg , bicarb . of soda ) , which speeds up the absorption ( sp ? ) significantly .
Take 1 or 2 antihistamine tablets .
* Paracetamol ( aka acetaminopren / tylenol ) Dosage : 15 + grammes , 20 + is better Time : 10 hours fatal damage , but 2 weeks to actually die Available : easy to get hold of Certainty : fairly reliable Notes :
Once 10 - 12 hours is up , you 've had it , but you still live for a week or two after that .
Probably better to wait 15 hours just to make sure .
Horrible side effects during this time ( some of which are : acute toxic hepatitis , renal failure , cerebral oedema , intra-abdominal bleeding , aspiration pneumonia , haemophilia ) .
Too small dose causes severe liver damage .
Accidental deaths are very common .
There are few if any side effects before the damage becomes fatal ; occasionally vomitting and nausea .
* Sleeping tablets ( see specific notes for each kind )
See later entries for amobarbital , butabarbital , diazepam , flurazepam , glutethimide , chloral hydrate , hydromorphone , meprobamate , methyprylon , meperidine ( pethidine ) , methadone , morphine , orphenadrine , phenobarbital [ also check trade names in same entries ] .
* Alcohol ( spirits preferably , your choice ) Dosage : 1/2 litre vodka ? , similar .
Varies from person to person .
Time : about 8 hours Available : good Certainty : unreliable Notes : will cause liver and kidney damage if ' rescued ' before death .
Drink it all at the same time , quickly as possible .
Dosage is questionable , I do n't have any figures .
Taking the spirits as an enema is supposed to be a very quick way of absorbing alcohol , but a less unpleasant way is to inject it .
The dosage it takes to kill you depends on whether you drink normally , the state of your liver , whether you pass out on your back or not . [ 3 ] :
" The fatal dose of pure alcohol in an average adult is 300 - 400 mL ( 750 - 1000 mL of 40 % alcohol ) if consumed in less than one hour .
Apart from the effects of overdosage , death after alcohol consumption can occur as a result of choking on vomit while unconscious .
.....
Consequences such as liver damage occur after chronic consumption . "
Alcohol helps other drugs to dissolve .
Do n't drink it in advance , wash down tablets with it , & follow by drinking another few glasses of spirits .
* Water Dosage : 14 litres mentioned Time : 12 hours or so ?
Available : always available Certainty : unknown Notes : works by washing out the salts in your body , until the cells fail ( osmotic balance buggered up ) .
You need to keep drinking continually until you collapse .
Unusual method .
Someone suggested it would also cause cramps .
The following is something from [ 2 ] : " About a year ago a local newspaper carried a story about a woman who had drunk herself to death .
Apparently she had ingested something mildly poisonous , and when she called her doctor asking him what to do , he told her to drink lots of water and see him in the morning .
She got to it and managed to drink no less than 14 litres of water before the osmotic balance in her body was so upset it could no longer function and she died ( do n't know how quickly ) " .
Calle :
The above anecdote originally came from me , and the death described occured in Vdxjv , Sweden .
Unfortunately I no longer remember which newspaper I saw it in .
Recently , I was told about a similar case in San Antonio .
It supposedly happened a couple of years ago and was reported in the local San Antonio Express / News .
* Bleach and other corrosives ( lye , drain cleaning fluids )
Dosage : A bottle ( litre or half litre ) Time : Hours / days Available : Easily available Certainty : Uncertain Notes : Bloody painful - depends on your stomach getting corroded , the stomach acids escaping , and doing their dirty work in your vital organs . [ 1 ] says : " I have heard of people throwing themselves through plate glass windows in their death agonies after drinking lye . "
* Insulin ( injected ) Dosage : No idea Time : death in hours to days Available : Difficult to get hold of unless you 're a diabetic or a vet Certainty : reasonable Notes : Supposed to be quite pleasant ( eg insulin shock treatments used for some psychiatric condition ) .
* Petrol ( in lungs / injected ) Dosage : " A Thimble - full " - 20 ml ?
Time : Seconds / minutes Available : Common Certainty : I 'm not sure of the dosage , but fairly certain if correct Notes : Can also use LPG ( propane / butane ) on skin surface ( since these are light enough to go through the skin ) .
Stick your hand in a bucket of propane and see how many seconds you last ... * Oil of Wintergreen / Methyl Salicylate ( in lungs / injected ) Dosage : Probably similar to petrol ( 20 ml ) Time : Do n't know Available : Not available in concentration Certainty : Do n't know Notes :
Do n't have enough information on this one to be able to say anything about it .
If it is just taken normally , it is the same as aspirin .
* Malathion ( insecticide ) ( entry revised by Calle ) Dosage : A few bottles , at least Time : 2 to 3 hours Available : From a large garden centre or DIY shop Certainty : not so good Notes : A correspondent mentions that the LD50 of this stuff is 1 g/kg in rats , and adds that there is not nearly that much in a bottle .
He also mentions that it is treatable .
Instead of this , he recommends parathion , if you really want to use an insecticide .
* Phosphine gas from aluminium phosphide pesticide ( ALP ) Dosage : Single 3 gramme tablet ( " .. is enough to kill 10 people " )
Time : About 2 hours Available : Difficult .
Used in India , sold on black market .
Certainty : Without medical help , and using fresh pill , very good Notes :
This is a common way of committing suicide in Indian villages .
There is no specific antidote to this .
The pills are 3 grammes of ALP , which produces lethal phosphine gas when it comes in contact with hydrochloric acid or water in the stomach .
After severe vomiting , the victim loses consciousness , the blood vessels rupture , and body cavities fill with blood .
While the pill is exceedingly lethal , some escape death because the rate of the gas ' release declines with the pill 's age and use , and exposure to moisture .
Trouble with this one is the availability , and it also looks like a rather unpleasant .
* Rat poison ( Warfarin ) Dosage : not known
Time : Hours to terminal damage , days to actual death Available : Available Certainty : Certain given suffient dosage .
Most probably treatable .
Notes :
This is one of the truly unpleasant poisons , along with Paracetamol / Acetylminopren .
I think it causes cerebral haemorage ( rat poison works by giving the unfortunate rat haemophillia ) .
Doctors can't do anything about it , they just leave you to die in agony on an intensive care ward .
Calle : Since human haemophiliacs usually live quite ordinary lives , the above sounds rather improbable .
* Caffeine Dosage : 20 grammes ( someone said 8 -> 10 grammes )
Time : not known Available : Caffeine tablets available in Chemist shops Certainty : do n't know Notes : I do n't know very much about this .
There is n't all that much caffeine in coffee , maybe 200 mg .
* Potassium Chloride ( injected in solution ) / KCl Dosage : not known ( try 20 cc injection of strong solution ) Time : Seconds to minutes Available : Widely available Certainty : Certain given correct dosage Notes : Causes heart attack ( which is painful ) .
May be difficult for coroner to realise it was suicide rather than a natural heart attack .
An excess of K+ in the blood interferes with nerve signals , and stops muscles and nerves from working .
So when it reaches your heart , the heart stops .
* Nitrogen gas ( or other inert gas ) Dosage : Several litres uncompressed is minimum Time : Minutes Available :
Try plumber , or welding supplies company Certainty : Certain Notes :
This is really a form of asphyxiation , ( see later ) , but is particularly good since you do n't experience the lack of oxygen ( what people really experience is the EXCESS of carbon dioxide ) .
* Nitrous oxide ( N20 ? NO2 ? ) Dosage : Unknown Time : Minutes Available : Dentists supply would be good Certainty : reasonable Notes : Asphyxiate yourself with laughing gas .
Nice . * Carbon Monoxide ( CO ) Dosage : 5 % concentration or so ?
Time : Minutes to hours depending on concentration Available :
You get it out of a car exhaust , you used to be able to use " town gas " ( eg , stick your head in the cooker ) but this is no longer available Certainty : Fairly certain , as long as you are n't " rescued " Notes : Causes brain damage .
Calle : A correspondent from Denmark , where you still can use " town gas " to kill yourself , says that even though it 's possible it 's not a good idea .
He tells of an incident where a family committed suicide by turning on the gas and waiting .
Apparently , the heavier - than - air carbon monoxide leaked through the floor and reached the people in the apartment below .
Not nice .
The actual cause of death is asphyxiation , since the carbon monoxide binds tighter to haemoglobine than oxygen does ( the oxygen gets crowded out , so to speak ) .
* Chlorine gas Dosage : not known
Time : not known Available : tricky Certainty : Good Notes :
This was used in the first world war in the trenches .
Probably very unpleasant , does something to the lungs .
* Hydrazine Dosage :
As produced by reaction Time : Not known , fortnight ?
Available : Bottle of bleach & bottle of ammonia Certainty : not known Notes : [ 2 ] : " This is no joke , D----.
Several years ago at my high school , one of the janitors innocently mixed together half a bottle of bleach with half a bottle of of ammonia in a small closet where the cleaning fluids were kept .
He passed out due to the hydrazine ( not chlorine ) gas released in the reaction between the two chemicals .
This man was in agony for two weeks in an intensive care unit in a local hospital with the majority of the inside surface of his lungs damaged and untreatable before he got lucky and died . "
* Chloroform Dosage : not known , just put a splash onto a rag Time : several minutes probably Available : not known Certainty : good Notes :
If you tape the rag over your mouth so that you get knocked out , you should die as you continue getting the stuff into your lungs .
* Digitalis ( Foxglove , Digitalis Purpurea )
Dosage : not known
Time : not known Available : extract from foxgloves Certainty : bad due to vomiting Notes : [ 4 ] :
Gives you a heart - attack .
Symptoms : nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , diarrhoea , headache , and slow irregular pulse .
Also sometimes trembling , convulsions , delirium , and hallucinations .
Its difficult to take a fatal amount because vomiting usually gets rid of it .
* Yew ( Taxus Baccata , the " English Yew " )
Dosage : not known
Time : Can be very rapid ( minutes ) , occasionally 3 or 4 days .
Available : Grows wild in the UK , do n't know about elsewhere .
Certainty : not sure , but it sounds good if you eat enough Notes : [ 4 ] :
All parts of the plant , _except_ for the fleshy red bit of the fruit , contain poisons .
The seeds are poisonous , so if you eat the berries , chew them .
Symptoms : nausea , abdominal pain , coma , death .
The mode of death is a heart attack which occurs rapidly after eating sufficient .
If no heart attack occurs , you 'll probably survive .
Sometimes the sudden collapse leading to death is preceded by lethargy , trembling , staggering , coldness , dilation of the pupils , rapid pulse that becomes weak , and convulsions .
Other species in this genus are said to be equally poisonous .
See " plants in general " .
* Mezerein , Daphnetoxin ( Mezereon , AKA Daphne Mezereum , AKA D. Laureola ) Dosage : " a few " .
Probably 10 or more .
Time : not known Available : Garden plant .
Seeds are particularly poisonous .
Certainty : not known , dosage is questionable .
Notes : [ 4 ] :
The berries taste horrid , but you only need to eat a few to cause death .
Symptoms : burning sensation in mouth , nausea , vomiting , stomach pains , diarrhoea , weakness , disorientation , convulsions , followed by death .
The seeds can be dried and stored without affecting the poisons .
Do n't confuse this with laurels in the Prunus genus , Rosacea family .
See " plants in general " .
* Atropine ( Atropa Belladonna AKA Deadly Nightshade .
Also potato fruits )
Dosage : 5 berries in young children .. maybe 30 in adults ?
Time : 6 to 24 hours Available : from fruits of some plants in the potato family .
Certainty : unknown , particularly dosage is questionable Notes : [ 4 ] : AB also contains hyoscyamine and hyoscine ( scopolamine ) .
Symptoms : dry mouth , flushed face , dilation of pupils , rapid pulse .
Possibly also breathing difficulties , constipation , convulsions , hallucinations , and coma .
AB is often confused with other Nightshade species , which are n't as poisonous .
The berries are black in AB , and red in Woody Nightshade .
In addition , the flowers are larger ( 1.2 in ) in the true Deadly Nightshade .
Present in unripe deadly nightshake fruits , fruits of potato , and fruits of other members of this family ( not tomato though ! ) , but stick with AB .
See the " plants in general " entry .
Calle : A correspondent mentions that Jimsonweed will also do , and that a specific antidote exists .
* Oleander ( Nerium Oleander .
Poison similar to digitalis )
Dosage : not known , but fairly small amounts .
Time : unknown .
Available : leaves , wood of the plant .
From garden centres .
Certainty : unknown .
Notes : [ 4 ] :
Deaths have been caused by using wood from this plant in fires , and making tea from the leaves .
In a few hours there is abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , bloody diarrhoea , rapid pulse , and visual effects .
Later , a slow , weak , irregular pulse and fall in blood pressure , followed by failure of heart .
See the " plants in general " entry .
* Death - Cap / Destroying - Angel toadstool ( Amanita Phalloides )
Dosage : Fraction of one can kill , but eat 1 or 2 just in case .
Time : Week or so Available :
Have to know what it looks like .. similar edible ones Certainty : Definite without med .
treatment ; unknown with .
Notes : [ 5 , Volume 7 , pp591-592 ] : " Poisoning by toxic Amanita species is characterised by a delay in onset of 4 to 12 hours .
At this point , nausea vomiting , colic - like pain , and diarrhea occur .
There then follows a period of respite , which can last for two to four days .
This phase does NOT signify recovery : damage to the liver and kidneys continues to develop and the respite gives way to hepatic and renal failure .
Death usually occurs a week or so after poisoning . " .
See " plants in general " .
* Ricin ( Castor oil plant , Ricinus Communis )
Dosage : death has occured from eating 1 bean , but take more than 10 Time : within 3 to 5 days Available : From eating the castor beans Certainty : depends on ricin content of the beans .
Pure ricin is deadly Notes : [ 2 ] and [ 4 ] :
Symptoms begin within a few hours with abdominal pain , vomiting and bloody diarrhoea for several days .
Decreased production of urine and a fall in blood pressure .
Note that people have survived eating more than 10 beans , * with treatment * .
Presumably the fatal dose without medical intervention is less .
Surviving more than 3 to 5 days usually means recovery .
Ricin is described as " .. one of the most potent toxins known " .
In 1978 a Bulgarian journalist ( Georgi Markov ) was assassinated in London by being prodded with an umbrella .
The umbrella had a tiny ball coated with ricin on its tip , which lodged into the dissident .
He died a few days later in hospital .
See " plants in general " .
* Colchicine ( Acetyltrimethylcolchicinic acid , Autumn Crocus , Royal Lily ) Dosage : 7 mg to 60 mg ( why so wide variation ? )
Time : symptoms in about 4 hours , death in about 4 days Available : Easily available ( from large garden centre ) Certainty : certain Notes : [ New Scientist article : ]
From the Autumn crocus ( Colchicum Autumnale ) / royal lily ( Gloriosa Superba ) .
One flower of CA is about 12 mg , so take at least five of them .
20g tuber of GS provides 60 mg , single seed of CA provides 3.5 mg ( so take 18 ) .
Damages blood vessels and nerves , and stops cell division .
Do n't know whether its painful or not , but that bit about damaging nerves is worrying .
I just _love_ the name of the acid !
See See the " plants in general " entry .
* Aconitine ( AKA Wolfsbane , Monkshood , aconitum napellus , a. anglicum ) Dosage : " a few grams " Time : 10 mins to few hours Available : Garden plant , so get from garden centre Certainty : unknown ( can be treated in hospital ) Notes : [ 2 ] and [ 4 ] :
The poison is concentrated in the unripe seed pods and roots .
During winter , the roots are particularly poisonous .
Symptoms develop in less than an hour .
Burning sensation , feelings of coldness , sweating .
Later , numbness , vomiting and diarrhoea with abdominal pain .
Finally , slow pulse , convulsions and coma .
Death may occur within 2 hours .
The poison kills by causing a cardiac failure , and it is painful .
See the " plants in general " comment .
* Cicutoxin ( Cowbane , Cicuta Virosa ) Dosage : " .. a few bites .. can cause serious poisoning or death " .
Time : a few hours or more .
Available : rare in most parts of UK , do n't know about elsewhere .
Certainty : good , but resembles wild carrot & wild parsnip .
Notes : [ 4 ] :
The poison is strongest in the yellow juice of the underground parts .
Symptoms after half an hour : burning of mouth , excessive saliva , flushing , nausea , vomiting , dizziness , dilation of pupils , and later a bluish tinge to the skin .
Muscular contractions and convulsions , with difficulties in breathing are followed by unconsciousness and death , often within a few hours of eating the plant .
See " plants in general " .
* Coniine , Gamma - Coniceine , others ( Hemlock , Conium Maculatum ) Dosage : unknown Time : unknown Available : Grows throughout UK , except north .
Do n't know about elsewhere .
Certainty : unknown Notes : [ 4 ] : NOTE :
There are many plants called " hemlock " , some of which are n't poisonous at all .
It can also be mistaken for wild parsley and carrot , and is in the same family as Cowbane .
Symptoms appear in 15 mins to 2 hours .
Initially burning and dryness of the mouth , muscular weakness leading to paralysis that affects the breathing .
Sometimes also dilation of pupils , vomiting , diarrhoea , convulsions , and loss of consciousness .
If this is survived , birth defects may be caused in pregnant women .
This is said to be the plant that Socrates took in 399 BC .
* Oenanthetoxin ( Hemlock Water Dropwort , Oenanthe Eroeata ) Dosage : " .. dangerously poisonous , even in small quantities " .
Time :
Two to twelve hours .
Available : Grows in chalky wet areas , particularly S and W Britain .
Certainty : Fairly good , if you get the right species .
Notes : [ 4 ] :
The tubers contain more poison than the rest of the plant , particularly in winter and early spring , and may be cooked or dried .
Symptoms within an hour or two , nausea , salivation , vomiting , diarrhoea , sweating , weakness of legs , dilation of pupils .
Later loss of consciousness with convulsions before death .
See " plants in general " entry .
Same family as Hemlock .
* plants in general ( hemlock , foxglove , oleander ) Dosage : N/ A Time : N/ A Available : garden centre Certainty : questionable Notes : [ 1 ] says : " Everything I have ever read about death from plant poisoning indicates that it is risky and painful .
Symptoms range from nausea and vomiting to cramping and bloody diarrhea .
.... ..
Altogether , I consider poisonous plants as a means of exit far too unreliable and painful .
No matter how desperate you are , do n't even think about it ! " * Nicotine ( Rewritten by Calle ) Dosage : extract from 100g tabacco ? 40 - 60 mg pure .
Time : Several hours , coma may set in much earlier .
Much quicker if taken in large doses .
Available : Easily available Certainty : Fairly certain , given a large enough dose .
Notes
This is what Mike wrote : " Soak 100 grammes of tabacco for a few days .
You get a brown mess .
Strain off the tabacco , then simmer slowly until most of the liquid has gone , leaving about 2 teaspoons of brown treacle - like stuff .
Add it to your night - time drink , and never wake up .
Someone said the other day that 150 mg of pure nicotine would be fatal in seconds .
See the " plants in general " entry . "
It is correct , as far as I have found out .
It can be added that the effects include violent convulsions and that the direct cause of death is respiratory failure .
Smokers should use larger doses than non-smokers .
* Iron ( diet suppliments )
Dosage : unknown Time : unknown Available : diet , health food shops Certainty : good Notes : [ 2 ] :
" Well it seems that iron pills achieve death .
They oxydize in the stomach and eat a hole in it .
The only reason I know this is that someone at my school just recently OD'd and died from this .
It was ruled suicide since no person could accidently take that many iron pills .
They did n't say how many she took or how many it takes to kill yourself though . " [ sounds unpleasant ] * Cocaine Dosage : 1 ounce ( do n't know what that is in real weights .. )
Time : 2 to 3 hours ?
Available : Difficult Certainty : not known Notes : Read something in a newspaper ... a coke dealer died after eating an ounce of it , when the police raided his house .
Cause of death was a cardiac arrest 2 1/2 hours after the overdose .
However , a cocaine OD is painful , and causes paranoia / breathing problems .
One form of cocaine smuggling is to swallow condoms filled with the stuff .
From time to time , a " mule " has a condom burst inside him , and dies in pain reasonably quickly .
* LSD ( Lysergic acid diethylamide ) nonfatal Dosage : infinite !
Time : never Available : who cares ?
Certainty : will not kill you Notes : LSD can't kill you by overdose .. you might go psychotic if you take tens / hundreds of thousands of times the normal dose , but thats hardly surprising , since you 'd have to be insane to take that much in the first place .
General warning - even for normal use , if you are depressed , it 'll just amplify the depression , not lift it , and the chances of a bad trip are probably higher .
Probably , the only way to kill yourself with this stuff is to drop two tonnes of it on yourself .
Calle : I do n't quite believe in what Mike is saying about psychosis here .
As far as I have been able to find out , LSD works by catalyzing certain substances in the brain , and thus vast overdoses have no more effect than merely large ones .
Once all the stuff in your brain is used up , there will be no more effect .
A correspondent points out a case reported by The Journal of Clinical Toxicology where eight people snorted pure LSD Tartrate , beliving that it was cocaine .
The amounts ingested was estimated to be from 1000 to 10000 times an ordinary dose .
Half of them lapsed into comas , but all of them came out of it without any treatment .
Some were given Valium for anxiety efterwards .
On the whole , it seems that LSD is about as safe as a drug can be , despite much propaganda saying otherwise .
* Heroin ( morphine ) Dosage : 120 to 500 mg in non-users .
Time : unknown Available : From your friendly neighbourhood drug dealer .
Certainty : unknown Notes : Combine it with alcohol , since a combination of alc & H is much more dangerous than alc or H alone .
* Rotenone Dosage : very low , similar to cyanide Time : depends on dosage Available : extremely difficult Certainty : probable Notes : Rotenone is used by microbiologists to kill potentially dangerous bacteria cultures .
It is extremely poisonous .
Calle :
A correspondent believes this entry to be erroneous , since in the litterature he consulted rotenone was mentioned as being used as an insecticide and not being all that toxic .
* Mercury ( salts , soluble ) Dosage : 1 gramme of salts Time : unknown Available : unknown ( what are the _soluble_ salts ?
how to make ? )
Certainty : good Notes :
Note that contrary to popular opinion , pure mercury metal is n't all that poisonous .
The soluble salts are , however .
The " mad hatter " story refers to brain damage that hat makers used to get from using mercury salts .
* Amobarbital ( amytal , amal , eunoctal , etamyl , stadadorm ) [ this entry from [ 1 ] ]
Dosage : 4.5 grammes , typically 90 50mg tablets Time : unconscious in 5 -> 15 minutes , death in 20 -> 50 minutes Available : needs to be prescribed Certainty : very reliable Notes : use an airtight plastic bag , and a rubber band to get a very effective method .

Methods : other than poisoning 1 . asphyxiation ( dangle on end of rope for 10 minutes )
Time : 5 to 10 minutes Available : Rope , solid support 10 foot above ground Certainty : Fairly certain ( discovery , rope / support snapping ) Notes : Brain damage likely if rescued .
Very painful depending on rope .
Most common effective form of suicide in UK .
See " Asphyxiation " .
2 . breaking neck Time : Should be instant if it does break .
See previous if not Available : Rope , solid support , 10 foot space below , several above Certainty : Very certain if the rope / support does n't break Notes : Minimal danger of discovery ( depends on location ) .
Painless if you drop far enough ( 8 foot is optimum ) .
Make sure that the rope is tied securely to something STRONG !!
It has to support your weight MULTIPLIED by the deccelleration .
Use a hangman 's knot ( with the knot at the back of your neck ) .
It does n't always work this well though , you might get a bust jaw / lacerations etc and then asphyxiate .

The Author ( James " Hangman " Barry ) noted that when executing " persons who had attempted suicide by cutting their throats ... to prevent reoping the wounds I have reduced the drop by nearly half . "
3 . JUMPING OFF BUILDINGS
Time : Instantanious if you are lucky , minutes / hours otherwise Available :
You need ten stories or higher , and access to the top floor windows / roof .
Bring a bolt cutter to get onto the roof Certainty : 90 % for 6 stories , increasing after that Notes : Difficult to overcome fear of heights , many people can't do it .
Totally painless if high enough , but very frightening .
Easily discovered if seen on / near roof / windows .
Access fairly easy in a city , otherwise difficult .
Risk of spending the rest of your life in a wheelchair .
Ever tried killing yourself if you are paralysed from the neck down ?
Email conversations suggest 10 + stories works ALMOST all of the time .
Try to land on concrete .
Quote - " 9 out of 10 people who fall 6 stories will die " .
Note that it may take a while for many of those 90 % to die .
4 . SLITTING WRISTS OR OTHER ( often not effective ) Time : Minutes if major artery cut , eternity otherwise .
Available :
You really need a razor sharp knife .
Razors are pretty tricky to hold when they are covered with blood .
Certainty : possible if you cut an artery , improbable otherwise Notes : Painful at first .
Danger of discovery .
This is a very common suicide ' gesture ' and hardly ever results in anything other than a scar .
A lot of will power required to cut deeply into groin or carotid arteries , which are the only ones likely to kill you .
Do n't bother with this method .
Cutting your throat is difficult due to the fact that the carotid arteries are protected by your windpipe ( feel where your arteries are with your fingertips , & slice from the side ) .
I 've seen photos of people who have used this method - the depth of the cut required is amazing .
If you want to cut your wrists , cut along the blue line ( vein ) on the underside of your wrist , but cut deeply so that the artery underneath is exposed .
Cut this lengthways with a razor or similar .
The traditional hot bath does help , since it keeps the blood flowing quickly , slows down clotting , and is nice to lie back and relax in .
Position yourself so that your wrists do n't fall inwards against your body , blocking off blood flow .
Calle : A posting to A.S.H. suggests using the kind of equipment they use when you give blood to a blood bank , i.e. , a needle in a blood vessel and a piece of tubing .
It sounds like it would remove several of the disadvantages of the ordinary slitting - wrists method .
5 . BULLET Time : Microseconds unless you are unlucky ( mins / hours ) Available : Difficult in UK , easier in USA ( get a shotgun ) Certainty : Certain Notes : Painless if worked , otherwise painful & brain damage .
Danger of discovery of weapon or ammunition .
Not at all common in UK , more common in USA where guns available .
Brain damage & other effects if you survive .
Death either instantaneous , or prolonged .
Lots of will power needed to fire gun ( ' hesitation marks ' are bullets / pellets embedded in the wall , when you jerk the gun as you fire ) .
Bullet can miss vital parts in skull , deflect off skull .
If you have a choice , use a shotgun rather than a rifle of a pistol , since it is so much more effective .
( " shotgun " entry later ) .
Ammunition to use is : .458 Winchester Magnum , or soft - point slugs with .44 Magnum .
Also you could use a sabot round , which is a plastic wedge with a smaller thing in it .
These rounds are rather overkill , the phrase " elephant gun " has been used about the .458 Winchester , but if you 're going to go , do it with a bang .
Note , people usually survive single .22 shots to the temples .
The other problem with guns is that is is bloody messy .
Your next of kin will really _enjoy_ cleaning up after you , washing the coagulated blood & brains out of corners etc ...
6 . ASPHYXIATION Time : 5 mins to unconciousness , 10 + mins to brain death Available :
Anywhere there 's a rope and something solid to tie it to Certainty : Certain , if you do n't get " rescued " Notes : Panic reaction is very likely ( unless inert gasses used ) .
One of the most effective and most used methods of suicide .
Probable brain damage if you are " rescued " .
NOTE , this can only really be done in two ways : firstly , when you are unconsious ( eg , sleeping pills ) , or secondly , by hanging .
Combining with pure inert gasses is a very good suggestion .
See " Nitrogen " in the poisons section 7 .
AIR IN VEINS ( basically just a myth ) Time : Couple of minutes claimed Available : Plenty of air about ...
Need a hypodermic & syringe Certainty : only 1 known case .. patient may already have been dead Notes :
The only case I know about , it killed with 40 cc of air .
Smaller amounts are harmless .
The case was the death of Abbie Borroto , who died in 1950 from a 40 cc injection in New Hampshire .
She died in minutes .
This was the 1949 Dr H Sander case .
He was found not guilty to murder on the grounds that the patient may already have been dead when he gave the injection .
( A doctor and a nurse could find no pulse earlier the same day ) .
The following 2 quotes are from [ 1 ] : Prof. Y Kenis says : " ... not a suitable method , nor a gentle death ... extremely difficult to utilize as a method of suicide .
.. possibly with very serious consequences , such as paralysis or permanent brain damage .
.. this is only an impression , and I have no real scientific information on the subject . "
Dr Pieter V Admiraal .. describes the theoretical air bubble method of suicide as impossible , disagreeable and cruel .
" To kill somebody with air you would have to inject at least 100 -> 200 millilitres as quickly as possible in a vein as big as possible close to the heart .
You would have to fill the whole heart with air at once .
The heart would probably beat on for several minutes , perhaps 5 -> 15 minutes , and during the first minutes the person may be conscious . "
8 . DECAPITATION
Time : Couple of seconds before conciousness fades Available : Happen to have a train line nearby ?
Or a guillotine perhaps ?
Certainty : Very certain , unless you pull away just before Notes : See " jumping in front of trains " .
May be difficult to stop pulling your head out of the way - OD on sleeping tablets first Calle : A news notice from California posted to alt.suicide.holiday tells the story of a man who comitted suicide nearly cut his own head off with a chainsaw .
Sounds like a grisly way to do it .
9 . DISEMBOWELMENT ( aka seppuku / hara kiri ) Time : Minutes Available :
Got a nice razor - sharp sword ?
Certainty : Fairly certain , assuming that you managed to gut yourself properly before passing out with the agony Notes : Painful , even the macho Samurai used a ' second ' to decapitate them at the appropriate point , so do n't expect to do much more than give yourself peritonitis .
Trendy for insane martial arts fanatics and gay Japanese poets called Mishima .
10 . DROWNING
Time : Minutes ( 5 mins to die of drowning , 20 to die of hypothermia )
Available :
Anywhere there 's deep , ( cold ) water in a remote spot Certainty : Good , just make sure you sink & can't swim Notes :
Put stones in your pockets , tie your legs & hands together , and hop into the lake .. bit of a shock to the fisherman who finds your rotting corpse stuck in his brand new net .
Also see entry for " hypothermia / freezing " .
However , remember that you can be revived from cold water drowning after several hours , because the cold slows down terminal brain damage .
Warmer water does n't have the advantage of hypothermia , but is more effective in making sure you * stay * dead .
11 . ELECTROCUTION
Time : Seconds / minutes Available :
Anywhere with high - tension , high - current lines & a good earth Certainty : Somewhat dependant on luck & how much power goes through you Notes :
Do n't bother with 110 or 240 volt mains , its just not enough .
Some people do get killed with household electricity , but only after several minutes .
Use high tension lines , stand in bare feet on waterlogged ground ( better still , put a piece of THICK copper cable into the nearest river ) .
Works best if current path travels through your head , or through the heart .
Just burns you badly otherwise .
NOTE : people have survived massive high - voltage , high - current shocks with nothing but 3rd degree burns to show for it .
Sometimes paralysis , limbs amputated etc. 12 . EXPLOSIVES
Time : 10 milliseconds , or similar (!)
Available : Difficult to get hold of detonator & good explosives Certainty : Certain if detonator works properly Notes : DON'T USE GUNPOWDER or other ' slow ' explosives ( eg , homemade explosives ) .
Use dynamite or ' Plastique ' , strap it to your forehead with the detonator , and BOOM !
The main problem is with getting hold of high explosives ( I know the recipe for Nitro - Glycerine , but home manufacture is extremely risky , and the product is unstable ) .
If you can get a grenade , use it , it 's probably the best way of doing this one .
Calle : Recipies for creating explosives can be found , together with the appropriate warnings , in the rec. pyrotechnics FAQ .
13 . FREEZING TO DEATH ( hypothermia ) Time : several hours ( 15 minutes in very cold water )
Available :
Got a large chest freezer ?
Is the outside temp <- 10 degrees ?
Certainty : good if you do n't get found Notes : Soak your cloths in water , get into freezer / outside somewhere where you wo n't be found .
Helps to get pissed first drink yourself silly .
If you are near a very cold supply of water ( eg , the North Sea , or similar ) which is close to zero degrees , this is particularly good , since the average lifespan of someone in the water is 15 minutes . [ 1 ] says : " .. have quietly ascended their favorite mountain late in the day .. above the freezing line .. wearing light clothing , they sat down in a secluded spot to await the end .
Some have said that they intended to take a tranquilizer to hasten the sleep of death .
From what we know of hypothermia , they would pass out as the cold reached a certain level and they would die within a few hours .
Of course in a very cold climate there is no need to climb a mountain . " [ eg , UK in midwinter :-) .
There was a death in the middle of the city park here just this last winter ( ' 90 ) where a lady stripped after the park closed for the night . ]
A problem with this method is that because it slows the metabolism , and prevents damage to the brain , people can be revived several hours after ' death ' occasionally .
14 . JUMPING IN FRONT OF TRAINS Time : Seconds ( or hours if unlucky ) Available :
Anywhere near a HIGH - SPEED railway line Certainty : Depends on your timing & speed of train .
Go for decapitation Notes : Probably better to put your neck on the line , since a glancing blow would probably break your spine ( & cripple you ) .
High speed trains need a kilometer to stop , so find a blind corner .
15 . SELF -IMMOLATION
Time : Seconds to days Available :
Anywhere you can get petrol & a match Certainty : good as long as you are far away from medical help Notes : bloody painful one of the most agonising ways to die .
If you do survive , you will be disfigured for the rest of your life .
Try mixing the petrol with an explosive like TNT or NG , this will make it burn MUCH quicker , even if the explosive is very dilute .
16 . STARVING TO DEATH
Time : 40 days give or take .
Depends on health .
Available :
Anywhere where you can't be force - fed Certainty : Good as long as no medical help & will power holds up Notes : Supposed to be easier after the first couple of days , since your appetite goes .
In a UK prison , you can't be force - fed unless you give permission first , or are diagnosed insane , but I do n't know whether this is the same in other countries .
Beware relatives might give permission on your behalf if you are unconsious .
( living will / durable power of attorney helps ) .
It may help if you use an appetite suppressant .
Amphetamines , and some drugs ( MDMA , AKA XTC , AKA ecstasy , AKA metheylenedimethoxymethamphetamine is one such ) .
The problem with these is that they are frequently illegal .
I 've also heard of something called Aminorex ( 4 - methylaminorex ) which was briefly prescribed as an appetite suppressant , but taken off the market since it had fatal side effects ... which is hardly a problem !! [ 1 ] says : " .. after approximately 20 % of body weight loss , illness will begin to set in , notably severe indigestion , muscle weakness , and _worst of all_ mental incapacity .
... about 40 days before life is seriously theatened .
.... "
" In some cases self - starvation can be very painful .
... morphene had to be administered to kill the pain of fatal dehydration . .. "
17 . DRIVING INTO BRIDGE SUPPORT AT 100 MPH Time : Hopefully instantanious Available : Fast car , motorway , unprotected bridge ....
Certainty : So - so , put a couple of cans of petrol on the passenger seat to make it certain , & USE YOUR SEATBELT Notes : Bridges are usually protected in the UK , do n't know about USA .
Avoid being thrown out of the car by using the seatbelt , and put petrol ( in cans or just splashed about ) near to the driver 's seat just to make certain .
Can be made to look accidental .
18 . SHOTGUN
Time : Instantanious if you are lucky Available : Difficult in UK , easier in USA ( due to gun laws ) Certainty : Fairly certain Notes : 12 - gauge shotgun with 3 inch Magnum shells with # 2 to #000 buckshot .
See " Bullet " for other points .
This is the recommended way to die by firearm .
Apparently the shells suggested here are " extreme overkill " , but thats the point really ... problem here is that its amazingly messy who is going to pick the festering lumps of gore out of the carpet ?
Another problem is that it is possible to miss your brain entirely , and just blow off your face instead .
19 . ENLIST ( silly ) Time : Jan 15 ' 91 or other conflict Available : Just pop down to the local army office & sign on as a squaddie Certainty :
Be a " hero " .
Life expectancy in a battle is 20 minutes Notes : I do n't think this is an entirely serious suggestion , particularly since only 10 % ever see the front line , and only a few of those ever see combat .
Calle :
You could always get employed as a mercenary .
That way you 'll at least see combat , improving your chances to die vastly .
Still , a silly method .
20 . PENCILS UP YOUR NOSE , BANG DOWN ONTO TABLE ( urban legend ? )
Time : Seconds or never Available :
All you need is a couple of sharp pencils and a table Certainty : Very uncertain Notes :
This is a myth , I think , since the pencils would go into your frontal lobes , which are basically optional .
This is the legendary " exam suicide " .
Fine if you want a DIY frontal - lobotomy rather than death !
Calle :
This is an urban legend , see the alt.folklore.urban FAQ for more details .
21 . GETTING SOMEONE TO MURDER YOU Time : Depends on method used Available : Know any murderous psychopaths ?
No , not the tax people ...
Certainty : Depends on method used , & dedication of murderer Notes : Forget it .
Unless you contract someone to do it , the chances are that you are going to wake up in hospital without your wallet .
If you do contract someone , how are you going to pay them ?
Ca n't take them to court for running off with your money and not doing the job .
22 . MAKE YOURSELF INTO AN H - BOMB ( another silly one ) Time : Speed of light over 1/2 metre ( couple of nanoseconds )
Available : Nuke ( fission OR fusion ) , 10 litres of heavy water Certainty : 100 % Notes : Drink the heavy water for several days , strap yourself to the nuke , and press the button .
If you retained a couple of litres of the heavy water , the additional yield should be 6 megajoules ( give or take a few orders of magnitude ) .
Note that heavy water is a poison , so you might not survive that long anyway .
Calle :
If I remember my physics correctly , there will be no reaction in your body no matter how much heavy water you have ingested .
Not that it matters if you 're sitting on an exploding hydrogen bomb !
23 . MICROMACHINES / NANOCOMPUTERS
( science fiction )
Time : years or a fraction of a second depends how you look at it Available : in 50 > 1000 years time ?
Certainty : Good assuming that the technology is developed Notes : Basically , this involves a ' replicator ' panel .
You program it to replicate yourself , simplifying very slightly , with the exception of the urge to use this technique .
After a while , you turn into a mindless zombie , trudging around from the exit of the machine to the entrance , for eternity .
Strange philosophical implications .
Calle :
If you postulate nanomachines , why not use the deconstructor kind ?
Take your body apart into its component molecules in less than a minute ...
A silly method , if you had n't guessed .
24 . SCUBA - DIVING ( various fatal ' accidents ' )
Time : see notes - most are minutes / hours Available : scuba diving gear , nobody around Certainty : see notes Notes :
The first method is to rise 30 metres or so without releasing your breath .
Assuming that you can do it , it should cause your lungs to burst .
The second is the bends - stay under long enough for the nitrogen to dissolve ( 30 metres for 30 minutes ) .
go up rapidly without decompression time .
This is unreliable , and may cause brain / joint damage .
The third way is Carbon Monoxide poisoning - fill your tank with it , and stay away from other divers .
You will fall asleep fairly quickly .
See CO in poisons section .
The final way is oxygen poisoning - however , this means that you have to go very deep with an oxygen - rich mix , and there are problems associated with that .
The advantage of these methods is that insurance companies / relatives will assume that it was an accident ( ' misadventure ' ) , with the possible exception of the CO poisoning .
The source of this follows : ( from the net ) " Rising 30 m without exhaling will usually result in an over pressured lung , possible subcuteaneous emphazema , collapsed lung , death usually from drowning in your own blood .
Rather painful and usually curable if you are rescued , but fair chance of dying if you are n't .
Building up a high residual nitrogen time ( say 30 m for 30 min ) then coming up without decompressing will get you bent fairly nicely .
You do n't feel much , but your joints tend to start stiffening up after half an hour .
Death is very uncertain , coming from a stroke .
Brain damage , joint damage etc are most likely .
Pobably can be recued but some damage certain .
Oxygen poisoning , going down 50 +m until the partial pressure of the oxygen reaches a toxic level .
Difficult to accomplish , very painful to get down that deep , cold pressure etc , possibility of nitrogen narcosis and forgetting what you are doing .
Probably get bent , good chance of rescue .
CO poisoning , mix a healthy batch of carbon monoxide in your tank as you dive , you tend to go to sleep under water , when combined with the above methods you have a pretty good winner , do n't forget to forget your BCD . "
25 . SUCKING YOUR BRAINS OUT ( silly ) Time : Minutes Available : You 'd need a Puma ( TM ) robot , & some other bits Certainty : certain , given proper programming Notes :
You would need an industrial robot to do this properly .
Give it a saw attachment , a sucking tube attachment , and program it .
Make a head restraint .
When you are fixed securely into the restraint , start the robot 's program .
It will drill a hole in your head , and stick the tube into the hole .
Program it to wiggle the tube back and forth so that it does n't miss anything .
This might work better if you put a stream of water into the hole as well , so that the sucking attachment does n't just suck air all the time .
Debugging the program could be amusing .
26 . MICROWAVES Time : ?
Available : Source of strong microwave emissions Notes : Cooking yourself .
Point is to raise your core body temperature to fatal levels .
Calle : Does anyone have any information on this ?
All that I know is that standing in front of a Swedish coast surveillance radar ( which happens to use exactly the same wavelength as your average microwave oven ) is a Bad Thing .
27 . DEHYDRATION
Time : a week or so ?
Available : you need to be able to stop medical help .
Certainty : certain if your will - power stands up to it .
Notes :
Do n't eat or drink .
Remember that food contains a high proportion of water .
Avoiding medical help can be difficult .
See ' starving to death ' .
28 . SKYDIVING ' ACCIDENT '
Time : pretty damn quick .
Available : need to join a skydiving club .
Takes much time and money .
Certainty : Fairly certain .
People have fallen from extreme heights and survived .
The resulting injuries are not fun .
Notes : Join a skydiving club , continue to practise it for a while to clear off all suspicions and then once pack your parachute in a real mess ( preferably knotted up , but not too clearly ) and then jump .
The para will not open and you will reach a terminal velocity of 220 km/h ( 160 mph/120 kn ) .
Death is instant in the impact with the Planet Earth .
This has the advantages of being ' accidental ' , and your family / friends do not have the additional pain and guilt associated with suicides .
Calle :
In addition to the above , you need to remove or disable your reserve parachute ( which is not easy , I 'm told ) .
There are better " accidental " methods than this .
A correspondent who is a skydiver dislikes this entry , since if people use it it will give skydiving an undeservedly bad reputation .
29 .
DEATH BY A THOUSAND CUTS ; MODERN VERSION ( silly ) Time : variable Available : a heck of a lot of razor - wire .. maybe a high - voltage supply Certainty : not very good Notes :
This is a modern variant of the Arabic ' Death of a thousand cuts ' .
Basically , jump onto a stack of unravelled razor wire , and roll around till you die .. it may help to connect a high - voltage , low current power supply to the wire , so that you have spasms , which should keep you getting cut even when you are unconscious .
Also , you should make sure that you can't roll off the wire .
30 . CRUSHING
Time : seconds to minutes , depends on car press Available : a car press .. any good junkyard Certainty : certain as long as you can't escape Notes :
This is an elegantly simple one .. get into a car , in a car press , and shortly afterwards be squashed to death as your body is converted into a red pulp .
It may be tricky getting the press to trigger , but if you hide in the car someone may come along and activate it .
There are other ways of getting crushed , this just happens to be the most effective I can think up on the spur of the moment .
Getting yourself run over by a fully loaded articulated lorry is quite good .
You should remember that people quite often survive the actual crushing ; they die when the weight is taken OFF them .
31 . WORLD WAR THREE
Time : moments if you are near a militarilly significant site Available : happen to be one of the ' key - holders ' ?
president maybe ?
Certainty : pretty certain Notes :
All you have to do is trigger world war three .
Fire an ICBM or three at the Chinese and the Russians ...
This method has the advantage that you take everyone else with you !
Trouble is , the number of people with the requisite access is minimal , and I sort of doubt that any readers of ASH can do this .
Calle : Lots harder since the collapse of the Soviet Union ... Silly .
32 . HEATSTROKE
Time : 4 hours or more Available : Very hot day ; no disturbance from neighbours etc Certainty : depends on the weather Notes : Basically , the point is to give yourself extreme heatstroke .
You should pass out after a few hours .
Use some aluminium foil to direct the sun 's heat onto you , to speed up the process a bit .
Try to reduce the chance of being interuppted , take off the phone etc .
Obviously , start in the morning !
Helps if the outside temperature is > 100 F .
33 . ACID BATH
Time : depends on acid Available : a lot of a very strong acid Certainty : fairly good Notes : [ from alt.suicide.holiday ] " summer heat got you down ?
Try the new and improved neighbourhood acid bath .
Most metal working plants and some auto - repair shops will have a nice soothing acid bath .
This , of course , is for those of you who enjoy extreme pain and do n't want to make a mess for others to clean up .
If you do n't leave a note chances are they will never know what happened , aside from the shop / plant being broken into . "
34 . FAKE CAR BOMB
Time : milliseconds
Available : explosive Certainty : fairly good if enough explosive Notes :
This is a modification of the basic use - explosives method .
What you do , is make a homemade car bomb , and drive off happily after chatting with your neighbour about how well your life is going , apart from a few minor death - threats from an Iraqi death - squad ..
To confuse the authorities even more , have a note in your pocket listing the telephone numbers of all the eastern foreign embassies in your pocket , together with a little line of random " code numbers " next to each .. , and a random but large amount of cash listed against each code number . :-)
Oh yes , and a heavily annotated copy of Jane 's Defence Weekly - Xhosa edition .
35 . JUMPING OFF BRIDGES ( slice and dice with piano wire ) Time : 9.87 ms - 2 ; 4 to 10 meters ; calculate it yourself !
Available : Rope , pianowire and a high bridge .
Certainty : Fairly certain Notes : Never been tried .
Can also be used with a fairly high building , but then the art - motive will disappear .
Cut the rope and wire in various lengths .
Each length must not be longer than the height of the bridge .
Tie one end of the ropes and wires to the bridge
Tie the other part of the ropes to different bodyparts like thigh , calves , torso etc .
Then tie the pianowires around your joints .
( Do n't forget your genitals .. )
When you jump various parts of you body are whipped away by the pianowire nooses , and your bits are held up by the ropes swaying in the breeze .
If you to this right you should end up with just your torso hanging by it's neck above the sea , highway , ground .
Do it with friends , and call it art .
36 . BEING EATEN ALIVE
Time : depends , but probably a couple of minutes Available : zoo , or live in Africa / wherever Certainty : not brilliant .. what if they 're not hungry and do n't finish ?
Notes : basically , find one or more hungry carnivores ... tigers are nice .
Also , sharks , lions , any of the big cats ..
37 . BEING BURNED UP IN UNPROTECTED RE-ENTRY ( silly )
Time : probably a few minutes Available : if you happen to be able to get into orbit Certainty : about as certain as you can get !
Notes : Just go for a spacewalk in a low earth orbit , and decelerate enough to enter the atmosphere .
You 'll get a great view ... 38 . ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME ( AIDS ) Time : Incubation period 1 to 10 years , death within 2 years of diagnosis of AIDS , Can have HIV for years / decades Dosage : Just one intimate contact with an Infected person of any gender Available : Available to all for free Certainty : 99.9 % certainty AFTER infected Notes : [ 2 ] :
This is not painfree .
This method may cost you alot of money if you allow others to get you medical attention .
It may a little difficult to get infected as people who know they have it may not comply with your request .
Could be great fun attempting to get infected depending upon your attitude ( remember - any gender - you do n't have to limit yourself - you 're going to die , you might as well try it ; ) .
Should be quite devasting to your family & close friends .
You also get the satisfaction of leaving behind a virtual unrecognizable - as - you body !
This also gives you the prime opportunity to point your finger at your dentist and say he did it for all the times you have suffered in their chair .
Happy dying !
Calle : May not be so certain any more .
Ten years may well be long enough for someone to develop a cure .
Silly , IMHO .
39 .
AUTO - DECAPITATION BY CAR ( added by Calle ) Time : Real quick Available :
You need access to a car and a rope Certainty : I would n't trust it Notes : Comes from alt.suicide.holiday .
Basic idea is to tie one end of the rope around your neck , tie the other end to a real solid object , get into the car and accelerate away as fast as the car can manage .
When you reach the end of the rope , your head gets torn off .
Be sure to use enough rope and fasten your seat belt .
A posting to a.s.h. in July 1993 says that someone in Washinton State , USA actually used this method to commit suicide , so it can't be that bad .
The posting said that 25 feet of rope were used ( about 7.5 meters ) , which does sound a bit short .
Perhaps he had a real awesome car .
40 . DEATH BY PAINTING YOUR BODY ( very silly , and wrong ) Dosage :
Less than 1 can of paint depending on your body type Time : ?
Probably less than 8 hours Availability :
Very available !
You have a choice of greasepaint or House paint .
You need a type of paint that will not allow your pores to breath in order to be successful at this .
You also have a smashing selection of colors you can choose to die in !
Nile Green ?
Blood Red ?
Basic Black ?
Or any combo you desire ..
If you could n't decide before what to wear to die in , this method will cause you considerable angst .
Certainty :
This is a sure method , provided you have a paint that will block your pores from breathing .
Do n't forget the bottom of your feet .
You must paint every last bit of available skin .
If your pores can breathe , you wo n't die .
Notes :
I read this in some theater journal 5 or so years ago , saying when you you do full body makeup , you must insure that parts of the body are left naked to breathe or the actor will die .
Usually for full body makeup , they leave the bottoms of feet , and some patterns on the body , like lines so the actor does n't suffocate .
Calle :
This is an * extremely * silly one .
It was in the " not yet edited " portion of Mike 's file , and I think it is quite straight from an a .s.h. posting .
This method does not work .
As you can check in most any book on human anatomy , the skin does not breathe .
The only places in your body which absorbs oxygen are the lungs and the corneas , and the corneas only feed themselves .
You might get ill or even die if you use poisonous paint , though .
41 . NITROUS OXIDE ( N20 , Laughing Gas ) Dosage : Several Liters uncompressed Time : unconscious in about 5 min , death 10 -> 15 min Availability : Dentists supply would be good , any other technical - gases supplier , cream charges ( drugstore or something like that )
Certainty : reasonable Notes : combination with marijuana recommended absolutely painless method !
N2O is normally used as an analgesic , but may also be " mis " used as a drug ( to get " high " ) or to " off " yourself .
It may be purchased at a technical - gases supplier ( if they ask for the purpose : tell them you need it for car - tuning ( laughing - gas injection ( no joke ! ) ) ) .
I asked for it at a German gas - supplier ( Messer - Griesheim ) and they told me that the smallest gas - bottle is about 8 kg N2O ( which is equal to 4m ^ 3 ) .
It would cost about 156 , - DM per 8 kg ( about 15 $ per 1 kg , prices may differ ) .
Recommended for more comfort : ask them about a pressure reducer ( better control of gas - flow ) .
For best results , take someting like a breathing - mask ( anything similar will do ) to make sure to still inhale the gas after becoming unconscious .
You may start with a small N2O concentration ( simply lift the mask a little so you get fresh air with the N2O ) and increase it until you breathe pure N2O .
By the way : N2O tastes sweet ( but no calories I suppose :)
When 20mg N2O are solved in your blood ( after about 10 breaths ) , the effect sets in .
If you inhale the gas long enough , so that about 60mg N2O are solved in the blood , you will fade without the slightest pain from life to death .
60 eam charges every time ....!
You may achieve this by filling the contents of the cream charges into a balloon ( a big one ! ) and inhale and exhale into the balloon .
The only problem is , that you get difficulties holding the balloon properly to your mouth after you inhaled some times !

The only thing I can remember that has been asked for multiple times , besides the File itself , are the lyrics for " Suicide Is Painless " ( the theme from M * A * S*H ) .
Here it is : " Suicide is Painless " Words by Mike Altman Music by Johnny Mandel Through early morning fog I see Visions of the things to be The pains that are withheld for me I realize and I can see that Chorus : Suicide is painless
It brings on many changes
And I can take or leave it if I please .
I try to find a way to make
All our little joys relate Without that ever - present hate
But now I know that it 's too late , and ( chorus )
The game of life is hard to play I 'm going to lose it anyway
The losing card I 'll someday lay
And this is all I have to say , that ( chorus )
The only way to win is cheat
And lay it down before I 'm beat
And to another give a seat
For that 's the only painless feat , cause ( chorus )
The sword of time will pierce our skins
It does n't hurt when it begins
But as it works its way on in The pain grows stronger - watch it grin ( chorus ) A brave man once requested me To answer questions that are key Is it to be or not to be ?

Notes by Calle
At the end of Mike 's file there were an entry for Nitrous Oxide .
I have removed it , as there already is one .
There were also a mail were someone recommended military nerve toxins .
They might not be as certain as the originator thought , as current military thinking is that one griveously wounded man is worth many dead ones in decreasing the enemy 's fighting capacity .
That means that modern nerve gasses well might leave you paralyzed for life , but still living .
Anyway , if you can get military stuff , why not use a rifle or a few kilos of explosive ?
Note by the a.s.h webspinner Mike 's sig were also at the bottom of the File .
At his request , it has been deleted .
It is further requested that sites mirroring this file , which have a version of the file with the name and address , delete that information .
Most of it is wrong anyway now .

Federal judge Nancy Gertner today officially brought down the tent on the Joel Tenenbaum P2P Big Top World 'O Fun , all but admitting that she would have given Tenenbaum 's arguments about " fair use " a truly sympathetic hearing were it not for the shoddy behavior of his legal team .
What could have turned into a watershed case instead became another statutory crucifixion , with Gertner finally entering the jury 's $ 675,000 verdict against the young file - swapper whose defense crashed down with an in - court admission that he had been lying all along .
Gertner signed off the jury 's damage amounts , which means that Sony BMG is entitled to $ 112,500 , Warner Bros. gets $ 225,000 , Arista Records gets $ 45,000 , and Universal picks up $ 292,500 .
The record labels wanted more , though ; specifically , they asked for an injunction against Tenenbaum that would stop him from " promot[ing ] using the Internet or any online media distribution system to infringe copyrights . "
According to Gertner , " the word ' promote ' is far too vague to withstand scrutiny under the First Amendment .
Although plaintiffs are entitled to statutory damages , they have no right to silence defendant 's criticism of the statutory regime under which he is obligated to pay those damages .
This Court has neither the desire nor the authority to serve as the censor of defendant 's public remarks regarding online file - sharing . "
So it ends — but it did n't have to be this way .
What might have been
In a separate 35 - page memo , Gertner lays out a lengthy analysis of Tenenbaum 's claim that all noncommercial P2P file - sharing was simply fair use under US copyright law .
In it , her displeasure with the defense becomes clear .
Led by Harvard Law professor Charles Nesson , Team Tenenbaum told the court in late 2008 that it wanted trial as soon as possible and would file no amendments to its defense .
A few weeks before trial , it dropped a bombshell ; Nesson now wanted to claim that all file - sharing was legal .
Talk about overreach — there was no way such a defense would fly with even a sympathetic federal judge , as it would utterly eviscerate copyright .
Or , as Gertner put it today , it would " swallow the copyright protections that Congress created , defying both statute and precedent . "
But what 's striking about the judge 's memo is her frank admission that she might have gone along with a more limited form of this defense .
Charles Nesson
" As it made clear previously , the Court was prepared to consider a more expansive fair use argument than other courts have credited — perhaps one supported by facts specific to this individual and this unique period of rapid technological change .
For example , file sharing for the purposes of sampling music prior to purchase or space - shifting to store purchased music more efficiently might offer a compelling case for fair use .
Likewise , a defendant who used the new file - sharing networks in the technological interregnum before digital media could be purchased legally , but who later shifted to paid outlets , might also be able to rely on the defense . "
Read that again : Gertner was ready to consider the idea that even years of unrepentant P2P use might have been allowable so long as they were in the dark days of Napster and music industry 's own ridiculous attempts to launch music stores online , PressPlay and Musicnet .
Once iTunes and then Amazon made online sales cheap and easy , though , Gertner was not about to authorize widespread file - sharing .
Also remember that Gertner throughout has been quite a public critic of the music industry 's lawsuit campaign .
She continues that criticism in the memo , saying , " The Court , deeply concerned by the rash of file - sharing lawsuits , the imbalance of resources between the parties , and the upheaval of norms of behavior brought on by the Internet , did everything in its power to permit Tenenbaum to make his best case for fair use . "
That was the backdrop , but when Nesson and his team stepped up to litigate the issue of fair use , what did they offer to Gertner ?
" A truly chaotic defense , " she calls it , along with legal papers that " can only be described as perfunctory . "
It was also one that reached much too far .
" Rather than tailoring his fair use defense to suggest a modest exception to copyright protections , Tenenbaum mounted a broadside attack that would excuse all file - sharing for private enjoyment . "
By striking so broadly at the idea of copyright , Tenenbaum took the matter out of Gertner 's hands .
" Whether the widespread , unlimited file sharing that the record suggests he engaged in benefits the public more than our current copyright protections is a balance to be struck by Congress , not this Court , " she concluded .
In addition , she singled out Nesson for criticism in a footnote to the memo .
" Defense counsel repeatedly missed deadlines , ignored rules , engaged in litigation over conduct that was plainly illegal ( namely , the right to tape counsel and the Court without consent ) , and even went so far as to post the illegal recordings to the Web . "
Examples of Nesson 's bad behavior in the case " are legion . "
And so we 're left wondering what might have been .
Tenenbaum can still contest the damage award , arguing that it was unconstitutionally excessive ( papers on that claim are due in January ) , but " reducing a ridiculous damage award " is far less important than shoring up robust fair use rights .
The circus that the case has been was entertaining enough ; for journalists , in fact , it was an unlooked - for boon .
But there are limits to entertainment 's ability to effect change .
Now that the circus lights are down and the big top is packed away , the world returns to the way it was .
May 27 , 2005  --
Last month on Wage Equity Day , politicians demanded new laws to protect women from what they say is an unfair pay scale .
We hear about the so - called wage gap over and over , and many studies have found that women make about 75 cents for every dollar a man earns .
Activists and politicians say the pay difference is all about sexism .
" No matter how hard women work , or whatever they achieve in terms of advancement in their own professions and degrees , they will not be compensated equitably , " said Rep. Rosa DeLauro , D - Conn .
Activists have convinced some young women that even if they work the same hours , have the same education and do the same type of work , they will be paid less than men .
But how could this be possible ?
Suppose you 're an employer doing the hiring .
If a woman does equal work for 25 percent less money , why would any employer ever hire a man ?
Martha Burk , chair of the National Council of Women 's Organizations , gave me this simple answer : " Because they like to hire men , John .
They like to hire people like themselves and they darn sure like to promote people like themselves , " she said .
In her new book , " Cult of Power : Sex Discrimination in Corporate America and What Can Be Done About It , " Burk concludes what we 've all heard .
" Women make less .
Even if it 's the exact same job title and it is the exact same work and the experience is comparable , " she said .
But author Warren Farrell , who spent about 15 years going over U.S. Census statistics and research studies , said Burk is wrong .
Farrell 's research found that the wage gap exists not because of sexism , but because more men are willing to do certain kinds of jobs .
" The average full - time working male works more than a full - time working female , " Farrell said .
Farrell illustrates his findings at lectures by asking men and women to stand up in answer to a series of questions about their job choices , such as whether they work more than 40 hours a week , or have held a job that has required them to work outdoors , or if they have 20 years experience in their current occupation .
Again and again , more men stand up .
Different job choices are why men earn more , Farrell says in his new book , " Why Men Earn More : The Startling Truth Behind the Pay Gap -- and What Women Can Do About It . "
" The women themselves say they 're far more likely to care about flexibility .
The men say I 'm far more likely to care about money , " Farrell said .
What about the fact that almost all of the biggest money makers -- the company bosses -- are men ?
There are some female chief executive officers making big bucks , but they are the exception .
Is n't that discrimination ?
" We have been suckered into believing that because there are more men at the top than women at the top , that this is a result of discrimination against women .
That 's been the misconception .
It 's all about trade - offs .
You earn more money , you usually sacrifice something at home , " Farrell said .
If they are n't discriminating , why do companies give out multimillion - dollar settlements ?
" They 're afraid ... of getting publicity for a year saying that they 're anti-female , so you settle , " Farrell said .
Decades ago , Farrell was a man who joined Gloria Steinem in feminist protests .
He 's the only man to have been elected three times to the board of the National Organization for Women .
" I used to wear a ' 59 cent ' pin to protest the fact that men earned a dollar for each 59 cents that women earned for the same work .
And then I asked myself one day : " If men are earning a dollar , maybe I 'll go out and start an all - female firm and I 'll be able to produce products for 59 cents that male firms are producing for a dollar , " he said .
He came to realize that there 's something wrong with the statistic .
Farrell combed through jobs data and found that higher - paying jobs are more likely to require longer commuting times , safety risks , frequent travel , long hours and other factors that , on his tests , led the men to stand while the women sat .
Those jobs pay more because fewer people want to do them .
It 's not sexism .
It 's just supply and demand .
In some fields , like office jobs -- finance for example -- women make as much or more than men .
However , activists say America needs a law like the one passed in Ontario where employers must rate every job to make sure women are paid fairly .
Companies say the law is complicated and costly .
" We spent months , spent thousands , if not tens of thousands of dollars on this project to do a 3 - cent adjustment that may not have even been necessary , " said Sheldon Caplan , who works for a Canadian company that sews and sells sofa cushions .
While the law may have helped some women increase their wages , a broader study in The Canadian Journal of Economics found the law has had " no effect on the wage gap . "
We do n't need a law , Caplan said .
Any company that discriminates by sex or anything other than work ability will have higher costs .
" I hope my competitors discriminate .
I want my competitors to discriminate because then they will go out of business , " he said .
But the wage - gap myth persists , Farrell said , because nobody wants to confront it .
Feminists and activists now see Farrell as the bad guy , but he 's just saying what 's true .
" Women and men look at their life , and women say , ' What do I need ?
Do I need more money , or do I need more time ? '
And women are intelligent enough to say , I need more time .
And so women lead balanced lives , men should be learning from women . "
But some politicians say we should import the bureaucratic mess Ontario has created ?
Give me a break .
Quotes from outside experts or observers are also a rich source of unnecessary verbiage in newspaper articles .
Another New York Times story from the November 8 front page provides a good example here .
It ’s about how the crackdown on some Wall Street bonuses may have backfired .
Executives were forced to take stock instead of cash , but then the stock went up , damn it .
This is an “ enterprise ” story — one the reporter or an editor came up with , not one dictated by events .
And the reporter clearly views the information it contains as falling somewhere between ironic and appalling , which seems about right .
But it ’s not her job to have a view .
In fact , it ’s her job to not have a view .
Even though it ’s her story and her judgment , she must find someone else — an expert or an observer — to repeat and endorse her conclusion .
These quotes then magically turn an opinionated story into an objective one .
And so :
“ People have to look at the sizable gains that have been made since stock and options were granted last year , and the fact is this was , in many ways , a windfall , ” said Jesse M. Brill , the chairman of CompensationStandards.com , a trade publication .
“ This had nothing to do with people ’s performance .
These were granted at market lows . ”
Those are 56 words spent allowing Jesse M. Brill to restate the author ’s point .
Yet I , for one , have never heard of Jesse M. Brill before .
He may be a fine fellow .
But I have no particular reason to trust him , and he has no particular reason to need my trust .
The New York Times , on the other hand , does need my trust , or it is out of business .
So it has a strong incentive to earn my trust every day ( which it does , with rare and historic exceptions ) .
But instead of asking me to trust it and its reporter about the thesis of this piece , The New York Times asks me to trust this person I have never heard of , Jesse M. Brill .
Of course this attempt to pass the hot potato to a total stranger does n’t work , because before I can trust Jesse M. Brill about the thesis of the piece , I have to trust The New York Times that this Jesse M. Brill person is trustworthy , and the article under examination devotes many words to telling me who he is so that I will trust him .
( By contrast , it tells me nothing about the reporter . )
Why not cut out the middleman ?
The reason to trust this story , if you choose to do so , is that it is in The New York Times .
What Jesse M. Brill may think adds nothing .
Yet he is only one of several experts quoted throughout , basically telling the story all over again .
In the current financial crisis , The New York Times and other papers seem to have given reporters more leeway than ever before to express their opinions directly .
Editors may have realized that these issues are hard enough to explain without running into roadblocks at every turn labeled Warning : Opinion Territory Ahead .
But the old wordy conventions survive .
Quotes from strangers restating the reporter ’s opinion are one .
Another is adding protective qualifiers to statements about which there is no real doubt ( as when I wrote above that the bonus restrictions “ may have ” backfired ) .
A third — illustrated by the headline on that story , “ Windfall Seen as Bonuses Are Paid in Stock ” — is to attribute the article ’s conclusion to unnamed others .
Somebody sees a windfall .
We ’re just telling you about it .
SAN FRANCISCO 
It was not the type of question that one usually hears from lawyers in federal court .
“ What does it mean , ” Theodore B. Olson asked his client , Kristin M. Perry , “ to be a lesbian ? ”
Mr. Olson ’s question came during one of several attention - grabbing moments on the first day of the trial here on the constitutionality of Proposition 8 , California ’s voter - approved ban on same - sex marriage .
It is a case that is expected to feature three weeks of evidence , experts and  if Monday was an indication  emotionally charged testimony on everything from the nature of gay sexuality to the nature of a romantic same - sex marriage proposal .
Ms. Perry , a 45 - year - old child services professional who brought the case with her partner , Sandra B. Stier , 47 , and a male couple , recounted how she had slowly fallen in love with Ms. Stier .
“ I remember thinking that she was the sparkliest person I ’d ever met , ” Ms. Perry said , drawing giggles from the packed courtroom .
When she told Ms. Stier of her feelings , she said , “ she told me she loved me , too . ”
Ms. Perry proposed marriage in 2003 , although same - sex marriage was illegal then in California and every other state .
HEALTH SCANDAL - MONSANTO'S GMO PERVERSION OF FOOD
By Byron J. Richards , CCN
January 20 , 2010
NewsWithViews.com
In the 2010 growing season Monsanto plans to unleash its latest Frankenfood experiment on the American and Canadian public , a new version of genetically mutated corn with eight abnormal gene traits called Genuity SmartStax corn .
It is the culmination of an astonishing scandal that has been steadily building over the past decade .
During this time Monsanto ’s mutated seeds have grown to 90 % of the U.S. soy crop and 85 % of the corn crop – and wheat is next on their agenda .
Their efforts have been marked by corporate bullying and have drawn the attention of the Justice Department who is conducting an antitrust investigation .
All the while they have been spending millions on lobbying to fast track their agenda before the American public even realizes what hit them .
Monsanto is making an ominous power play to corner the worldwide market on food and seeds .
In the process they are adversely altering the very nature of food itself .
Few people would eat Monsanto ’s “ food ” if they understood what it was or knew that they were eating it .
President Obama and his family wo n’t eat it .
Neither did the Bush family .
Even a Monsanto employee cafeteria rejects it .
This is no laughing matter .
Your health and the health of your children and grandchildren are at stake .
It seems more like a scene from a horror flick than something happening in modern day America .
Imagine your digestive tract turned into a Roundup Ready herbicide factory and other warped genetic signals slowly and progressively rotting away your health .
Unlike acute food poisoning from infectious E.coli , it is a slow and insidious poisoning .
Why GMO Food is Dangerous
Monsanto ’s GMO ( genetically modified organism ) technology inserts non-food genes , genes from other species , into the DNA of food , altering the very nature of food itself .
In some cases these genes make the crops more tolerant to the Roundup Ready herbicide made by Monsanto and in other cases the genes abnormally cause the DNA of food cells to produce toxic proteins that act as pesticides .
Most people are not comfortable with the concept of altering the nature of food in a grand genetic experiment with unknown consequences .
The idea of food producing its own internal toxin is equally abhorrent .
After all , who wants to eat toxic food ?
Even fewer trust this technology in the hands of Monsanto , a company with a history of blatant disregard for human health .
It was Monsanto that knowingly poisoned the planet with toxic PCBs .
The process of making GMO seeds also poses health risks .
Viral promoter genes are used during this production process and become part of the DNA mix , posing a risk for new types of viral disease .
An unintended side - effect of this production technology is chronic activation or suppression of normal genes in the modified plants .
This alters the actual nutrient structure of food and the function of the proteins within that food – a very serious matter .
The entire process of producing GMO seeds is also unpredictable .
It creates multiple random genetic events in every food cell invaded by the mutant genes .
Because each gene does n’t just do one thing and is highly interactive with other genes , the production of GMO food is not consistent and therefore safety cannot be guaranteed – especially when you understand that our scientific knowledge of gene interdependencies is in its infancy .
Eating food that is mutated by other non-food species is a grand experiment to say the least .
GMO mutants can transfer to the living bacteria in your digestive tract , as has been shown in animal experiments .
This can adversely change the way your gut bacteria behave so that they create pesticides and become more resistant to your immune system and medical treatments .
If the GMO mutants were to transfer to an existing infection in your digestive tract then it could create your own superbug .
Because the proteins in GMO food are structurally different than normal food they significantly increase the risk for allergy .
Allergy is one form of inflammation that is likely to result from GMO food , but there are many other potential sources .
These include the mis-metabolism of the food , the inherent toxicity of the food , and the pesticide residues on the food .
These inflammatory problems of GMO food will additively contribute to other forms of inflammation such as pollution and stress and add to the total inflammation burden sets the stage for many diseases .
It is likely that GMO food will have a significant impact on pregnancy problems and developmental problems in children .
At this time nobody can rule out GMO as a possible causative factor in Autism , as the rates of both have risen together .
A recent re-evaluation of data provided by Monsanto showed that various types of GMO corn caused significant inflammatory organ damage to rats .

It has now been shown that the health consequence of eating high amounts of Roundup Ready residue that is being sprayed in ever - higher amounts on GMO crops is the disruption of your endocrine system .
A recent study shows that these residues of Roundup Ready are highly interactive with sex hormones and significantly disrupt their function .
A 2008 Austrian government study showed that feeding GMO corn to mice for multiple generations resulted in fertility issues and weakened kidneys , as well as changes in metabolic pathways involved with inflammation , cholesterol , and protein .
Here is a link to the 105 page report .
GMO crops are also drastically and adversely altering soil quality .
In fact , soil animals such as earthworms are now found to have incorporated GMO mutant corn genes into their cells .
This finding is of extreme importance to potential human health problems .
There is certainly nothing preventing this from happening to humans .
For more information on the devastating health consequences of consuming GMO foods read Jeffrey Smith ’s books , Seeds of Deception and Genetic Roulette . ”
You may be wondering the obvious ; if GMOs are so dangerous to eat then why are they allowed in the food supply ?
Corporate Cronyism - A Corrupt FDA Places the Public in Danger
We now know that FDA scientists originally working on the issue of the safety of GMO food had considerable concerns that included allergies , toxins , adverse nutritional effects , and new diseases .
They urged long - term studies but were ignored by FDA management who instead decided that GMO food was “ substantially equivalent ” to normal food .
In 1992 these managers issued the following policy statement in the Federal Register , “ The agency is not aware of any information showing that foods derived by these new methods differ from other foods in any meaningful or uniform way . ”
In retrospect , that policy , which stands to this day , was a flat out lie and a treasonous betrayal of the public trust .
Court cases have forced into public view the documents expressing the concerns of the FDA scientists .
You can read them all at this link to the BioIntegrity .
Org website .
In fact , rushing GMO foods to market also represents a serious breach of scientific integrity by the overall research community .
Today , the FDA is a world leader in proteomic technology , the advanced analysis of protein structure and function .
Italian researchers using proteomics have already proven beyond any question that GMO food is so genetically different from normal food that it cannot possibly be considered substantially equivalent .
Certainly the FDA could discover this fact for themselves in a matter of hours .
Why are FDA scientists in handcuffs and not taking action ?
Part of the FDA management team ’s culture of corruption is a revolving door with the various companies they are supposed to be regulating , the very definition of corporate cronyism .
These shenanigans have had the net effect of the FDA acting primarily as a police force bully representing various powerful lobbies that buy protection and marketing favors , while stomping on the rights of the little guys like organic family farms and consumers .
In the case of food , Monsanto wins the gold medal for influence pedaling at the expense of human health .
One of the more egregious examples of cronyism is Michael Taylor .
He was an FDA staff lawyer and Executive Assistant to the FDA Commissioner from 1976 to 1981 .
From 1981 to 1991 he worked at the law firm of King and Spaulding , acting as Monsanto ’s lawyer and lobbyist .
He was a major proponent for overturning the Delaney Clause , a 1958 law prohibiting the introduction of known carcinogens to processed foods , a law Monsanto hated and which was eventually overturned by Clinton in 1996 .
His main responsibility during this time was gaining regulatory approval of Monsanto ’s genetically modified cancer - causing bovine growth hormone ( rBGH ) .

To complete his efforts on the bovine growth hormone issue Taylor went back to work for the FDA in 1991 with the title Deputy Commissioner for Policy at the Food and Drug Administration .
He was directly responsible for writing the FDA policy on “ substantial equivalence ” which initially ushered in the rBGH era and to this day enables Monsanto to market its GMO mutated food with no appropriate oversight by the FDA as to safety .
He also formulated policy that prevented milk producers from informing consumers that their milk was free of bovine growth hormone – intentionally preventing consumers from being able to tell what was in the milk product they were consuming .
After accomplishing his dirty work , he left the FDA in 1994 and went to work for Monsanto as Vice President for Public Policy , working on Monsanto ’s long range plans .
More recently , he became a Senior Fellow at Resources for the Future ( RFF ) and Director of the Risk , Resources and Environmental Management division .
In this role , he strategized how to get Monsanto ’s GMO crops into Africa , working closely with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation .
He also worked closely with the Bush Administration , and is the point man in helping an elite agenda to spread GMO seeds and biotech dependence around the world .
You guessed it – now he is back at the FDA in a new position the Obama Administration created – Senior Advisor to the Commissioner , working primarily on issues of food safety !
“ I am pleased to welcome Mike Taylor back to the FDA , ” Commissioner of Food and Drugs Margaret A. Hamburg , M.D. , said in announcing Taylor ’s appointment .
“ His expertise and leadership on food safety issues will help the agency to develop and implement the prevention based strategy we need to ensure the safety of the food we eat . ”
As Monsanto , in anti-competitive collusion with Dow , takes their new GMO toxic and mutated corn to market , stacked with eight genes , it should come as no surprise that absolutely no safety testing is being required by the FDA .
Never before have there been eight genes altered simultaneously within the cells of food .
One gene is bad enough .
Three is horrendous .
But eight ?
The fact that the FDA is not requiring extensive safety testing by independent sources of this highly unpredictable and dangerous technology is unthinkable .
It is a grim day when the fox is in charge of the henhouse .
There Is No Good Reason for Monsanto ’s GMOs
If you listen to Monsanto and their business cohorts such as Cargill , they state they are trying to feed the world .
In reality , the world could eliminate Monsanto ’s mutated food tomorrow and it would be a better place .
It could also do without Cargill acting as an unregulated food banker , profiting on the manipulation of food sales at the expense of farmers in a way that is every bit as bad as the worst of Wall Street .
There is no need for Monsanto ’s GMO mutated seeds .
They offer no advantages .
It is an industry being propped up by unelected bureaucrats and elected officials on the receiving end of Monsanto ’s multi-million dollar lobbying operation .
Michael Taylor is one example of corporate crony influence , there are many others .
The USDA is profiting from Monsanto ’s seeds that cannot be used the next growing season ( the Terminator aspect of the problem ) .
The EPA ’s failure to regulate the amounts of Roundup Ready used on food is yet another scandal .
It ’s all about profits and control – while undermining the world ’s farmers and the biodiversity and sustainability of crops .
Contrary to the Monsanto and Cargill propaganda , GMO technology does not increase crop yields , as has been fully documented in the Union of Concerned Scientists report titled Failure to Yield .
And GMO crops are very bad for the carbon footprint .
The fact that the Obama administration is actively forwarding Monsanto ’s efforts should be a grave concern to every American .
Of course , the last 16 years of Clinton and Bush also did everything in their power to help Monsanto .
No wonder Americans are fed up .
Politicians in both parties are beholden to the golden idol , not the best health interests of its citizens .
Take Back Our Food – Join the Fight
We the people can have a huge impact and we can change this serious threat to human health .
Do n’t buy GMOs food .
GMOs permeate corn and soy products , beet sugar is now mutated , and wheat is next in line .
If you are n’t sure how to avoid GMO foods and brands then follow the advice given on Jeffrey Smith ’s Non-GMO shopping guide .
Demand from your political representatives that all GMO food be labeled as containing GMOs .
This is n’t just a political issue – this is about your personal health and the future of food .

John Prescott has defended China 's role in the climate change summit , saying the blame for its flawed outcome must lie with the United States and Barack Obama .
The former deputy prime minister helped negotiate the Kyoto protocol in 1997 , and was in Copenhagen acting as an informal bridge between the Chinese delegation and others .
As a frequent visitor to China , who knows many of its officials personally , Prescott fears privately that the Chinese will walk away from the talks if they continue to be singled out for blame .
In a letter to the Guardian , Prescott criticises the US climate change special envoy , Todd Stern , who " said at Copenhagen emissions were n't about ' morality or politics ' , they were ' just maths ' , with China projected to emit 60 % more CO 2 than the US by 2030 " .
In his letter Prescott claims that Stern 's arguments " ignored the more transparent measure of pollution per capita , which shows the US emits 20 tonnes per person every year , compared to China 's six tonnes , whilst America 's GDP per person is almost eight times greater than the Chinese " .
He also attacks President Barack Obama for suggesting there had been a period of " two decades of talking and no action .
That might have been true in America , which refused to sign up to Kyoto , but not in the case of China or Europe , who followed a lot of that protocol 's policies .
Indeed Obama 's offer of a 17 % cut is wholly dependent on Congressional approval and will still be less than Kyoto targets . "
Prescott is climate change convenor for the Council of Europe , with the role of exploring how to keep the talks on the road .
China itself defended its " crucial role " in saving the Copenhagen conference from failure , according to the state media 's first blow - by - blow rebuttal of European claims that China wrecked a climate deal .
In a florid account of prime minister Wen Jiabao 's 60 hours in Copenhagen , the Xinhua news agency said the premier staved off the " unrealistic and unfair demands " of Britain , Germany and Japan .
There is no direct criticism of the US , but Obama is described as " awkward " in the presence of the Chinese premier .
According to the lengthy defence of China 's actions , European nations repeatedly tried to impose secret drafts , unscheduled meetings and a hidden agenda on China and other developing nations .
The article , likely to have been approved at the highest level of government , notes that Wen walked out of a state dinner after hearing that an unscheduled meeting of leaders was being arranged soon afterwards to discuss a new draft text .
" It was really absurd that the country who called for the meeting never informed China , " the report says .
" Premier Wen concluded that this was no small matter .
" Since the start of the conference , there had been cases where individual or small group of countries put forward new texts in disregard of the principle of openness and transparency , arousing strong complaints from other participants . "
Such accusations infuriate senior European negotiators , who claim China was fully informed ahead of Copenhagen of the plan for a new document , though it never agreed to the content .
Xinhua avoids mention of how and why China killed attempts to impose 2050 targets for reducing emissions .
Beijing has consistently rejected such long - term goals , which it sees as a threat to itseconomic growth .
It also fails to address claims that China torpedoed the inclusion of a 1.5C maximum global temperature rise , requested by small island states and African nations .
Instead , it says , Wen showed sincerity by accepting a rise of no more than 2C by 2050 .
Fewer than 50 % of British people believe there is a genuine climate problem caused by humans .
And of that 50 % most have no idea what the science says anyway .
Same goes for the USA and most other countries .
Nor do the leaders of those countries know the extent of worldwide concern , that nations are stripping their assets to follow unproven science .
Or , more likely , they are ignoring it .
There is the general delusion that climate change is caused by CO2
This means that leaders who attend the Summit represent only themselves and their own interests .
They certainly do not represent their countries .
There is the general delusion that climate change is caused by CO2 , even though the science says otherwise .
There is also the general delusion that man can change climate by altering his CO2 emissions .
This is another fallacy , unproven by science .
So , what is going on ?
What is going on is repression and suppression of science .
Growing large numbers of scientists throughout the world object to the prevailing clamour to cut CO2 , to ‘ save the planet ’ .
Only a few months ago they were still touting ‘ global warming ’ .
This has now been quietly dropped in favour of yet another myth – climate change .
What comes next ?
Repression and suppression of science
‘ Climate change ’ ( a totally meaningless semi-phrase ) is only the prevailing view because the media and governments refuse to publish all sides of the story … and there are many .
In particular , there is no agreement that CO2 affects climate in any way .
And there is no agreement that humans cause the biggest rise in CO2 .
Indeed , there is no scientific way to prove humans are behind CO2 rises , unless every molecule of carbon is neatly labelled ‘ human ’ and ‘ other ’ !
And , CO2 has a relatively short half - life anyway , so it never accumulates to a dangerous level ( ‘ danger ’ only being in the mind of greenies , especially as there is no ‘ greenhouse effect ’ .
That is , there is no ‘ greenhouse ’ or ceiling in the Troposphere trapping gases ) .
Yet , economies are being driven to collapse by relying totally on only one side of the argument .
The evidence suggests this is deliberate .
Laws and policies that control and remove freedoms of choice are being produced at break - neck speed .
People are now unable to heat their homes , or travel far .
And there is inordinate taxation .
But , there is no natural shortage of oil – there is more oil ready to be tapped than ever before !
There are plenty of fossil fuels – coal and gas .
And green taxes go to pay for … well , nothing in particular … ask government what the money actually pays for .
You ’ll find the answer is quite nebulous and unscientific .
Government panic is not due to lack of resources , but to a resolute refusal to use them !
And that is caused by bad science .
Even if we call it ‘ science in disagreement ’ there is no science to conclusively prove environmentalist claims .
If there were , green scientists would allow their data to be scrutinised and falsified – essential steps in proving , or disproving , any scientific claim .
In reality , ‘ green ’ scientists are blocking articles and data offered by those in opposition , and refusing to cooperate !
These are the fake professors ; those who wo n’t share their findings with genuine scientists .
Why are governments pushing the green agenda ?
Power , Money , Control
Why are governments pushing the green agenda ?
It has nothing at all to do with ‘ saving the planet ’ .
The sole reason is power and money .
Behind the whole enterprise is socialism , and a struggle to create a one world government .
Both Gordon Brown and Barack Obama have openly said so .
To clear the ground for this new socialist global governance , it is necessary to break each country ’s reliance on oil , money and individual freedoms .
Then , they have to rely on government .
This is why Obama has loaded the USA with a debt of mutli-trillions it cannot repay .
It is why Brown is taxing the UK up to its neck .
It is why the EU is splitting up countries in readiness to become mere regions .
It is why there are frantic campaigns in the media to reduce CO2 , and to brainwash the people into thinking there really is a looming disaster .
Forget warming – CO2 is the new black !
After that maybe the ‘ scientific consensus ’ will be , er , breathing in collapses distant stars , so stop it !
Am I really suggesting scientists make things up ?
Could be .
The disaster with Copenhagen is that we follow the leaders !
The background to their high claims is without scientific agreement .
But , what medium will publish the actual facts ?
Who will give equal time to pro- and anti-green scientists ?
And why is the revelation of emails and documents taken from a UK university , proving collusion and fraud between green scientists , hushed up ?
If anything , the BBC is promoting a pro-green set of programmes that coincide with the revelation of fraud !
And the UK government is stepping up its very biased ad campaign , ‘ Act on CO2 ’ .
They want to bury the facts under a flurry of activity .
Actually , I tell a lie – the BBC knew about the emails six weeks ago , but kept it quiet !
Nice to see they know news when they see it , and expose the perpetrators in the public interest .
( Excuse a snigger ) .
Why the rush to tie things up at Copenhagen ?
Because unless leaders can get the people to shut up and comply with every move , immediately , more revelations and facts about scientific fraud may hit the streets , and they will lose momentum and any credibility they think they have .
They do n’t care if news gets out after they have signed a binding agreement .
But not before – it makes things very awkward .
True Science not Government Propaganda
The urgent need of the day is to get the true scientific facts before the public eye , instead of government propaganda … not to speed head - first into committing every nation to pay trillions in ‘ aid ’ to mythical needs , or to make pro-green laws that are not based on science .
The Second World War was about removing a Fascist regime .
Then came the Cold War that opposed communism .
Now , in a time of relative peace for the West , every country is hurtling down the road of perdition , repeating the grave errors of the past .
They all want to join the coming Marxist - Fascist worldwide regime .
As in both former regimes , only the elite survive and are made comfortable .
The rest suffer .
This is where the Copenhagen Summit is heading .
It is up to the people to stop it in its tracks .
Just keep spreading the facts and make the brew sour .

Archive photo of Abdallah Abu Rahmah protesting the wall in Bil ’in taken on May 17 , 2005 .
( Photo : Oren Ziv/ Activestills.org )
On International Human Rights Day in 2008 , my husband Abdallah Abu Rahmah was in Berlin receiving a medal from the World Association for Human Rights .
Last year on the same day , December 10th , Abdallah was taken away at 2 am by Israeli soldiers who broke into our West Bank home .
Abdallah was arrested for the same reasons he received the prize – his nonviolent struggle for justice , equality and peace in Israel / Palestine .
My husband is a school teacher and farmer from the Palestinian village of Bil’in .
When Israel built its apartheid wall here , it separated Bil ’in from more than half of its land , in order to facilitate the expansion of the illegal settlement Mattityahu East .
In response , Abdallah and fellow villagers began a campaign of nonviolent resistance .
Every Friday for the past five years , we ’ve marched , with Israeli and international supporters , to protest the theft of our land and livelihoods .
In September , 2007 Israel ’s Supreme Court ruled that the route of the wall in Bil ’in was illegal and should be changed .
Over two years later , the wall remains , unmoved .
Many were discouraged , but Abdallah told them that the pressure of our campaign and international support could bring down the wall .
As the grassroots struggle grows here , the efforts to end our actions have intensified .
The army has been instructed to use weapons against the protesters and arrest participants .
Our beloved friend , Bassem Abu Rahmah , was murdered by Israeli soldiers as he tried to talk with them , while participating in a demonstration .
Seventy - seven others have been arrested in violent night raids .
Among the other arrestees is Abdallah ’s cousin Adeeb Abu Rahmah , who , like Abdallah , never missed a demonstration and was never violent .
Adeeb , a father of nine , has been in prison for five months , with no end in sight .
Since the first time our home was invaded , our seven year - old daughter Luma has been waking up screaming , and five year - old Layan wetting her bed .
Only our nine month - old son Laith still smiles and giggles , but I cry when he calls for his father .
Leaders like former President Jimmy Carter and Archbishop Desmond Tutu , one of the leaders of South Africa ’s anti-apartheid struggle , have visited our village .
They stood with Abdallah at Bassem ’s grave last August .
Mr. Tutu told us , " Just as a simple man named Gandhi led the successful nonviolent struggle in India and simple people such as Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King led the struggle for civil rights in the United States , simple people here in Bil ’in are leading a nonviolent struggle that will bring them their freedom . "
The afternoon before his arrest , Abdallah prepared a speech to be read on his behalf to the World Association for Human Rights since Israel would not allow him to travel to Germany for the ceremony .
Abdallah wrote :
" I wish I could be with you to share in the joy of our colleagues receiving this year ’s prize and to celebrate with you the 20th anniversary of the removal of the Berlin Wall .
But the occupation not only robs us of statehood , land , and so often of our lives , it also deprives us of many beautiful moments . "
" My mother passed away in a hospital in occupied East Jerusalem , our historic capital , in August but the Israeli occupation refused me a permit to be with her .
An Israeli friend held a mobile phone to my mother ’s ear so that I could say good bye to her and thank her for all the love she has given me .
In the darkness of all these difficulties the occupation imposes on us , the solidarity of justice - seeking people like you all over the world gives us strength . "
" Unlike Israel , we have no nuclear weapons , and no army , but we do not want or need those things .
With your support and the justice of our cause , we will bring down Israel ’s apartheid wall . "
Twelve hours after Abdallah was taken to a military jail from our home , I listened as President Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize and spoke of " the men and women around the world who have been jailed and beaten in the pursuit of justice . "
I thought of Bassem , Adeeb and my husband , and wondered if President Obama will take action to support our struggle for freedom .
Majda Abu Rahmah is a school teacher for children with special needs from the village of Bil’in in the Israeli - occupied West Bank .

TEHRAN ( Reuters ) - A remote - controlled bomb killed a Tehran University scientist on Tuesday , official media reported , in an attack Iran blamed on the United States and Israel .
Iranian officials and state media described professor Massoud Ali-Mohammadi as a nuclear scientist , and Iran ’s cabinet said agents of the United States were behind his murder .
A State Department official in Washington said charges of U.S. involvement were absurd .
Western sources said Ali-Mohammadi , a physics professor , worked closely with Mohsen Fakhrizadeh - Mahabadi and Fereydoun Abbassi - Davani , both subject to U.N. sanctions because of their work on suspected nuclear weapons development .
The U.N. nuclear agency is investigating Iran ’s nuclear program , which Tehran says is for generating electricity and not for building nuclear bombs as the West suspects .
Ali Shirzadian , a spokesman for Iran ’s Atomic Energy Organization , said Ali-Mohammadi , 50 , had not played a role in the activities of the organization , which is at the center of the disputed nuclear program .
Shahram Amiri , a university researcher working for the atomic body , disappeared during a pilgrimage to Mecca in June , three months before Iran disclosed the existence of its second uranium enrichment site near the city of Qom .
In December , Tehran accused Saudi Arabia of handing Amiri over to the United States .
“ America ’s spying and intelligence agents from one side abduct some Iranian citizens ... and on the other side their treacherous agents kill an Iranian citizen inside the country , ” an Iranian cabinet statement said , reported by the semi-official Fars news agency .
A list of Ali-Mohammadi ’s publications on Tehran University ’s website suggested his specialism was theoretical particle physics , not nuclear energy , a Western physics professor said .
The bombing -- a rare attack in the Iranian capital -- occurred at a time of heightened tension in the Islamic Republic seven months after a disputed presidential election plunged the oil producer into turmoil .
It also coincided with a sensitive juncture in Iran ’s row with the West over its nuclear ambitions , with global powers expected to meet in New York on Saturday to discuss possible new sanctions on Tehran over its refusal to halt its atomic work .
Earlier , Iran ’s Foreign Ministry blamed Israel and the United States .
“ Signs of the triangle of wickedness by the Zionist regime ( Israel ) , America and their hired agents , are visible in the terrorist act , ” it said .
“ Such terrorist acts and the apparent elimination of the country ’s nuclear scientists will definitely not obstruct scientific and technological processes , ” it said .
White House spokesman Bill Burton said the accusations were absurd .
A senior Israeli official said Ali-Mohammadi was not known to have been a significant figure in any military nuclear program .
BOOBY - TRAPPED MOTORBIKE
English - language Press TV said Ali-Mohammadi was killed in a northern part of the capital by a booby - trapped motorcycle as he was leaving his home .
It showed footage of blood stains , broken glass and other debris at the scene , with what appeared to be the dead man in a body bag taken away on a stretcher .

Fars said President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had ordered the intelligence and security services to use all their capabilities to find those behind the killing .
State broadcaster IRIB described al - Mohammadi as a “ committed and revolutionary ” professor , suggesting he backed Ahmadinejad ’s government .
Fars quoted one of his students as saying he had worked with the elite Revolutionary Guards until 2003 .
But an opposition website , Jaras , said he was an opposition supporter whose name was among hundreds of academics who issued a statement in favor of moderate candidate Mirhossein Mousavi during the campaign for last June ’s election .
Even if he had worked on Iran ’s nuclear program , analysts doubted his death could set back Tehran ’s aspirations .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
“ I have no reason to think that this is part of an Israeli or American strategy to deprive Iran of the brains of the enrichment process , ” said Mark Fitzpatrick , chief proliferation analyst at London ’s International Institute for Strategic Studies .
“ There are by now too many scientists and engineers with the requisite expertise ” .
STRATFOR , a global intelligence firm , said Ali-Mohammadi was unlikely to have been a key figure in nuclear activities since his publishing record pointed to purely academic research .
“ The relatively high visibility and volume of work in academia suggests that Ali-Mohammadi ’s role , if any , in the nuclear program was not very significant , ” STRATFOR said in an analysis .
“ Critical scientists involved in nuclear weapons programs usually are sequestered carefully and provided more security than Ali-Mohammadi was given . ”
Fars quoted a foreign - based group , the Iran Monarchy Association , as claiming responsibility for Tuesday ’s bombing .
It did not say how it obtained the statement .
Iran has been convulsed by its most serious domestic unrest since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 as protests by opposition supporters against the election result have turned violent .
Authorities deny opposition allegations that voting was rigged .

A coffee shop that played an unusual role in Iowa City history holds its grand reopening next week .
Wild Bill ’s Coffee Shop was the workplace of Bill Sackter , the man on whom the popular 1981 movie “ Bill ” was based , starring Mickey Rooney , and a documentary in 2008 .
Jefri Palermo is development coordinator at the University of Iowa ’s School of Social Work , and says the on -campus shop needed a major overhaul .
“ We had a very tiny kitchen , ” Palermo says .
“ We did n’t have hot water .
We did n’t have a dishwasher .
We had no way to really function in a kitchen capacity .
We busted out some walls and we ’ve expanded .
The whole goal is to make it wheelchair accessible . ”
After months of planning and renovation , she says the shop has a brand new look , while retaining its quirky character .
“ Now , the coffee shop has a nice kitchen , a wheelchair accessible sink , a refrigerator was donated by the Social Work Student Association , ” Palermo says .
“ We are ready to begin serving hot soup and sandwiches as well as gourmet coffee and pastries . ”
Sackter spent 44 years in a mental institution and emerged as an international hero for people with disabilities .
Palermo says many people who knew Bill will be back on campus for the January 19th reopening ceremony .
She says the shop is in what used to be the kindergarten room of the old University Elementary School .
During the remodeling process , the original kindergarten floor was found and restored , along with the cubbies from the room and a variety of artifacts .
Sackter died in 1983 .
The coffee shop is run by adults with disabilities as a service learning project in the School of Social Work at the University of Iowa .

Bacteria dance the electric slide , officially named electrokinesis by the USC geobiologists who discovered the phenomenon .
Their study , published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( Early Edition ) , describes what appears to be an entirely new bacterial behavior .
The metal - metabolizing Shewanella oneidensis microbe does not just cling to metal in its environment , as previously thought .
Instead , it harvests electrochemical energy obtained upon contact with the metal and swims furiously for a few minutes before landing again .
Electrokinesis is more than a curiosity .
Laboratory director and co-author Kenneth Nealson , the Wrigley Professor of Geobiology at USC and discoverer of Shewanella , hopes to boost the power of microbe - based fuel cells enough to produce usable energy .
The discovery of electrokinesis does not achieve that goal directly , but it should help researchers to better tune the complex living engines of microbial fuel cells .
" To optimize the bacteria is far more complicated than to optimize the fuel cell , " Nealson said .
advertisement
Electrokinesis was discovered in 2007 by Nealson 's graduate student Howard Harris , an undergraduate at the time .
Nealson had given Harris what seemed an ideal assignment for a double major in cinema and biophysics .
" I had asked him if he would just take some movies of these bacteria doing what they do , " Nealson said .
Filming through a microscope is hardly simple , but with the help of co-author and biophysics expert Moh El - Naggar , assistant professor of physics and astronomy at USC , Harris was able to make a computer analysis of a time - lapse sequence of bacteria near metal oxide particles .
" Every time the bacteria were around these particles … there was a great deal of swimming activity , " Nealson recalled .
advertisement
Harris then discovered that bacteria displayed the same behavior around the electrode of a battery .
The swimming stopped when the electrode turned off , suggesting that the activity was electrical in origin .
As is often true with discoveries , this one raises more questions than it answers .
Two in particular intrigue the researchers :
Why do the bacteria expend valuable energy swimming around ?
How do the bacteria find the metal and return to it ?
Do they sense it through an electric field or the behavior of other bacteria ?
Nealson and his team so far have only educated guesses .
For the first question , Nealson believes that the bacteria may swim away from the metal because they have too many competitors .
Bacteria get energy in two steps : by absorbing dissolved nutrients and then by converting those nutrients into biologically useful forms of energy through respiration , or the loss of electrons to an electron acceptor such as iron or manganese ( humans also respire through the loss of electrons to oxygen , one of the most powerful electron acceptors ) .
" If electrons do n't flow , it does n't matter how much food you have , " Nealson said .
However , he added , " in some environments , the food is much more precious than the electron acceptors . "
If a metal surface became too crowded for bacteria to absorb nutrients easily , they might want to swim away and come back .
For the second question , Harris and co-author Mandy Ward , assistant professor of research in earth sciences at USC , are planning other experiments to understand exactly how Shewanella find electron acceptors .
They expect the experiments to keep Harris busy through his doctoral thesis .
The other co-authors on the PNAS paper were Orianna Bretschger of the J. Craig Venter Institute in San Diego , Margaret Romine of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory , and Anna Obraztsova , staff scientist in the Nealson laboratory at USC .
Bernie ’s on the brink .
Disgraced ex-top cop Bernard Kerik has been exhibiting psychiatric “ symptoms ” behind bars and is considered “ at risk ” by a jailhouse shrink , the judge in his corruption case revealed yesterday .
Sources who have known the former NYPD commissioner for years told The Post they were n’t surprised that the fallen hero of 9/11 was apparently losing it in the slammer .
Kerik ca n’t stand humiliation , the sources said , and was totally despondent after the 2004 debacle when corruption allegations derailed his nomination to head the federal Department of Homeland Security .
Some friends even worried at the time that he might hurt himself , the sources said .
Judge Stephen Robinson said he got an unusual memo and later spoke with Westchester County Jail psychiatrist Dr. Robert Mahler , who expressed worries about Kerik ’s condition since being moved to a special unit after being locked up last week .
Robinson said “ it was clear to me in that conversation that there was more going on than simply Mr. Kerik being placed there because of his notoriety , status , or the circumstances of this case .
“ The concern was not ordinary , ” Robinson said .
“ There were things described to me that were either said or done that raised a level of concern for them such that I left the conversation with Dr. Mahler not feeling that this was an issue that could be ignored . ”
The judge said Kerik , 54 , might have to waive his right to doctor - patient confidentiality or undergo a court - ordered exam , and Robinson told both sides to get more information by Monday .
Robinson also said the situation might force another delay to Kerik ’s trial , set to begin on Nov. 9 .
Kerik — who had his bail revoked on Oct. 20 for giving a supporter sealed court records — did not speak during the hearing in White Plains federal court .
He wore a suit but no tie .
Defense lawyer Barry Berke said Kerik — who initially asked to be housed among the jail ’s general population — was instead put in “ essentially a lockdown most of the day , ” and that “ because of the stress of this situation , as well as the stress of the confinement , ” he agreed to a staffer ’s suggestion that he be moved to the special unit .
Berke said Kerik was not being medicated , but was “ regularly speaking ” with the staffer who suggested the move .
Berke would not answer reporters ’ questions afterward .
Jail spokesman Justin Pruyne said Kerik returned to the lockup after his court appearance and “ remains segregated from the general population , as he has since intake , based on his law - enforcement background , ” but would n’t comment further .
The jail has a psychiatric unit , but officials would not confirm that Kerik is there .

The Death Of John Kennedy
Why Nixon resigned instead of facing impeachment .
The answer to that question , never asked by politician , never asked by a servile media , was THE dark secret that could not be revealed ; the secret that would have brought down the entire government !
Years later , it did come out what had been the motive for the break - in .
It was connected to what Nixon called " Hanky Panky " , " That Cuban Thing " , and " That Bay of Pigs Mess " , on the White House tapes .
The DNC had gotten copies of the photographs taken of the three tramps in Dealey Plaza , and identified two of them as long time Nixon henchmen E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis .
The Democrats were using the photos to blackmail Nixon into calling off his campaign of sabotage in the final weeks before the GOP convention .
There was no real need to wiretap the phones that justified the risks of the break - ins as Nixon 's re-election was already a foregone conclusion .
This is why E. Howard
Hunt lead the break - in ; it was his own ass he was trying to save .
The photos resurfaced as part of a news story , and E. Howard Hunt sued the publisher , Liberty Lobby .
He lost .
Attorney Mark Lane provided witnesses that placed E. Howard Hunt in Dealey Plaza at the time that John F. Kennedy was killed .

Recently by Gary North : Why the Deflationist Argument Is Wrong in Both Theory and Practice
For the third time in my life , the Social Security System will go belly - up .
The first time was in 1977 — well , almost .
To head off the bust , Jimmy Carter got Congress to pass a major FICA tax increase — sorry , “ contribution ” increase — in order to save Social Security .
The rate would be hiked in phases from 2 % to 6.15 % ( times two : employee and employer ) .
He promised : “ Now this legislation will guarantee that from 1980 to the year 2030 , the Social Security funds will be sound . ” ( http://tinyurl.com/ybksxs4)
Carter ’s projection was off by a Georgia country mile .
In 1983 , the SSA program technically went bankrupt .
Reagan signed a law that speeded up Carter ’s rate increases , added Congressional employees to Social Security , and delayed the age of eligibility .
( http://tinyurl.com/ybksxs4)
Unless there is another Social Security tax increase in 2010 , the system will go into red ink mode and stay there .
The public has not been informed of this , which comes as no surprise .
There have been a few scattered stories on the Web , but nothing sustained .
The media do not want to admit that the jointly operated Social Security program and Medicare program are going to bankrupt the Federal government if they are not cut back drastically .
They are never cut back .
They always expand .
Medicare ’s Hospital Insurance program has been in red ink mode for two years .
The public does not know this , either .
To cover the program ’s insolvency , the government is quietly funding the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund with bailouts from the general fund .
Politically , this creates a problem .
When the Treasury taps the general fund , the expenditure appears on the budget — the on - budget budget — as an expenditure .
This immediately adds to the deficit , meaning the visible deficit , the one that gets recorded on those wonderful U.S. debt clocks .
When revenues flow into the four Social Security and Medicare trust funds , the money is instantly handed over to the Treasury , which issues non-marketable long - term IOU ’s to the trust funds .
These IOU ’s are listed as assets by the funds .
But , through the wonders of government accounting , they are not listed as liabilities on the government ’s on - budget budget .
They are liabilities only on the off - budget budget , which most Americans are unaware of .
This chicanery has been going on ever since the Johnson Administration ( Lyndon ’s , not Andrew’s ) .
The problem facing the politicians is this : when a trust fund is no longer showing a surplus of revenues over expenditures , it has to sell its assets back to the Treasury .
The Treasury ’s non-listed liabilities must be converted into money to send to the legal recipients .
This is a red alert of hidden red ink .
The public finds out .
The debt clocks speed up .
The Treasury has no money in reserve .
Every dollar that it takes in immediately flows out .
So , it must get Congress to provide the money for the deficit - running trust funds , either by taxing or by borrowing ( increasing the legal debt ceiling ) .
What ’s a Congress to do ?
HIDING THE BUST
The Congressional Budget Office released a report in July on the condition of the Social Security trust finds .
There are two funds : Old Age Insurance and Disability Insurance .
Think of them as “ geezers and gimps . ”
Combined , they are called OASDI .
The report offered a table of numbers showing inflow and outflow .
It is here .
The table is tricky to interpret .
This is deliberate .
The political strategy has always been concealment .
But if we think through what is being reported in this table , we can spot the ringer .
The ringer is interest payments to the trust funds .
The Treasury issued the IOU ’s , so it must pay the trust funds interest .
Think :
“ Where does the Treasury get the money ? ”
Answer : “ The general fund . ”
Up go the debt clocks .
Look at the figures projected for 2009 .
Income from revenues ( FICA ) is $ 653 billion .
Total income is $ 808 billion .
Where did the extra income come from ?
Three sources .
Taxes on benefits : $ 21 billionFederal employer share : $ 14 billionInterest : $ 120 billion
This means that the U.S. government has to pony up an extra $ 134 billion to pay to itself : $ 14 billion in taxes paid on behalf of Federal workers plus $ 120 billion in interest .
This is counted as revenue for the OASDI Trust Fund , but it is red ink for the government .
Neat !
Now let ’s do a reality check .
Subtract $ 134 billion from the $ 808 billion reported as total income to the OASDI Trust Fund .
Why subtract it ?
Because this is not income coming from outside the government .
We get $ 674 billion .
What is the expected outgo ?
$ 670 billion .
The official budget surplus for the OASDI Trust Fund : $ 138 billion ( $ 808 b minus $ 670 b ) .
This is reported by the CBO under “ Surplus . ”
This looks pretty good .
For the Trust Fund , it is pretty good .
For the government , the real figure is barely in the black .
The official on - budget , count - the - subsidy - as - a - subsidy OASDI surplus for the U.S. government : $ 4 billion ( $ 674 b minus $ 670 b ) .
This is never mentioned by the CBO .
We are expected to figure this out .
No one does .
It took me several minutes to spot the ringer .
Now let us look at the projections for 2010 .
Income for the trust funds : $ 811 billion .
Taxes on benefits : $ 20 billionFederal employer share : $ 15 billionInterest : $ 118 billion
Let us remove the U.S. government ’s payments into the fund : $ 133 billion ( $ 15 b + $ 118 b ) .
This must be covered by the general fund .
Subtract this from total income to the OASDI fund : $ 811 b minus $ 133 b = $ 678 b .
The expected outgo is $ 703 billion .
The deficit for the OASDI program in 2010 will be $ 25 billion ( $ 703 b minus $ 678 b ) .
Some people will regard the “ Federal employer share ” as non-subsidy : $ 15 billion .
I ’ll concede this in practice , although I still think this is money extracted by taxes paid into the general fund .
Even with this money removed , Social Security will run a $ 10 billion deficit in 2010 .
Social Security will go bust in 2010 , if CBO projections are correct .
What do I mean by “ bust ” ?
I mean technically insolvent — you know , like the nation ’s biggest banks in September 2008 , before the government ’s bailout and the Federal Reserve ’s swap at face value of T - bills for toxic debt held by the banks .
I mean by “ bust ” the inability of the Social Security System to pay its bills by means of money extracted from the public by way of FICA “ contributions . ”
Think of the Social Security System as Oliver Twist in the workhouse , gruel bowl in hand .
“ Please , sir , may I have some more ? ”
Unlike Bumble , the Treasury dips its ladle into the gruel and then fills up the bowl .
For how long ?
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow .
THE ACCOUNTING DECEPTION WORKS
The accounting scam of the Social Security Trust Fund has worked politically for a generation .
It is not just the voters who are fooled .
The best and the brightest in the media have been taken in .
Here is an exchange that took place on the PBS show , Nightly Business Report , on March 25 , 2009 .
GERSH : A negative cash flow does not mean Social Security is in crisis .
The program has built up an enormous trust fund over two decades .
Barbara Kennelly is president of the Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare .
She says the trust fund is more than enough to cover any short - term financial hit .
BARBARA KENNELLY , PRES . , NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO PRESERVE SOCIAL SECURITY & MEDICARE :
The trustees look at it every single year , the report is going to come out at the end of this month .
And you ’re going to still see that we can pay those benefits way out .
Say it ’s not 2041 , it ’s 2040 or 2039 .
But we have that money .
There is $ 2.5 trillion in the trust fund for Social Security .
No problem !
There is a $ 2.5 trillion asset base .
The OASDI Trust Fund need only sell a few of these assets each year .
The interviewer with PBS never batted an eye .
He did not say , “ Do n’t try to pull the wool over my eyes , sister .
I was n’t born yesterday . ”
Yes , he was , and the scam worked just as well yesterday as it does today .
She said : “ We can pay those benefits way out . ”
How ?
By selling trust fund assets .
You know the old line from the financial world .
“ Sell ! ” “ To whom ? ”
To sell an asset , there must be a market .
Here is the punch line , taken directly from the 2009 Report of the Trustees : “ Status of the Social Security and Medicare Programs . ”
( In a printout , this appears on page 4 . )
The Department of the Treasury invests program revenues in special non-marketable securities of the U.S. Government on which a market rate of interest is credited .
The trust funds represent the accumulated value , including interest , of all prior program annual surpluses and deficits , and provide automatic authority to pay benefits .
What , exactly , are “ non-marketable securities ” ?
They are IOU ’s issued by the Treasury on behalf of the U.S. government .
As I mentioned , these IOU ’s are not recorded in the government ’s on - budget account .
The revenues that purchase these IOU ’s are .
But wait !
There ’s more !
Pay attention to these words : “ on which a market rate of interest is credited . ”
The Treasury applies a market rate of interest to a non-marketable security .
There is no such rate .
The Treasury can make it up as it goes along .
So , the trust funds are filled with assets : non-marketable IOU ’s from the government , issued to a government agency .
The trust funds are treated as marketable assets .
They are indeed marketable : to the Treasury .
The bill is passed along to Congress whenever the trust fund sells any of these assets .
There are lots and lots of these IOU ’s in the Social Security OASDI Trust Fund .
No problem !
This is a scam .
It is an accounting trick to deceive the public .
Does it work ?
Better than Congress could have dreamed back in late 1968 , when the change in accounting took place .
( http://tinyurl.com/yeh5sm5)
According to the lady representing the special interest group promoting Social Security and Medicare , Judgment Day is a depleted trust fund .
That will take place is 2040 , give or take a couple of years .
Politically , a date this far out is irrelevant .
Congress has been playing kick the can on this issue for a generation .
There is no sense of urgency by the public , so there is no sense of urgency in Congress .
Judgment Day is 2010 , when the general fund must start paying for those cashed - in non-marketable assets .
Let ’s see if Congress will kick the can some more .
Let ’s see if Congress passes hikes in the FICA tax rates in 2010 , or extends the wage base that pays the tax beyond today ’s $ 106,800 limit .
My guess : Congress will kick the can .
The deficit will grow .
“ HOW BAD IS IT ? ”
Those were Ed McMahon ’s four words to Johnny Carson , decade after decade , setting up Carson ’s punch line .
Here is the punch line — lines , actually — as delivered by the notoriously humorless trustees of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds .
The 2009 report begins : “ The financial condition of the Social Security and Medicare programs remains challenging . ” I worked on Capitol Hill as Ron Paul ’s first research assistant back in 1976 .
The code word “ challenging ” means “ politically unsolvable at the present time , so Congress will kick the can . ”
To this assessment , add the first sentence in the Conclusion : “ The financial difficulties facing Social Security and Medicare pose serious challenges . ”
What does “ serious challenge ” mean ?
Think of December 7 , 1941 , on board the U.S.S. Arizona .
Imagine this sound : “ Aye - oo - ga ! Aye - oo - ga !
Abandon ship !
Abandon ship ! ”
We are assured that Social Security ’s problem is merely difficult .
( “ Yellow alert !
Yellow alert ! ” )
For Social Security , the reform options are relatively well understood but the choices are difficult .
The Social Security options are very well understood by Congress , but not the public .
These options have been understood by Congress ever since 1983 , when Reagan hiked FICA taxes .
The political choice was difficult in 1983 , back when Reagan still thought he could balance the budget without vetoing spending bills sent up by Congress , which he usually signed into law .
That was the year that the on - budget deficit hit $ 200 billion , a year before my 1977 prediction that it would hit $ 200 billion in 1984 .
Reagan knew that red ink from the sale of Social Security Trust Fund assets back to the Treasury would push his on - budget budget even deeper into the red .
He hiked FICA taxes to keep this from happening .
Ever since then , Congress has played kick the can .
We ai n’t seen nothin ’ yet !
The Conclusion concludes :
Medicare is a bigger challenge .
Its cost growth can be contained without sacrificing quality of care only if health care cost growth more generally is contained .
But despite the difficulties — indeed , because of the difficulties — it is essential that action be taken soon , particularly to control health care costs .
CONCLUSION
We are on board a replica of a 19th - century Mississippi paddle wheel steamboat .
Nostalgia is always popular .
The illusion of the good old days still sells .
The engine is chugging faster and faster .
The captain and crew decided long ago never to put the engine into reverse .
We are floating down the fiscal river of no return .
We are moving faster and faster .
Some of us can hear the falls ahead .
The sound gets louder and louder .
But our companions on board say , “ Let ’s party ! ”
They head for the dining room .
After that , they will head for the slot machines .
Americans respond favorably to these words : “ Free ” and “ all you can eat . ”
That is what politicians promise .
Either the falls will get us ( deflationary depression ) or else an explosion of the overheated engine will ( hyperinflation ) .
Our companions are still in the dining room or heading toward the slot machines .
You and I should begin to move toward the lifeboats .

HOW 3D BROADCASTS WORK
Each year brings fresh updates to the body of peak oil research but I thought the recent An Explanation of Oil Peaking , R.W. Bentley , University of Reading 2009 was particularly good reading .
Bentley does such a good job of explaining in direct terms a simple model for peak oil , without excluding any of the attendant complexity .
( This would be a very good introduction for someone new to the subject ) .
I especially liked his articulation of how the total production arc for , say a country or a region , is a sequence composed of the largest fields eventually giving way to many smaller fields .
That description made me think of the post - peak production profile of the United States , with its long - life extension at levels well below the 1971 peak .
And , it also brought to mind Mexico .
The chart you see here includes the latest updated production , provided just today by PEMEX .
Total crude oil for the month of December comes in at 2.590 mbpd .
This is a slight uptick to November ’s 2.553 mbpd .
Of course , the real story in the chart is that Mexico can never , and will never , get back to its peak year of 2004 .
The fact that the country ’s oil minister (s ) has been claiming it would , over the past five years , is actually kind of sad .
And if you read Bentley ’s paper you ’ll understand more fully the reasons why .
Now that Mexico has lost its largest oilfield , Cantarell , which did a fast crash over 3 - 4 years and is the central thrust behind the above chart it ’s now likely that Mexico ’s crude oil production will tail off at a gentler decline rate .
If Cantarell became inoperable for some reason then a new , fast leg down in supply would of course unfold .
But , barring such an occurrence my guess now would be that much of the acute phase of the decline is over .
Or , about to be over .
As Mexico moves into the chronic phase of its decline you will hear about new technologies , new discoveries , and increased production from some existing fields .
Perhaps Mexico will even change its constitution , and allow western exploration companies to enter with their engineers and high - tech equipment .
No doubt the Mexican government will claim , just like poorly written journalism here in the States often claims , that these developments have a chance to meaningfully lift production .
Again , the data shows that ’s simply not the case at all .
For the explanation , read Bentley .

' KILLEN you are magnificent , '' Robert Menzies is said to have telegrammed to James Killen , after the latter saved the government by winning his seat on official Communist Party preferences .
He had n't , actually , and Menzies did n't send a telegram - in truth , Killen made up the story .
But the moment has lived on in Australian political myth .
The 1961 win , in the teeth of a credit squeeze , gave the Coalition another 11 years .
Will Tony Abbott 's party room victory acquire the same status as Killen 's narrow win ?
A one - vote victory , with one informal ballot and one absent member , has elevated a man who appears to provoke fierce differences of opinion in the party , and a great deal of distrust among the general public .
Abbott has great skills and he may manage to unite the party with that most effective of adhesives , political success .
But should he fail , then the options for the party are dire - a double dissolution wipe - out of 12 - 20 House seats , the Greens hitting double figures in the Senate , and the tarring of the Coalition as a reactionary rump , failing to address the most pressing questions of modernity .
For those Liberal MHRs faced with losing their seat , the dilemma must be acute .
Most of them are in urban seats , where climate change scepticism is seen as sunstruck rural idiocy .
Like the pieds - noirs the French colonial troops sent to endless slaughter in World War I for an empire that was oppressing them , the urban Liberals will go to their political deaths on behalf of a conservative cabal whose loopy assessment of climate science - '' communism by other means ' ' - is really a rejection of the enlightenment notion of rational inquiry , upon which liberalism itself is based .
Whatever this split is about , it ai n't Malcolm Turnbull 's shortcomings as a leader .
The rupture in the Liberal Party may have made it unsustainable as a unit , suggesting that Menzies ' vision of a liberal party be best honoured by splitting , not preserving the party in its current form .
Afraid is better ( Image : Tsuneo Yamashita / Getty )
Even at the tender age of 3 , children who will go on to be convicted of a crime are less likely to learn to link fear with a certain noise than those who do n’t .
This may mean that an insensitivity to fear could be a driving force behind criminal behaviour .
Adult criminals tend to be fearless , but whether this characteristic emerges before or after they commit a crime was n’t clear , says Adrian Raine , a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia .
To find out , Raine and colleague Yu Gao turned to data from a 1970s study , collected as part of a decades - long project to understand the biological and environmental factors underlying mental illness .
Advertisement
Back then , researchers led by Raine ’s former research supervisor had measured the sweat response of about 1800 3 - year - olds in Mauritius when they were exposed to two different sounds .
One sound was always followed by a noisy blare , the other by nothing .
The children learned to anticipate which sound preceded the blare , and sweated in response to it – an indicator of fear .
Decades later , Raine ’s own team looked to see if any of the subjects had criminal records and found 137 that did .
The team discovered that , as toddlers , these people had sweated significantly less in anticipation of the blare compared with subjects of similar race , gender and background for whom no criminal record was found .
Reducing crime
“ I think it ’s a very interesting , potentially important finding , ” says Joseph Newman , a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin - Madison .
However , he cautions that the existence of early predictors of criminal behaviour does not mean that some children are born criminals .
“ There are many causes of crime , and there are many things that underlie fear conditioning , ” he says .
The differences in fear sensitivity are likely to be innate , at least in part : dysfunction in the amygdala , a brain area important for processing fear , has previously been linked to psychopathic behaviour , and genetic factors must underlie some of these differences .
However , numerous children who showed muted responses to fearful cues never fell foul of the law , Raine says .
“ Is this a throw - away - the - key approach to criminals ?
Absolutely not , ” he says .
Raine emphasises that environment can make someone less likely to commit a crime .
He points to other studies from his team , also based on data from Mauritius , which indicate that manipulating a child ’s surroundings with improved nutrition , more exercise and cognitive stimulation , can reduce the chance they will commit a crime later on in life .

By nearly every measure , average Americans lost ground in the ‘ Aughts . ’
They ’ve been losing ground — to the rich — for three full decades now .
Will the ‘ Teens ’ make that four ?
By Sam Pizzigati
Pawn shops always do well in recessions .
CEOs of pawn shops , at least these days , do even better .
At EZCorp , the Texas - based regional chain that runs over 670 pawn shops and payday loan storefronts , CEO Joseph Rotunda just picked up a 20 percent salary hike .
CEOs do better .
Can any three words more aptly sum up the decade we put to rest last week ?
For power suits , an uninterrupted string of windfall paychecks .
For everyone else , the insecurity of the worst economic times in over 70 years .
Actually , by one economic measure , the first decade of the 21st century turned out to be America ’s worst ever .
The stock market ended the “ Aughts ” with the poorest calendar decade performance record in U.S. investment history .
Adjusted for inflation , stocks lost an average of 3.3 percent a year during the ’00s .
Back during the 1930s , the previous worst - performing decade , stocks averaged an 1.8 percent annual gain .
If you have your retirement tied to a 401 ( k ) , you ’re already feeling the stock market woes — and reeling from them .
Most Americans working at major companies used to have pensions that tied checks to years worked .
You labored 35 years , you knew exactly what your pension check would be .
Most retirement plans today , by contrast , offer workers no such guarantee , only stock .
If share prices fall , you lose at retirement time .
Top executives do n’t .
The wheelers and dealers who populate America ’s executive suites enjoy preferential retirement treatment — via “ supplemental ” plans that shove pay dollars into “ deferred-compensation accounts . ”
These accounts let executives set aside — and defer from taxes — far more than the $ 16,500 maximum that ordinary workers can defer into 401 ( k ) s .
But these accounts go one giant step further .
They typically guarantee the executives who hold them a guaranteed investment return on their deferred dollars .
In 2008 , a Wall Street Journal report has just revealed , cable giant Comcast paid its top execs a way - above - market - rate 12 percent interest on the dollars they had parked away in their deferred - compensation accounts .
For Comcast VP Stephen Burke , that 12 percent guarantee generated $ 7.4 million .
And Comcast ’s 70,000 regular employees ?
Over the same period , their 401 ( k ) s , dependent on the vagaries of the stock market , dropped 28 percent in value , a collective loss of $ 649 million .
We do n’t have figures yet for 401 ( k ) losses in 2009 .
In 2008 , says the Boston College Center on Retirement Research , 401 ( k ) s overall fell at least $ 1 trillion .
A sizeable piece of that misfortune befell the 1.2 million workers in Wal - Mart ’s 401( k ) .
Their retirement nest - eggs took a 18 percent hit .
But Wal - Mart gave CEO H. Lee Scott Jr. a guaranteed 6.6 percent return on his supplemental retirement savings .
Scott ’s gain : $ 2.3 million .
Lee Scott almost perfectly personifies our just completed decade ’s CEO story .
He moved into the Wal - Mart chief executive slot right at the start of the ten years , in January 2000 , and retired last January 31 .
His predecessor , David Glass , averaged $ 4.5 million a year in the five years before Scott took over .
Scott , in his first four years as CEO , averaged $ 23 million .
In his last full year at Wal - Mart ’s summit , Scott took home $ 30.2 million , over 1,500 times the average $ 19,200 pay that went that year to Wal - Mart workers .
Our executive gravy train did n’t start , of course , in the Aughts .
The CEO pay spiral actually began turbo charging two decades earlier , in the early 1980s , a time when top execs were still averaging only 30 to 40 times more take - home than their workers .
Forbes , the business magazine , conveniently started keeping score of Corporate America ’s biggest windfall winners about that same exact time .
In 1982 , in the magazine ’s first annual list of America ’s 400 richest , Forbes reporters counted just 13 billionaires .
The current count : 359 .
The total top 400 today hold $ 1.27 trillion in wealth .
Since 1982 , the wealth of the Forbes top 400 has jumped an amazing 12 times faster than inflation .
How much of this good fortune has “ trickled down ” to average American families ?
Average American families with children , headed up by someone under age 50 , hold less net worth today , after inflation , than they held back in 1983 .
Journalist David Cay Johnston , in an analysis just published in the widely respected Tax Notes journal , is calling that finding — teased from data collected by Barry Bosworth and Rosanna Smart for the Brookings Institution — simply “ stunning . ”
How much longer will growing inequality in the United States continue to generate such stunning stats ?
Will the “ Teens ” turn our 30 years of rapidly growing inequality into 40 ?
Or will the Teens , like the Depression 1930s , set the stage for an explosion of equality that totally reinvigorates American life and labor ?
We ’ll see .
Washington ( CNN ) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned Thursday that a " new information curtain is descending across much of the world . "
In a speech on Internet freedom and security , Clinton also urged China to investigate a wave of cyber attacks against Google and other companies .
The Internet and other technologies are critical to foreign policy , and those who engage in cyber attacks should face international condemnation , she said .
" In an interconnected world , an attack on one nation 's networks can be an attack on all , " she said at The Newseum in Washington .
Clinton made the comments as search - engine giant Google threatened to shut down its operations in China , five years after agreeing to allow some censorship in exchange for the right to work in that country 's massive emerging technology market .
Google charges that Chinese hackers have targeted Google and up to 34 other companies .
The Chinese government argues that the Google case is a business dispute and should not affect overall relations between the two countries .
Clinton has said that Google 's allegations of censorship and online attacks by China raise " very serious concerns , " and her agency has said it will file a formal protest over the company 's complaints .
Also this month , foreign correspondents in at least two Chinese bureaus of news organizations had their Google e-mail accounts attacked , with e-mails forwarded to a mysterious address , according to the Foreign Correspondents ' Club of China .
Clinton warned that the latest information technology -- designed to open access to governments -- can also be used by some governments to " crush dissent and deny human rights . "
" In the last year , we 've seen a spike in threats to the free flow of information .
China , Tunisia and Uzbekistan have stepped up their censorship of the Internet , " she said .
" In Vietnam , access to popular social networking sites has suddenly disappeared .
And last Friday in Egypt , 30 bloggers and activists were detained . "
A member of that group , having since been freed , was in the audience , Clinton said .
" So while it is clear that the spread of these technologies is transforming our world , it is still unclear how that transformation will affect the human rights and welfare of much of the world 's population , " she said .
" The same networks that help organize movements for freedom also enable al Qaeda to spew hatred and incite violence against the innocent , " Clinton said .
Some governments also have " co-opted " the Internet to silence " people of faith , " Clinton said .
" Last year in Saudi Arabia , a man spent months in prison for blogging about Christianity , " she said .
Countries such as Vietnam and China have used similar tactics to " restrict access to religious information . "
The State Department will convene a high - level meeting next month of firms that provide network services for talks on Internet freedom , she said .
Citizens and businesses must be able to rely on the security of information networks , Clinton said .
" Our ability to bank online , use electronic commerce and safeguard billions of dollars in intellectual property are all at stake if we cannot rely on the security of information networks , " she said .
Referring to social and economic development , Clinton said the Internet can serve as a " great equalizer . "
By providing people with access to knowledge and potential markets , networks can create opportunity where none exist .
" Over the last year , I 've seen this first hand in Kenya , where farmers have seen their income grow by as much as 30 percent since they started using mobile banking technology , " Clinton said .
Information technology has been a great help in addressing the staggering problems in Haiti , she said , pointing to a young girl and two women who were pulled from the rubble after they sent a text message for help .
The text message campaign to raise money for Haiti has raised more than $ 25 million for recovery efforts , Clinton said .
Each texter was asked to donate $ 10 , and the State Department said Wednesday that it is believed to be the largest amount raised for the country through a mobile phone campaign .
CNN 's Jill Dougherty and Doug Gross contributed to this report .
Rogers , Canada 's only carrier with Android handsets , has cut off data to customers until they run a mandatory firmware update .
Nominally , this fixes a 911 bug : but it also prevents you from jailbreaking your phone and activating features and applications Rogers does n't like ( even if you paid full price for your phone ) .
But Rogers is only doing something about it now — namely , cutting data access of paying customers until they accept a mandatory firmware upgrade that not only fixes the 911 problem , but also contains ' extra ' features that prevent users from ever gaining root access to their phones — even non-subsidized ones .
And some phones are also getting bricked by this ' official ' update .
The moral : we really need to open up the competition here up North . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
It ’s not all in the mind -- the so - called placebo effect is real and reaches right down to the spine , German scientists said on Thursday .
A handful of pills in a file photo .

The finding may help in the hunt for better ways to tackle pain and other disorders .
Using modern imaging technology the researchers found that simply believing a pain treatment is effective actually dampens pain signaling in a region of the spinal cord called the dorsal horn , suggesting a powerful biological mechanism is at work .
“ It is deeply rooted in very , very early areas of the central nervous system .
That definitely speaks for a strong effect , ” lead researcher Falk Eippert of the University Medical Center Hamburg - Eppendorf told Reuters .
Eippert and colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging , or fMRI , to study changes in spinal cord activity .
They applied painful heat to the arms of 15 healthy men and compared the spinal cord responses when they thought they had been treated with either an anesthetic cream or a placebo .
Both creams , in fact , were inactive but the fMRI scans showed nerve activity was reduced significantly when subjects believed they were getting the anesthetic .
The ability of sham medicines with no active ingredient to produce real clinical benefits has long perplexed doctors and frustrated drugmakers .
Patients are typically given either an experimental drug or a dummy in clinical trials and the fact that those on placebo often get better , too , makes it hard to determine whether a new drug is working .
The placebo effect is particularly strong when treating central nervous system conditions , like depression and pain .
Traditionally , experts have viewed the effect as psychological , but the new German research is the latest in a growing body of evidence that there is an important physical component .
Just what turns down pain signaling in the spine when a placebo is given is unclear , although Eippert suspects a range of chemicals including natural opioids , noradrenaline and serotonin may be involved .
Writing in the journal Science , Eippert and colleagues said their work “ opens up new avenues for assessing the efficacy and possible site of action of new treatments for various forms of pain , including chronic pain . ”
The word placebo comes from the Latin for “ I shall please . ”

OPINION : Suspicion over Friday ’s train bomb is focused on militants from the strategic region , writes DANIEL McLAUGHLIN
THE SHOCK - WAVES from Friday night ’s bomb attack on the Moscow - St Petersburg express will be felt far beyond Russia ’s two main cities .
Twenty - five people were killed , almost 100 injured , and many more are still missing , feared dead , after the Nevsky Express was hurled from the rails in remote woodland as it sped north from Moscow to Russia ’s old imperial capital .
Investigators have found traces of explosives at the site , and another smaller device blew up on Saturday while rescue teams were still working on the wreckage of the train , which is the most luxurious of its type in Russia and regularly carries politicians and business executives .
No group has claimed responsibility for the atrocity , but suspicion is already focused on militants from the North Caucasus region , whose attacks on Russian targets are becoming more frequent and more audacious .
In the first nine months of this year , more than 420 people were killed in rebel attacks in the neighbouring republics of Chechnya , Ingushetia and Dagestan , four times the number killed in the same period last year .
This year ’s victims include senior police and army officers , local politicians and judges , and the militants came close to killing the Kremlin - appointed president of Ingushetia , Yunus - Bek Yevkurov , in a car bomb attack in June .
Chechnya , the main Caucasus battleground of the last decade , is arguably now calmer than Ingushetia and Dagestan , but security service personnel and rebels are now dying daily across the region in clashes that make a mockery of previous Kremlin claims to have full control over the republics .
After prematurely declaring anti-terrorist operations over this spring , Russian president Dmitry Medvedev admitted in this month ’s state - of - the - nation address that the situation in the Caucasus was the “ most serious domestic political problem for our country ” .
“ The level of corruption , violence , and clan dominance in North Caucasus republics is simply unprecedented , ” he said .
The candour of Medvedev ’s comments fuelled talk of an impending crackdown in the Caucasus , as did a sudden hardening of the mild - mannered lawyer ’s rhetoric .
He has called the rebels “ terrorist scum ” who must be eliminated “ without emotion or hesitation ” , words that called to mind the order of his predecessor , Vladimir Putin , that Chechnya ’s militants be killed wherever they are hiding , and even “ whacked in the outhouse ” .
Putin , now Russia ’s prime minister , made that demand 10 years ago , shortly after a series of devastating apartment bombings in Moscow and southern Russia killed more than 200 people in their homes .
The attacks spread fear throughout Russia and brought the insurgency on its southern , mountainous fringe into the “ heartland ” of the country , convincing people that Chechnya ’s separatists had to be crushed and that the tough - talking Putin was the man to do it .
The myriad unanswered questions about the apartment bombings prompted allegations they were carried out by Russia ’s security services to provide a pretext for a new Chechen war , which Putin was in the process of launching when the bombs exploded .
Several people who made such claims , or investigated the attacks , have been jailed or have died in mysterious circumstances , including agent - turned - whistleblower Alexander Litvinenko .
While there is no suggestion of state involvement in Friday ’s Nevsky Express explosion , it could have a similar impact to the apartment bombings of a decade ago .
Russia ’s most prestigious train was targeted because it carried some 700 passengers between the nation ’s biggest and most important cities , its political , economic and financial powerhouses , the home of its elite .
Putin and Medvedev both hail from St Petersburg , and they have brought many allies from their home town to rule with them in Moscow .
The Nevsky Express was a soft target that carried considerable symbolic weight for Russians , and its destruction will feed political and public calls for severe measures against those responsible .
Ultranationalist groups have been mentioned as possible suspects , but they have never launched an attack on this scale .
If , as expected , Caucasian rebels are ultimately blamed , then we may soon see Russian forces surging back into the region to crush them .
Earlier this month exiled Chechen rebel leader Akhmed Zakayev said Moscow was preparing to deploy an “ enormous ” number of troops to the North Caucasus , to establish an iron grip on the region before the nearby resort of Sochi hosts the 2014 Winter Olympics .
“ They want to solve the Caucasus problem before the Olympics and tell the world they have eliminated terrorism , ” he said .
“ This will also put the North Caucasus in their hands . ”
Renewed large - scale military operations in the region would be a disaster for its people , thousands of whom have died and disappeared in fighting between Islamic militants , clans , organised crime groups , separatist rebels , Russian security forces and local Kremlin - backed leaders whose militias are infamous for their brutality and corruption .
The Kremlin is determined to remain the dominant player in the Caucasus , which is a vital route for exports of oil and gas from the Caspian Sea and Central Asia .
Russia strengthened its hand considerably last year by crushing Georgia in a six - day war and by recognising the independence of two breakaway regions , Abkhazia and South Ossetia .
Georgians now fear Moscow will use trouble in the North Caucasus as a pretext to launch a new offensive , and senior Russian security officials recently accused Georgia of harbouring rebels in its remote Pankisi Gorge region , which borders Chechnya and Dagestan .
Another war between Russia and Georgia would further damage the latter ’s reputation as the West ’s most stable and solid partner in the Caucasus , and undermine its place at the centre of US and European Union efforts to create an energy pipeline network that bypasses Russia .
For Russians facing a renewed terror threat , the people of the Caucasus who fear a backlash , and western powers with major strategic interests in the region , the fate of the Nevsky Express may be a grim portent of even worse to come .
Auckland , New Zealand - based unorthodox death metal act Ulcerate was formed by guitarist Michael Hoggard and drummer Jamie Saint Merat in 2000 , with the aim of creating dark oppressive death metal .
This focus has since developed and metamorphosed into a far more dynamic approach with a fully realised sense of atmosphere and mood , while furthering their foray into the darker end of the genre ’s spectrum .
The band has remained DIY where possible , handling all facets of album production and visual design .

No , this is n't an April Fool 's prank .
According to both the LAT's Hero Complex and the Hollywood Reporter , Sam Mendes , the wonderfully cerebral and cultured filmmaker who once upon a time won an Oscar for " American Beauty , " is in discussions to make the new James Bond film , which could go into production as early as this June .
Daniel Craig would be onboard , reprising his role as Mr. 007 .
While I 'm also happy to see filmmakers practicing their craft , this is a bad decision in oh , so many ways , not to mention a depressing example of how hard it is for filmmakers to find any good studio material to work with .
Not that I 'm letting Mendes off the hook here .
His career has been in steep decline , both in terms of critical as well as commercial success .
In fact , if you look at the grosses on his five feature films , they form a graph that goes in only one direction -- straight down .
Mendes ' biggest - grossing film was " American Beauty , " his splashy Hollywood debut that made $ 130 million .
His second film , " Road to Perdition , " made $ 104 million .
His next , " Jarhead , " topped out at $ 62 million .
" Revolutionary Road " only grossed $ 22 million while his most recent film , last year 's road - trip comedy , " Away We Go , " struggled to earn $ 9.4 million .
Many critics would say the quality index on Mendes ' films has gone just as precipitously downhill , with " Revolutionary Road , " adapted from a brilliant Richard Yates cult novel , being an especially chilly , claustrophobic letdown .
It seems obvious that Mendes -- or more likely , his CAA agents -- decided it was time to grab hold of a commercial piece of material that could not only offer a payday but an opportunity to put up some respectable box - office numbers .
But a Bond movie is a Bond movie .
There 's really no way to put a personal stamp on a series whose fans demand all sorts of familiar fare , from buxom vixens to high - powered action scenes .
It 's almost by definition hack work , the equivalent of hiring Irving Penn to do a photo spread for the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue .
Even if Mendes does a solid , professional job , the resulting film will do little to change anyone 's perception of his commercial touch ( or lack of it ) .
I wish Mendes would go back to his roots and spend a year or two refreshing himself in the London theater , where he could work with great actors and regain some of his old bravado .
Great directors thrive on challenges .
When Martin Scorsese found himself in a rut years ago , he did n't look to Bond for salvation .
He rejuvenated himself with a low - budget thriller called " After Hours , " which led to " The Last Temptation of Christ " and " GoodFellas . "
When Darren Aronofsky flopped with " The Fountain , " he did n't beg Warners to let him direct a Harry Potter sequel .
He found just enough money to get " The Wrestler " made , which reminded everyone of his seemingly limitless filmmaking energy and intensity .
Say it ai n't so , Sam .
For someone of your talents , doing a James Bond movie is really the worst example of stooping to conquer .

Marketing influences game revenue three times more than high scores
High review scores improving sales is a " myth " says EEDAR research – it's all in the marketing budget
Matt Martin Monday 16th November 2009
Share this article Share
Research by EEDAR has shown that a high marketing spend increases gross revenue three times more than high review scores .
The perception that high scores are crucial to sales is a myth , said EEDAR 's Jesse Divnich speaking at the Montreal International Games Summit today , and developers should realise the cold fact that a poor quality game shipped with a big marketing spend will sell much better than a great game with little financial support behind it .
" You can make the greatest game and it wo n't even matter .
I know that 's discouraging to developers at first but it's very true , " Divnich told the audience .
" Marketing influences game revenue three times more than quality scores .
There 's a giant myth out there that reviews scores are the most crucial to a videogame .
The reason why that is is the information is readily available  we can go to Metacritic  and we see games like Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty succeed and we see they have a high quality score and we make that correlation .
But the truth is , marketing actually has much more of an influence to game sales than high scores . "
Looking at all games released between 2007 and the end of 2008 , and comparing as many different configurations as possible  single format exclusives , handheld releases , Xbox 360 , PS3 and Wii only  the research came to the same conclusion ; marketing is more important than game quality .
Nintendo DS titles came out the worst , " this basically means that review scores for the Nintendo DS do n't matter .
If you 're making a DS game do n't even bother on quality , just ask for a bunch of marketing dollars , " he said .
" This actually suggests to developers that if you can , sacrifice quality to get a higher marketing budget . "
For its first three months on sale , BioShock , which had $ 5.5 million in US marketing behind it , sold twice as many copies of EA 's Dead Space , which had a budget of $ 2 million .
The same results were found for EA Sports Active , which sold around 720,000 copies with a marketing budget of $ 5.6 million , compared to My Fitness Coach , which shifted an estimated 250,000 units backed with a $ 50,000 budget .
Divnich said that the research took in all variable costs and looked at whether the games drove more profits simply because they had more marketing spent on them .
" Looking at the gross margin , BioShock made $ 15 million more in the first three months than Dead Space , even when you take into consideration that Take - Two spent more money on marketing , " he detailed .
" EA Sports Active made $ 22 million more . "
However , Divnich admitted that publishers can't just rely on marketing to sell their game  it has to be targeted correctly to sell the product .
" There are times when marketing fails , you can spend so much money but it does n't matter .
Sony spent $ 150 million globally on the launch of the PlayStation 3 , " said Divnich before showing the PlayStation 3 baby commercial first shown in 2006 .
" They honestly thought they could release any type of commercial and it would sell .
It truly is a WTF moment in marketing history .
It creeped people out .
Sony got complacent , they were on top of the world and they thought they could say ' here 's the PS3 go out and buy it ' . "
" A lot of people want to blame the high price points for the PS3's failure , but I do n't think so , I blame the marketing , it impacted the success of the PS3 much more than the price . "
Divnich compared more recent PS3 commercials that accompanied this year 's price cut , and suggested these were more of a driver to sales for the console than a cheaper retail price .
" Sales went through the roof and a lot of people attributed that to the price drop .
I disagree , I actually think it 's the marketing .
It 's how you distribute that message to your consumers .
I truly believe Sony 's success in late 2009 had less to do with the price drop and more to do with how they delivered their message , " he offered .
" Unfortunately now you have the burden of knowledge , " he told the audience .
" You can work as hard as you want on your game to make it as high quality as possible , but if the marketing is not there it will fail .
" You know your target market better than anyone .
Most agencies that make videogame commercials come from outside the industry .
I honestly believe that more level designers and even low level programmers can make a better marketing plan than most marketing managers , " he concluded .
The two Democrats differed very little on the issues .
Mr. Locke , who is 61 , promised to crack down on crime and expand the police department .
Ms. Parker , 53 , said her experience as controller made her a better candidate to steer the city through the tough financial times it now faces .
The candidates also started slinging stones at one another in final weeks as it became clear neither had a huge advantage in the few polls conducted here .
Mr. Locke bashed Ms. Parker as “ soft on crime ” and suggested she favors tax increases .
She portrayed him as nothing more than a lobbyist for developers .
But the ugliest attacks came from a group of black pastors who spoke out against Ms. Parker for what they called her gay agenda and two separate anti-gay advocates who sent out fliers in the mail calling attention to her support from gay groups and to her relationship with her partner .
Mr. Locke denied having anything to do with the attacks , but two members of his finance committee gave $ 40,000 to help finance one of the mailings .

Some national gay - rights groups , meanwhile , came to the aid of Ms. Parker ’s campaign with money and volunteers to staff telephone banks in a get - out - the - vote effort and to urge her likely supporters to vote .
Political strategists said that to win , Mr. Locke needed to carry a large majority of the black vote , which is usually around a third of the turnout , and to attract significant support from conservative whites , many of them Republicans , who are also about a third of the voting mix here .
The crowd at Ms. Parker ’s speech included dozens of young gay men and lesbians who had volunteered on her campaign .
Many were elated with the sense of history being made .

Adding in the points awarded to our recent Propaganda Contest winners 60,000 frags added to the Killed Demomen score and 25,000 added to the Killed Soldier score the war currently stands neck - and - neck at 5,727,928 Killed Soldiers to 5,742,720 Killed Demos .
We need to stress to you that we have not gamed these numbers in any way :
After a solid week of gut - grinding combat and an astonishing 11,470,648 total kills , the Demomen and Soldiers are separated by a mere 14,792 points .
When we first hashed out the idea of a Soldier / Demo War , some of us were worried about the very real possibility of an embarrassing one - sided blowout .
The fact that we 're now just one day away from the war 's end and it 's still anybody 's game is genuinely cool .
In Update news , how about some weapon reveals ?
Do n't spend too much time discussing them in the forums , though .
This war is ALMOST OVER , and your class needs you .

Ruby Gets An Official Spec : Heading To Become An ISO International Standard
By Peter Cooper
It 's long been a bone of contention in the Ruby world that Ruby , as a programming language , does n't have an official spec ( though RubySpec has been a noble , community effort to build an executable specification for Ruby ) .
Now , though , there 's a draft , official Ruby specification available for you to check out - based on Ruby 1.8.7 ( which some are n't happy about ) .
From the announcement :
For wider and more application of Ruby language , " Ruby Standardization Working Group " has been established under Information - technology Promotion Agency , Japan ( IPA ) to define the specification of Ruby language on Oct. 2008 .
Since then the WG has been drafting the specification of Ruby language .
As the first draft of Ruby language specification has just recently completed , we 'd like to request users and developers of Ruby communities to review it .
By gathering review comments widely from you , we are going to improve the draft of Ruby language specification further .
Then we will propose the improved draft to Japanese Industrial Standards Committee ( JISC ) to be JIS .
After JIS for Ruby has been published , we will propose it to International Standardization Organization ( ISO / IEC JTC1 ) to be International Standard .
Why now ?
In a ruby - core thread about the forthcoming standard , Shugo Maeda spills the beans :
In addition , one of reasons why we need open standard for Ruby is that the basic guideline for the government procurement in Japan require it .
In that policy , we should refer to open standards instead of specific products for fair competition .
While the prospect of getting cushy government contracts is appealing to Japanese Rubyists , it could also start to play a role elsewhere as governments start to ride their own open standards / open source bandwagons .
Ultimately , this news is n't going to matter to the majority of Rubyists yet , but becoming an international standard will ultimately lend more legitimacy to a language that has been flagging in popularity lately .
If you want to jump right to checking out the standard ( available only as a PDF at the moment ) , click here .
Last week , we highlighted a scary county - by - county map that a commenter posted to #tips showing metastasizing unemployment growth .
Today , it occurred to us that we 'd seen a graphic like that somewhere before : A CDC map of obesity by county .
The left map is a snapshot of county - level unemployment rates from October 2008 ; darker counties have higher unemployment ( the time - lapse map we grabbed it from goes to October 2009 , at which point the whole country is basically black ) .
At the right is a CDC map released last month of obesity rates in 2007 — it 's the first county - level rendering of obesity data .
( You can click the maps to see a larger version . )
With the exception of the West Coast , it looks as though Ground Zero of the employment crash aligned fairly faithfully with the Obesity Belt : Appalachia , Michigan , the Deep South and the Southeast Atlantic Coast all shared early unemployment spikes and higher rates of obesity , while Texas , the Upper Midwest , and the plains states are thinner and have better job security .
He was instrumental in shining the light on one of Washington 's biggest scandals .
He made Jack Abramoff a household name .
But few know who he is .
Tom Rodgers preferred to operate strategically behind the scenes as he played a leading role in taking down the most notorious lobbyist on K Street .
But now , in an interview with The Hill , he has decided to go public with his story .
ADVERTISEMENT
" We watched this all unfold and we remained quiet , " he said .
" At that time , we were stereotyped as ignorant and greedy Indians .
But we knew different … we knew the time to tell this story was n't then . "
For years , speculation about the Abramoff whistleblower has focused on the supposed revenge of a former fiancee of Michael Scanlon , Abramoff 's right - hand man .
Others suspected Republican lobbyists jealous of the enormous fees Abramoff collected from Indian tribes .
But some of the very tribes Abramoff deceived and defrauded turned on him and worked to destroy him — with the help of Rodgers , a trusted fellow Native American familiar with the ways of Washington .
For nearly eight years Rodgers has remained cloaked in anonymity as the Justice Department pursued its case .
He watched and quietly celebrated with the tribal leaders who helped provide the inside information as the impact of the scandal spiraled .
It landed Abramoff and former Rep. Bob Ney ( R - Ohio ) in prison , helped force then - Majority Leader Tom DeLay ( R - Texas ) from office and played a key role in Democrats taking back the majority in the House and Senate in 2006 .
In the aftermath , Congress passed the most sweeping new ethics rules since Watergate .
Now Rodgers is speaking out .
With only a handful of remaining Abramoff associates facing trial or sentencing , Rodgers 's role was featured in a new documentary , " Casino Jack and the United States of Money , " which premiered at Sundance last Saturday .
The film will be shown in Washington , D.C. later this year .
In early January 2003 Rodgers was up past midnight , watching a recap of his beloved Pittsburgh Steelers playoff win when he got a fateful call that both startled and intrigued him .
" Tom , I was told I could trust you , " the voice on the phone said .
Rodgers listened intently as Bernie Sprague , the subchief of the Saginaw Chippewa of Mount Pleasant , Mich. , told him about his tribe 's disturbing interactions with Abramoff .
" Tom , we 're being threatened by our lobbyist , " Rodgers was told .
Rodgers responded , " What do you mean , threatened ? "
Sprague informed Rodgers that Abramoff was going to sue him because he was questioning the invoices and what he was doing to justify the millions of dollars in fees .
Sprague needed to know if Rodgers could help him .
Rodgers , a former Democratic staffer , faced a difficult choice of whether to meddle in the business of one of the most powerful Republican lobbyists .
Abramoff had many friends in the GOP - controlled administration and Congress .
Detractors kept their mouths shut or risked paying a heavy political and sometimes personal price .
ADVERTISEMENT
Now 49 , Rodgers is not your typical pinstriped , backslapping denizen of K Street with good Italian shoes .
He did n't hang out in Abramoff 's elite GOP power circles , so the two never met even though they both represented tribal clients .
Abramoff , however , was familiar with Rodgers 's reputation for operating above board .
In an e-mail to Scanlon that came out during the investigation , he even called Rodgers a " moron " for doing so .
At the time , Rodgers did n't know about Abramoff 's interest in him .
Now he finds it amusing .
Rodgers wanted to help out the tribal leaders who contacted him but was well - aware of the danger in doing so .
He gathered a small group of his trusted friends together , all of whom worked on Capitol Hill , and told them what he was about to do .
One cautioned him to be extremely careful and another explicitly warned him not to get involved .
" He said , ' Tommy , are you prepared to lose everything you have , everything you ever accumulated ? ' "
But after hearing some of the details about Abramoff 's schemes , threats and deception , Rodgers could n't turn away .
To him , the abuse evoked a dark period in the 1850s when unscrupulous Bureau of Indian Affairs ( BIA ) agents stationed on reservations to provide tribes with food and healthcare stirred hostilities .
" We wanted to do something that would better our democracy and help Native Americans , " Rodgers stated .
" We were facing people who were not Yankee bluecoats but arrived in double - breasted , custom suits . "
With the warnings in mind , Rodgers told only his friends and his family about what he planned to do and decided to hire a respected lawyer .
Houston attorney Philip Hilder had represented Sharon Watkins , the whistleblower in the Enron case .
Hilder cautioned Rodgers to lay low — or face the consequences .
" I judged him to be quite credible , but I also know the realities of Washington — that if he would have reared his head , it would have been decapitated , " Hilder says .
By the time Sprague contacted him , Rodgers was already tracking Abramoff 's colorful exploits through a running newspaper clip file that expanded in unpredictable ways .
Rodgers monitored Abramoff 's work for Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi and the South African apartheid government , his foray into Hollywood with an anti-communist film , " Red Scorpion , " and his purchase of a fleet of casino boats in Florida and the subsequent gangland Mafia murder of its former owner .
( Abramoff was convicted in 2006 for fraud and conspiracy in the purchase of the SunCruz fleet . )
" My grandfather , who was also French Indian , had a great saying … there 's too much s—t in that barn for there not to be a horse in there , " he said .
Rodgers 's early suspicions about Abramoff compounded after talking to Sprague and others , and his initial anger quickly turned to rage .
In the fall of 2002 , Rodgers got a call from Monica Quigley , a longtime friend and former attorney for the Saginaw Chippewa tribe .
She told Rodgers she had been fired from that position after questioning Abramoff 's invoices and legislative activities .
She then put Sprague in touch with Rodgers .
The Saginaw Chippewa had been sending $ 2 million checks to Scanlon 's public - relations group , Capitol Campaign Strategies , at 611 Pennsylvania Ave. SE , Suite 375 .
When Sprague told him Capitol Campaign Strategies ' address , Rodgers was immediately suspicious .
" I said there 's nothing up there but gas stations , bars and nail salons , " Rodgers recalled telling Sprague .
He drove to the address to take a photo of the place to send to Sprague .
What he found was a Mailboxes Etc .
" Suite 375 was seven inches high and 11 inches deep , " he said .
In the months and years that followed these exchanges , Rodgers worked with members of the Saginaw Chippewa tribe , the Alabama Coushatta and their cousins the Coushatta tribe of Louisiana to gather internal invoices and documents and slowly and strategically leak them to the media after first contacting the BIA .
" We were told [ by the BIA ] that it was an internal affair , " Rodgers recalled .
" I turned to [ Vice Chairman of the Louisiana Coushatta tribe David Sickey and Sprague ] on a conference call one night and said , ' Now we need to go another way .
We 've accumulated the data ; we have all the information we need .
We need to leak it . ' "
Aware that the national media tended to give scant attention to Native American issues , Rodgers first advised Sprague and Sickey to contact their local press , the Mt. Pleasant Morning News , the Lake Charles American Press and the Alexandria Town Talk .
After these initial local articles appeared , Rodgers said he sent 14 manila folders with a one - inch packet of the articles , invoices and other documents to several good - government groups , as well as the National Journal and The Washington Post 's Susan Schmidt , who would go on to win a Pulitzer Prize for her series on the Abramoff scandal .
He chose to contact Schmidt specifically because of a 1997 article she wrote about Democratic lobbyists overcharging Native American clients .
His ability to keep his identity secret for so many years is a testament to the insular world of Native Americans ; Rodgers is n't afraid to stand out in a crowd .
Usually clad in an all - black matching shirt and sport coat , his unusual combination of high cheekbones and deep - set green eyes illustrates his mixed Blackfoot Indian and Irish heritage .
His firm 's website is a virtual bulletin board for favorite inspirational quotes and poetry from leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Thomas Paine .
He sprinkles his conversation with some of these lofty , idealistic quotes , but can lighten the mood with a joke , accompanied with his high - pitched laugh .
Following years of silence , Rodgers seems relieved to finally be getting the experience off his chest .
During an hourlong interview , he often talked for 15 minutes straight without prompting and at one point teared up when talking about how he grew up in the small town of Glasgow , Mont. , spending summers on the Blackfoot reservation .
" My parents barely finished high school , but they instilled in us an incredible work ethic and a concern for others , " he said .
" We all went to graduate school and we truly escaped — and I use that word purposefully , escaped — the poverty of the Blackfoot reservation . "
Rodgers received his J.D. and master 's in taxation law at the University of Denver School of Law and then moved to Washington , working as a congressional staffer for Sen.

He recalls a rocky relationship with his father , who died from cancer two months ago .
The two did n't speak for 10 years after his father asked him to sign a document that contained a lie .
Rodgers refused ; his father complained that he cared too much about his reputation .
Rodgers says the altercation only made him more concerned about his reputation and even motivated him to take a stand when confronted by Abramoff 's abuses .
" The Cree words are my father 's unintended life lesson to me , " Rodgers wrote in an e-mail .
" O - tee - paym - soo - wuk : a person who owns himself . "
Rodgers is well - aware that critics will accuse him of taking Abramoff down in order to steal his clients or benefit Democrats , but he says his reasons are far more complex and deeply personal .
He was simply outraged over the abuse of Native Americans whose heritage he shares .
He insists that he would have spoken up if all the players were Democrats , and he never received a cent from the Louisiana Coushatta or the Saginaw Chippewa for his work — and has not taken them on as clients since .
" We did it when it mattered and we did n't do it for money or for fame , and the records bear that out , " he said .
" I did offer [ to pay him ] on separate occasions , and he has just said that he wants the best for the Coushattas and always makes the point that it's a labor of love , " Sickey said .
Shortly after the first Post stories appeared , Philip Hilder contacted the Justice Department 's public integrity unit and provided the same packet of material Rodgers had sent to media outlets .

Rodgers called up Pablo Carillo , the lead staffer on the committee 's investigation .
" How can I help you ? "
Rodgers remembers Carillo saying as he picked up the phone that day .
" Actually , I believe I can help you , " Rodgers responded , telling him about the invoices and documents he had amassed .
" How soon can you be here ? " Rodgers said Carillo responded .
During his initial work and the years that followed , Rodgers was silently amused by the mistaken attempts to unmask the Deep Throat of the Abramoff scandal .
" What 's important is that the tribes that were defrauded and cheated and abused did something about it , and we did it when it mattered , " he said .
He faults some Washington players who later write books about misdeeds they knew were going on at the time : " Well , then why did n't you do something then ? "
The tribal leaders say they could n't have drawn blood without Rodgers 's quiet but lethal under - the - radar strategy .
" We sustained our course and moved on it consistently , and that had a lot to do with Rodgers being the quarterback , " Sickey said .
" If Tom had n't been willing to help , I truthfully do n't think anything would have come of it , " Quigley added .
Emily Miller , Scanlon 's former fiancee , who for years was mistakenly blamed for being the original whistleblower , said she suspected that the real source was another lobbyist .
" I 'm surprised but thrilled to know that the moral outrage of a fellow Native American was Abramoff 's real downfall , " she said .
" Good for him . "
Rodgers decided it is the right time to reveal his role because the Abramoff scandal appears to be coming to a close .
Abramoff has served nearly four years , with two more to go .
He hopes the scandal will have a lasting impact but admits he has real concerns that something similar could happen again if Washington does n't enforce the ethics laws it spawned .
" One of my favorite lines is from the movie ' Wall Street , ' " Rodgers recalls , " when Hal Holbrook walks up to Charlie Sheen and says , ' Bud , money makes you do things you do n't want to do . ' "
Capturing Osama Bin Laden
Is the Last Thing That Americans Want
Where is bad guy Osama bin Laden ?
This question still takes the minds of US political and military elite .
US National Security Advisor James Jones believes that the prime suspect of 9/11 attacks is hiding in Pakistan .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates later said that the Pentagon did not have the information to confirm the statement , for terrorist No. 1 would have been caught otherwise .
Capturing Osama Bin Laden
Is the Last Thing That Americans Want
A special report from the US Senate said that the US military had a chance to capture Bin Laden alive , but they missed him during the first months of the Afghan campaign in 2001 .
Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and General Tommy Franks are said to be accountable for that mistake .
According to US intelligence , Bin Laden was hiding in Tora Bora caves in the east of Afghanistan .
US troops were prepared to storm the caves in December of 2001 , but suddenly canceled the operation following the orders from Rumsfeld and Franks , who later said that they should concentrate their efforts in other directions .
The authors of the report believe that Bin Laden and his associates used the opportunity to escape to Pakistan , where he can probably be staying still .
The officials , who prepared the report , referred to the information announced by Afghan Prime Minister Yusuf Gilani .
It is worthy of note that many US top officials believe that the prime suspect of 9/11 attacks masterminds resistance in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
If Bin Laden is eventually captured will there be peace in the troubled region ?
Valery Garbuzov , an expert with the Institute for the USA and Canada , said in an interview with Pravda .
Ru that many US politicians do believe that the capture of al - Qaeda ’s leader would help the situation in the region change for the better .
“ Other officials take a more reasonable and cautious approach to the issue , but they are convinced that Bin Laden must be seized since he poses a serious danger to the United States after the terror attacks in 2001 .
“ They believe that the attacks were prepared in Afghanistan – that ’s why they sent troops there to destroy terrorist camps not to let this happen again .
Washington intends to continue doing that in the war - torn nation .
However , US special services say that the number of al - Qaeda terrorists is not numerous at all - about a hundred of them is left as a result of eight years of struggle .
Therefore , the international terrorist network is not that dangerous anymore , ” the expert said .
Konstantin Sivkov , the vice president of the Academy for Geopolitical Sciences , stated that many of the gunmen , who fight against NATO troops in Afghanistan , are not related to al - Qaeda and Bin Laden .
The war in Afghanistan is no longer the war of the Taliban movement – it became national resistance against foreign invaders in the face of the USA and its allies .
Capturing Bin Laden is the last thing that the Americans want .
They only imitate activities at this point to show everyone that they are looking for him .
“ Let ’s start with saying that Bin Laden was created by American special services to struggle against the Soviet military contingent in Afghanistan .
It is a well - known fact .
In 2001 , Washington said that it was Osama who organized the terrorist acts .
The acts were then used as the reason to invade Afghanistan and Iraq .
Washington said that it would be struggling against terrorism there .
Therefore , if they capture or kill Bin Laden , they will ruin their arguments justifying the presence of NATO troops in the two countries .
“ If Bin Laden is killed , he will become a martyr for many Muslims , and they may decide to continue his deeds .
Furthermore , US officials believe that terrorist organizations , including al - Qaeda , may split into many uncontrollable groups and it would become even more difficult to struggle against them .
That is why there is nothing surprising about the fact that Rumsfeld and Franks canceled the storming of Tora Bora in 2001 , ” Mr. Sivkov said .

The federal government sent 2.5 million stimulus dollars to North Carolina ZIP codes that do n’t exist .
The information came from the government ’s own Web site — Recovery.gov .
The site was set up to track the distribution of the $ 787 billion made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
It lists 479 North Carolina ZIP codes as the destination of $ 4.2 billion in grants , contracts , and loans .
Four of those ZIP codes — 24858 , 28389 , 23854 , and 27600 — are nowhere to be found on U.S. Postal Service maps .
In the four ZIP codes , the Web site reports , the $ 2.5 million created 0.5 jobs all told .
All North Carolina ZIP codes start with 27 or 28 , so projects listed in 24858 and 23854 ZIP codes would not be based in North Carolina , even if such ZIP codes existed .
The Philadelphia - based Franklin Center for Government & Public Integrity reported last week that the federal government ’s Web site had assigned $ 375 million in stimulus spending nationally to 440 nonexistent ZIP codes .
In December , the Franklin Center found that nearly $ 6.4 billion in stimulus spending had been attributed to 440 phony congressional districts .
Deputy Press Secretary for the Recovery Act Jim Gilio said the illegitimate ZIP codes were probably innocent mistakes .
He said the list was compiled based on information reported by recipients of the funding , and that they most likely made data entry errors .
“ There ’s really no story here , ” he said in a telephone interview .
“ Every project was real .
There ’s never been a question about whether a real recipient received the money . ”
Gilio suggested searching by dollar amount rather than by ZIP code .
While the “ funds by ZIP code ” page is based on recipient - reported data , the “ funds by amount ” page is based on agency - reported data .
He demonstrated that the $ 34,096 figure , which corresponded with the phony 24858 ZIP , could be found on the agency - reported data page along with the correct ZIP code , 27834 , and the correct recipient , East Carolina University .
Using the same method for 28389 , the $ 63,000 award went to ZIP code 28226 , and that the recipient was Uplift Cosmetic Surgery Laser and Skin Center .
The award created zero new jobs .
And yet it ’s not possible to use Recovery .
gov ’s “ search by amount ” method to learn how the $ 2.1 million assigned to 23854 or the $ 367,472 for 27600 were spent .
That leaves nearly $ 2.4 million unaccounted for on the federal Web site .
Ed Pound , spokesman for the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board , told Watchdog.org , a transparency Web site from the Franklin Center , that the bogus ZIP Codes are “ nonsense ” and “ much ado about nothing . ”
“ This is simply human error , ” he said to Watchdog.org .
“ Just because recipients inverted ZIP Codes ( at the place of performance ) does not mean that the money is going to some phantom place . ”
For North Carolina ’s projects , that explanation does not add up .
The U.S. Postal Service ’s ZIP Code Lookup site does not recognize ZIP codes 28458 , 26700 , 28354 , and 28839 — ZIP codes that result by transposing the second and third digits on the bogus ZIP codes reported on Recovery .gov .
Gilio said the recovery board ’s goal is to make the Web site “ better each time we update it and to correct mistakes whenever we see them . ”
The site was last updated in October 2009 .
To date , the faulty ZIP codes have not been corrected .

This method would work with other heavily declined languages as well .
The thought occurred to me the other day that when explaining declension in Lithuanian , there really is no need to explain it using sentences that are written completely in Lithuanian , as this may tend to confuse the learner who is forced to take everything on in one go ( verb conjugation , unfamiliar words , declension , different word order , everything ) .
So when teaching declension why not just write out sentences almost entirely in English ( or whatever the mother tongue of the student happens to be ) , with only the words being used to show declension in Lithuanian ?
To demonstrate this , I 've taken each of the words in the Lithuanian declension page from Wikipedia used to show how all five declensions work , and have created a short story or conversation using each and every form in both singular and plural , at least once .
I 've also done my best to make them as memorable as possible , as imparting the information in a specific story may make it easier to retain than just one dry sentence after another .
I 've just finished writing it out so there may still be a typo or two , and hopefully lyzazel will take a look at it .
Also note that this is more of a memorization exercise than a perfect demonstration of cases in Lithuanian , so not all instances will match up to their Lithuanian equivalents .
The next " level " after this would be declination of adjectives as well , but adjectives are much easier so the stories for those should n't take very long to create .

Into the room walked a vaik .
This was the third vaikbecause there were already two vaikon the other side of the room .
The vaikface looked worried , while the other two vaikfaces looked quite calm at first .
On the one vaikwas very little money , while on the two vaikin the room there was quite a bit ; they were from a rich family .
The two vaikcalled to the one vaik .
" Vaik , what are you doing here ? "
The one vaikresponded to the two vaik : " Vaik , I am here because your father sent me . "
What ?
The two vaikfather sent a new vaikto join them ?
Did he not love the two vaikhe already had ?
What was he attempting to do with this vaik ?
The new vaikthought to himself : " Use them , vaik .
You may not like them but with these vaikand their family you may be able to accomplish great things ...
" Once upon a time there were three broli .
The middle brolsaid to the eldest brol : " Brol , I am bored of our life here in this small village .
Let us set out to the city to see what opportunity awaits us . "
The eldest broliface lit up as he had always wanted to make a name for himself .
But the youngest brolsaid to them , " Broli , I still have one year left of school here .
Let us wait just a bit longer . "
The other two brolifaces showed disappointment but they knew their little brolwas right .
On the eldest brolwas a sword , and he went out back to practice it some more for when the time came .
Meanwhile , on the two younger and weaker brolwere books , and they took them out to study by the firelight in the house .
But while they had a year to wait , to all three brolcame a kind of hope .
It was very likely that next year someone would hire the eldest brolto become a soldier , and certainly someone would hire the two younger and intelligent brolas scribes .
In the beginning they would probably need to use the eldest brolto pay the bills , but eventually they would all become three great brolA : " What 's your favourite animal ? " B : " Well , I 'm not sure but I think I like that arklover there .
" A : " That one ?
In general arklusually like humans , but that one arkldoes n't like people at all .
" B : " But I used to have two arklback home that looked like that one and they were both very nice .
Here , let me try calling him .
Arkl ! .... " A : " Told you , he does n't like people .
With that arklyou wo n't even get over that ridge , let alone the next town .
" B : " Well , have you even tried sitting on the arkl ?
That arklibody looks like it was made for people to ride .
" A : " I do n't know .
It looks to me like pretty much all arklbodies are made for that .
You might know arklbetter than I do .
" B : " I think I do .
I used to give carrots to my two arklback home .
My guess is that this arkllikes them .
Here , let 's try giving this arkla carrot or two .
" A : " So how far did you ride before using your two arkl ?
" B : " Pretty far .
I would always have a big saddle with lots of equipment on my two arkl , and they enjoyed the ride .
I would even take them together with a friend of mine sometimes .
Just tell them arkl , to the city !
and off they 'd go .
" There are many types of motinin the animal kingdom , and indeed the human motinis actually quite similar to them .
On the human motinis the same instrument for producing milk that one finds on other motinamong mammals .
It 's true that other mammals get stronger quickly by means of their motin , but a human baby will still develop quite a bit over time relying on its motintoo .
Of course , there are also large differences .
The human motinbody is only made to have a single baby every few years , while the bodies of cat motinare capable of giving birth to many kittens at a time .
Also , I 'm not sure if my kitten remembers his motinor not , but humans continue to talk with and see their motineven after they grow up .
My friend still says " motin ! " whenever he sees his motin .
And so to the human motinand all the motinin the animal kingdom we say to them " Motin , good job !
" A : " Look , there 's a katon the street !
Let 's call it and see if it comes over .
" B : " Here katkatkat ... " A : " No luck , he ran away .
I hear there are a lot of katin this neighborhood .
" B : " There are .
My sister always gives food to all the katthat live here , and sometimes pets those kattoo .
" A : " Yeah , I was hoping we could pet that kattoo .
" B : " Well , it takes time .
A katpersonality is n't like that of a dog .
You ca n't just go to where there 's a group of katand say " Hey kat ! " and expect them to come over .
A : " So what about the kittens of these kač ? " B : " Their mothers usually take care of them .
I gave some food to a katon the street the other day and it turned out that she was the mother and carried the food all the way back to them .
" A : " I saw a katthe other day on the street - on that katwas a moustache that made it look like Hitler .
" B : " You should have taken a picture .
If there is a moustache on those katthey 're called " Kitlers " and with those katyou can get pretty famous online if it 's funny enough .
" A : " Note to self - take picture of kat , use katto get famous ...
" In that house there is a husband and pat , newly married .
It 's not just your average couple though , because the pačhusband is overly attached to her , and another man secretly loves his pač .
On the pačis a wedding ring that she wears out of obligation , as opposed to on other pačwho wear their wedding rings out of love and joy .
She became a pača few years back , around the same time that most of her other friends became pačtoo .
Those pačhusbands are generally pretty average people , and they are fairly happy pač .
When those husbands proposed and gave rings to their pačthey were very happy , while when this husband gave his ring to his pačshe was secretly unhappy but accepted it nevertheless out of pity .
This couple sees the other husbands and pačon the weekend sometimes , though this patwould rather spend the weekend alone .
After the couples return home the husbands say " pat ( or pač ) , did you have a good time ? " and the answer is usually yes .
But the one pačanswer is often no .
The lesson here : pač , be careful about making such decisions lightly !
Vagare very popular in role - playing games .
Using a vaga team of players can get into areas they never could before without him .
On your average vagis a set of lock - picking tools , and on many other vagare tools that let them disguise themselves as completely different people .
A vagpersonality is also very interesting , as they are less altruistic than other characters .
The moral character of these vagcan even be slanted towards evil .
Using these vagin an adventure is also very exciting - you never know when you are going to hear " Hey , vag , stop !
Somebody catch that vag ! "
If there is a vagin a bar and you want to approach that vagto join your team , it 's best to think of what you have that the vagwould want .
It 's also good to remember that too many vagcan be a bad thing .
In full out combat it 's easy for monsters to injure those vagas they are individually quite weak , and if you are a group of vagyou 're going to always have officials telling their guards " Go to those vagand arrest them all ; they 're criminals so we 'll take them out in one fell swoop . "
You certainly do n't want an adventure to end with the words " Vag , for the good of the state I hereby sentence you to death !
" A : " You know what 's interesting ?
My akcolour is a kind of weird green .
" B : " Do n't you mean your akcolour ?
You have more than one , you know .
" A : " Oh yeah .
I was just reading about the Cyclops in Greek mythology so maybe that 's what did it .
The Cyclops did pretty well just using one ak .
" B : " Sure , and many other animals use more than two akas well so they would look at our two akand think them to be pretty weird .
Exactly the same way that we look at the one akof the Cyclops and wonder how he lived with that .
" A : " The akis pretty varied when you think about it .
The akof birds are capable of seeing ultraviolet as well .B : " And even on your average akyou do n't even find the same components either .
On the akof insects you find a weird kind of honeycomb - type shape .
" A : " Yeah , those akare pretty weird .
Well , to my akthey look weird , that is .
" B : " And to the akof the Cyclops your aklook weird too .
" A : " I suppose so .
I wish I could use other aksometimes .
I 'd look at one of them and say " Ak , come here !
Time to try you out . "
" B : " Talking to inanimate objects already I see .
I bet when you get older you 'll say things like " Ak , do n't fail me now ! " when you 're alone .
" Sūnplay an important role in mythology , history and popular culture .
Alexander the Great 's father once famously said to his sūn : " Sūn , ask for thyself another kingdom , for that which I leave is too small for thee . "
There is of course also the story of the prodigal sūnfrom the Bible .
Daedalus had a sūnnamed Icarus , and on his sūnwere the wings of feathers and wax he used to try to escape but flew too close to the sun .
His sūnambition was too great and he ended up perishing in the ocean .
Worf in Star Trek : the Next Generation is one of two sūnof Mogh .
Mogh 's sūngoal was to regain their family honour .
Though Mogh perished honorably in battle , he was accused of being a traitor after death and he surely would have liked to say to his sūn : " Sūn , I did not betray the two of you ; I died defending the Empire . " if he could .
Eventually though they were able to expose the plot that made their father look like a traitor and they became sūnwith honour again .
Romulus and Remus from Roman mythology are also interesting .
The river deity Tiberinus took these two sūnand kept them safe .
Some say that later on one day there was a shovel on the first sūnRomulus , with which he killed his brother and became the sūnfor which the city was named .
Other accounts say though that Romulus did n't kill his brother and that in these two sūnwas only love for each other .
" Profesor , come in . " said Sherlock Holmes .
In walked the profesor , who seemed quite nervous at being in the presence of the legendary detective .
On the profesorwas a gold pocket watch , which Holmes expertly noted as he intently watched the profesor .
Nervous , he began to speak .
" I became a profesorjust five years ago , and am thus still new and do not know the other eight profesoriI work with as well as I should , though I engage in research daily with those those profesor .
It really is quite the closed society and one cannot simply say " profesor , I am one of your circle now and should be privy to your secrets " just by having the same academic degree .
In fact , on those profesoris a certain seal that they own but I do not , and I have never been able to ascertain what sort of meaning it has to those profesor .
I did approach one profesorone day to ask , but he pretended as if I had never asked in the first place . "
There was silence , and finally Holmes spoke .
" Nine profesorin one faculty , very interesting .
There is a reason why they did not speak to you of the matter - those profesorgroup is one only known to a few and never has more than eight members .
But we can discern something about the group nevertheless .
Tell me about the profesorcountenance at the time , the one you dared to ask about the group that day ... " Vandis common in most places on Earth , and humans as well as animals usually need to drink vandevery day .
There are many types of vand , and using these various types of vand - for example vandfrom the sea , or vandfrom rivers , humans can do more than just drink .
Humans take these vandand use them for scientific research as well .
For these vandone needs a type of self - sustaining ecosystem , otherwise it would all disappear .
For the vandin a river for example you need a mountain to provide a source .
In these various vandyou can find humans doing different things , like bathing or exploring or even using those vandfeatures as weapons of war .
In the fantasy desert world of Dark Sun , certain priests even worship these vand , saying things like " O vandof the past , please return and restore the green age that once was !
I ask you to come forth now , rain vand ! "
Vandappearance to the people of that world is a very welcome one , as they do not even have enough of it to bathe in vandas people from other worlds can .
A : " So I heard you 're the only boy in the house and have two ses .
" B : " That 's right .
The first sesof mine was born before me , and two years after I was born we had the second so there are two sesin total .
" A : " What is your first sespersonality like ?
" B : " She 's pretty responsible and feels almost like a mom so I do n't even call her by her name , just ses .
" A : " And is the personality of both sesthe same ? " B : " No , she 's completely different .
I watch my second sesand think just how little she resembles the first .
" A : " Do you talk to your sesa lot ? " B : " Sure , but I talk to my second sesmore .
She 's become a really nice sesto me .
Well , both of them have become nice sesof course , but the second is easier to talk to .
" A : " I noticed a new ring on your first sesthe other day .
" B : " Yeah , I 've seen a lot of jewelry on both my sesfairly recently .
I think they both have boyfriends or are just trying to show off .
I sometimes ask them " Hey ses , what 's up with all the jewelry ? " but they never tell me of course .
My sesare pretty secretive .
" There are a lot of duktof famous and powerful people throughout the world .
The president of Uzbekistan has a duktthat is quite powerful and is often said to be interested in running the country after his death .
Chelsea Clinton is the duktof Bill and Hillary Clinton , and she became a much more well - known duktduring the election campaign in 2008 .
On these duktis often found a type of dilemma where they have to balance being so famous with trying to live a normal life .
A duktpersonality is largely shaped by the culture in which she grows up .
Many countries still try to avoid having dukt , and this often results in these duktbecoming duktthat work extra hard to impress their family .
These duktambitions often know no bounds , and this ambition is especially found in the duktof a family with no other children , as this child wants to become a duktthat the whole family can be proud of .
To these duktI say " Dukt , you are absolutely correct ! "
It is actually a blessing in disguise for a duktlike this to be given such responsibility , as it is far better than a life without ambition .
So do not despair , dukt , your life is what you make it .
Instead of publishing my personal resolutions for 2010 , I thought I 'd fill you in on what Modative has in store for 2010 .
1. Integrated Project Delivery
Here at Modative , we 're never mistaken for traditionalists .
I 'm not just talking about our architectural style , but the way we do everything .
This is why we are committed to further moving away from the traditional design - bid - build process into integrated project delivery .
We feel that this new way of delivering projects to our clients not only distinguishes us from the competition , but makes the process easier on our clients , contractors and even us .
And since we 're not looking to procrastinate on our 2010 resolutions , we 've already added a section on Integrated Project Delivery to our website so you can see what it 's all about .
2. Beyond Architecture
In more and more of our projects , clients have been asking us to go beyond our core architecture services to provide them with many of the other things that go into getting a project built .
Why ?
Because coordinating with one person ( Modative ) is much easier than coordinating with ten different consultants .
We also prefer this one - stop - shop service because it further enables us to deliver the finished project as envisioned .
A glimpse of what we can provide can be found on our services beyond architecture page .
3. Modative Build
When we founded Modative , one of our primary company goals was so important to us that we put it on our business cards .
Instead of " Architecture " , we used the tag line " Design , Develop , Build . "
And while we have assisted with development decisions on the Venice Boulevard Urban Dwellings and Fay Avenue Art District Dwellings , we have n't yet acted as the contractor on one of our projects .
That will soon change as I 'm proud to announce that Modative Build will be launching this year .
4. Small Lot Subdivision
When I tell people I 'm an architect , they often ask , " So , do you do houses or ( commercial ) buildings " .
" Both " I answer .
Our firm has always kept our project types diverse : a fairly even split between residential and commercial .
And within the residential category , there has been a healthy mix of single - family and multi-family projects .
However , if there 's one project type that we 've done more than any other , it 's clearly Small Lot Subdivision , which is really a hybrid between homes and condos .
We 've continued to pursue and take on these Small Lot Projects because we believe in them as the future of residential development in Los Angeles ( and a lot of other places ) .
To show our further commitment to this unique project type , we 've expanded our Small Lot Subdivision online presence with a new Small Lot Subdivision Blog and a free guide on the basics of developing Small Lot Subdivision Projects in Los Angeles .

NASA wo n’t meet Congressional orders to track most city - smashing - sized asteroids in Earth ’s neighborhood by 2020 , an expert panel concluded Friday , because the government did n’t provide the money to detect such Near - Earth Objects .
“ because for the past 5 years the administration requested no funds , and the Congress appropriated none , for this purpose . ” ( blogs.usatoday.com/sciencefair )
This issue is not a possibility , its a probability .
Sooner or later Earth will be hit by another asteroid that will cause massive amounts of damage .
Bundle up all the things Washington protects us from into one giant cataclysmic ball and it still would n’t equal the damage a large asteroid will do .
The mistake is that asteroids are still legal .
If asteroids were illegal then there would be ample funding to track and destroy them .
To that end , please help spread one of these rumors about asteroids –
What can Star Wars teach us about war ?
Political bloggers can't help but look at the original trilogy through the lens of real - world counter insurgency tactics , leading them to wonder if the Rebel Alliance was fighting the wrong battles .

The conversation started with an email from the Center for a New American Security 's Abu Muqawama 's brother :
Why did n't the Rebel Alliance pursue a strategy of insurgency in their rebellion against the Galactic Empire ?
I would argue that they pursued a strategy of conventional war against the Empire and forwent every aspect of insurgent strategy and tactics .
They finally came around a bit in the end by co-opting the Ewoks onto their side .
Why had n't they pursued that strategy on a larger scale ?
Instead , they simply staged two conventional assualts on the Empire 's center of gravity : the Death Star .
Although both attempts were successful , I think they got lucky .

Democracy Arsenal 's Patrick Barry is n't convinced :
[ G] iven the intergalactic nature of the war between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance , [ is ] a classic insurgency is even possible ?
If one of the insurgent 's biggest advantages is his knowledge of the local environment , and the tacit support of the inhabitants of that environment , then is n't that advantage pretty much negated in the vacuum of space ?
I imagine that the space - based nature of war in the Star Wars universe constrained the Alliance 's strategic options , perhaps significantly .
I suspect that the rebels were pursuing the best set of tactics available to them - waging asymmetric war against the Empire 's vulnerable conventional military assets .

Think Progress ' Matthew Yglesias , meanwhile , takes the argument one step further :
To say that the Rebel Alliance " simply staged two conventional assaults on the Empire 's center of gravity : the Death Star " is , I think , to misconstrue the situation .
What 's going on is that nobody on either side of the war seriously disputes the notion that " fear will keep the local systems in line .
Fear of this battlestation . " ...
Once it 's clear that the Empire can destroy planets wholesale , the rebels are in agreement with Tarkin and the Emperor that sufficient firepower , deployed without conscience , can , in fact , win the war .
Thus , the rebels only hope for staving off defeat is a bold attack on the Death Star itself .
As Exum 's correspondent notes , " they got lucky " in terms of destroying the Death Star so it made perfect sense for the Emperor to simply respond by trying to build a new one .
Here , again , both sides agree that a fully operational Death Star can end the war , so again the rebels need to mount a somewhat desperate attack .
And they win !
But the lesson here is n't that the rebels are being irrationally conventional ; the lesson is that there are limits to the logic of counterinsurgency doctrine .
Overwhelming force and brutality really can be applied to good effect if you 're really willing to unleash it in an evil way .

US : White House seeks to block new environmental regulations on coal ash
By Hiram Lee
12 January 2010
The Obama administration is attempting to block new regulations proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) that would designate coal ash as toxic waste .
The EPA presented their proposals to the Office of Management and Budget ( OMB ) — an office within the executive branch of the government — for review in September , with plans to release a report by the end of 2009 .
The EPA proposal has been stalled by the OMB , however , and no report has yet been issued .
Up to 130 million tons of coal ash , the waste product created during coal combustion , are produced each year in the US , with approximately 40 percent of it going for use in other products such as asphalt or concrete .
Sixty percent of the ash is stored in landfills or ash “ ponds ” throughout the country .
Exposure to coal ash through contaminated water supplies presents a significant health risk .
The waste product contains toxic contaminants such as arsenic , mercury , lead and barium , which can lead to cancer , birth defects or disorders of the nervous system .
There are currently no uniform , federal standards in place governing the building or maintenance of coal ash containment facilities .
In addition to treating coal ash as toxic waste in its proposal , the EPA has also named three industries — chemical manufacturing ; petroleum and coal products manufacturing ; and the electric power generation , transmission , and distribution industry — that could potentially face financial responsibility requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation and Liability Act .
Should CERCLA be amended to include these industries , it would force the companies involved to be financially responsible for the cleanup of any environmental contamination they may have caused .
The industries potentially affected by the new EPA proposals have protested , saying a ruling by the federal government on coal ash would present them with a logistical nightmare and billions of dollars in new costs to provide sound management of their waste .
The role of the Obama administration has been to prevent the EPA proposal from moving forward , acting on behalf of the coal and energy companies .
Should the proposal be allowed to go through , it will only be after the administration has worked with the energy conglomerates to revise it in such as way as to arrange the most favorable financial conditions possible for the companies .
A number of commentators have pointed to the unusual and suspicious nature of the OMB ’s aggressive involvement , particularly at this early stage in the EPA ’s push for new regulations .
Cass Sunstein , administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs , located within the OMB , has held some 20 meetings since October 2009 with coal industry representatives to discuss their concerns .
The Electric Power Research Institute of Palo Alto , California , has warned the OMB during these talks that new regulations placed on coal ash could cost utility companies up to $ 10 billion in revenue per year and that the costs of providing new means of storing the ash could lead to higher prices for customers .
Energy companies are all the more eager to protect themselves from the new regulations because the publication of an EPA report on the matter would open up the practices of the energy industries to public review and congressional hearings .
The negligence of these companies in the management of their toxic waste has produced significant consequences for the environment and the US population .
Among the more publicized disasters involving coal ash pollution was a major containment failure that occurred in Kingston , Tennessee , in December 2008 .
One billion gallons of wet coal ash were released into the environment when the wall of a containment pond owned by the Kingston Fossil Plant was breached .
Some 5.4 million cubic yards of land were covered in the toxic sludge and dozens of homes were damaged .
The nearby Emory River was contaminated .
Tests of the river subsequently showed an elevated presence of lead and thallium .
Clean - up of the disaster is expected to last through 2013 .
The Tennessee Valley Authority , which controls the Kingston Fossil Plant and is also leading the clean - up efforts , currently faces several lawsuits by residents affected by the spill .
The health problems described by victims in the spill ’s aftermath have included nosebleeds , complications with asthma , headaches , shortness of breath and chest pains .
A June 2009 report by the EPA found 49 coal combustion residue management facilities that currently have a “ high hazard potential ” rating .
These include 11 facilities owned by American Electric Power in Ohio , West Virginia , Indiana and Kentucky ; 10 facilities in North Carolina owned by Duke Energy ; and 5 facilities in Kentucky owned by Kentucky Utilities .
There are 548 coal ash “ ponds ” in the US in all .
Indiana contains the most , with 53 , and Kentucky is second with 44 .
The Obama administration 's efforts to block the new EPA regulations are in line with its general economic policies .
No measures can be put in place that would in any way diminish corporate profits .
Roger S. Clark , who teaches at the Rutgers School of Law in Camden , N.J. , and was one of the leaders of the movement to have the institute condemn the death penalty outright , said he was satisfied with the compromise .
“ Capital punishment is going to be around for a while , ” Professor Clark said .
“ What this does is pull the plug on the whole intellectual underpinnings for it . ”
The framework the institute developed in 1962 was an effort to make the death penalty less arbitrary .
It proposed limiting capital crimes to murder and narrowing the categories of people eligible for the punishment .
Most important , it gave juries a framework to decide whom to put to death , asking them to balance aggravating factors against mitigating ones .
The move to combat arbitrariness without giving up sensitivity to individual circumstances is known as “ guided discretion , ” which sounds good until you notice that it is a phrase at war with itself .
The Supreme Court ’s capital justice jurisprudence since 1976 has only complicated things .
Justice Harry A. Blackmun conceded in 1987 that “ there perhaps is an inherent tension between the discretion accorded capital sentencing juries and the guidance for use of that discretion that is constitutionally required . ”
That was an understatement , Justice Antonin Scalia said in 1990 .
“ To acknowledge that ‘ there perhaps is an inherent tension , ’ ” he wrote , “ is rather like saying that there was perhaps an inherent tension between the Allies and the Axis powers in World War II . ”
Justice Scalia solved the problem by vowing never to throw out a death sentence on the ground that the sentencer ’s discretion had been unconstitutionally restricted .
In 1994 , Justice Blackmun came around to the view that “ guided discretion ” amounted to “ irreconcilable constitutional commands . ”
But he drew a different conclusion than Justice Scalia had from the same premise , saying that “ the death penalty cannot be administered in accord with our Constitution . ”
He said he would no longer “ tinker with the machinery of death . ”
The institute came to essentially the same conclusion .
Tattooing children under 18 is a crime under Georgia state law
A man and woman in the US state of Georgia are facing child cruelty charges after using a homemade device to tattoo six of their children .
Patty " Jo Jo " Marsh and Jacob Edward Bartels allegedly used a plastic pen fitted with a piece of guitar string to mark the children , aged 10 to 17 .
Unlicensed tattooists and the tattooing of minors are illegal in Georgia .
Ms Marsh told local media she had not done anything wrong and that the children had asked for the tattoos .
" I 'm not breaking the skin .
It 's going to fade away , it 's like a pen mark , " she told reporters .
The children were marked with small black crosses on the skin between their thumb and index finger .
One was also tattooed with the words " Mama & Dad " .
Chattooga County Sheriff John Everett said the couple had been reported by the biological mother of some of the children , who noticed the ink marks could not be wiped off .
" We 've never seen anything , or heard of anything like this , in the surrounding counties , or anywhere , " he told the WHEC news website , adding that police believe the same improvised needle was used for all the children .
Mr Bartels and Ms Marsh were released on bail by police , but Ms Marsh said she could not understand the public 's reaction .
" I love my children , we 'd never do anything to harm our kids , " WHEC quoted her as saying .
The administrator was one of the top 10 biggest idiots I have ever encountered in my life .
In addition , the test itself was painful .
I had a previously collapsed vein in my arm caused by an overly aggressive nurse determined to get everything she needed in one draw .
Yet the administrator INSISTED on using that arm .
He sneered while he asked the questions .
He was a sarcastic schmuck .
In other words , a complete jerk who apparently got his kicks harassing teenage girls .
While I had never stolen a single thing from that store EVER , I failed my polygraph test miserably .
Completely .
I would never steal something if for no other reason than I know myself well enough to know I 'd probably forget I stole it , wear it into the store a week later , and get busted .
* LOL *
Everyone else passed , and I know for a fact one of them stole something .
Go figure ?
After being falsely accused and humiliated by the branch manager , I was demoted from manager to minimum wage sales clerk .
Same hours and same job at a fraction of the pay .
But I was telling the TRUTH !!
After stewing over it for a few weeks , I decided I was n't going to get mad , I was going to get even .
While I never stole anything myself , I did tell my friends to help themselves to whatever they wanted while I looked the other way .
I 'm sure their expensive tests and false accusations did wonders for their shrinkage problem .
They failed to catch the real theives , and got new ones to boot .
Since this experience , I do n't trust those machines or their results at all .
After a week sick in bed with nothing to do but watch dreadful daytime TV , I had to wonder how many lives have been ruined by false results on the likes of the Maury Povich , Steve Wilkos , Dr. Phil , etc. shows .
When I was the manager at a retail store that had a major problem with " shrinkage " ( theft by employees ) , I was required to take a Polygraph test in order to keep my job .
I agreed .
I had nothing to hide .
Or so I thought !!

* India wants action to stop militant attacks
* Both India , U.S. want more from Pakistan
* No huge hurdles on unfinished nuclear deal
WASHINGTON , Nov 25 ( Reuters ) - Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Wednesday he was assured that U.S. influence on Pakistan would help prod Islamabad to crack down on militants who target India .
Singh said his talks with President Barack Obama on Tuesday produced agreements that the two powers would work together on a number of issues including counter - terrorism .
" I 'll go back to India convinced that India and the United States can and will do lots of things together to strengthen our strategic partnership in economics , in trade , in climate change , in energy , in counter - terrorism and all related activities , " he told a news conference .
Asked whether he had persuaded the United States to use its clout with its ally Pakistan to crack down on Islamic militants who direct attacks at India , Singh said " I have been assured that U.S. influence will work in ( that ) direction . "
The Indian leader 's four - day visit to Washington aimed at boosting ties with the United States ended on the eve of the anniversary of last year 's attack on the Indian city of Mumbai which killed 166 people .
Singh said in a statement to bereaved families of the attack that India " will not rest until we 've brought the perpetrators of this horrible crime to justice . "
Washington and New Delhi want Islamabad to do more to counter growing Islamic militancy .
India wants Pakistan to crack down on militants operating in disputed Kashmir , while the United States wants it to root out Taliban fighters to help end an insurgency in neighboring Afghanistan .
BOTH SIDES COURT CHINA
Singh said he and Obama also discussed China , which has a long - running border dispute with India , but the Indian leader played down talk of rivalry with the Chinese .
" I said to the president that , like other countries , we welcome the peaceful rise of China .
We also are engaged with China , " he said , describing Beijing as a major trade partner .
Singh said he told Obama that China had been increasingly assertive on the border dispute recently .
But he added that India had not sought U.S. help in defusing the row and hoped that it could be resolved in talks with China .
He said there were no major blocks to implementing a civil nuclear cooperation agreement he signed with former U.S. President George W. Bush intended to end a nuclear isolation imposed on India after it tested an atom bomb in 1974 .
" There are no insurmountable barriers and I am confident that in the next couple of weeks we can sort out these , " Singh said of a deal that would open up India 's potential $ 150 billion market in power plants to U.S. businesses .
India 's parliament has to debate a new law to limit U.S. firms ' liability in case of a nuclear accident , but Singh said his cabinet had approved it and was ready to take to the assembly .
The United States , which still has not signed a nuclear fuel reprocessing agreement with India , had given assurances it was serious about completing that process , Singh said .

It 's only January 4 , but already Judge Jed Rakoff has cast a cloud on Bank of America 's year .
Rakoff -- the federal judge famous for refusing to approve the settlement between the bank and the SEC -- ruled today that the Bank could not enter into evidence media reports relating to its approval of up to a total of $ 5.8 million in bonuses to Merrill Lynch employees .
The SEC alleges that the proxy statement that solicited shareholder approval of BofA 's purchase of Merrill falsely represented that Merrill was prohibited from paying year - end bonuses when BofA had actually already consented to them .
BofA wanted to use media reports saying that bonsues were likely to be paid as evidence that shareholders were aware of the bonuses and that the media reports were a " relevant part of the 'mix of information that determines whether the alleged misrepresentations were material , " the opinion said .
The SEC argued , and Rokoff whole - heartedly agreed , that BofA 's own statements warn shareholders from relying on media reports and that they should therefore be excluded from evidence .
The proxy statement said , in part , " You should rely only on the information contained or incorporated by reference in this documents . "
Rakoff had strong words for BofA :
" In effect , [ BofA ] is arguing that , even though it expressly warned its shareholders to disregard the media , it can now defend itself by asserting that a reasonable shareholder would have disregarded these warnings and , by consulting the media , perceived [ BofA 's ] alleged lies were immaterial .
Even a zealous advocate might perceive that such an argument hints at hypocrisy . "
The ruling , the court noted , appears to knock out the entire testimony of two of BofA 's six proposed experts and a portion of a third's .
DealBook 's report on the opinion is here ; they also obtained a copy of the opinion , which is included below .

Two major obstacles to vetting Agile topics effectively with executives were identified in the post entitled The Business Value of Agile Software Methods :
Lack of hard quantitative data .
The “ It wo n’t work here ” syndrome .
As indicated in the post , the data provided in the study How Agile Projects Measure Up , and What This Means to You and the book The business Value of Agile Software Methods address the first obstacle .
This follow - on post is about the second of the two obstacles – the resistance to Agile transformation in the face of hard data on its benefits to other companies .
Resistance in the form of “ it wo n’t work here ” is typically anchored in one or more of the following five beliefs :
Uniqueness : “ Some very unique elements exist in our company .
These elements render industry data inapplicable . ”
Secret sauce : “ Something very special element existed in the companies reporting great success with Agile .
Our company does not possess nor have access to the ‘ secret sauce ’ that enabled success elsewhere . ”
Cultural change : “ For the Agile initiative to succeed , our corporate culture needs to change .
The required cultural change takes a lot of time and involves a great deal of pain .
All in all , the risk of rolling Agile is unacceptably high . ”
Affordability : “ The company is strapped to the degree that investment in another software method is a luxury it ca n’t afford . ”
Software is not core to us :
“ We are not a software company , nor is software engineering our core competency .
Software is merely one of the many elements we use in our business . ”
Various other reasons for not going Agile in the context of a specific company are , of course , cited at some frequency .
The five reasons listed above seem to be encountered most often by Agile champions .
Use the following counter - arguments to turn around these beliefs :
Uniqueness :
Very rare occurence .
Companies use similar business designs , apply fairly standard operating procedures , utilize common technology , are subject to the same regulatory constraints that their competitors are , have offshore sites in places like India , etc .
Discussion of your company vis-a - vis its direct competitor usually suffices to overcome the uniqueness claim .
Secret sauce :
The ‘ secret sauce ’ is neither secret nor difficult to concoct .
For example , the secret sauce used by BMC Software in its successful Agile initiative had four simple ingredient : intentionality , know - how , flexibility and patience .
Based on insights by colleague and friend Alan Atlas , I have recently added mutuality as the fifth ingredient .
Your own secret sauce might be somewhat different , but I very much doubt that an extravagantly exotic sauce will be needed .
Cultural change : Myth has it that Agile would only work in the Collaborative culture .
Reality is it will work in any of the four core cultures identified by Schneider : Control , Competence , Cultivation or Collaboration .
See Four Principles , Four Cultures , One Mirror for an approach to building Agile on the strength of whatever culture prevails in your company / organization .
Affordability :
The question to ask is whether you can afford not to improve your software .
Tools are readily available to quantify your company ’s technical debt .
Monetize the technical debt and include it as a liability line item in a pro forma balance sheet .
Doing so is likely to shift the discussion from affordability to how to create elbow room for handling the technical debt .
Software is not core to us : Indeed , it might not be but it is likely to become so in just about any industry .
Use an analogy like the record industry vis-a - vis the publishing industry .
The record industry has been decimated by software over the past decade .
Chances are a similar decimation is likely to occur in publishing unless the industry transforms itself .
( Some of the decimation that already took place in publishing has become quite visible recently .
For example , last week Bloomberg LP announced completion of the acquisition of BusinessWeek for a paltry $ 5 M ) .
You will need to be realistically patient with respect to the time it takes for the considerations listed above to sink in .
It could easily take six months just to forge a consensus on the subject in the executive team .
It might then take another six month to operationalize the consensus .
Chances are there is an elephant hidden somewhere in the “ room ” if you do n’t carry the day with within a one year period of diligently vetting Agile with your executives .

What the hell is wrong with you ?
Are you really going to wear that ?
Why are n't you right now cooking me a nice meal and wearing those hot boy shorts you know I love and saying those words you know I want to hear at exactly the moment I like to hear them , to make me feel better about everything , even though I probably wo n't ?
What happened to my bonus ?
What happened to my job ?
What happened to my country ?
Why can't it all go the way it 's supposed to go ?
You mean having a kid wo n't solve my marriage problems ?
Why do n't these drugs make me feel better ?
Where 's that goddamn waiter with my salad ?
Have you seen the stupid weather today ?
Is this really all there is ?
These are , from what I can glean , the most important questions of the day , of the month , of modern life itself .
Hell , what with the economy and job situation , the housing market and the overall feel and texture of the nation right now , it 's no wonder Americans are , by and large , a goddamn miserable bunch .
We do n't like anything right now .
No politician , no decision , no situation , no inhale , no exhale .
We are sick to death of all of it , including ourselves .
Can you blame us ?
Have you seen how many things there to be disappointed about these days ?
Love . Sex . Marriage .
Stock market .
God .
Gas mileage .
Death .
Air travel .
5/9ths of the Supreme Court .
It 's all just a big goddamn letdown .
The list is endless .
And getting endlesser .
The evidence is everywhere .
I calculate it took about seven minutes , give or take , after Steve Jobs finished introducing the shinypretty iPad before the whiny attacks on the wondergizmo began flooding in , how it did n't have this or that expected feature , how it can't do live video chat , does n't have Flash , the bezel is too big and it wo n't double as a meat thermometer , how it does n't really revolutionize much of anything despite how it's , you know , this gorgeous 1.5 - pound slab of aluminum and glass that works flawlessly and can perform roughly one thousand tasks in a more fluid and astonishing way than any device of its kind in history .
Big f--ing deal .
We just do not care .
It 's all a big disappointment .
Hey , I was expecting to be blown away .
I was expecting miracles and transformations and multiple twitching orgasms on sight .
Do not come at me with tantalizing promises only to reveal that you can fulfill most of them to a fairly good degree , and not far exceed all of them in every imaginable way .
We 're Americans , goddammit .
Ye shall know us by the tang of our bitter and untenable jadedness .
Also , global warming ?
Total effing letdown .
Americans are no longer believing in it .
Do you know why ?
Not because the mountains of scientific proof are n't there .
Not because it 's not happening .
But because it's not yet happening to us like they said it would in the movies and those worst - case scenario books .
Where are the zombies ?
The ice forests ?
Where 's the tidal wave crashing over the Himalayas ?
I want my goddamn apocalypse , and I want it now .
Hey , you annoying gay people ?
Ditto , to you .
All this uproar about rights and gender , all this talk about how gay marriage is now legal in a handful of states , and still the very fabric of whinysad 50 - percent divorce rate Christian society has yet to unravel and cause riots and induce all white Midwestern children to spontaneously combust .
I mean , WTF ?
So disappointing .
My God , did you hear that pathetic State of the Union ?
That guy , that President Obama ?
Disappointing times a thousand , am I right ?
What the hell happened to him ?
Why is he so weak and ineffectual ?
Why the hell can't he step up and fix the entire planet in under 400 days like he promised he would , in my dreams and fantasies and impossible liberal grass - fed organic tofu greengasms ?
Does n't he know I put a goddamn bumper sticker on my Subaru for him ?
I 've never done that for anyone .
Bastard .
He 's only accomplished what , about 100 of the things I expected him to accomplish by now ?
Big deal .
I have , like , 5,000 more .
Health care reform is hugely flawed .
Guantanamo is still open .
Wars are still warring .
Jobs are still sucking .
Gays are still unhappy because the entire human understanding of love and gender in this nation has not completely transformed within a year .
Infuriating !
But the biggest disappointment of all ?
Turns out one calm n' brilliant Barack Obama is n't enough to solve the problem of 535 vile n' slothful congressional jackals who are n't Barack Obama .
Go figure .
Shall we recall just how violently disappointed those Christian fundamentalists were when Bush bumbled off the stage , the single greatest disaster as president we will ever know ?
They were , of course , mostly disappointed Bush was n't able to do far more repellant damage than he did .
They wanted nothing less than full - scale war on Islam , death to all abortion doctors , creationism in schools , homosexuality banned outright , all you scary women to please stop it with your needy n' terrifying vaginas .
You know , the usual .
And now it's the hardcore Dems ' turn , in reverse .
Obama cannot do enough good , fast enough .
He is failing as our personal SuperJesus .
Not because he's not accomplishing volumes and making all sorts of history , but because we were expecting total mindblowing revolution .
Hey , it 's his own fault , right ?
He 's the one that set out one of the most ambitious agendas in presidential history to go along with the million - mile hole he has to dig us out of first .
Can you blame us for whining ?
But we do n't stop there .
Not only are we disappointed , we need to express it .
Vent it .
Hiss it and spit it and hurl it like fistfuls of mental manure at the great wall of hey , screw you .
You have but to take a peek in the comments section below this column , any column , any article on this or any news site whatsoever , to see just how mean and nasty we have become .
It does not matter what the piece might be about .
Obama 's speech .
High speed rail .
Popular dog breeds .
Your grandmother 's cookies .
The anonymous comments section of any major media site or popular blog will be so crammed with bile and bickering , accusation and pule , hatred and sneer you can't help but feel violently disappointed by the shocking lack of basic human kindness and respect , much less a sense of positivism or perspective .
Maybe this , then , is the ultimate upshot of our endless , self - wrought swirl of sour disappointment , of never having our impossible needs fully met , of constantly being thwarted in our desire to have the world revolve around our exact set of specifications and desires .
Our disappointment begins to curdle , to turn back on itself , poison the heart , turn us nasty and low .
It shifts from merely being a national mood or general temperament , into a way of being .
A wiring , deep and harmful and permanent .
It 's all very disappointing , really .

Republicans want to make the insurance industry more like the credit card industry
" A House Republican health - care bill would n't seek to prevent health - insurance companies from denying sick people insurance , " the first paragraph of the Wall Street Journal 's preview of the latest Republican health - care reform alternative says .
" Republicans also would n't prevent insurers from ending policies once an individual becomes seriously ill , " reads the fifth .
On the bright side , the Republican bill would allow insurers to base themselves in whichever state has the weakest regulatory standards and then sell policies built around those rules nationwide .
If you 've ever thought that your insurance was too comprehensive , too straightforward , and contained too few loopholes that you did n't learn about until you feel terribly ill , then this is the plan for you !
I 'm tired of doing this .
I 'm tired of pretending that political documents are the same as policy documents .
Republicans have not released a plan to reform the health - care system .
They have released a plan ( pdf ) to have people stop bugging them about releasing a plan to reform the health - care system .
The two are not the same thing .
The difference is clear from the first page .
The bill released by House Democrats states that the legislation is meant " to provide affordable , quality health care for all Americans and reduce the growth in health care spending , and for other purposes . "
The " amendment in the nature of a substitute " by John Boehner says , " The purpose of this Act is to take meaningful steps to lower health care costs and increase access to health insurance coverage ( especially for individuals with preexisting conditions ) without --
( 1 ) raising taxes ;
( 2 ) cutting Medicare benefits for seniors ;
( 3 ) adding to the national deficit ;
( 4 ) intervening in the doctor - patient relationship ; or
( 5 ) instituting a government takeover of health care . "
The bill is framed in terms of Republican attacks on the Democratic bill , not in terms of its own aims or methods .
Which is fine , and to be expected .
If I were a Republican , I would n't spend my time crafting a health - care reform plan , either .
Republicans do n't have the votes to pass a bill , and they know it .
As such , they 're not particularly interested in spending months crafting a precise and detailed health - care reform alternative , as it wastes time that could be spent fighting the Democratic bill , raising money for 2010 , and generally working on projects that have an actual chance to succeed .
But you do n't get to have it both ways .
You do n't get to save time by producing a bill that would n't solve any problems and does n't hang together and then also get to whine about how no one is covering the legislation you introduced on Nov. 3 when you can't even say how many people will be covered under your bill !
This is n't serious legislation .
It 's a really long press release .
And I do n't cover really long press releases .
The irony is that the GOP is lucky that most of the press corps will react similarly .
A serious investigation into what would happen if we let insurers cluster in the state with the least regulations and then sell that product nationwide would not go well for the Republicans .
Nor will a sustained look at the world of " high - risk pools " be comforting to Americans .
" Make the insurance industry more like the credit card industry ! " is not a winning slogan .

La Contralor�a General del Distrito Federal inici� ayer un proceso administrativo contra Alejandra N��ez , designada por Rafael Acosta Juanito directora de Jur�dico y Gobierno en Iztapalapa , segundo cargo en importancia de la delegaci�n , por no presentar su declaraci�n patrimonial .
La dependencia comenz� el proceso debido a que la tambi�n asesora de Juanito renunci� en mayo de 2008 a la Coordinaci�n de Mercados en la delegaci�n Miguel Hidalgo , sin ofrecer datos de su patrimonio por conclusi�n del cargo .
De acuerdo con la normatividad que rige para servidores p�blicos , la falta fija como sanci�n la inhabilitaci�n por un a�o para ejercer cualquier cargo p�blico .
N��ez est� citada para el pr�ximo 10 de diciembre en la Contralor�a , donde podr� alegar lo que a su derecho convenga .
La funcionaria enfrenta tambi�n otro problema : asumi� el cargo en Iztapalapa aunque era militante activa del PAN .
El partido dio a conocer que N��ez envi� al Comit� Directivo local una solicitud de licencia indefinida el mismo d�a que fue nombrada por Acosta .
El Reglamento de Miembros de Acci�n Nacional establece que se considerar� renuncia p�blica al partido cuando alg�n miembro “ acepte un cargo en un gobierno no emanado del PAN sin autorizaci�n previa del comit� correspondiente ” .
Ayer el actor Alberto Rojas El Caballo confirm� que Juanito lo invit� a colaborar con �l , pero a�n no toma una decisi�n .

Not surprisingly , the blatant corruption exposed at Britain ’s premiere climate institute was not contained within the nation ’s borders .
Just months after the Climategate scandal broke , a new study has uncovered compelling evidence that our government ’ s principal climate centers have also been manipulating worldwide temperature data in order to fraudulently advance the global warming political agenda .
Not only does the preliminary report [ PDF ] indict a broader network of conspirators , but it also challenges the very mechanism by which global temperatures are measured , published , and historically ranked .
Last Thursday , Certified Consulting Meteorologist Joseph D’Aleo and computer expert E. Michael Smith appeared together on KUSI TV [ Video ] to discuss the Climategate -- American Style scandal they had discovered .
This time out , the alleged perpetrators are the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) .
NOAA stands accused by the two researchers of strategically deleting cherry - picked , cooler - reporting weather observation stations from the temperature data it provides the world through its National Climatic Data Center ( NCDC ) .
D’Aleo explained to show host and Weather Channel founder John Coleman that while the Hadley Center in the U.K. has been the subject of recent scrutiny , “ [ w ] e think NOAA is complicit , if not the real ground zero for the issue . ”
And their primary accomplices are the scientists at GISS , who put the altered data through an even more biased regimen of alterations , including intentionally replacing the dropped NOAA readings with those of stations located in much warmer locales .
As you ’ll soon see , the ultimate effects of these statistical transgressions on the reports which influence climate alarm and subsequently world energy policy are nothing short of staggering .
NOAA – Data In / Garbage Out
Although satellite temperature measurements have been available since 1978 , most global temperature analyses still rely on data captured from land - based thermometers , scattered more or less about the planet .
It is that data which NOAA receives and disseminates – although not before performing some sleight - of - hand on it .
Smith has done much of the heavy lifting involved in analyzing the NOAA / GISS data and software , and he chronicles his often frustrating experiences at his fascinating website .
There , detail - seekers will find plenty to satisfy , divided into easily - navigated sections -- some designed specifically for us “ geeks , ” but most readily approachable to readers of all technical strata .
Perhaps the key point discovered by Smith was that by 1990 , NOAA had deleted from its datasets all but 1,500 of the 6,000 thermometers in service around the globe .
Now , 75 % represents quite a drop in sampling population , particularly considering that these stations provide the readings used to compile both the Global Historical Climatology Network ( GHCN ) and United States Historical Climatology Network ( USHCN ) datasets .
These are the same datasets , incidentally , which serve as primary sources of temperature data not only for climate researchers and universities worldwide , but also for the many international agencies using the data to create analytical temperature anomaly maps and charts .
Yet as disturbing as the number of dropped stations was , it is the nature of NOAA ’s “ selection bias ” that Smith found infinitely more troubling .
It seems that stations placed in historically cooler , rural areas of higher latitude and elevation were scrapped from the data series in favor of more urban locales at lower latitudes and elevations .
Consequently , post - 1990 readings have been biased to the warm side not only by selective geographic location , but also by the anthropogenic heating influence of a phenomenon known as the Urban Heat Island Effect ( UHI ) .
For example , Canada ’s reporting stations dropped from 496 in 1989 to 44 in 1991 , with the percentage of stations at lower elevations tripling while the numbers of those at higher elevations dropped to one .
That ’s right :
As Smith wrote in his blog , they left “ one thermometer for everything north of LAT 65 . ” And that one resides in a place called Eureka , which has been described as “ The Garden Spot of the Arctic ” due to its unusually moderate summers .
Smith also discovered that in California , only four stations remain – one in San Francisco and three in Southern L.A. near the beach – and he rightly observed that
It is certainly impossible to compare it with the past record that had thermometers in the snowy mountains .
So we can have no idea if California is warming or cooling by looking at the USHCN data set or the GHCN data set .
That ’s because the baseline temperatures to which current readings are compared were a true averaging of both warmer and cooler locations .
And comparing these historic true averages to contemporary false averages – which have had the lower end of their numbers intentionally stripped out – will always yield a warming trend , even when temperatures have actually dropped .
Overall , U.S. online stations have dropped from a peak of 1,850 in 1963 to a low of 136 as of 2007 .
In his blog , Smith wittily observed that “ the Thermometer Langoliers have eaten 9/10 of the thermometers in the USA [ , ] including all the cold ones in California . ”
But he was deadly serious after comparing current to previous versions of USHCN data and discovering that this “ selection bias ” creates a +0.6 °C warming in U.S. temperature history .
And no wonder -- imagine the accuracy of campaign tracking polls were Gallup to include only the replies of Democrats in their statistics .
But it gets worse .
Prior to publication , NOAA effects a number of “ adjustments ” to the cherry - picked stations ’ data , supposedly to eliminate flagrant outliers , adjust for time of day heat variance , and “ homogenize ” stations with their neighbors in order to compensate for discontinuities .
This last one , they state , is accomplished by essentially adjusting each to jibe closely with the mean of its five closest “ neighbors . ”
But given the plummeting number of stations , and the likely disregard for the latitude , elevation , or UHI of such neighbors , it ’s no surprise that such “ homogenizing ” seems to always result in warmer readings .
The chart below is from Willis Eschenbach ’s WUWT essay , “ The smoking gun at Darwin Zero , ” and it plots GHCN Raw versus homogeneity - adjusted temperature data at Darwin International Airport in Australia .
The “ adjustments ” actually reversed the 20th - century trend from temperatures falling at 0.7 °C per century to temperatures rising at 1.2 °C per century .
Eschenbach isolated a single station and found that it was adjusted to the positive by 6.0 °C per century , and with no apparent reason , as all five stations at the airport more or less aligned for each period .
His conclusion was that he had uncovered “ indisputable evidence that the ‘ homogenized ’ data has been changed to fit someone ’s preconceptions about whether the earth is warming . ”
WUWT ’s editor , Anthony Watts , has calculated the overall U.S. homogeneity bias to be 0.5 °F to the positive , which alone accounts for almost one half of the 1.2 °F warming over the last century .
Add Smith ’s selection bias to the mix and poof – actual warming completely disappears !
Yet believe it or not , the manipulation does not stop there .
GISS – Garbage In / Globaloney Out
The scientists at NASA ’s GISS are widely considered to be the world ’s leading researchers into atmospheric and climate changes .
And their Surface Temperature ( GISTemp ) analysis system is undoubtedly the premiere source for global surface temperature anomaly reports .
In creating its widely disseminated maps and charts , the program merges station readings collected from the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research ( SCAR ) with GHCN and USHCN data from NOAA .
It then puts the merged data through a few “ adjustments ” of its own .
First , it further “ homogenizes ” stations , supposedly adjusting for UHI by ( according to NASA ) changing “ the long term trend of any non-rural station to match the long term trend of their rural neighbors , while retaining the short term monthly and annual variations . ”
Of course , the reduced number of stations will have the same effect on GISS ’s UHI correction as it did on NOAA ’s discontinuity homogenization – the creation of artificial warming .
Furthermore , in his communications with me , Smith cited boatloads of problems and errors he found in the Fortran code written to accomplish this task , ranging from hot airport stations being mismarked as “ rural ” to the “ correction ” having the wrong sign (+/-) and therefore increasing when it meant to decrease or vice - versa .
And according to NASA , “ If no such neighbors exist or the overlap of the rural combination and the non-rural record is less than 20 years , the station is completely dropped ; if the rural records are shorter , part of the non-rural record is dropped . ”
However , Smith points out that a dropped record may be “ from a location that has existed for 100 years . ”
For instance , if an aging piece of equipment gets swapped out , thereby changing its identification number , the time horizon reinitializes to zero years .
Even having a large enough temporal gap ( e.g. , during a world war ) might cause the data to “ just get tossed out . ”
But the real chicanery begins in the next phase , wherein the planet is flattened and stretched onto an 8,000 - box grid , into which the time series are converted to a series of anomalies ( degree variances from the baseline ) .
Now , you might wonder just how one manages to fill 8,000 boxes using 1,500 stations .
Here ’s NASA ’s solution :
For each grid box , the stations within that grid box and also any station within 1200 km of the center of that box are combined using the reference station method .
Even on paper , the design flaws inherent in such a process should be glaringly obvious .
So it ’s no surprise that Smith found many examples of problems surfacing in actual practice .
He offered me Hawaii for starters .
It seems that all of the Aloha State ’s surviving stations reside in major airports .
Nonetheless , this unrepresentative hot data is what ’s used to “ infill ” the surrounding “ empty ” Grid Boxes up to 1200 km out to sea .
So in effect , you have “ jet airport tarmacs ‘ standing in ’ for temperature over water 1200 km closer to the North Pole . ”
An isolated problem ?
Hardly , reports Smith .
From KUSI ’s Global Warming : The Other Side :
“ There ’s a wonderful baseline for Bolivia -- a very high mountainous country -- right up until 1990 when the data ends .
And if you look on the [ GISS ]
November 2009 anomaly map , you ’ll see a very red rosy hot Bolivia [ boxed in blue ] .
But how do you get a hot Bolivia when you have n’t measured the temperature for 20 years ? ”
Of course , you already know the answer : GISS simply fills in the missing numbers – originally cool , as Bolivia contains proportionately more land above 10,000 feet than any other country in the world – with hot ones available in neighboring stations on a beach in Peru or somewhere in the Amazon jungle .
Remember that single station north of 65° latitude which they located in a warm section of northern Canada ?
Joe D’Aleo explained its purpose : “ To estimate temperatures in the Northwest Territory [ boxed in green above ] , they either have to rely on that location or look further south . ”
Pretty slick , huh ?
And those are but a few examples .
In fact , throughout the entire grid , cooler station data are dropped and “ filled in ” by temperatures extrapolated from warmer stations in a manner obviously designed to overestimate warming ...
... And convince you that it ’s your fault .
Government and Intergovernmental Agencies -- Globaloney
In / Green Gospel Out
Smith attributes up to 3 °F ( more in some places ) of added “ warming trend ” between NOAA ’s data adjustment and GIStemp processing .
That ’s over twice last century ’s reported warming .
And yet , not only are NOAA ’s bogus data accepted as green gospel , but so are its equally bogus hysterical claims , like this one from the 2006 annual State of the Climate in 2005 [ PDF ] :
“ Globally averaged mean annual air temperature in 2005 slightly exceeded the previous record heat of 1998 , making 2005 the warmest year on record . ”
And as D’Aleo points out in the preliminary report , the recent NOAA proclamation that June 2009 was the second - warmest June in 130 years will go down in the history books , despite multiple satellite assessments ranking it as the 15th - coldest in 31 years .
Even when our own National Weather Service ( NWS ) makes its frequent announcements that a certain month or year was the hottest ever , or that five of the warmest years on record occurred last decade , they ’re basing such hyperbole entirely on NOAA ’s warm - biased data .
And how can anyone possibly read GISS chief James Hansen ’s Sunday claim that 2009 was tied with 2007 for second - warmest year overall , and the Southern Hemisphere ’s absolute warmest in 130 years of global instrumental temperature records , without laughing hysterically ?
It 's especially laughable when one considers that NOAA had just released a statement claiming that very same year ( 2009 ) to be tied with 2006 for the fifth - warmest year on record .
So how do alarmists reconcile one government center reporting 2009 as tied for second while another had it tied for fifth ?
If you ’re WaPo ’s Andrew Freedman , you simply chalk it up to “ different data analysis methods ” before adjudicating both NASA and NOAA innocent of any impropriety based solely on their pointless assertions that they did n’t do it .
Earth to Andrew : “ Different data analysis methods ” ?
Try replacing “ analysis ” with “ manipulation , ” and ye shall find enlightenment .
More importantly , does the explicit fact that since the drastically divergent results of both “ methods ” ca n’t be right , both are immediately suspect somehow elude you ?
But by far the most significant impact of this data fraud is that it ultimately bubbles up to the pages of the climate alarmists ’ bible : The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report .
And wrong data begets wrong reports , which – particularly in this case – begets dreadfully wrong policy .
It ’s High Time We Investigated the Investigators
The final report will be made public shortly , and it will be available at the websites of both report - supporter Science and Public Policy Institute and Joe D’Aleo ’s own ICECAP .
As they ’ve both been tremendously helpful over the past few days , I ’ll trust in the opinions I ’ve received from the report ’s architects to sum up .
This from the meteorologist :
The biggest gaps and greatest uncertainties are in high latitude areas where the data centers say they ' find ' the greatest warming ( and thus which contribute the most to their global anomalies ) .
Add to that no adjustment for urban growth and land use changes ( even as the world 's population increased from 1.5 to 6.7 billion people ) [ in the NOAA data ] and questionable methodology for computing the historical record that very often cools off the early record and you have surface based data sets so seriously flawed , they can no longer be trusted for climate trend or model forecast assessment or decision making by the administration , congress or the EPA .
Roger Pielke Sr. has suggested : “ ... that we move forward with an inclusive assessment of the surface temperature record of CRU , GISS and NCDC .
We need to focus on the science issues .
This necessarily should involve all research investigators who are working on this topic , with formal assessments chaired and paneled by mutually agreed to climate scientists who do not have a vested interest in the outcome of the evaluations . ”
I endorse that suggestion .
Certainly , all rational thinkers agree .
Perhaps even the mainstream media , most of whom have hitherto mistakenly dismissed Climategate as a uniquely British problem , will now wake up and demand such an investigation .
With the pbcopy and pbpaste commands , you can use the command line to manipulate clipboard contents but also access your Mac OS X clipboard directly through the Terminal .
Yes , that means you can access what you copied in a GUI app and use it in the command line seamlessly , and vice versa .
We ’ve shown a brief introduction on how to use both pbcopy and pbpaste from the command line before , but we wanted to demonstrate a few additional methods to use these incredibly useful tools on the Mac , like how to directly access whatever is currently stored in the Macs clipboard from the terminal prompt .
Accessing the OS X Clipboard Contents with pbpaste
pbpaste – pbpaste is how you dump the currently active contents of the clipboard .
If you just want to see what ’s in the clipboard , simply type this :
pbpaste
You ’ll see whatever is stored in the clipboard right now , as if you hit Command + V in OS X .
You can also easily store the contents of the clipboard into a file by using pbpaste , as follows :
pbpaste > clipboard.txt
Now you ’ll have the document clipboard .
txt with the contents of your clipboard .
You can double - check this by opening it in any text editor , or by typing cat clipboard .
txt to see the contents .
Adding Contents to the Clipboard with pbcopy
pbcopy – as you might imagine , pbcopy is how you can copy things from the command line .
This is basically like using Comamnd +C in the Finder or GUI of OS X .
The best way to use it is by piping something into pbcopy , for example :
ls - lha |pbcopy
This will pipe the results of ls - lha into your clipboard , which you can now access using the pbpaste command .
Now that you ’ve copied something to the clipboard of OS X with pbcopy you can dump the output back into the Terminal by using pbpaste , if you had just run the ls - lha|pbcopy command , the output will be that .
You can learn more about modifying the clipboard from the terminal by redirecting command output here with pipes and redirects to the pbcopy command .
pbcopy and pbpaste can even work across networks by using ssh or other protocols , check this out :
Pasting Clipboard Contents Across Networks with SSH & pbpaste
pbcopy and pbpaste are a lot more powerful than the above examples though .
Here ’s how to use pbpaste to send the contents of your clipboard to another machine , by piping the output through an ssh connection into a file named myclipboard .
txt on the remote machine :
pbpaste | ssh username@host ' cat > ~/myclipboard.txt '
Nice huh ?
news Apples ( The White Plastic Kind ) Endangered at TDSB
Photo by Smedlipotski from the Torontoist Flickr Pool .
Why , at the very crest of Apple ’s latest wave of buzz , is the Toronto District School Board moving to phase out Mac computers in all its facilities ?
Lots of reasons .
The decision was announced in a briefing note , submitted to the TDSB ’s trustees on November 13 by Lee Stem , general manager of Information and Technology Services for the Board .
The rationale for instituting the plan revolves around the costliness of Macs as compared to similarly equipped PCs , and the alleged difficulty and expense of performing automatic maintenance on two platforms , rather than one .
“ The Apple computer in a large - scale network ―their capabilities for automatically managing that many machines really pales to what ’s available in the PC world , ” said Stem , during a phone call .
The Board ’s network serves nearly 63,000 computers ( for over 250,000 students ) , roughly 8 % of which are currently Macs .
Under the plan , the Board will stop introducing Macs into classrooms for general - use purposes .
The Board ’s existing general - use Macs , once they reach the end of their service lives , will be replaced with PCs .
The Board will then continue to purchase Macs , but dramatically fewer than they currently do , and only for use in classes dealing with subjects where Mac is considered the industry standard ( like video editing , or art ) .
“ At the end of the day , it really comes down to getting as many devices in the hands of as many people as possible , ” added Stem .
“ Every penny that we save …all that money is going to bring more technology into the hands of kids . ”
Many teachers at TDSB schools have publicly objected to this planned course of action .
Among them is Chris Higgins , a Swansea Public School tech instructor who started an online petition in protest ( it currently has almost five hundred signatures , many from community members and TDSB employees ) .
In particular , Higgins mourns the impending loss of Garage Band , a program that comes bundled with new Mac computers .
“ It ’s really a unique program , ” he said , speaking over Skype from a computer in his school ’s Mac lab .
“ It does podcasting better than any other program .
It ’s unique to Mac .
Not only can you record your voice and do the fade in , fade out , and all those types of effects , but you can put multiple tracks in . ”
Higgins employs Garage Band with primary - school students , who use the program ’s intuitive interface to make multimedia class projects .
There is no PC version of the program .
“ I have never seen a child who did n’t love the program Garage Band , ” said Higgins .
“ There are some really good PC programs , but none that reach or even come close . ”
Higgins is concerned that primary - school students might be the group most severely affected by the Mac- reduction plan , since the type of specialized skills training for which Macs would be reserved does n’t generally begin until secondary school .
Over at Grenoble Public School , a second technology instructor registered his dissatisfaction in a video plea for sanity , which he recorded on one of his school ’s iMacs and posted on YouTube ( see below ) .
Grenoble Public School media literacy teacher Colin McAuley makes a YouTube plea for continued Mac support in the TDSB .
The strongest pushback to date came on January 5 , when Trustee Michael Coteau introduced a motion [ DOC ] that insists not only upon continued support for Macs at the TDSB , but also upon the immediate integration of iPhones into the Board ’s systems .
The motion will go before the Board ’s Administration , Finance and Accountability Committee on January 27 ( coincidentally the same day Apple is expected to confirm the existence of its mythical “ iSlate ” at a press event in San Francisco ) .
Scott Baker , a teacher at Pringdale Gardens Public School and a former technology consultant with the Board , has also been publicly opposed to the plan .
He wrote a lengthy and impassioned open letter to Chris Spence , the new Director of Education for TDSB .
The letter argues , among other things , that Macs are actually , in the long - term , cheaper to own than PCs , despite the fact that their initial cost of purchase is higher .
Supposedly , this is because Macs are built of high - quality components and are less prone to breakdown and malware infection .
Unequivocal proof of this claim is difficult to come by .
Apple computers inspire a devotion in their most enthusiastic users that has often been described as “ cultish , ” and , as a result , a majority of the anecdotal information available on the long - term costs of Mac computers relative to PCs is suspect .
In any case , anecdotal reports have little value for organizations the size of the TDSB .
Professional IT research firms occasionally take stabs at the “ total cost of ownership ” question for large organizations , but the resulting reports cost hundreds of dollars to read , and are only freely available in bullet point form .
Stem said that several of these were consulted prior to the announcement of the Mac- reduction plan .
( Stem : “ We ’ve done our homework on this . ” )
It is true that there is currently less malware targeting Mac OSX than Windows , but experts speculate that this has to do with Mac OSX ’s comparatively small market share , rather than any kind of inherent invulnerability to attack .
Another common lament over the handling of Macs at the TDSB is the Board ’s perceived over - reliance on Microsoft - focused networking architecture .
Evidence strongly suggests that this complaint has some basis in reality .
In 2006 , Microsoft published a case study describing TDSB ’s experience with a Microsoft - certified consultant , who sold the Board ’s IT department on the alleged superiority of Microsoft ’s ill - fated Vista operating system .
Vista , released to the public in 2006 , was superseded after less than three years when Microsoft released its latest operating system , Windows 7 , in 2009 .
At the moment , the exact fate of TDSB ’s Mac minority is uncertain .
An internal committee consisting of teachers , administrators , and representatives from Information and Technology Services has been formed at the Board , and is currently negotiating the precise terms of the Mac rollback .
Whatever the outcome , though , it ’s a certainty that the next generation of computing resources in Toronto ’s public schools will be PC - centric .
TDSB renewed its contract with Dell last year , and will pay an estimated annual sum of six million dollars for new desktop PCs and associated hardware over the next five years .
Other large urban school districts , meanwhile , have built networks that successfully integrate multiple different computing platforms .
Chicago Public Schools , with nearly twice as many students as the TDSB , pointedly assert equal support for PC and Mac in their technology plan [ PDF ] .
It is unclear what additional costs , if any , might be associated with integrating the two platforms .
It is difficult to say how much of the conflict over Macs at TDSB truly springs from issues of cost , and how much is tangled up in simple preference for one type of machine over another .
Do the Mac ’s easy - to - use applications and low malware infection rates outweigh the PC ’s easy automation and low initial cost of purchase ?
Absent a detailed analysis of the relative weights of these considerations from the Board , teachers who rely on Macs in the classroom ca n’t help but feel wronged .
“ The bottom line , ” wrote Baker in response to an emailed question , “ is that decisions that affect the classroom are being made by the IT department without input from the people ( teachers ) that these decisions affect . ”
Bezos Expeditions invests in 37signals Jason 152 comments Latest by Movies
Today we have a very special announcement to make : Bezos Expeditions , a personal investment company of Jeff Bezos , has made a minority private equity investment in 37signals .
Here ’s some background on the decision .
Over the past two and a half years we ’ve accomplished a lot on our own .
We ’ve released 5 products ( Basecamp , Backpack , Campfire , Tadalist , and Writeboard ) which over 500,000 people have signed up for so far , wrote Getting Real which has sold nearly 20,000 copies in less than six months , changed the web development world by writing and open sourcing the Ruby on Rails framework , presented at conferences around the world , and more .
We ’re proud of what we ’ve been able to do without outside help .
But we think we can do even better with the right kind of help .
And we ’re picky .
Since we launched Basecamp we ’ve been contacted by nearly 30 different VC firms .
We ’ve never been interested in the typical traditional VC deal .
With a few exceptions , all the VCs could offer us was cash and connections .
We ’re fine on both of those fronts .
We do n’t need their money to run the business and our little black book is full .
We ’re looking for something else .
What we ’ve been looking for is the wisdom of a very special entrepreneur who ’s been through what we ’re going through .
Someone who sees things a little differently and makes us feel right at home .
Someone with a long term outlook , not a build - to - flip mentality .
We found a perfect match in Jeff .
Jeff is our kinda guy .
It will be great learning from Jeff as we build 37 signals into one the great companies of the next 20 years .
Daniel Burnham , the great visionary architect of Chicago , said , “ Make no little plans ; they have no magic to stir men ’s blood and probably will themselves not be realized . ”
We agree .
We hope this boost of ambition , and Jeff ’s personal vote of confidence , will help us achieve our big plans .
So here we go .
