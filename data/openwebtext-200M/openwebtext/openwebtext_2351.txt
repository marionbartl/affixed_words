Fritzl says he was ' born to rape '
Fritzl has been in custody since the case came to light in April The Austrian father who allegedly imprisoned and abused his daughter for 24 years has said he was " born to rape " , according to a leaked report .
The report by psychiatrist Adelheid Kastner says Joseph Fritzl 's mother humiliated him in childhood , creating his need to " possess a human being " .
Mr Fritzl said he had an " evil streak " and that he " could have behaved a lot worse than locking up my daughter " .
Mr Fritzl fathered seven children with his daughter in a cellar he built .
Dr Kastner says in her 130 - page report that Mr Fritzl is fit for trial and would be " highly " likely to reoffend if he had the opportunity .
A trial could begin in the next few months .
Mr Fritzl has been in custody since the case came to light in April .
' Volcano '
Dr Kastner 's report has been submitted to the prosecutor 's office but was leaked to the Austrian media .
In the report , Mr Fritzl , 73 , tells the psychiatrist : " I was born to rape and I held myself back for a relatively long time . "
Fritzl , here as a 16 - year - old in 1951 , spoke of humiliations as a child Dr Kastner says Mr Fritzl spoke of humiliating and unprovoked attacks by his mother in childhood .
" His childhood made him susceptible to an emotional handicap , " she writes , creating the need for him " to possess an entire human being " .
The report says Mr Fritzl believed incarcerating his daughter , Elisabeth , meant he would have someone " just for me " .
He believed having children with her would mean she would have to stay with him as she would " no longer hold any attraction for other men " .
Mr Fritzl speaks of himself as a " volcano " who has a " flood of destructive lava that was barely controllable " .
Prosecutors say Mr Fritzl has confessed to keeping Elisabeth captive in a cell at his home in Amstetten , west of Vienna .
DNA tests have shown he is the father of six of Elisabeth 's children - a seventh child is believed to have died shortly after birth .
Elisabeth , 42 , her six children and her mother Rosemarie have been undergoing psychiatric treatment and are thought to be at a secret location learning to resume a normal existence .
The case first came to light in April after 19 - year - old Kerstin , one of the children fathered by Mr Fritzl , became seriously ill and was taken to hospital .

The argument over the US anthrax attacks of 2001 looks set to continue , as politicians begin asking tough questions about the investigation .
US law enforcement agencies last week released their reasons for suspecting Bruce Ivins , a senior anthrax researcher for the US Army , as the long - sought mailer of powdered anthrax to US media outlets and Senators in 2001 .
Ivins ’s death late last month , ruled a suicide , means those arguments will not now be examined in a court of law .
But senior US politicians are calling for investigation of the evidence , which consisted only of requests by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) to search Ivins ’ property over the past year .
Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa called for a “ full and thorough vetting ” of the claims , noting that “ more than a hundred people ” had access to the flask of anthrax spores that the FBI says genetically matched the spores used in the attacks .

Unanswered questions
Grassley wants to know how many samples of that batch were sent to other labs , and how the FBI ruled out other people who might have had access to them .
He wants details of the measurements of oxygen isotopes in the attack anthrax , which reportedly identified where it was grown , and why logs showing late work in Ivins ’ lab before the mailings did not focus the investigation on Ivins earlier .
He also wants to know if there is video evidence that it was Ivins working those late - night sessions .

Quantum cryptography is touted as being " unbreakable " Perfect secrecy has come a step closer with the launch of the world 's first computer network protected by unbreakable quantum encryption at a scientific conference in Vienna .
The network connects six locations across Vienna and in the nearby town of St Poelten , using 200 km of standard commercial fibre optic cables .
Quantum cryptography is completely different from the kinds of security schemes used on computer networks today .
These are typically based on complex mathematical procedures which are extremely hard for outsiders to crack but not impossible given sufficient computing resources or time .
But quantum systems use the laws of quantum theory , which have been shown to be inherently unbreakable .
Real breakthroughs are not found because you want to develop some new technology , but because you are curious and want to find out how the world is
Anton Zeilinger , Vienna University
The basic idea of quantum cryptography was worked out 25 years ago by Charles Bennett of IBM and Gilles Brassard of Montreal University , who was in Vienna to see the network in action .
" All quantum security schemes are based on the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , on the fact that you cannot measure quantum information without disturbing it , " he explained .
" Because of that , one can have a communications channel between two users on which it 's impossible to eavesdrop without creating a disturbance .
An eavesdropper would create a mark on it .
That was the key idea . "
In practice this means using the ultimate quantum objects : photons , the " atoms of light " .
Incredibly faint beams of light equating to single photons fired a million times a second raced between the nodes in the Vienna network .
Each node , housed in a different Siemens office ( Siemens has provided the fibre links ) , contains a small rack of electronics - boxes about the size of a PC - and a handful of sensitive light detectors .
Numerical key From the detected photons , a totally secret numerical key can be distilled , which encodes the users ' data much like the keys used in normal computer networks do .
The advantage is that no - one else can know the key without revealing themselves .
As we saw in the demonstration , when an intruder did try to listen in on the quantum exchange , photons became scrambled , and a rise in the error rate at the node detectors signalled the attack .
The system automatically shut down without being compromised .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More importantly , the demonstration also showed that the network is robust .
If one quantum link breaks down , the connections can be re-routed via other nodes , much as phone calls get re-routed automatically through a telecoms network , so that any two users on the network can remain in continuous secure contact .
Dr Hannes Huebel of Vienna University , operating one of the nodes , explained how robustness was now as important as security in the development of quantum encryption systems .
" We are constantly in touch with insurance companies and banks , and they say it 's nearly better that they lose 10 m euros than if the system is down for two hours , because that might be more damaging for the bank , " said Dr Huebel .
" So that 's what we have to prove , that we have a reliable system that delivers quantum keys for several weeks without interruption , and then they might be more interested . "
Polarised light
The final element of the EU - sponsored project ( called SECO -QC ) was the interconnection of different realisations of quantum cryptography .
There are many ways photons of light can encode a numerical key : through the direction they 're polarised ( like Polaroid glasses ) for example , or the precise timing of their arrival .
Different schemes have different strengths and weaknesses , and a viable network would have to handle whatever individual users choose to use , explained the project 's director , Christian Monyk - just as a mobile phone network has to handle handsets from many manufacturers .
Quantum cryptography is a surprising outgrowth of recondite arguments that bounced around for decades about the meaning of quantum mechanics .
Albert Einstein , who discovered the quantum properties of photons of light - indeed , discovered the very concept of the photon - always resisted quantum theory 's spooky behaviour , " God does not play dice " , being among his oft - quoted objections .
But experiments eventually proved that he apparently does , and also laid the technical foundations for today 's quantum information revolution - cryptography , teleportation , and computation .
One of the grandees of quantum science , Vienna University 's Anton Zeilinger , used the occasion to argue for continued funding of fundamental science in these increasingly application - focused days .
" Real breakthroughs are not found because you want to develop some new technology , but because you are curious and want to find out how the world is , " Dr Zeilinger said .
" It may not have surprised the founding fathers of quantum science that technology has advanced so that you can play with individual quantum systems , in great detail .
" Maybe this would not surprise , but what could surprise them is that people are thinking and doing practical applications . "

Just a day before being picked as the GOP vice president , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin wrote a letter to California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger urging him to shoot down a groundbreaking pollution - reduction effort aimed at cargo containers : she asked the Governator not to sign a bill that would impose heavy fees on ships entering the ports of Long Beach , Los Angeles , and Oakland .
Palin ’s concerns were aimed at the Alaskan economy , and well … not the environment .
Duh !
Claiming that shippers are already burdened by high fuel prices , she said this “ may harm California by driving port business away from its ports . ”
As those three ports together account for over 40 - percent of U.S. goods , that kinda seems unlikely .
The bill ’s author is n’t impressed by Palin ’s suggestion either .
“ We are losing about 3,400 Californians each year because of pollution . … I do n’t think Gov. Palin truly understands the impacts going on here , ” says state Sen.
Alan Lowenthal ( D ) , who sponsored the bill .
“ She certainly displays a lack of understanding , ” Lowenthal went on to say .
Many California environmentalists consider this to be the most important pollution reduction effort made in the state this year .
“ Why should Gov. Schwarzenegger take into account what out - of - state interests are saying ? ” said Lisa Warshaw , a spokeswoman for the Coalition for Clean Air .
“ It ’s unfortunate that she is using her popularity to push her agenda on this state . ”
The bill would impose a $ 60 fee for every 40 - foot cargo container entering those ports .
It would bring in about $ 400 million per year , which would go towards the installation of cleaner truck and train engines and projects aimed to reduce congestion and idling .
That sounds pretty good to me !
Schwarzenegger has had concerns about the port fee and even threatened to veto it last year .
He urged Lowenthal to meet with retail and shipping representatives to address their complaints that it will harm business .
But Schwarzenegger has not yet responded to Palin ’s letter , nor has he made a decision about whether to sign or veto the legislation , said spokeswoman Rachel Cameron .

Yet there was little doubt that Mr Medvedev was playing the divide - and - rule tactics of Vladimir Putin , his predecessor and now Prime Minister , by seeking to pit the US against its European allies .
In a speech delivered to European leaders at a conference hosted by the French President , Nicolas Sarkozy , to discuss the international financial crisis , Mr Medvedev sought to show that the US was at the root of all the world 's problems .
He blamed Washington's " economic egotism " for the world 's financial woes and then accused the Bush Administration of taking Europe to the brink of a new cold war by pursuing a deliberately divisive foreign policy .
He also maintained that the US was once again trying to return to a policy of containing Russia .
" After toppling the Taliban regime in Afghanistan , the United States started a series of unilateral actions , " Mr Medvedev said .
" As a result , a trend appeared in international relations towards creating dividing lines .
This was in fact the revival of a policy popular in the past and known as containment . "
While he called for a cooling of the noxious rhetoric that had blighted East - West relations over the past two years , Mr Medvedev clearly laid the blame for the deterioration on the US , which he said was again viewing Russia through the prism of the Cold War .
" Sovietology , like paranoia , is a very dangerous disease , and it is a pity that part of the US Administration still suffers from it , " he said .
In order to end the " unipolar " model in which the world depended on the US , he proposed creating new financial systems to challenge the dominance of the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organisation , both of which had fallen under Washington 's spell .
Attacking the enlargement of NATO , which he said had advanced provocatively towards Russia , he proposed a new European security treaty .
The new European pact would include " a clear affirmation of the inadmissibility of the use of force - or the threat of force - in international relations " and would be built on the principle of the territorial integrity of independent nations .
While Russia has insisted it was not intending to supplant NATO , Mr Medvedev made it clear that the US - dominated alliance was partly responsible for the war in the Caucasus by its failure to rein in Georgian " aggression " .
The Russian President won praise from Mr Sarkozy after he announced that all Russian troops had been withdrawn from buffer zones around Georgia 's rebel enclaves of South Ossetia and Abkhazia before today 's deadline .
Describing his guest as a man who had " kept his word " , Mr Sarkozy immediately declared that talks on an EU - Russia partnership deal , suspended as punishment for Russia 's military operation in Georgia , could resume .

Standards Norway , the organization that manages technical standards for the Scandinavian country , took a serious blow last week when key members resigned in protest over procedural irregularities in the approval process for Microsoft 's Office Open XML ( OOXML ) format .
The 23 - person technical committee has lost 13 of its members .
The standardization process for Microsoft 's office format has been plagued with controversy .
Critics have challenged the validity of its ISO approval and allege that procedural irregularities and outright misconduct marred the voting process in national standards bodies around the world .
Norway has faced particularly close scrutiny because the country reversed its vote against approval despite strong opposition to the format by a majority of the members who participated in the technical committee .
Standards Norway has defended its conduct and asserts that its vote in favor of OOXML approval was based on the outcome of a public inquiry in which a majority of the responses it received encouraged support of OOXML .
The standards body has also admitted , however , that a significant number of those responses were identical submissions authored by Microsoft .
A letter of resignation written by the departing members and made public by The Inquirer accuses the standards body of folding to pressure from Microsoft , violating its own procedural rules , and ignoring the analysis of the technical committee tasked with evaluating OOXML .
" It is sad when organisations that work for our common interest fail the task .
Through the OOXML work , Standard Norway has shown , with a clear margin , that they are not fit to represent Norway in the ISO , " the letter says .
" Standard Norway chose to defy their own technical committee and vote yes to a specification that is immature , useless , and unworthy of being called an ISO standard . "
Opera CTO
Håkon Wium Lie is among the technical committee members who are resigning over the OOXML decision .
In the letter , he stresses the importance of open standards and the need for formats that are universally accessible to everyone .
" Standardization of formats for content on the Web is more important than ever .
A large part of mankind 's communication is done digitally , and all — ALL — must have the ability to read and write these formats , " he wrote .
Fallout from the OOXML controversy continues to be felt around the world .
ISO is facing a revolt from dissatisfied participants who feel that their technical input was ignored , and national standards bodies from various countries are suffering internal friction over alleged misconduct .
The implosion of the Standards Norway technical committee reflects the ongoing turmoil created by the ambiguity surrounding ISO 's approval of OOXML .

Alistair Darling today insisted that 98 % of accounts held in British banks were " fully covered " , as he confirmed that the government guarantee on savings would tomorrow be raised from £ 35,000 to £ 50,000 .
In a parliamentary statement , the chancellor said it was his responsibility to support a stable , well - functioning banking system , as he revealed that Northern Rock had now repaid half of the money it had been lent by taxpayers .
" Financial transactions are at the heart of everything we do .
They allow people to buy goods , pay for services , buy homes , save for pensions and invest , so it 's essential that we take action to both support the banking system as a whole as well as being ready to intervene in particular cases when it 's necessary to do so , " Darling told MPs .
" Both general support and individual intervention is necessary . "
Darling said that the government had made available in excess of £ 100bn of long - term funding and was " willing to make further resources available as necessary " .
The Bank of England had injected substantial funds into the markets and would continue to do so .
" Tomorrow it will put in another £ 40bn , " he said .
Setting out what had been done in Britain to " deal with developments in Europe over the weekend " , Darling said that from tomorrow the Financial Services Authority would raise the compensation limit for bank deposits from £ 35,000 to £ 50,000 - or £ 100,000 for joint accounts .
" This measure will ensure 98 % of accounts are fully covered , " he said .
" The FSA is consulting on whether to increase this limit further . "
The Treasury came under pressure last night to guarantee the savings of all depositors in British banks or face an exodus of cash from British financial institutions after Germany announced it was following the lead of the Irish and Greeks and offering a blanket guarantee on all savings .
Gordon Brown was due to speak to the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , today to clarify the extent of Germany 's commitment to protect bank deposits , Downing Street said .
British officials were said to be furious that Merkel had given no indication of the move at a summit in Paris on Saturday designed to coordinate a European response to the economic crisis .
But moments before Darling got to his feet , EU leaders issued a joint statement vowing to take " whatever measures are necessary to maintain the stability of the financial system " .
" All the leaders of the European Union make clear that each of them will take whatever measures are necessary to maintain the stability of the financial system – whether through liquidity support through central banks , action to deal with individual banks or enhanced depositor protection schemes , " the statement said .
" While no depositors in our countries ' banks have lost any money , we will continue to take the necessary measures to protect both the system and individual depositors .
In taking these measures , European leaders acknowledge the need for close coordination and cooperation . "
Darling also told the Commons that Northern Rock – the first British bank taken into public ownership – had now repaid more than half of the taxpayers ' money that had been lent to it .
" It continues to repay its loan ahead of schedule , " Darling said .
The chancellor said while it would be irresponsible to speculate on any future measures that may be needed to bring order to the financial system " all practical options must remain open " .
This morning Brown chaired the first of what will be twice - weekly meetings of his new national economic council , aimed at managing the economic crisis .
The meeting , which lasted about an hour , included an update from Hazel Blears , the communities secretary , on the impact of the crisis on the housing market .
Brown has been involved in " intense " international discussions over the weekend about the financial crisis .
Downing Street confirmed that in the past 24 hours Brown had held discussions with the prime ministers of Iceland and Denmark , the managing director of the International Monetary Fund , the head of the European Central Bank and Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president .
Asked whether the government had contingency plans to partially or completely nationalise the banking sector , Yvette Cooper , the chief secretary to the Treasury , said that Brown and Darling had promised to do " whatever it takes " to ensure the banking sector remained safe .
" The chancellor said yesterday that of course that does mean looking at a whole series of pretty big steps that you might not take in ordinary times , " Cooper told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
In a significant shift in position , the Tory leader , David Cameron , said he favoured a recapitalisation to strengthen the banking system .
" It is something parties should talk about , and I think it is something where consensus would be better than opposition . "
Previously the Tories had spoken of ailing banks being taken over by the Bank of England to run them down and sell off their profitable assets .
Darling has already allowed the bank to put £ 40bn into the market this week to ease the problems of banks accessing money , but there are increasing signs that this is dealing merely with the symptoms of the problem .
The chancellor also gave a broad hint that he feels the Bank of England is free to cut interest rates on Thursday when he said its remit was not confined to controlling inflation .
" The Bank of England also has a wider duty to support the government 's economic objectives , " he said .
He did , however , reject calls from the Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman , Vincent Cable , to specifically change the bank 's remit , saying such a move would undermine its independence .
Cable had warned : " We are in a real crisis situation .
In an edge of the cliff environment . "
Incomplete and constrained transmission grids pose a serious impediment to the use of renewable energy sources such as wind power .
Proposals launched over the past week show that support for more lines is going mainstream .
Last week none other than Greenpeace called for an underwater power grid criss - crossing the North Sea to accelerate the installation of dozens of new offshore wind farms .
In “ A North Sea Electricity Grid [ R] Evolution ” , Greenpeace Belgium and Brussels - based environmental consulting firm 3E map out an offshore network composed of 6,200 kilometers of undersea lines .
According to their models , this grid extension could add 68 gigawatts of wind power capacity by 2020 — enough to meet 13 % of net power demand of seven North Sea countries .
Yesterday the Washington , D.C. - based Council on Competitiveness , an alliance of corporate CEOs , university presidents and labor leaders , lent its support to grid expansion , urging the next U.S. president to create a “ national transmission superhighway . ”
The proposal is part of a broader “ 100 - Day Energy Action Plan ” .
The Council would empower the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to determine when and where expanded transmission capacity is needed , overriding state authorities .
“ As with the interstate highway system and the information superhighway , our leaders must knit together the current patchwork of regulations and oversight into a seamlessly connected electrical power highway , ” states the plan .
Proposals that need to be debated .

Thanks to an unattended Twitter widget , a website intended to promote the work of 50 young Republican volunteers became an unwitting showcase for the mockery of one group member Friday , when it emerged that the volunteer faked a macabre attack on herself and tried to pin it on a nonexistent Obama supporter and mugger .
Ashley Todd , a 20 - year - old college student and McCain volunteer , admitted on Friday that she made up a widely reported story about being mugged by a so - called big black guy at an ATM in Pittsburgh .
She falsely told police this week that her assailant became enraged after seeing a John McCain bumper sticker on her car , and proceeded to scratch a backwards " B " — for " Barack " — on her face .
It now appears the mark was self - inflicted , and police say it 's expected to heal completely .
Todd was one of the members of a group called 50 College Republicans that has been publicizing its activities through a blog and Twitter feed on a website called Life in the Field .
The volunteers ' tweets carried the hashtag " #litf08 . "
On Friday , commenters started using the tag to broadcast their disgust , causing the sarcastic tweets to be automatically displayed on the Republican site .
" Anyone know which Rove protege is responsible for #litf08 ?
Because they lack the execution skills of the man himself , " tweeted Matt
Browner - Hamlin , a former blogger for Sen. Chris Dodd , D - Conn .'s presidential campaign .
" Hmm , it was an okay Obama frame - job , just a few inconsistencies snagged you , " wrote another tweeter .
" Overall I 'd give you a ' B ' .
" Do 50 College Republicans try this kind of stunt often ? " asked Adamuu .
On that last question , Ethan Eilon , executive director of the College Republicans , says the group had " no idea that [ Todd ] was making this story up . "
He forwarded a statement from the communications director .
" When Ms. Todd initially contacted us claiming to have been attacked , our first reaction was obviously to be concerned for her safety , " said Ashley Barbera in a statement .
" We are as upset as anyone to learn of her deceit .
Ashley must take full responsibility for her actions . "
The gradual origin of the turtle shell with two hypothetical ancestors , from an animal with isolated lumps of armour , to one with a complete shell ( Image : Royal Society )
A newly identified fossil could explain one of evolution ’s biggest mysteries – the origin of the turtle ’s shell .
Bone fragments from a 210 - million year - old , land - dwelling reptile from New Mexico suggest that the earliest turtles did n’t have much of a shell at all .
Over millions of years , rows of protective armour plates gradually fused together and to the reptile ’s vertebrae , eventually creating a complete shell .

“ Turtles ultimately originated from something that looked like an armadillo , ” says lead author Walter Joyce , a palaeontologist at the Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven , Connecticut .
His colleague Spencer Lucas , of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque , discovered a neck - bone fragment of the new reptile more than a decade ago , but its provenance remained debatable because the skeleton was so small , Joyce says .
However , recent erosion revealed enough pieces of Chinlechelys tenertesta – Latin for thin - shelled turtle – to remove any doubt .
Unlike turtle fossils dating from the later Jurassic era – “ they ’re so common people stopped collecting them , ” Joyce says – Triassic turtles are few and far between .
That ’s probably because they lived on land , where fossilisation is far less likely to happen , he says .
The new animal is about 30 centimetres long , with a shell only a millimetre wide .
“ This one ’s by far the thinnest ever found , ” Joyce says .
More importantly , the reptile ’s dorsal ribs are n’t fully fused to its shell – or carapace – as is the case in later fossils and in modern turtles .
“ This is a crucial new discovery , ” says Guillermo Rougier , at the University of Louisville in Kentucky , who uncovered the first Triassic turtles in northwest Argentina .
These and other early turtles had already gained their carapaces and offered few clues as to its origin .
C. tenertesta , on the other hand , points to the body form that must have given rise to the shell .
“ This new guy is an animal that belong to the lineage of turtles , it ’s a proto - turtle in a way , ” he says .
Exactly why turtles evolved their shell remains a mystery , Joyce says .
A full shell might offer added protection and stability .
And the proof could be in the pudding – their body plan is the world ’s oldest , changing little over 200 million years .
“ For some reason just being a turtle is an idea that came along and just really works , ” he says .

For decades after the disaster , there was little doubt about what sank the Titanic .
When the " unsinkable " ship , the largest , most luxurious ocean liner of its time , crashed into an iceberg on its maiden voyage in 1912 , it took more than 1,500 of its 2,200 passengers to the bottom .
As the ship slipped into the North Atlantic , so , too , did the secret of how and why it sank .
[ See photos commemorating the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic . ]
Two government investigations conducted immediately after the disaster agreed it was the iceberg , not any weakness in the ship itself , that caused the Titanic to sink .
Both inquiries concluded the vessel had gone to the bottom intact .
Blame for the incident fell on the ship 's deceased captain , E. J. Smith , who was condemned for racing at 22 knots through a known ice field in the dark waters off the coast of Newfoundland .
The case of the Titanic was considered closed .
But lingering questions about what might have sunk the seemingly indestructible ship never completely disappeared .
In 1985 , when oceanographer Robert Ballard , after years of searching , finally located the ship 's remains 2.5 miles down on the ocean bottom , he discovered that it had , in fact , broken in two on the surface before sinking .
His findings made the Titanic rise again in the public imagination .
Why had it cracked , experts wondered ?
If the official inquiries were wrong , was the invincible Titanic weak ?
A few years after Ballard discovered the wreck , the first pieces of the ship were brought to the surface , raising even more eyebrows when they seemed to offer physical evidence that low - quality steel might have caused the disaster .
In 1997 , James Cameron 's film Titanic , largely mirroring the scientific consensus at the time , seared Titanic 's terrifying last moments , with its stern soaring high into the air before it cracked in two and disappeared , into popular memory .
Still , the search for answers about the Titanic did n't end there .
In two new books , a group of historians , naval architects , and materials scientists argue that fresh evidence has further unraveled the familiar story of the Titanic , raising more questions about what caused the disaster .
In What Really Sank the Titanic : New Forensic Discoveries , Jennifer Hooper McCarty , a materials scientist at Oregon Health and Science University , and Tim Foecke , a scientist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology , make the case that it was n't the ship 's steel that was weak ; it was the rivets , the all - important metal pins that held the steel hull plates together .
Titanic 's Last Secrets , to be published next month , describes the work of Richie Kohler and John Chatterton , wreck - diving historians who believe two recently discovered pieces of the Titanic 's bottom prove the ship 's stern never rose high in the air the way many Titanic experts , including Cameron , originally believed .
The two divers , whose discovery of a lost German U - boat was chronicled in the book Shadow Divers , say the ship broke up and sank while still relatively flat on the surface — a potential sign of weakness , they believe , that was covered up after the disaster .
When the Titanic 's keel was laid down in 1909 , Harland & Wolff , the Belfast shipbuilder that constructed the ship , certainly did n't believe its design would still be controversial a hundred years later .
Built in response to a rival company 's construction of a new generation of fast liners , Titanic and her sister ships , Olympic and Britannic , were the biggest ships ever made — from bow to stern , they were almost 900 feet long , dwarfing even the world 's biggest skyscrapers .
Specially outfitted to handle the challenges of the North Atlantic , including big waves and major collisions , they were also supposed to be among the safest .
The Titanic could stay afloat with four of its 16 watertight compartments flooded , more than anyone could imagine on a ship of its size .
On the night of April 14 , 1912 , though , only a few days into the Titanic 's maiden voyage , its Achilles ' heel was exposed .
The ship was n't nimble enough to avoid an iceberg that lookouts spotted ( the only way to detect icebergs at the time ) at the last minute in the darkness .
As the ice bumped along its starboard side , it punched holes in the ship 's steel plates , flooding six compartments .
In a little over two hours , the Titanic filled with water and sank .
Low quality .
More than 70 years passed before scientists were able to study the first physical evidence of the wreck .
As luck would have it , the first piece of steel pulled up from the bottom seemed to put an end to the mystery .
When the steel was placed in ice water and hit with a hammer , it shattered .
For much of the 1990s , scientists thought this " brittle " steel was responsible for the massive flooding .
Only recently has testing on other , bigger pieces of the ship disproved this theory .
The original piece , scientists discovered , had been unusually weak , while the rest of Titanic 's steel passed the tests .
" We know now there was nothing wrong with the steel , " says William Garzke , chairman of a forensics panel formed by the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers to investigate the wreck .
Experts looking for explanations landed on another potentially weak link :
The more than 3 million rivets holding the ship together .
McCarty and Foecke began examining 48 rivets brought up from the wreck and found they contained high concentrations of " slag , " a residue of smelting that can make metal fracture prone .
Researching in the Harland & Wolff archives , they discovered that the shipbuilder 's ambitious plans to build three large ships at the same time had put a huge strain on its shipyard .
" Not because of cost , but because of time pressures , they started using lower - quality material to fill the gaps , " says Foecke .
This substandard iron was pounded by hand into the ship 's bow and stern , where the large machines required to pound in steel rivets did n't fit .
Steel rivets , meanwhile , which are much stronger than iron , were put in the more - accessible middle of the ship .
When the Titanic hit the iceberg , McCarty and Foecke say , the weaker iron rivets in the bow popped , opening seams in the hull — and hurrying the ship 's demise .
It 's no accident , Foecke says , that the flooding stopped at the point in the hull where the steel rivets began .
Harland & Wolff , now an engineering and design firm , flatly rejects the notion that its rivets were weak .
Tom McCluskie , the company 's retired archivist , points out that Olympic , Titanic 's sister ship , was riveted with the same iron and served without incident for 25 years , surviving several major collisions , including being rammed by a British cruiser .
" Olympic deliberately rammed a German submarine during the First World War and cut it in half , " says McCluskie .
" She was plenty strong . "
The Britannic sank after hitting a mine during World War I .
Both ships were strengthened after the Titanic disaster with double hulls and taller bulkheads , but their rivets were never changed .
Stronger rivets might have slowed the sinking process , but once water began flooding six of the Titanic 's compartments , it was only a matter of time before the ship went down .
Questions remain , though , about exactly how and why the ship ultimately broke apart and sank .
In 2005 , an expedition organized by Kohler and Chatterton found a new clue .
Wandering away from the main wreckage site , they stumbled upon two large pieces of the ship 's bottom on the ocean floor .
Closer examination revealed the two hull sections had split exactly where the ship broke in two , making them a possible key to the mystery of the ship 's final moments .
Simon Mills , an Olympic - class - ship historian who advised the divers , calls the find " very likely the most interesting piece of Titanic research to be carried out in the last 20 years . "
When Roger Long , a naval architect hired to accompany the expedition , began analyzing the edges of the hull pieces , he came to a surprising conclusion .
It was impossible , he believed , for the ship to have broken up the way experts for two decades believed it did , with the stern rising up to a 45 - degree angle before the ship 's hull split .
" There are a lot of very contradictory things you can see in the pieces , " he says .
" But the only scenario I could come up with to explain all of the contradictions was that the ship broke at a very shallow angle . "
Close examination of the pieces showed that they had been interrupted in the middle of tearing apart — a sign , Long says , that the ship was still at a low - enough angle ( he estimates only 11 degrees ) that its stern could regain buoyancy as it began to crack .
If the back of the ship had been raised out of the water at a 45 - degree angle , as depicted in Cameron 's movie , once the stern tore off , nothing would have stopped it , and the hull pieces would have torn in two .
Why does it matter exactly how the ship broke in two ?
For Titanic 's passengers , it may have been the difference between life and death .
" In the movie , the stern rises up and [ then ] sinks , " says Chatterton .
" It 's this protracted , dramatic experience . "
But in Long 's scenario , the ship may have tilted over only slightly as the bow filled with water , giving those on board a false sense of security .
" If you 're standing on the deck with 10 degrees of incline , and they 're saying ' Quick , everyone into the lifeboats , ' you 're thinking , ' You know , things are n't looking so bad here , maybe I can just stay in the bar , ' " says Chatterton .
" The passengers and many of the crew did n't understand the seriousness of the situation they were in . "
Of course , since the Titanic had enough lifeboats for only half its passengers , many people were never going to make it off the ship alive .
When the bow filled with enough water , Long says , the ship split in two and sank in a matter of minutes .
Interestingly , much of the survivor testimony seems to confirm this sequence of events .
Charlie Joughin , Titanic 's chief baker , said that he had been standing near the stern when the ship went under , but he reported none of the signs of a high - angle break .
No suction , no big splash , and no roller - coaster ride to the surface .
He said he swam away from the ship without even getting his hair wet .
Unlike in the Cameron film , there was no huge wave reported from any of the lifeboats when the stern went under .
One survivor reported slipping into the water , turning around , and discovering the ship had disappeared .
" He was in the water 50 feet from the ship , he heard a ' shloop , ' and it was gone , " says Long .
" That 's not what a person would remember if 25,000 tons of steel fell nearby . "
Eyewitnesses .
While some survivors in the lifeboats did remember seeing the ship 's stern rising high in the air , Long says that might have been an optical illusion .
At an 11 - degree angle , the ship 's propellers would have been raised out of the water , making the ship , already nearly 20 stories tall , appear even taller and making its angle in the water appear even steeper .
Technical advisers to the movie Titanic say Cameron , who did not respond to a request for comment , may have been aware of this but exaggerated the angle at which the ship sank for effect .
Though experts still quibble about the exact nature of how the ship broke up , a consensus does seem to be forming around how Titanic sank .
" We all agree that the ship did sink at a shallow angle , " says Garzke , head of the naval architects ' forensics panel .
Historians believe Harland & Wolff was probably aware of this at the time , but when the official inquiries absolved the shipbuilder of any liability in the matter , the company did n't protest .
Some conspiracy theorists believe that the company 's silence was a sign of a coverup , and that the post - disaster retrofitting of Titanic 's sister ships proves Harland & Wolff knew its ship was flawed .
But most historians come to a different conclusion .
" The fact that the ship broke up on the surface does not mean she was weak , " says Long .
When 38,000 tons of water filled its bow , pushing the stern up even 11 degrees out of the water , the ship was loaded beyond its capacity and cracked in two .
Man 's oldest friend : Scientists discover the grandad of modern dogs ... from 31,700 years ago
For hundreds of years they 've been considered man 's best friend , and now it seems dogs have been around longer than thought .
Scientists have discovered the oldest - ever remains of dogs dating back 31,700 years - that 's 221,900 in dog years ...
The remains push back the date for the earliest dog by 14,000 years , and suggest the forefathers of the modern canine were a lot stronger and a lot hungrier than next - door 's Fido .
A Siberian husky , thought to most resemble the Paleolithic dogs of our forefathers
From studying the fossils , found at Goyet Cave in Belgium , the international team of scientists believe the animals subsisted on a diet of horse , musk ox and reindeer .
Lead author Mietje Germonpré , a paleontologist at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences , said : ' In shape , the Paleolithic dogs most resemble the Siberian husky , but in size , however , they were somewhat larger , probably comparable to large shepherd dogs .
' The Paleolithic dogs had wider and shorter snouts and relatively wider brain cases than fossil and recent wolves . '
Analysis of the animals ' bones found that the earliest dogs consumed horse , musk ox and reindeer , but not fish or seafood .
Since the European Aurignacian people are believed to have hunted big game and fished at different times of the year , the researchers think the dogs might have enjoyed meaty handouts during certain seasons .
DNA studies showed that the canids carried ' a substantial amount of genetic diversity , ' suggesting that past wolf populations were much larger than they are today .
Germonpré speculated that dog domestication began when the prehistoric hunters killed a female wolf and then brought home her pups .
Recent studies on silver foxes suggest that when the most docile pups are kept and cared for , it takes just 10 generations of breeding for morphological changes to take effect .
' I think it is possible that the dogs were used for tracking , hunting , and transport of game , ' she said .
' Transport could have been organized using the dogs as pack animals .
Furthermore , the dogs could have been kept for their fur or meat , as pets , or as an animal with ritual connotation . '

End of the new economy , among others
Govindraj Ethiraj | October 14 , 2008
T his is the best economy I 've ever seen in 50 years of studying it every day , Alan Greenspan told President Bill Clinton in May 1998 , as reported by journalist Bob Woodward in Maestro , Greenspan 's biography .
A little earlier , Greenspan had figured that there had been a stupendous boom in productive capital and the money that businesses were spending was yielding an extraordinary return because of increased worker productivity .
The computer , high technology investments and the Internet were paying off .
And , said Greenspan , the payoffs had to be real because the higher profits and economic growth had continued for several years now .
It was now almost two years earlier , in December 1996 , that Greenspan had spoken of irrational exuberance .
And the stock markets had not stopped expanding .
Greenspan for long had wondered why prices continued to stay stable even as profits were rising for American corporations .
Several bouts of exhaustive accounting investigations later , he was closer to understanding the effects of computerization , which " ensured that there were few shortages or bottlenecks in the economy , allowing for quick replacement and quick refurnishing " .
Which brings me to the " byproducts of a meltdown " theory .
Which is that while there may be a period of pain for businesses and investors , as must follow any period of excesses , such phases also bring with them some welcome corrections and shift in perspectives .
Undoubtedly this has been expressed many times before but there are always a few differences here and there .
My primary submission would be that the current market meltdown marks the end of the post - dotcom new economy .
What Michael Lewis in his book called it the ' New New Thing is the Old Old Thing ' and is almost as much part of the economic output equation as is perhaps electricity .
So if the new economy is indeed pretty old and is either the real economy or just the economy , then why would the companies that support the efforts of " corporations trying to ease the bottlenecks " , to use Greenspan 's term of a decade ago , be bigger than the companies who are doing the de-bottlenecking to hold their profits , or more appropriately now , survive .
Now this question obviously could have been posed at any point in the last eight years and the answer could have been the same .
Yet it takes market shake - ups to review belief systems .
It 's happened to investment banking in this round , in case you did n't notice .
Until last month , Wall Street was defined by them .
Now it almost appears like they never existed .
A little background on the new economy in the Indian context .
The growth of IT services exploded with the Y2 K opportunity as Indian IT companies used that platform to integrate with global corporations ' thrust for higher productivity and lower costs .
So much so that despite the dotcom bubble burst in 2000 , most inherently strong technology companies began bouncing back by 2003 with the rest of the market - in India and overseas - with many hitting lifetime highs in late 2007 .
Since 2000 , companies like Infosys [ Get Quote ] have been held as " bellwether " stocks for the Indian market as a whole .
For two reasons broadly .
First , they have been high - performing companies with very strong managements leading them .
Second , because the general belief , rightly so , has been that the businesses were somehow insulated from everything else happening around because of the inherent and integrated nature of their offerings .
The first part still holds , the second does not .
This article is not arguing about whether or not IT companies will get beaten down because of their exposure to European and North American banks and financial institutions , which they will to some extent ; rather that the byproduct of this meltdown is that these companies and their performances will be viewed through a different lens .
Information technology is not the only sector .
Nowhere in the world have I seen or heard of real estate firms enjoy such attention and capital markets patronage as they did in India for a while .
They may continue to do so in the next bounce - back but I would reckon that their dream run is over .
And there were will be other sectors as well .
Put more simply , the hot growth sectors of the 2000 - 2008 phase may not enjoy the same status in the next wave .
As it must happen .
But one key byproduct will be a look at companies that contribute to the direct growth and expansion of the real domestic economy .
That 's what will help us in the next phase of growth , not a renewed focus on the earnings of the same companies that " powered " the previous bull - run .
Obama spokesman : Fox 'a mix of an infomercial for McCain and the X - Files ' Nick Juliano and David Edwards
Published : Thursday October 9 , 2008
Print This Email This John McCain's $ 300 billion mortgage buy - up plan came under intense criticism from economists and experts Thursday because of the burden it would place on taxpayers .
On the same day , McCain released a video press release attacking his Democratic opponent for previously associating with a former ' 60s radical .
Quick , guess what the hosts of Fox & Friends wanted to talk about !
Why , Barack Obama and Bill Ayers , of course .
A spokesman for the Democratic candidate was determined not to let the morning co-hosts sit comfortably in their positions as unofficial McCain mud-slingers .
Following the lead of Obama strategist Robert Gibbs , who tore into Sean Hannity earlier this week , Obama Press Secretary Bill Burton accused Steve Doocey and Gretchen Wilson of wallowing in the mud of distraction rather than discussing issues voters care about .
" I 'm guessing you guys do n't want to talk about the economy , huh ? "
Burton said to kick off the interview .
He was right .
Taking their cues from a 90 - second Web ad , which by the way the McCain campaign is n't even bothering to pay to air on television , the Fox hosts would not be swayed from their exclusively Ayers related questions .
Burton reiterated that Obama and Ayers did cross paths a few times , many years ago , Obama deplores the actions of the Weather Underground , and Bill Ayers has nothing to do with any of the real and pressing problems facing the country .
" The fact is , this morning we wake up ... and every newspaper from the Washington Post to the Wall Street Journal , which loves John McCain , says that he has a new program -- it's $ 300 billion -- it 's terrible .
What it does is it puts taxpayers on the hook ( for bad mortgages ) , but we 're not talking about that right now , we 're talking about something that 's already been asked and answered and discussed , " Burton said .
" John McCain , as his campaign has said over and over again , does not want to talk about the economy because if they do they lose . "
Doocey jumped in , doing his damnedest to steer the conversation back to Ayers , making the completely unfounded accusation that Obama is lying about meeting Ayers in the mid-90s , because their wives happened to work at the same huge law firm 10 years earlier .
" Watching TV this morning , it 's like a mix between an infomercial for the McCain campaign and an episode of the X - Files , with all the conspiracies and criss - crossing suggestions of associations and secret meetings and things like that , " Burton said .
" No , we 've said before that Sen. Obama did n't know him until 1995 . "
The hosts would n't give up .
Doocey tried to shout down Burton a couple times , while the network displayed an incendiary photo of Ayers stomping on an American flag .
Wilson demanded " a specific date " for when Obama learned the full details of Ayers 's past .
" Gretchen , this is ridiculous .
It 's completely ridiculous , " Burton charged .
" These questions have been asked and answered , over and over again ....
It 's a distraction , but I understand this is what the McCain campaign wants to talk about .
And , you know , they 're pretty effectively getting to talk about it , and getting me to talk about it on Fox News this morning because of this ad they put out . "
Wilson seemed to take offense at the seemingly undeniable accusation that she was taking her cues directly from the McCain campaign , defending the inquiry as a response to " our viewers " wanting to know about Ayers as well .
" I 'm sure you 've got McCain supporters watching Fox News , that 's not news to anybody , " Burton quipped .
" But the fact is , I bet your [ viewers ] would love to know what 's going on with this $ 300 billion plan that John McCain is going to saddle taxpayers on . "
After some sputtering about the " independent " voters who watch Fox News , Burton was abruptly dismissed and the program cut to a commercial .

Initial steps on kdb
For basic dump analysis , this article is mostly interested in a dump image .
Here , we cover how to extract the appropriate files from the snap package and then explain a methodical approach to examine the dump , and find the fundamental reason for a system crash .
The dump file and the UNIX ® file are in the dump subdirectory of the snap package .
Though we are primarily focused on the dump image , it is important to note that snap can provide you with useful information when used with appropriate options .
Additional information is found in the General and Kernel subsections of the article .
General
This general directory includes information about the system runtime environment , for example :
Copy of ODM data .
All environment variables ( e.g. , PATH and TZ ) .
Date and time the data was collected .
Amount of real memory on the system ( bootinfo - r ) .
Listing of all defined paging spaces .
Listing of all installed filesets and their levels .
Listing of all installed APARs .
Device attributes ( lsattr - El ) .
System VPD information ( lscfg - pv ) .
Status of last dump ( sysdumpdev - L ) .
Kernel
The kernel subdirectory contains useful kernel information ( Process and memory data ) .
Date and time the data was collected
Vmstat output
VMM tunable information ( vmo - L ) .
Scheduling tunable information ( schedo - L ) .
I/O related tunable iformation ( ioo - L ) .
Environment variables .
SRC information ( lssrc - a ) .
Process information ( ps - ef and ps - leaf ) .
Checksum of device drivers and methods .
Extracting the snap package
The pax command is used to extract files from the snap package .
To view the contents of a snap package , type : # zcat snap.pax .Z | pax -v
To extract the entire contents of a package , type : # zcat snap.pax .Z | pax -r
To extract just the dump , general , and kernel subdirectories , type : #uncompress snap.pax .
Z #zcat snap.pax .Z | pax -r ./ dump ./ general ./ kernel
What is kdb ?
The kdb uitility examines the operating system image of the current running system and is very tightly coupled with the IBM ® AIX ® kernel .
This is because it requires knowledge of the structures used by the kernel to correctly format the information contained in the system dump image .
The kdb command has many subcommands for viewing and formatting data structures .
KDB - The Kernel Debugger
kdb is an interactive kernel debugger .
kdb allows the user to control execution of kernel code ( including kernel extensions and device drivers ) , and to observe and modify the variables and register .
It has to be invoked by a special boot image .
The kdb is a tool / command for analysing the system dumps .
It is used for post - mortem analysis of system dumps , or for monitoring the running kernel .
Invoking kdb
kdb is invoked with two arguments when examining a system dump .
The first specifies the dump image , and the second specifies the UNIX file of the kernel that was running on the system at the time of the dump .
The UNIX file must match the dump image ( i.e. , be the one that was running at the time of crash ) .
If it does not , kdb displays an error message and exits .
# kdb [ dump ] [ unix ]
When invoked with no arguments , the kdb examines the image of the currently running system .
# kdb
Getting dump status
Upon invoking kdb on a dump image , you first retrieve the basic dump status using the stat subcommand :
Figure 1 .
Stat output
The stat subcommand of kdb provides information about the dump we are looking at .
Along with date , time , version , and release information , we also find the dump reason code .
Dump reason code
If a dump was initiated because the system detected a problem , then the output of the stat subcommand contains a section titled CRASH INFORMATION .
The first line of output in this section lists the CPU that detected the problem that caused the dump routine to be invoked ( CPU 0 in the previous example ) .
The dump reason code is the first three digits of the number displayed next to the text : error code for LEDs .
In the previous example the first line of the CRASH INFORMATION section contains the following text error code for LEDs : 30000000
This means that the Dump Reason Code is 300 , meaning DSI ( DATA STORAGE INTERRUPT ) .
The Dump Reason Code indicates the fundamental reason for the crash .
Most often crashes show reason codes 300 , 400 , and 700 .
Reason Code Description 2nn Machine Check 3nn Data Storage Interrupt 400 Instruction Storage Interrupt 5nn External Interrupt 700 Programm Interrupt 800 Floating Data Unavailable
2nn-Machine check .
A machine check reason code usually indicates a hardware problem ( for example , bad memory ) .
3nn -Data Storage Interrupt ( DSI ) .
A DSI occurs whenever a reference is made to a virtual address that is not currently loaded in physical memory ( this is a page fault ) .
Page faults occur all the time .
They are normally handled by VMM and do not normally result in a system crash .
However , if a page fault cannot be resolved while in kernel mode or if a page fault occurs when interrupts are disabled , then a DSI will cause a system crash .
The root cause is usually software , but may occasionally be hardware related .
400 - Instruction Storage Interrupt ( ISI ) .
An instruction storage interrupt is a page fault on an instruction fetch .
This would normally be resolved by the VMM and would not normally result in a system crash .
If it can not be resolved by the VMM , or if the page fault occurs when interrupts are disabled , the system will crash .
5nn-External Interrupt .
Crash is caused by an interrupt from a external device , such as an I / O bus controller .
700 - Program Interrupt .
This type of crash results when a kernel routine invokes a trap instruction .
This is normally from a call to the panic kernel service or from a failed assert .
A kernel routine will call panic when it has encountered a problem that it cannot resolve .
The ultimate cause is frequently software , but can also be hardware related .
800 - Floating point unavailable .
An attempt was made to execute a floating point instruction when the floating point available bit in the MSR ( machine status register ) was disabled .
Initial CPU context
kdb always starts in the context of the CPU running the crashing thread .
When we invoke kdb , the prompt is shown as : ( n ) > > , where n is a number that indicates the current CPU context .
However , to change the context to another CPU , use the cpu subcommand :
( 0 ) >> cpu 1 ( 1 ) >>
MST ( MACHINE STATE SAVE AREA )
The Machine State save area , or MST , contains a saved image of the CPU 's process context .
The process context includes the general purpose registers , floating point registers , the special purpose registers , and other information necessary to restart a thread when it is dispatched .
Each processor on the CPU has its own CSA ( current save area ) pointer that points to the MST that is to be used when a thread or interrupt handler is interrupted or swapped due to context switch .
While a thread is active , the CSA for the processor running that thread will point to the MST of the current active thread .
One of the fields in the MST is a pointer to the previous MST ( prev in kdb ) .
This field will only be filled in in interrupt context .
Figure 2 . Chain of MST structures represents an interrupt history
The mst subcommand : mst [ thread_slot | thread_table_address ] provides a formatted display of the MST for the specified thread .
If no address is specified , it displays the MST area for the current processor .
Figure 3 . Output of the mst subcommand on 64 - bit kernel
Figure 4 . Output of the mst subcommand on 32 - bit kernel
Data fields in mst subcommand output
iar - The instruction address register .
Contains the location of the faulting instruction ( for the faulting MST ) .
It is the current instruction that has been executed during the time of crash .
lr -Value of the link register .
Contains the return address of the function .
Except - Displays the exception structure .
Gives information about the nature of the crash .
r0 - r31 shows the contents of general purpose registers .
intpri-Indicates the interrupt priority level .
Indicates if the processor is running with interrupts disabled .
prev-If the value is zero .
The MST represents the base - level thread that was running on the processor .
If the value is non-zero , then the processor was handling an interrupt .
The prev field points to the next MST structure in the chain .
The values in the prev and intpri fields help in determining whether the processor is running a thread or an interrupt handler .
When a CPU is running a thread , the thread can be either in process context or interrupt context .
Interrupt handlers always run in interrupt context .
Figure 5 . Process - Interrupt context
The main difference between the process and interrupt environments is that no page faults are permitted while in the interrupt environment .
The Machine State Register ( MSR )
Each CPU has its own MSR , which indicates the status of the processor .
dr msr /* dr cmd is used to dump the contents of any register */
( 0 ) > dr msr msr : 0000F0B2 bit set : EE PR FP ME IR DR RI
Figure 6 . MST register
Evaluating MSR data
When examining the system dump , we are only interested in what was running on the CPU that caused the crash .
If the PR bit in MSR is set ( Problem State ) , then the CPU was running in user mode , and is unlikely to be the cause of the crash .
This is because user mode instructions do not have sufficient privileges to cause the system to crash .
In the case of dumps where the dump reason code is 300 or 400 , we have to evaluate the exception structure .
Figure 7 . Exception structure
The dar ( Data Address Register ) contains the address that the processor tried to access , which then caused a page fault .
The dsisr ( Data Storage Interrupt Status Register ) indicates why the page fault could not be resolved .
Figure 8 . DSISR bits description
The dsirr ( Data Storage Interrupt reason Register ) indicates the type of page fault that has occurred .
Decoding the dsirr is done by converting the hexadecimal value to decimal .
Values between 1 to 127 are error numbers ( shown in /usr / include / sys / errno.h ) , whereas between 128 to 512 are exceptions ( shown in /usr / include / sys/ m_except.h ) .
We have to evaluate the IAR value shown in the mst output .
In particular we will examine the instruction that is referenced by the IAR , to confirm that it could cause the type of crash reported by the stat subcommand
VMM error log
Figure 9 . Vmlog output
The vmlog subcommand provides additional information when the reason for the crash came from VMM .
The Error ID shown in the case of code 300 dump is DSI_PROC , or ISI_PROC in the case of code 400 dump .
The Exception DSISR / ISISR , srval , virt addr will contain the same information as that shown in the exception structure .
The Exception value is an internal VMM error code .
Stack trace
f [ threadtableslot | threadtableaddress ]
It displays the kernel mode stack trace of the thread .
When given with no arguments , displays stack trace for the current CPU context .

DSI example
The image above shows the output from the stat command .
The error code indicated by the output is 300 , which means this is a DSI crash .
Figure 12 .
DSI trace
The stack trace shown above describes that the problem appears to have happened when a thread running on CPU 0 ran the function __memmove .
Figure .
13 . mst command output
The output of the mst subcommand shows that the thread was running ( indicated by prev =0 ) with all interrupts enabled ( indicated by intpri =0B ) .
In other words , the thread was running in the process environment .
The dsisr field of the exception structure has a two - bit set , DSISR_PROT and DSISR_ST .
The DSISR_PROT field indicates that there has been a protection violation .
The DSISR_ST bit indicates that the problem was with the store operation .
The data address that caused the page fault problem was 0x00 ( dar 0000000000000000 ) .
The DSISR_ST bit in the dsisr field of the exception structure indicates the problem was a store operation .
We expect the IAR to reference a store instruction of some form .
0 ) > dc @iar ___memmove64+000058 std r7,8( r3 )
The current contents of r7 will be stored at the memory address calculated by adding 0x08 to the current value of r3 .
From the output of the mst subcommand , we can see that the current value of r3 is FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF8 , so by adding 0x08 to FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF8 we get :
( 0 ) > hcal FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF8+0x08
Value hexa : 00000000
Value decimal : 0
So this means the current contents of r7 will be stored at the address 0X00 .
This matches with the value shown in the dar field of the exception structure .
The first page of virtual memory in the kernel address space can be accessed by kernel code , but is marked as read - only .
Any attempt to write to this memory range will result in a protection violation .
Process and threads
The proc subcommand
When invoked with an asterix ( * ) , the proc subcommand displays one line summary of each active process in the process table .
When invoked with a process table address or slot number , the proc subcommand displays detailed formatted process information for the specified address or slot .
( If the proc subcommand is invoked with no arguments , it displays detailed formatted process information for the current process . )

The thread subcommand
When invoked with an asterix ( * ) , the thread subcommand displays a one - line summary for each active thread in the thread table .
When invoked with a thread table address or slot number , the thread subcommand displays detailed formatted thread information for the specified thread .
( If the thread sudcommand is invoked with no arguments , it displays detailed formatted thread information for the current thread . )

Current thread and process
The status subcommand lists the current thread and process information for all CPUs .

Other kdb subcommands
By default , kdb works in the symbolic mode , and the addresses mostly are shown in output as symbol + offset .
Figure 19 . kdb output
Here pvproc+000000 is in the Symbol + Offset format .
Using ns or set no_symbol , we can change the above format : Figure 20 .
ns command output
Use the nm subcommand to get the address of the symbol and Table Of Contents ( TOC ) section of the executable module that contains symbols .
Figure 21 . nm command output
lke subcommand with no arguments lists the currently loaded extensions
ts subcommand to translate the address to the symbolic representation
CALCULATORS - Use hcal for hexadecimal , dcal for decimal calculation
Logging the kdb session - ( 0 ) > set logfile filename .
( 0 ) > set loglevel 2
The loglevel can be set to 0,1 , or 2 .
This determines the type of information that will be logged in a log file .
The value of 0 disables logging into the log file .
The value of 1 logs only the kdb commands typed at the prompt .
The value of 2 logs both the input and the output of the kdb session .
Conclusion
Because finding the root cause of system crash issues can be a tedious process , it is helpful to know how kdb can provide a methodological approach to analyze the crash issues .
Using kdb , you will be able to track down the system crash problems quickly .
In addition , you will gain a valuable skill that will not only save lots of time from the debugging perspective , but it will provide insight as to what coding practices will avoid system crash in the future .
Last but not the least , this approach will provide a methodological approach to solve the crash issue very quickly , gaining customer confidence .

On the heels of a McCain supporter yelling that Obama was a “ terrorist ” today – and McCain said nothing in response to admonish the supporter – the Washington Post reports ( via ThinkProgress ) that a Palin supporter at one of her rallies today yelled for Obama to be assassinated after Palin , again , told the lie that some of Obama ’s best friends are terrorists :
“ Now it turns out , one of his earliest supporters is a man named Bill Ayers , ” Palin said .
“ Boooo ! ” said the crowd .
“ And , according to the New York Times , he was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that , quote , ‘ launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and our U.S. Capitol , ' ” she continued .
“ Boooo ! ” the crowd repeated .
“ Kill him ! ” proposed one man in the audience .
Palin went on to say that “ Obama held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers ’s living room , and they ’ve worked together on various projects in Chicago . ”
Palin went on ?
Just like she did when speakers at her church said that terrorist attacks against Israelis were “ God ’s judgment ” for Jews having the audacity not to embrace Christianity .
Just like she did when a visiting witch doctor at her church lamented the fact that , as he claimed , Jews control the banking industry and that ’s why Wall Street is so corrupt .
Not a word from Sarah Palin when her supporters talk of killing Barack Obama .
Not a word from Sarah Palin when her own church talks of the propriety of launching terrorist attacks against Jews in Israel .
In one day , McCain ’s supporters are so enraged by McCain ’s new rhetoric , calling Obama an un-American terrorist sympathizer , that McCain ’s supporters are now labeling Obama himself a “ terrorist ” and calling for him to be killed .
And McCain has no problem with this .
Nor does Sarah Palin .

As taxpayers we are now all potentially supporting these banks with our own money , and it is right that we have a say in how they are run .
Executives who have presided over their institutions like personal fiefdoms driven by ego and hubris have turned out to be architects of their firms ' downfall .
Why they are still in place is beyond me .
At the very least , we should demand their heads .
Chief author of his bank 's demise is Sir Fred Goodwin , who heads Royal Bank of Scotland and whose nickname " Fred the shred " reflects his approach to businesses he takes over .
But " shred " could now equally be applied to the bank itself .
RBS has never recovered from Goodwin 's ego - driven deal to buy Dutch bank ABN Amro at the top of the market last year .
Goodwin is paid handsomely for his stewardship of the bank that owns the high street brand NatWest .
Last year , he took home £ 5.4 m in salary and bonus , and that was without his long - term incentive plan paying out .
But his ambition to be a world leader has almost broken the 281 - year - old institution .
RBS paid a high price for Goodwin 's obstinate pursuit of ABN Amro.
Competition with his arch-rival John Varley , who runs Barclays , could have been a factor in his persistence .
Varley had agreed a merger with ABN Amro before Goodwin came along to spoil the deal .
The RBS chief recruited partner banks to help him pay top dollar for the Dutch institution .
He pursued the takeover against dissenting voices among his own shareholders - even after ABN Amro had sold the American assets he prized , and when it became clear the world had changed as the credit crunch took hold .
The £ 47bn deal - the biggest cross - border banking takeover to date - was finalised late last year , just as banks were finding that sources of funding were drying up .
Nevertheless , Goodwin insisted the deal would be good for RBS , and that it could cope with the cost of its share of the takeover ; two other banks were involved - one of which , Fortis , has now been nationalised by the Belgian and Dutch authorities .
Six months later , as RBS reported its financial results , Goodwin stuck to his script about not needing to raise additional funds .
But barely a month later he was asking shareholders for £ 12bn to boost the bank 's capital .
Of course , now RBS looks as if it will ask for government money too .
This unhappy record has seen Goodwin express his regret to shareholders after the bank made the biggest loss in its recent history earlier this year .
RBS shares have fallen by nearly 80 % over the past year .
But so far he and the entire RBS board - five of whom earned bonuses of more than £ 1 m each last year - remain in their jobs .
Barclays boss Varley , who fought with Goodwin over ABN Amro , had a lucky escape .
But rather than learning a lesson about expensive international adventures , he is intent on building up Barclays ' overseas operations .
Its president , Bob Diamond , has been able to buy assets from the defunct American investment bank , Lehmans , to help turn Barclays into a force on Wall Street .
Diamond , who was paid more than his boss , taking home £ 36 m last year , wants to expand Barclays ' trading and investment banking business .
Whether this is a suitable ambition for a new era of austerity in the industry is questionable .
That brings us to the hapless HBOS , whose shares have dropped almost 90 % in the course of a year , and which has had to be rescued by Lloyds TSB in a deal that flouts all existing competition rules .
The youthful Andy Hornby , who runs it , also appears to be a leader for a different era .
He was recruited from Asda 10 years ago , when banks believed they were retail operations and needed the skills of a marketing man .
Hornby , who tarted up the branches to make them more like shops and hired Howard , the singing bank manager for the group 's advertising campaigns , is probably responsible for changing the way we think about banks .
While HBOS retrenched its mortgage lending early last year after it became worried about the housing market , it remains a major supplier of funds to large entrepreneurs and private equity companies .
Hornby relies for much of his financing on the wholesale banking market , which has dried up .
These exposures have spooked investors and worried other banks , who are wary of lending , forcing HBOS into the arms of the more staid Lloyds TSB .
Banks are supposed to be risk - averse institutions .
They are custodians of our money , and we expect them to protect it .
But it seems the current generation of bankers has forgotten this age - old adage and become carried away with the idea of turning their retail networks into international powerhouses .
Now that gamble has not worked , they have come running to us to help them out .
In response we should start by insisting that these bank bosses pay with their jobs , and forgo the large payouts to which they will say they are entitled .
This could be time to test their employment contracts in court .
If Gordon Brown means what he says , it is time to hold the bankers to account .

The Audi Calamaro is a futuristic concept car designed by Tibor , a Hungarian design student .
Its mad futuristic styling seems to cross a dolphin , a speed boat and a jet fighter and I can’t help but draw a comparison to the awesome Seabreacher submarine .
There ’s no information on how this thing would actually fly , so I ’m going to speculate ( feel free to disagree in the comments ) .
The only way I can imagine this vehicle actually getting off the ground , is via that housing at the front .
If it contained an inverted tilt - rotor or small jet - engines like the ones Jet Man used to fly across the Channel , we could be in action .
Hovering and forward motion could be controlled by tilting the engine slightly , plus the engine ’s weight should be enough to keep the vehicle level .
As it has no wings to provide lift , the rotors could never be perpendicular to the ground like a true tilt - rotor … except in a free - fall .
It could n’t fly fast like a plane , but I believe it would work … however inefficiently .

How to Choose and Buy a Karaoke Machine
Here are some hints and tips on things to consider when choosing and buying a karaoke machine :
Type of Karaoke Machine
The first thing to decide is whether you want a DVD Player / Karaoke Machine or a stand - alone karaoke machine .
If you already have a good home entertainment system , you may want to choose a DVD Player / Karaoke Machine , as you can use your home entertainment system speakers with it .
These models are also versatile as you can use them in the same way as a standard DVD player , and they tend to be compact and easy to store .
However , if you are looking for a karaoke machine that has its own in - built speakers and television screen , the stand - alone karaoke machine will be the best option .
These tend to be bulkier but are ideal if you are going to be having regular karaoke sessions .
If your karaoke machine is only going to be used by the kids , you may want to consider buying one of the funky and fun karaoke machines or stands specifically designed for children .
You should also check the product description of any model that you are considering to make sure that it plays the type of disc that you are likely to use .
The main types of disc used are CDs , CDGs and DVDs .
You can find out more about these different types of karaoke machines and karaoke discs on our Types of Karaoke Machine page .
Effects and Features
When you are using your karaoke machine , you ’ll want to make your voice sound as good as you can , and different models of karaoke machine have different features and effects to help you to do this .
Check the product descriptions carefully to make sure that your chosen model has the effects that you think you ’ll want .
Some of the features and effects that you can get are :
Pitch controller – this alters the pitch of the backing track by speeding it up or slowing it down so that you can change it to suit your vocal range

Dr Toben has in the past described the Holocaust as ' a lie ' British courts should refuse to act on an EU arrest warrant requesting the extradition of an alleged Holocaust denier , a senior Lib Dem has said .
Australian citizen Dr Gerald Toben was remanded in custody after his arrest by British police at Heathrow Airport .
German authorities allege Dr Toben published material online " of an anti-Semitic and / or revisionist nature " .
But home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said holocaust denial is not a crime in the UK and he should not be extradited .
Dr Toben , a German - born former schoolteacher , was en route from the United States to Dubai when he was arrested .
He has been remanded in custody ahead of a bail hearing on 10 October and a full hearing on 17 October .
He has previously been convicted in Germany for breaking a law that prohibits denying or " playing down " the mass murder of the Jews under Hitler .
We do n't in this country tend to prosecute people for issues that we regard as issues of freedom of speech
Chris Huhne
But some human rights campaigners have backed his case , saying that his views - however unpleasant - do not make him a criminal in the UK .
The Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) , acting for the German authorities , argues that agreements signed in 2003 between the UK and other European countries mean that Britain is duty - bound to assist the German authorities .
But Mr Huhne , a former MEP , told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that countries could " pick and choose " cases in which they would apply warrants issued by fellow EU member states .
The Lib Dem home affairs spokesman said there were good legal grounds for refusing to participate .
He cited the case of Belgium , which is refusing to send suspects to Poland on murder charges which related to abortion .
Mr Huhne said : " There is a clear precedent for doing this and I think we should in this case . "
Dr Toben has in the past described the Holocaust as " a lie " and has claimed on his Australian - based website , the Adelaide Institute , there was " no proof " Hitler systematically exterminated the Jews .
' Pretty dodgy '
While stressing that he was completely opposed to anti-Semitism , Mr Huhne said : " We do n't in this country tend to prosecute people for issues that we regard as issues of freedom of speech . "
Mr Huhne said the case seemed " pretty dodgy " given the fact the offence was not committed in Germany .
In his court appearance earlier this week , Dr Toben , 64 , claimed he was the victim of a " legal ambush " and promised never to return to Britain if he was allowed to leave .
Judges will decide whether the alleged conduct constitutes an extraditable offence .

On the very northernmost coast of Taiwan lies the spookily bizarre San Zhi resort , which consists entirely of circular , multi-coloured pods stacked on top of one another .
Furthermore , these strange habitats have been completely abandoned for a number of years , and are slowly rotting away into nothing .
One story says that the project had to be abandoned after several fatal accidents occurred during construction , and according to local rumours , this ghost city is now haunted by those who died building it .
There seems to be very little actual information about these buildings available online ( at least in English ) , but they may have been built by the government in the early 80s “ in an attempt to position this as a luxurious holiday location for the rich of Taipei ” .
The concept behind the strange design might have been that they could expand the buildings vertically as required , simply by adding more pods on top .

What are the 11 most interesting Wind Turbine Designs ?
Today ’s hottest job market for mariners is Offshore Oil and Gas but this is by no means the only controversial industry segment which presents opportunities to mariners .
Like exploratory drilling , Offshore wind farms have also raised controversy among industry experts but presents unique job opportunities for those looking for more than the average liner run .
Today we look at the 5 most interesting wind turbine designs .
.
Helix Wind
Helix Wind , who offers a well - designed system that creates electricity to power any home or small business .
The Savonius turbine - based design catches wind from all directions , creating smooth powerful torque to spin the electric generator .
It ’s mounted up to 35 feet high , in winds as low as 10 mph , thus allowing the Helix system to fulfill electricity needs , while being congruous with the environment .
The strength of the wind is captured by Helix ’s distinctive and efficient vertical blade design .
The vertical Savonious 2.0 and Savonious 5.0 have a patent pending design which empowers the turbine to convert wind power into energy less than 5 decibels above background noise .
Translation …
The noise that the turbine makes is similar to the noise generated when wind passes through a tree or a house , compared to conventional horizontal wind turbines that operate at up to ten times above the wind speed , which is responsible for the piercing whistling sound near wind farms .

QuietRevolution
This is equivalent to about five low - energy houses ’ electricity demand , or the electrical needs of a twenty man office .
Unlike other turbines which are usually noisy the unique shape of the quietrevolution turbine allows it to operate in near silent which is ideal for operating close to residential areas .
The distinctive helical shape of the turbine is also eye pleasing which is impotent since many communities rejected wind turbines because of their visual impact .

Selsam Super Turbine
The innovative Selsam SuperTurbine off - shore concept was designed for simplicity , as it eliminates all components that do not directly contribute to power generation , resulting in a low - cost wind turbine .
The unit is equipped with multiple , synchronous , small rotors and with a universal joint that enables it to tilt .
Because of this structure , the turbines resemble reeds bending in the wind .
The optional addition of a blimp can make this floating wind turbine even more powerful .
The Selsam prototype was able to produce 6,000 watts in 32.5 mph winds , proving the efficiency and effectiveness of the design .

Salsam Sky Serpant
The advantages of the SuperTurbine design are many .
First , during large and fierce storms , these deep water turbines may intentionally lay down by flooding chambers , or even completely submerge to survive .
Bonus !
Second , flotation near the surface forms a fulcrum , with the weight of the rotors and driveshaft balanced by a downward force from the mooring below .
According to the site , this allows the turbine to bend similar to arching your back to take advantage of wind patterns much more easily .
Additionally , the rotors can be staggered , spiral , or in line .

The LoopWing
This is the “ LoopWing ” wind turbine .
It is soon to be unveiled in Japan ’s Eco-Products 2006 Exhibition .
The E1500 model turbine is aimed at homeowners , and it sports a unique wing design that operates with low vibration , and at wind speeds as low as 1.6 m/sec .
The efficiency specs on the turbine are vague — “ 43 % power performance at optimum wind speeds ” is all published .

The Egg Beater
BSI , the British Standards Institute , gave first prize in its Sustainability Awards 2007 to Ben Storan for his “ afforable personal wind turbine suited to the urban environment . ”
According to the BSI ,
The result is a unique design which uses vertical , rather than traditional horizontal , rotation .
This feature gives a slower rotational speed , which allows the turbine to capture more energy from turbulent air flow , common to urban environments .
It also means quieter operation .

Magenn Air Generator
Magenn Air Generator –
While designed for shore based power stations , not ships , could they one day be repurposed ? ”
Magenn ’s system is a lighter - than - air wind turbine capable of powering a rural village – the 30 metre wide , helium - filled “ Air Rotor System ” contains a turbine that spins around a horizontal axis and can produce 10 kilowatts of energy as it floats above the ground while attached to a copper tether .
Larger models — ones that might power a skyscraper — are also reportedly in the works .
The company claims the governments of India and Pakistan have expressed interest in the first version .
Magenn is planning to launch a 1 kw prototype ( costing around C$ 1 million ) into the air above Ottawa this ( northern ) spring . ”

Kite Turbine
Chetwoods Associates , an architectural group from Great Britain , has come up with a new environmental design that promises to capture wind power in an odd but innovative manner :
By using a huge replica sail as a model .
The first version of this idea will use a giant spinnaker sail placed in a mountain gorge near Russia ’s Lake Ladoga area .
A spinnaker is a type of sail usually made for boats taking wind from ‘ a reaching course to a downwind , i.e. with the wind 90 ° – 180° off the bow . ’
It ’s supposed to take in the wind , powerfully generated between a mountainside channel , and then further funnel that energy through an attached turbine .
It ’s safe to assume that there would be power conduit beneath the river to drag in the converted energy for community use .

WindSpiral Turbine
At a height of 30 ft. tall and only 2 feet wide , the WindSpire converts wind energy into measurable electricity through a vertical design , a rotor / generator system ( with a low speed giromill and rotating ‘ air core ’ motors ) , and a wireless modem that an owner can track on a computer .
It produces about 1900 kilowatt hours per year in 12 mile per hour average winds , which is about a quarter of the total energy used by a regular U.S. house .
But the key promise mentioned in the video , is that if the spire was twice as thick , it could likely produce 100 % of the energy needs of a household .

MagLev Wind Turbine
The MagLev wind turbine is expected take wind power technology to the next level with magnetic levitation .
Magnetic levitation is an extremely efficient system for wind energy .
Here ’s how it works : the vertically oriented blades of the wind turbine are suspended in the air above the base of the machine , replacing the need for ball bearings .
The turbine uses “ full - permanent ” magnets , not electromagnets – therefore , it does not require electricty to run .
The full - permanent magnet system employs neodymium ( “ rare earth ” ) magnets and there is no energy loss through friction .
This also helps reduce maintenance costs and increases the lifespan of the generator .

Laddermill
Researchers at Delft University are building what they call a Laddermill to tap the steady and stiff winds in the jet stream .
The Laddermill consists of a stack of tethered kites that soar as high as five miles and then return toward earth in an endless loop to generate electricity .
As the kites sail up to the jet stream and back , they pull with them tethers that turn an electrical generator located on the ground .
The Delft researchers also are experimenting with a fleet of gliders that would soar in place of the kites .

Offshore Installation – A Photo Diary
For those curious how these wind farms will be installed offshore … be sure to check out Frodog ’s Photo Diary of the Skegness Project .
You can view the diary HERE and the HD Slideshow HERE .
Yesterday two different people sent a link my way , with perhaps a 5 minute interval between .
The link was for Ubiquity , the latest Mozilla project ( http://labs.mozilla.com/2008/08/introducing-ubiquity/ ) , an application that builds into the browser a " language " that allows you to embed Google Map locations into your emails , display lists , copy items into Twitter , etc all on the fly .
Basically Ubiquity would be the seam that ties major sites together allowing you to do special tasks in a simplified way - and often tasks that you would n't have otherwise been able to do .
That 's a pretty high level view of it , and the app is currently in alpha , with its 0.1 release .
An application like this offers a lot .
It lets users go beyond the individual website , and the seamlessness creates what I imagine will be theexperience .
The user experience across websites is improved , as content no longer quite belongs to a particular website , but becomes a free floating part of the internet ether .
But is this necessarily athing ?
As an advocate for Net Neutrality , I have a particular bone to pick with an application such as this one , and others like the new browser Flock , which creates a social networking across major websites .
It 's a bit of a stretch to pick this bone , particularly when overall the service these programs and apps can offer are quite useful and - but it's a bone to pick , all the same .
First off , what is Net Neutrality ?
In brief , the internet was intended to be a free , and equal medium - neutral when it comes to companies , countries , content .
Lately the neutrality of the web has come into question when internet providers have realized there 's a lot of money that can be made by having high traffic websites pay for the speed at which they 're delivered .
For example , Google can pay to be delivered at a faster rate , than say a smaller , new and upcoming search engine .
This immediately creates an environment that favors the established and well off companies , and makes it extremely difficult for upcoming websites .
With net neutrality , if both sites are delivered at the same speed , then it becomes a part of the websites themselves to deliver their content ( the product ) at a faster speed .
In other words , the competition becomes purely in the product , and not in the medium to get to the product .
Consider it like two roads - one which takes you to a Walmart , which has more lanes , a higher speed limit , and will get you to the Walmart in 5 minutes , while the road which takes you to the mom and pop store is a single lane , dirt road that takes 10 minutes .
Drivers will immediately take the road to the Walmart , and never even find out whether or not that mom and pop store has better products , and better prices .
But that 's Net Neutrality when it comes to the delivery of content .
There 's also Net Neutrality in terms of monopolistic practices - though it does n't always fall under the term of net neutrality .
One such example was the Antitrust case of Microsoft .
When Microsoft bundled Internet Explorer as part of the operating system , this practically destroyed Netscape 's browser - though it later remerged as Firefox , and has since been gaining ground on IE .
Why was this a monopolistic practice , and an antitrust case ?
Because by bundling the browser into Windows , users immediately would use IE , and not even bother to consider any alternatives .
This created an environment where other browsers could not compete .
From the user 's standpoint , an internet browser bundled into an operating system was in fact a great tool .
It integrated the internet with the operating system :
One could be browsing their files , and moments later - from the same window - browse the internet , and a moment later , be looking at files on an FTP site .
The Explorer window was both a file explorer , internet explorer , and FTP explorer .
I found it an extremely useful , and was particularly disappointed when it had to change - for legal reasons .
Of course it destroyed the competition for internet browsers , and the end result was that the end user 's experience was compromised to create a more competitive environment ( the argument being that without the competition , the end user 's experience will still suffer - eventually ) .
That 's the potential risk I see here as well , with programs like Ubiquity .
The major difference is that in the case of Ubiquity , there is a number of different companies and groups at play , instead of a single one , making it difficult to make an argument about monopolistic practices .
But if you consider the major websites : Facebook , Twitter , Digg , Google ( Gmail , Google Maps , Google News ) , etc. and imagine a partnership among these companies , a potential monopoly is forming - and the interesting part is that we are forming it .
The Mozilla browser allows third parties to create plugins , which allows users to create plugins which integrate with particular websites .
This has eventually evolved into the notion of the Flock browser , and Ubiquity .
As users we love the ability to go from one of our favorite websites to another , and have this feeling of uniformity , seamlessness , a feeling of ubiquity .
But what is this really doing to our internet ?
We are currently heading down a path that makes it increasingly difficult for the emergent market .
Take Twitter for example , which is a popular website , with a slight twist on Social Networking .
I , personally , know very few people on Twitter , and it's in large part due to all my friends using Facebook .
There 's no need to create an account on Twitter , and have to recreate a profile , and have another profile to keep up to date .
And that 's why both Google and Facebook are investing a lot into their concepts of universal accounts that branch across websites .
Twitter , however , is lucky enough to already be in the realm of the popular websites .
Other websites - new ones , are having an increasingly difficult time emerging on the market .
Old ones , established ones , are losing their ground because - through the decisions of the users - they were not included in the group of popular websites .
MySpace , for example , while still popular , has lost a lot of ground to Facebook , and is doomed to fail as Facebook becomes the social networking website .
This is the While I said it 's difficult to imagine a monopoly formed by a group , group monopolies do exist , and the consumer suffers as a result of them .
An example of a group monopoly is with the four major cellphone providers in Canada : Bell , Rogers , Fido and Telus .
These four have created an incredibly difficult market to enter into , such that any startup provider faces an incredibly steep mountain to climb .
It 's the reason why Canadians have been calling for the government to take action , to assist in the smaller companies emerge into the market .
It 's also the reason why Canadians have very expensive phone plans when compared to the US , and even more expensive when compared with Europe - a market that is saturated with options .
With a group monopoly of websites , internet users are headed down a road where there will be no more net neutrality .
Websites will lose their individuality , as they are all heaped together - and even if a website offering a better product were to emerge , it would take a whole lot to convince people who have already dedicated themselves to the group , to switch to less popular alternative .
And here enters the dilemma :
As users , what should we do ?
Impose upon ourselves the agreement to not use tools that will allow this group monopoly to form , thereby impeding our own experience on the internet ?
Or provide ourselves with the better experience , thereby creating a marketplace dominated by the few , resulting in the eventual degradation of the product ?

Our Secretary of State has been put through the mill this election year .
Jennifer Brunner has worked harder than any Secretary of State , in my memory , to ensure that this state has no election fraud that we witnessed in 2000 and 2004 .
Vodpod videos no longer available .
Now , to make matters worse , a Columbus man has been charged Friday , with making a telephone death threat to Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner .
The State Highway Patrol says Dana McArtor was charged Friday with intimidation .
Brunner spokesman Jeff Ortega says the call last Friday threatened to kill the secretary of state .
Her office says it has been inundated with threats during a busy season of voter lawsuits and alleged registration irregularities .
The 51 - year - old Columbus man remains jailed .
He is to be arraigned Saturday .
Hang in there Ms. Brunner .
We only have little over a week to go .
Stay safe .
Many of us are pleased with your extraordinary effort – you have made this election year – to correct many of the problems that have plagued this state for so long .

Not all cultures believe in burying the dead in the ground .
Here are 10 unique ceremonies from around the world .
THE MODERN DICTIONARY defines the word ‘ burial ’ as placing a body in the ground .
But burying the deceased was not always the case .
Just as primitive man has long worshiped the four elements of Earth , Sky , Water , and Fire , so too have these elements taken their place in burial practices as diverse as the different tribes of the earth .
The way mankind deals with its dead says a great deal about those left to carry on .
Burial practices are windows to a culture that speak volumes about how it lives .
As we are told in Genesis , man comes from dust , and returns to it .
We have found many different ways to return .
Here are 10 that I found particularly fascinating :
Air Sacrifice – Mongolia
Photo by Viacheslav Smilyk
Lamas direct the entire ceremony , with their number determined by the social standing of the deceased .
They decide the direction the entourage will travel with the body , to the specific day and time the ceremony can happen .
Mongolians believe in the return of the soul .
Therefore the lamas pray and offer food to keep evil spirits away and to protect the remaining family .
They also place blue stones in the dead persons bed to prevent evil spirits from entering it .
No one but a lama is allowed to touch the corpse , and a white silk veil is placed over the face .
The naked body is flanked by men on the right side of the yurt while women are placed on the left .
Both have their respective right or left hand placed under their heads , and are situated in the fetal position .
The family burns incense and leaves food out to feed all visiting spirits .
When time comes to remove the body , it must be passed through a window or a hole cut in the wall to prevent evil from slipping in while the door is open .
The body is taken away from the village and laid on the open ground .
A stone outline is placed around it , and then the village dogs that have been penned up and not fed for days are released to consume the remains .
What is left goes to the local predators .
The stone outline remains as a reminder of the person .
Â
If any step of the ceremony is left out , no matter how trivial , bad karma is believed to ensue .
Sky Burial – Tibet
Pounding the bones .
Photo by Rotem Eldar
This is similar to the Mongolian ceremony .
The deceased is dismembered by a rogyapa , or body breaker , and left outside away from any occupied dwellings to be consumed by nature .
To the western mind , this may seem barbaric , as it did to the Chinese who outlawed the practice after taking control of the country in the 1950s .
But in Buddhist Tibet , it makes perfect sense .
The ceremony represents the perfect Buddhist act , known as Jhator .
The worthless body provides sustenance to the birds of prey that are the primary consumers of its flesh .
To a Buddhist , the body is but an empty shell , worthless after the spirit has departed .
Most of the country is surrounded by snowy peaks , and the ground is too solid for traditional earth internment .
Likewise , being mostly above the tree line , there is not enough fuel for cremation .
Pit Burial – Pacific Northwest Haida

Before white contact , the indigenous people of the American northwest coast , particularly the Haida , simply cast their dead into a large open pit behind the village .
Their flesh was left to the animals .
But if one was a chief , shaman , or warrior , things were quite different .
The body was crushed with clubs until it fit into a small wooden box about the size of a piece of modern luggage .
It was then fitted atop a totem pole in front of the longhouse of the man ’s tribe where the various icons of the totem acted as guardians for the spirits ’ journey to the next world .
Written history left to us by the first missionaries to the area all speak of an unbelievable stench at most of these villages .
Today , this practice is outlawed .
Viking Burial – Scandinavia

Illustration Long Beach City College
We have all seen images of a Viking funeral with the body laid out on the deck of a dragon ship , floating into the sunset while warriors fire flaming arrows to ignite the pyre .
While very dramatic , burning a ship is quite expensive , and not very practical .
What we do know is most Vikings , being a sea faring people , were interred in large graves dug in the shape of a ship and lined with rocks .
Â
The person ’s belongings and food were placed beside them .
Men took their weapons to the next world , while women were laid to rest wearing their finest jewelry and accessories .
If the deceased was a nobleman or great warrior , his woman was passed from man to man in his tribe , who all made love to her ( some would say raped ) before strangling her , and placing her next to the body of her man .
Thankfully this practice is now , for the most part , extinct .
Fire Burial – Bali
Fire consumes all .

On the mostly Hindu Isle of Bali , fire is the vehicle to the next life .
The body or Mayat is bathed and laid out on a table where food offerings are laid beside it for the journey .
Lanterns line the path to the persons hut to let people know he or she has passed , and act as a reminder of their life so they are not forgotten .
It is then interred in a mass grave with others from the same village who have passed on until it is deemed there are a sufficient number of bodies to hold a cremation .
The bodies are unearthed , cleaned , and stacked on an elaborate float , gloriously decorated by the entire village and adorned with flowers .
The float is paraded through the village to the central square where it is consumed by flames , and marks the beginning of a massive feast to honor and remember the dead .
Spirit Offerings – Southeast Asia

Throughout most of Southeast Asia , people have been buried in the fields where they lived and worked .
It is common to see large stone monuments in the middle of a pasture of cows or water buffalo .
The Vietnamese leave thick wads of counterfeit money under rocks on these monuments so the deceased can buy whatever they need on their way to the next life
In Cambodia and Thailand , wooden “ spirit houses ” sit in front of almost every hut from the poorest to the most elaborate estate .
These are places where food and drink are left periodically for the souls of departed relatives to refuel when necessary .
The offerings of both countries also ask the spirits of the relatives to watch over the lands and the families left behind .
Predator Burial – Maasai Tribe
No after life .
Photo by Demosh
The Maasai of East Africa are hereditary nomads who believe in a deity known as Enkai , but this is not a single being or entity .
It is a term that encompasses the earth , sky , and all that dwells below .
It is a difficult concept for western minds that are more used to traditional religious beliefs than those of so - called primitive cultures .
Actual burial is reserved for chiefs as a sign of respect , while the common people are simply left outdoors for predators to dispose of , since Maasai believe dead bodies are harmful to the earth .
To them when you are dead , you are simply gone .
There is no after life .
Skull Burial – Kiribati

On the tiny island of Kiribati the deceased is laid out in their house for no less than three days and as long as twelve , depending on their status in the community .
Friends and relatives make a pudding from the root of a local plant as an offering .
Several months after internment the body is exhumed and the skull removed , oiled , polished , and offered tobacco and food .
After the remainder of the body is re-interred , traditional islanders keep the skull on a shelf in their home and believe the native god Nakaa welcomes the dead person ’s spirit in the northern end of the islands .
Cave Burial – Hawaii

In the Hawaiian Islands , a traditional burial takes place in a cave where the body is bent into a fetal position with hands and feet tied to keep it that way , then covered with a tapa cloth made from the bark of a mulberry bush .
Sometimes the internal organs are removed and the cavity filled with salt to preserve it .
The bones are considered sacred and believed to have diving power .
Many caves in Hawaii still contain these skeletons , particularly along the coast of Maui .
Ocean Burial
The open sea .

Since most of our planet is covered with water , burial at sea has long been the accepted norm for mariners the world over .
By international law , the captain of any ship , regardless of size or nationality has the authority to conduct an official burial service at sea .
The traditional burial shroud is a burlap bag , being cheap and plentiful , and long in use to carry cargo .
The deceased is sewn inside and is weighted with rocks or other heavy debris to keep it from floating .
If available , the flag of their nation covers the bag while a service is conducted on deck .
The body is then slid from under the flag , and deposited in Davy Jones locker .
In olden days , the British navy mandated that the final stitch in the bag had to go through the deceased person ’s lip , just to make sure they really were dead .
( If they were still alive , having a needle passed through their skin would revive them ) .
It is quite possible that sea burial has been the main form of burial across the earth since before recorded history .
The Final Frontier
Today , if one has enough money , you can be launched into space aboard a private commercial satellite and a capsule containing your ashes will be in permanent orbit around the earth .
Perhaps this is the ultimate burial ceremony , or maybe the beginning of a whole new era in which man continues to find new and innovative ways to invoke spirits and provide a safe passage to whatever awaits us at the end of this life .

Cannabis Crimes in Holland ' It 's not Our Intention to Close Down the Coffee Shops '
The Netherlands ' marijuana tolerance policy was meant to prevent use of harder drugs .

Todd believes regular policemen and women should be given Tasers , which are currently issued only to firearms officers .
The Home Office said it had no plans to make the guns widely available .
Mr Todd said afterwards : " I could n't move , it hurt like hell .
I would n't want to do that again . "
You just seem to freeze
Chief Constable Michael Todd
A Taser blast incapacitates those it hits , but should not be fatal .
Mr Todd took the hit under controlled conditions at the force 's Tactical Firearms Unit .
His verdict was : " I 've never experienced anything like it .
You just seem to freeze .
" If I was carrying a weapon and about to attack a member of the public when this happened , I could n't have done anything at all , which is why it is important that we have them . "
Home Office minister Hazel Blears has said that the controversial gun was a dangerous weapon which should not yet be issued to frontline police .
The purpose of this post is to offer readers a chance to talk about where they see this issue going .
Below the fold , I offer a few thoughts on what areas arguably need federal support , and a few implications if the country moves toward more nationalization of companies .
How much more of this can we expect to see in the days ahead ?
What indirect impacts will this have on American businesses ?
Where does all of this end ?
We in the United States live in a country with a strong tradition of private ownership of companies .
In recent days , we have seen changes that border on nationalization :
Organizations possibly needing more federal support
Bankrupt large banks ( or even small banks )
FDIC insurance is only $ 250,000 per account , dropping to $ 100,000 an account January 1 , 2010 .
This limit is fine for personal accounts , but it is not nearly enough for companies ( or governmental organizations ) with thousands of employees .
These companies spend more than $ 250,000 for payroll each pay period .
They are also likely to need accounts with very large balances in order to issue checks to vendors .
If the banks that handle these accounts are allowed to go bankrupt , the corporations with these accounts might lose a large amount of money , and would have difficulty with future payroll checks and checks to vendors .
While some businesses could split their accounts among banks , this becomes difficult if dozens of banks are needed for ordinary transactions .
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC )
The FDIC guarantees bank deposits , now up to $ 250,000 per account , but does not have much to in actual funds to back up this guarantee ( something like $ 45 billion ) .
The usual method of obtaining additional funding is by charging higher insurance premiums to banks for the coverage .
In the recent past , these fees have only amounted , in total , to a few billion dollars per year .
It is doubtful that the fees can be raised to a high enough level that they will pay all of the losses occurring -- without bankrupting additional banks .
Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation ( PBGC )
The PBGC is similar to the FDIC , except that it guarantees the payment of pension plans .
It has exactly the same problem in terms of funding that FDIC has -- the methodology works fine for an occasional bankruptcy , but not if there are multiple pension plans failing at the same time , because they hold securities that no longer have value , or because they are invested in the stock market , and the stock market has not increased as much as planned .
Insurance Companies
Insurance companies are not the first to be affected by problems with investments , but as more companies and governments default on their bonds , they are likely to be affected as well .
Insurance companies are covered by state guarantee funds in the case of insolvency , but the coverage offered by the funds has many exclusions and low limits .
These funds are assessment plans that collect funds from solvent insurers to pay for those that are insolvent .
This approach works well for an occasional bankruptcy , but not if there are multiple large insurance company failures .
Oil and Gas Companies
Oil and gas companies are frequent targets for government takeovers for a number of reasons .
For one thing , governments see them as a possible source of extra revenue .
Also , if rationing is necessary , it may be easier for rationing to be carried out according to governmental plans , if a company is under government supervision .
Another issue is price subsidies ; the prices charged by oil companies may be perceived to be too high for consumers .
Another consideration may be declining production .
If the government is in charge , there can be no question whether the amount of exploration and drilling is adequate .
Parts of the Electric Utility Industry
We know that the grid has been neglected for years .
No one has clear responsibility for maintaining and upgrading it , so this is a logical area for governmental support .
Also , if there are bankruptcies of companies necessary to electricity transmission over the grid , the federal government may want to intervene to prevent service interruptions .
Another area where government support may be needed is in the funding of new nuclear plants , if these are added .
Railroad Tracks
If we want to upgrade our railroad system , some might argue that the best way would be to have the federal government take responsibility for maintaining and upgrading the railroad tracks , similar to the way it maintains the interstate road system .
Airline Industry
If airline service to smaller cities disappears , so will the prospects for new industries for these cities .
Some are likely to argue that the airlines need support to maintain service to smaller airports ( or to stay in business at all ) .
Auto Manufacturers
If General Motors and Ford go bankrupt , should the government just stand by ?
Housing Problems
A federal program to assist in homeownership , and help stop falling prices , has been proposed .
New manufacturing
We have off - shored a huge amount of manufacturing .
If we want to bring some of this manufacturing back on - shore and financing is still very tight , it may be necessary for the federal government to provide support to the new manufacturers .
State and local governments
I understand that California is now looking for loans .
In the months ahead , there will no doubt be many others .
I do n't think state and local governments can be nationalized , but they can come to depend on assistance from the federal government .
Risks
Need for ongoing infusion of funds
The reason all of these organizations ( except the oil and gas companies ) need help is because they are short of funds .
If they were short of funds before the first infusion of funds , they are likely to still be short of funds later , especially if the current financial problems are not just the result of a cyclic downturn .
It seems likely the downturn will last , because the total amount of debt outstanding is unreasonable relative to the amount of underlying resource .
In addition , oil and other energy prices are now higher , because of oil shortages .
The higher energy prices make debt more difficult to pay back , and are likely to limit future growth .
Government as poor business manager Governments have a reputation for hiring people who are not necessarily competent , and keeping more people on the staff than necessary .
Some have suggested that with the government involved and shortages of some goods , bribery may be more of an issue .

Get your facts first , and then you can distort them as much as you please .
—- Mark Twain
I use a Mac , so I know I think different .
I also coexist on an alternative parallel world where people live on the same planet as me , but have such a radically different way of thinking that I wonder if we have the same ability to evaluate reality ( 1 ) .
The best example of different ways of seeing the same thing is homeopathy .
Homeopathy is utterly and completely ridiculous with zero plausibility or efficacy .
Only therapeutic touch is its rival .
Yet homeopath Louise Mclean can suggest there are 50 facts that validate homeopathy ( 2 ) .
These facts were presented as an attempt to counter criticism that homeopathy is only water with no therapeutic effects .
Lets evaluate each fact .
There are two parts to the evaluations : whether the fact is true and what , if any , logical fallacy is being used .
Deciding on which logical fallacy is being used is not my strong point , feel free to correct me in the comments , and I will add to the text later .
1 ) Fact 1 – Hippocrates
‘ The Father of Medicine ’ of Ancient Greece said there were two Laws of Healing : The Law of Opposites and the Law of Similars .
Homeopathy treats the patient with medicines using the Law of Similars , orthodox medicine uses the Law of Opposites , e.g. antibiotics , anti-inflammatories , anticonvulsants , antihypertensives , anti-depressants , anti-psychotics .
Logical fallacy ( 3 ) : Argument from authority , argument from antiquity , strawman .
Errors : Hippocrates ’ ideas as to disease treatment have no ( as in zero ) applicability to how we understand medicine .
Also , medicine does not treat by the Law of Opposites , and using the ‘ anti ’ prefix as an understanding of how a process works is just weird .
Its like finding significance in assume making an ‘ ass ’ of ‘ u ’ and ‘ me ’ .
Antibiotics , for example , work by targeting very specific bacterial chemical pathways to kill the organism .
Anti inflammatories block a specific enzymes in the inflammatory pathway to decrease inflammation etc etc .
There is no Law of Opposites in modern medicine .
That is either a profound misunderstanding or a misrepresentation .
Fact 2 – Homeopathic theories are based on fixed principles of the Laws of Nature which do not change — unlike medical theories which are constantly changing !
Logical Fallacy : Strawman .
Error : Homeopathy is based on nonsense , and there are no fixed “ Laws of Nature ” upon which it is based ( I do like the the capitals , makes it seem so much more authoritative ) .
What “ Law ” outside the fictions on Hanneman ( he pulled his Laws out the his , well , imagination ) , is homeopathy based on ?
None .
All the Laws of chemistry , physics , physiology , biology etc would suggest that homeopathy is unequivocal nonsense .
That medicine is changing is its strong suit .
Ask yourself this ( not applicable if you are Amish or a Homeopath ) is there any part of your life where you would prefer to operate under the concepts and technology of the mid 1800 ’s ?
Modern medicine progresses .
Homeopathy is not only nonsense , it is stagnant nonsense .
Fact 3 – Homeopathy is an evidence - based , empirical medicine .
Logical Fallacy : Non-Sequitur , moving goalpost .
Error : none .
Unfortunately all the evidence based , empirical data demonstrates that homeopathy is totally useless .
Fact 4 – Homeopathy is both an art and a science .
Logical Fallacy : Non-Sequitur , moving goalpost .
Error :
It is an art , like other works of the imagination .
As to science , not so much .
Homeopaths denies the applicability of all the basic sciences to homeopathy , especially chemistry and physiology .
It does occasionally misinterpret quantum mechanics as applicable to its mechanism of action , but misapplying science does not a science make , in this they share a close kinship with the science of intelligent design .
Fact 5 – The Homeopathic provings of medicines are a more scientific method of testing than the orthodox model .
Logical Fallacy : Unstated Major Premise .
Error :
This is only true if you think non randomized , uncontrolled , unblinded anecdotes based on unknown or unproven physical principles are more scientific than randomized , controlled , double blind studies based on therapies that have biologic plausibility .
This statement is the same as postulating astrology is better science than astronomy .
Fact 6 – Homeopathic medicine awakens and stimulates the body ’s own curative powers .
The potentized remedy acts as a catalyst to set healing into motion .
Logical Fallacy : Non-Sequitur ?
There needs to be a logical fallacy for using scientific terminology that seems to make sense , but does n’t .
I call it the “ Say What ?
logical fallacy .
Error :
Which curative power and how it is stimulated and what is catalyzed is never said .
It sounds impressive until you ask for details .
Vague homilies , no meat .
Potentized is homeopathy speak for really dilute and shaked / shook / shooken really well .
Fact 7 – Homeopathic medicines work by communicating a current / pattern / frequency of energy via the whole human body to jump start the body ’s own inherent healing mechanisms
Logical Fallacy : say what ?
Error :
This makes no sense as I understand the world .
The phase “ communicating a current / pattern / frequency of energy via the whole human body ” really has no content in reality based medicine .
Like Oakland , there is no there there .
Much of alt med is often all sound and fury , signifying nothing .
Big , impressive words and concepts that when analyzed carefully say nothing .
Fact 8 – Homeopathy assists the body to heal itself , to overcome an illness which brings the patient to a higher level of health .
Orthodox medicine suppresses the illness , bringing the patient to a lower level of health .
Logical Fallacy : strawman .
Error :
There is a presumption in alt med that the people have a perfect level of health they should be at all the time .
Probably not true , as evolution has given us a system that mostly functions reasonably well , but is far from perfection .
Next time I cure a heart valve infection , or my cardiology colleague limits the damage of heart attack , or my surgical colleague takes out that cancer , I tell the patient , sorry .
I have only suppressed your illness , your level of health is now less .
Fact 9 – The homeopathic practitioner endeavours to search for and treat the cause of the disease in order to heal the effect .
Logical Fallacy : strawman .
Error : this is the big lie ( Big Lie to make it more authoritative ) of all alt med .
This is what “ orthodox ” medicine excels at , and what alt medicine , because it is grounded in magic , superstition and faulty understanding of the physical world , can never do .
Real doctors find and fix the root cause of illness , homeopaths cannot and do not do any such thing .
Fact 10 – Outcomes of homeopathic treatment are measured by the long term curative effects of prescribing and complete eradication of the disease state for preventing numerous diseases .
Logical Fallacy : false dichotomy .
Error : none .
however , when you diagnose and treat based on magic , you can define cure and prevention in non-verifiable ways .
Fact 11 – The homeopathic practitioner treats the whole person , believing all symptoms are interrelated and seeks to select a medicine which most closely covers them all .
Logical Fallacy : strawman .
Error : Again , being grounded in nonsense and magical thinking , homeopathy can only have an erroneous and faulty understanding of the whole person .
See https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=137 for an extended rant .
Fact 12 – Homeopathic remedies are cheap .
Logical Fallacy : none .
Error : Yes , water is inexpensive .
However , think for a moment what it takes to make a homeopathic preparation .
Take a 25 ml ( 1.7 tablespoons ) bottle of 200C homeopathic preparation .
To make such a product you need 495 liters ( about 130 gallons , or 1040 pints ) of water to make the required dilutions for one bottle ( 4 ) .
That is an amazing waste of water .
Environmentally maybe not so cheap .
Fact 13 – Pharmaceutical medicines are expensive .
Logical Fallacy : strawman , non sequitur .
false dichotomy , which I like to call the , ‘ oh yeah , well you are fat ’ fallacy .
Error : some real medications are expensive , some are not .
Unlike homeopathy , pharmaceutical medicines are proven to work .
Whatever the failings of science based medicine , those failings do not validate homeopathy .
Homeopathy has to stand or fall on its own , not on the perceived failings of others .
It is like declaring you are thin , because I am fat .
Fact 14 – There are more than 4,000 homeopathic medicines .
Logical Fallacy : strawman .
Error : Homeopathy is one ‘ medication ’ : water .
Fact 15 – Homeopathic medicines have no toxic side - effects .
Logical Fallacy : none
Error : tell that to Percy Bysshe Shelley .
Medications can only have side effects if first they have an effect .
No effect , no side effect .
I wonder .
Do homeopaths ever misdiagnose ?
If so , what is the effect of giving the wrong homeopathic treatment ?
Fact 16 – Homeopathic medicines are non-addictive .
Logical Fallacy : none .
Error : you try going without water .
Fact 17 – Every true homeopathic medicine is made using one substance — whether plant , mineral , metal , etc .
The exact substance is known , unlike most modern drugs where we are rarely informed of the ingredients .
Logical Fallacy : strawman , false dichotomy .
Error : I could be in error , but I did not know that plants were made of one substance .
A quick scan of the periodic chart , oh yeah , there it is : foxglove .
Right after belladonna .
The first mineral in the mineral database ( 4442 total minerals ) is Anorthite , CaAl2Si2O8 , made up of 4 substances .
Plants and minerals are made up of many many substances .
But I am a reductionist .
Again it is true in that all homeopathic medications are water and only water .
As to modern drugs , I guess she has not seen a PDR , where the ingredients of medications are freely available , meticulously detailed and strictly controlled , the opposite , at least in the US , of all alt therapies which have zero oversight as to their composition .
Fact 18 – Any remedy up to a 12c or a 24 x potency still contains the original molecules of the substance and this is known as Avogadro ’s number .
Logical Fallacy : say what ?
Error : “ Avogadro ’s number , is the number of “ elementary entities ” ( usually atoms or molecules ) in one mole , that is ( from the definition of the mole ) the number of atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon - 12 ( Wikipedia ) . ”
As it applies to homeopathy , “ According to the laws of chemistry , there is a limit to the dilution that can be made without losing the original substance altogether .
This limit , called Avogadro ’s number ( 6.023 x 10 - 23 ) corresponds to homeopathic potencies of 12C or 24X ( 1 part in 1024 ) .
At this dilution there is less than a 50 % chance that even one molecule of active material remains ( 5 ) . ”
I thought it was the water that had the potency , not the molecule .
BTW : who wants to go to a bartender who serves Cosmopolitans made with the principals of homeopathy ?
A 12 C martini would have 60 % chance ( 6 ) of one molecule of alcohol in it , but should be more potent than a normal cosmo .
At least if it were a homeopathic cosmo .
Fact 19 – Every Patient is Unique so homeopathic medicines are individualized .
Logical Fallacy : ?
Error : homeopathy appears to postulate 6 billion different treatments for each person in the world who has hypertension .
And 6 billion different treatments for fever .
And 6 billion unique treatments for …. on and on for each of the diseases out there .
It is , of course , like the rest of homeopathy , impossible .
And for each individual treatment there are , by Fact 14 , over 4000 homeopathic remedies .
And you apply 4000 remedies to 6 billion people and make each treatment individualized how ?
There are over 13,000 prescription drugs .
Who do you think is better able to provide an individualized therapy ?
Fact 20 – Homeopaths treat genetic illness , tracing its origins to 6 main genetic causes : Tuberculosis , Syphilis , Gonorrhoea , Psora ( scabies ) , Cancer , Leprosy .
Logical Fallacy : say what ?
Error : Tuberculosis , Syphilis , Gonorrhoea , Psora ( scabies ) and Leprosy are infections .
Infections not genetic illnesses .
Thats just stupid .
Cancer , may be considered genetic .
Fact 21 – Epidemics such as cholera and typhoid were treated successfully using homeopathy in the 19th century with very high success rates , compared to orthodox medicine ( http://www.whale.to/v/winston.html) .
Logical Fallacy : argument from antiquity .
Error :
As best I can tell , in 1854 10 of 61 cases of cholera died in a homeopathic hospital , while 123 of the 231 died of cholera in a regular hospital .
I am not able to find the details of the therapy and the rigorousness of the diagnosis .
I can find insufficient information to comment on the validity of the information .
If it is a valid conclusion it has been the only positive study in the 150 years of homeopathy .
Fact 22 – There are thousands of homeopathic books , available at specialist outlets , not sold in the high street .
Logical Fallacy : Appeal to popularity .
Error : none .
Reading fiction remains a popular pastime .
Fact 23 – There are 5 homeopathic hospitals in the U.K. — in London , Tunbridge Wells , Bristol , Liverpool and Glasgow .
They cost the NHS under £ 10 million a year compared to the £ 100 billion for the total annual NHS budget for 2008 !
Logical Fallacy : Appeal to popularity .
Error : I do not doubt it is a true fact .
No wonder the sun set long ago on the Empire .
Fact 24 – At one of the earliest debates on the NHS Act of 1948 the Government pledged that homoeopathy would continue to be available on the NHS , as long as there were “ patients wishing to receive it and doctors willing to provide it ” .
Logical Fallacy : Appeal to popularity .
Error : As George Bush II said : “ You can fool some of the people all the time , and those are the ones you want to concentrate on . ”
I bet there are those that wish cocaine had the same criteria for availability from UK doctors : someone wants it and a doctor will sell it .
Fact 25 – There is a campaign by certain U.K.
Professors to oust homeopathy completely from the NHS after they wrote on NHS headed paper to all Primary Care Trusts in 2006 telling managers not to refer patients to the homeopathic hospitals .
Logical Fallacy : Appeal to popularity .
Error : none .
Certain U.K. professors are better at understanding good healthcare than others and much better than politicians pandering to nonsense with a promise of homeopathy forever .
Fact 26 – The Homeopathic Hospitals are clean , with friendly , well informed staff .
The patients are generally pleased with their treatment unlike many orthodox National Health Service hospitals .
Logical Fallacy : Appeal to popularity , false dichotomy .
Error : none .
Con men need to please their clients / victims since they have no real service to offer .
Fact 27 – The chances of contracting MRSA or C. Difficile at a Homeopathic Hospital are extremely rare .
Logical Fallacy : ?
Error : I do not doubt this .
MRSA and C. difficile are unfortunate ( and perhaps unpreventable ) complications of doing interventions that work .
MRSA most commonly causes a postoperative wound infection from surgery and C. difficile occurs after receiving antibiotics .
SInce homeopathy does nothing , it cannot have these complications .
Fact 28 – Unlike orthodox medicine where two thirds of all conventional hospital admissions are due to the side - effects of pharmaceutical medicines , the bill for negligence claims soaring into billions , one U.K. leading insurance company reported only ‘ a couple ’ of claims against homeopaths in a ten year period !
Logical Fallacy : say what ?
Error : ” two thirds of all conventional hospital admissions are due to the side - effects of pharmaceutical medicines ” .
Where did this number come from ?
She appears to making stuff up ( I bet someone finds it on the whale ) .
Maybe 6 % or so of hospitalitzations are due to adverse drug reactions ( 7 ) .
I somehow operate under the assumption that facts have a correlation with real data that can be evaluated and not , like Hahnemann ’s Laws , just made up .
Fact 29 – In the United States in the early 1900s there were 22 homeopathic medical schools and over 100 homeopathic hospitals , 60 orphanages and old people ’s homes and 1,000 + homeopathic pharmacies .
Logical Fallacy : Appeal to popularity .
Error :
And the life expectancy was 48.23 years ( 8 ) .
We abandoned homeopathy and doubled our life expectancy .
Fact 30 – Members of the American Medical Association had great animosity towards homeopathy after its formation in 1847 and it was decided to purge all local medical societies of physicians who were homeopaths .
Logical Fallacy : ?
Error : Curiously , as an MD ( but not an AMA member ) , I have an animosity towards my patients wasting their money and jeopardizing their health on nonsense .
Fact 31 – Big Pharma does not want the Public to find out how well homeopathy works !
Logical Fallacy : Appeal to paranoid delusions ( not a standard logical fallacy , but needed here ) .
Error : its a paranoid delusion .
Fact 32 – In 2005 the World Health Organization brought out a draft report which showed homeopathy was beneficial causing Big Pharma to panic and The Lancet to bring out an editorial entitled ‘ The End of Homeopathy ’ .
Logical Fallacy : Appeal to paranoid delusions .
Error : its a paranoid delusion .
Fact 33 – In 2005 The Lancet tried to destroy homeopathy but were only looking at 8 inconclusive trials out of 110 of which 102 were positive .
This was a fraudulent analysis .
“ The meta - analysis at the centre of the controversy is based on 110 placebo - controlled clinical trials of homeopathy and 110 clinical trials of allopathy ( conventional medicine ) , which are said to be matched .
These were reduced to 21 trials of homeopathy and 9 of conventional medicine of ‘ higher quality ’ and further reduced to 8 and 6 trials , respectively , which were ‘ larger , higher quality ’ .
The final analysis which concluded that ‘ the clinical effects of homoeopathy are placebo effects ’ was based on just the eight ‘ larger , higher quality ’ clinical trials of homeopathy .
The Lancet ’s press release did not mention this , instead giving the impression that the conclusions were based on all 110 trials . ” ( http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articl…)
Logical Fallacy : Appeal to paranoid delusions .
Error : meta analysis of impossible therapies are medical paradolia , seeing patterns were none exist .
See https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=242 for details .
The best quote ever on the topic :
“ I see all the homeopathy trials as making up a kind of “ model organism ” for studying the way science and scientific publishing works .
Given that homeopathic remedies are known to be completely inert , any positive conclusions or even suggestions of positive conclusions that homeopathy researchers come up with must be either chance findings , mistakes , or fraud .
So homeopathy lets us look at how a community of researchers can generate a body of published papers and even meta - analyze and re-meta - analyze them in great detail , in the absence of any actual phenomenon at all .
It ’s a bit like growing bacteria in a petri dish in which you know there is nothing but agar .
The rather sad conclusion I ’ve come to is that it ’s very easy for intelligent , thoughtful scientists to see signals in random noise .
I fear that an awful lot of published work in sensible fields of medicine and biology is probably just that as well .
Homeopathy proves that it can happen .
( the problem is that we do n’t know what ’s nonsense and what ’s not within any given field . )
It ’s a warning to scientists everywhere ( 10 ) . ”
Fact 34 – There have been many clinical trials that prove homeopathy works .
In the past 24 years there have been more than 180 controlled , and 118 randomized , trials into homeopathy , which were analyzed by four separate meta-analyses .
In each case , the researchers concluded that the benefits of homeopathy went far beyond that which could be explained purely by the placebo effect .
Logical Fallacy : none .
Error :
The question is are there quality trials that show homeopathy works .
Nope .
And fact 5 dismisses these scientific trials as inferior to the homeopathic proving , so which is it ?
It is a case of having your cake and eating it too , which should be a logical fallacy .
Fact 35 – The Bristol Homeopathic Hospital carried out a study published in November 2005 of 6500 patients receiving homeopathic treatment .
There was an overall improvement in health of 70 % of them .
Logical Fallacy :
Error : association is not causation .
They improved and received homeopathic treatment NOT
They improved because they received homeopathic treatment .
Causality is a tricky thing to prove , at least outside of homeopathy .
Fact 36 – Homeopathy can never be properly tested through double blind randomized trials because each prescription is individualized as every patient is unique .
Therefore 10 people with arthritis , for example , may all need a different homeopathic medicine .
Logical Fallacy : the cake and eat it too fallacy .
Error : facts 33 and 34 depend on their validity from double blind randomized trial , which are denied in fact 36 and fact 5 .
And if 4001 people have arthritis , that 4000 and first is out of luck .
See fact 19 .
She sure is n’t one for consistency in her facts .
Fact 37 – Homeopathic medicines are not tested on animals .
Logical Fallacy : false dichotomy .
Error :
If homeopathic medications are more effective on animals ( fact 38 ) and have no toxic side effects ( fact 15 ) , then why is this a good thing ?
It is bad to test on animals because it harms them .
If homeopathy is harmless , then there is no moral high ground to be gained from not testing on animals .
We know water is safe for animals , especially for fish , who are subject to all the increasingly dilute , and therefore more powerful , homeopathic medications sent down the drain .
Is that why the fish stocks are crashing ?
Fact 38 – Homeopathic medicines work even better on animals and babies than on adults , proving this can not be placebo .
Logical Fallacy : say what ?
Error : huh ?
The efficacy of the medication depends on age and species ?
How is this supposed to work ?
And if homeopathic medicines are not tested on animals ( fact 37 ) , then how do we know they are more effective ?
Fact 39 – Scientists agree that if and when homeopathy is accepted by the scientific community it will turn established science on its head .
Logical Fallacy : strawman .
Error : absolutely true .
If homeopathy is accepted because to experimental proof , then 500 years of progress in all the sciences have been in error .
If homeopathy is accepted without scientific proof , then its back to the dark ages for western civilization , and only the morticians and homeopaths will profit .
Fact 40 – Homeopathic Practitioners train for 4 years in Anatomy and Physiology , as well as Pathology and Disease , Materia Medica , Homeopathic Philosophy and study of the Homeopathic Repertory .
Logical Fallacy : non sequiter .
Error : no argument here .
Four years to learn anatomy , pathology and physiology just so you can ignore it later .
I wonder if they study chemistry .
Fact 41 – Most homeopaths treat patients who have been referred to them by word of mouth .
Most patients seek out homeopathy because conventional treatment has not benefited them or because it poses too great a risk of side - effects .
Logical Fallacy : appeal to popularity .
Error : none .
Fact 42 – The homeopathic community has thousands , even millions , of written case notes that demonstrate the positive benefits of their treatment .
Some homeopaths have video proof of their patients before and after treatment .
Logical Fallacy : appeal to popularity .
Error : the plural of anecdote is anecdotes , not data .
Fact 43 – Homeopaths charge patients an average of £ 50 an hour .
Specialist Doctors can charge up to £ 200 or more .
Logical Fallacy : strawman
Error : one gets what they pay for .
You can spend thousands of dollars on a car for transportation , but I bet a unicorn would cost less for the same purpose .
Fact 44 – The popularity of homeopathy has grown in the past 30 years , its revival entirely through word of mouth and estimated to be growing at more than 20 % a year the world over .
Logical Fallacy : appeal to popularity .
Error : see George Bush quote above .
Fact 45 – Hundreds of famous people throughout the past 200 years have enjoyed the benefits of homeopathic medicine ( www.homeopathicrevolution.com) .
Logical Fallacy : appeal to authority and popularity .
Error : being famous does not make your knowledge of medicine more ( or less ) valid ( 9 ) .
Fact 46 – The aristocratic patronage of homeopathy in the U.K. extended well into the 1940s and beyond can be easily demonstrated .
In the Homeopathic Medical Directories there are lists of patrons of the dispensaries and hospitals .
They read like an extract from Burke ’s or Debrett’s .
Logical Fallacy : appeal to authority and popularity .
Error : Like being famous , being an aristocrat does not make your knowledge of medicine more ( or less ) valid .
Fact 47 – The Royal Families of Europe use homeopathic medicine and Queen Elizabeth II of England never travels anywhere without her homeopathic vials of medicine .
Logical Fallacy : appeal to authority .
Error : since the Queen is a medical authority , as a medical doctor I am an authority on constitutional monarchy .
Fact 48 – Homeopathy is practised nowadays in countries all over the world .
In India there are 100 homeopathic medical schools and around 250,000 homeopathic doctors .
Logical Fallacy : appeal to popularity .
Error : none .
But Indians have a life expectancy 20 years less than the US .
Cause and effect ?
Fact 49 – In a recent Global TGI survey where people were asked whether they trust homeopathy the following percentages of people living in urban areas said YES : 62 % in India , 58 % Brazil , 53 % Saudi Arabia , Chile 49 % , United Arab Emirates 49 % , France 40 % , South Africa 35 % , Russia 28 % , Germany 27 % , Argentina 25 % , Hungary 25 % , USA 18 % , UK 15 % ( http://www.tgisurveys.com/documents/TGI…)
Logical Fallacy : appeal to popularity .
Error :
The data is accurate , but does not validate homeopathy .
In the USA , 18 % was the percentage who trusted Wall Street in 2007 ( 11 ) .
Fact 50 – The media as a whole has been unwilling to air a defence of the efficacy of homeopathy and the validity of this 250 year old profession .
Logical Fallacy : paranoid strawman .
Error : from my perspective , the opposite is true with the media all too willing to perpetuate nonsense like homeopathy .
Fact 51 : I think Ronald Reagan was practicing homeopathy when he said “ Facts are stupid things ” .
Logical Fallacy : I like a good quote .
Error : none .

I 've said this before : it would n't be so bad if , while wrecking the planet , we could at least say we were having one hell of a party .
But I 'm not sure we are .
So many of us are working way more than we should , spending less time with those that we love than we want to , not using the talents we most value , and not connecting to any larger sense of meaning .
For many , life is a grind and what we get instead of the real satisfactions -- if we 're lucky -- is a lot of stuff .
Big houses , boats and airplane rides .
Consolation prizes .
The things we 're supposed to want .
The question is , are the things we 're supposed to want making us happy ?
Because for certain , our having more stuff is not making the planet more happy .
The more stuff we make and buy , the more greenhouse gases and air pollution and every other kind of pollution we pump out , the more the planet 's ability to support our health , happiness and security suffers .
So , back where I started , can we , while wrecking the place , at least say we 're having one hell of a party ?
Will we at least be able to say , when it 's all over , that it was worth it ?
I 'm thinking maybe not .
I 'm thinking maybe we ought to ask ourselves again what the good life really is , because it would be a shame if we trashed the place and all we got in return was , say , the mediocre life .
What makes us happy ?
What makes us fulfilled ?
What makes us feel as though we have made best use of the 75 years or so we get ?
I ask myself this all the time , because I think it is crucial .
And one thing I think is that the true good life might actually mean less stuff , fewer working hours to buy the stuff but a lot more leisure time .
That might mean fewer of us would have our own boats and jet skis , but more of us would know how to play guitar and make great art .
I might not have the money to fly around the world , but I would get to spend more time reading literature and playing with Isabella .
In other words , we could let the planet save its resources and , at the same time , instead of working our butts off , maybe become the people we really want to be .
That 's called redefining the good life .
Now imagine this .
Imagine a society and an economy that did not revolve around material productivity and efficiently ensuring that all of us got as much stuff as possible .
Imagine , instead , a society and economy whose purpose is to ensure that we all got our basic needs met so that we could use the rest of our time do what fulfilled us .
Might that be an economy that costs our habitat less while paying us more ?
Might that , therefore , be a more efficient economy in terms of human satisfaction delivered per unit of resource used ?
Meanwhile , as for the picture at the top of this post , when I think thoughts like these , I experiment and ask myself what the good life would be for me ( and each of us has our own definition ) .
How might I spend more leisure time ?
So today , with time I could have used to work , I instead sat down with Isabella and drew on a piece of newspaper .
And what I 'm dreaming of just now is a way of life for our culture in which I do n't feel stressed that spending time drawing on newspaper with my little girl is time I should be using to earn more money .
A culture that supports what really sustains us instead of just the consolation prizes .
Might that be one vision of the good life ?
A good life that does n't even cost the earth ?
Obama Takes Double - Digit Lead Over McCain
A new poll shows McCain at a ten point disadvantage with just three weeks left .
Oct. 13 , 2008  -- John McCain and his vice presidential running mate , Sarah Palin , have introduced a kinder , gentler campaign against Barack Obama as the Republican duo has slipped farther behind in the polls with only three weeks left until Election Day .
The latest Washington Post / ABC
News poll indicates that Obama is pulling away from McCain , establishing a 10 - point lead in the race for the White House by a commanding 53 percent to 43 percent .
McCain had tried to overcome sliding poll numbers by aggressively attacking the Illinois senator , but the Washington Post / ABC News poll indicates that the pit - bull style may have worked against McCain and Palin .
It found that 59 percent accused McCain of negative campaigning , while 35 percent said McCain is addressing the issues .
" I think we 're headed for a very big win , " Sen . Hillary Clinton , D - N.Y. , told " Good Morning America " today .
Republicans Worry as McCain Aims for Comeback
Republicans are showing signs of worry about the state of the presidential race .
Conservative Republican William Kristol wrote in The New York Times that the McCain campaign is " close to being out - and - out dysfunctional . "
" If the race continues over the next three weeks to be a conventional one , McCain is doomed , " Kristol said .
McCain , speaking today in Virginia Beach , Va. , acknowledged his campaign was trailing , but denied the race was over .
" The national media has written us off .
Sen .
Obama is measuring the drapes , " he said to a cheering throng .
He added , " My friends , we 've got them just where we want them . "
Alluding ostensibly to the country 's economy , his experience as a POW , and his political fortunes , he said , " I know what fear feels like .
... I know what hopelessness feels like .
... I felt those things once before .
I will never let them in again .
I 'm an American .
And I choose to fight . "
" Nothing is inevitable here , " McCain said .
" We never give up .
We never quit .
We never hide from history .
We make history . "
In contrast , Obama presented an afternoon rally in Toledo , Ohio , with his most comprehensive economic plan yet , and coupled it with an admonishment for average Americans to " create a new ethic of responsibility . "
The " era of easy money " in which people are " encouraged to spend without limits " is over , and it is time to break " the cycle of debt , " he said .
" This country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we have n't seen in nearly a century , " Obama said .
" And future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test . "
McCain and Palin changed their tactics over this weekend , toning down their rhetoric and insisting to their supporters that they will battle Obama but with " respect . "
At a rally in St. Clairsville , Ohio , Sunday night , Palin dropped her usual references to Obama " palling around " with terrorists and did n't mention Obama 's acquaintance with former 1960s radical Bill Ayers .
That reference has prompted supporters in the last week to angrily shout out things like " traitor " and " off with his head . "
Instead , the Alaska governor attacked Obama for his abortion - rights stance saying , " It 's not negative and it's not mean - spirited in a campaign for me to ask you to check out our opponent 's record . "
At another point , Palin told the crowd , " I 'm not being negative , not mean - spirited , but please check out his record on partial - birth abortion and on the Child Born - Alive Act , and I 'll let you judge for yourself . "
Hillary Clinton Predicts ' Big ' Obama Win , ' Appreciates ' McCain 's Efforts to Calm Race
Clinton , speaking on " GMA , " noted McCain 's efforts to tone down the anger among his supporters .
" I think they 've been negative , but I think Sen. McCain himself has publicly said that 's not the direction he wants to go , and I appreciate that , " she said .
McCain has made appeals to his audiences in recent days that they confront Obama 's candidacy with respect , arguing that Obama is a " decent family man . "
For McCain to win next month , he will have to do what no other presidential candidate has ever done -- come back from a 10 - point deficit with only three weeks to go .
" No candidate has ever lost with a lead like this since modern polling began in 1936 , " ABC News ' senior Washington correspondent George Stephanopoulos told " GMA . "
Stephanopoulos said Obama 's candidacy is riding a surge of public opinion , fueled by the current economic crisis , which is devastating for the Republicans .
A record number 90 percent of Americans feel the country is on the wrong track and 73 percent disapprove of President Bush 's performance , according to the ABC / Post poll .
That disapproval number is also a record , and because Bush is a Republican , it makes it harder for McCain , the GOP candidate , to argue that he would be best to handle the economy .
Obama Hammers Economy as McCain Looks for Comeback
Obama has also fared better in the debates .
More Americans , 32 percent , felt better about Obama after the first two debates .
Only 12 percent had a better opinion of McCain after the first two debates .
The third and final showdown will be held Wednesday .
" It 's McCain 's last chance , " Stephanopoulos said .
" McCain may be tempted in the last debate to go hard on the attack , but that could end up hurting him more than helping him in this environment , " Stephanopoulos said .
McCain has surprised his critics before .
He was counted out in the Republican primaries , only to come back and win the party 's nomination .
" This is a tough campaign , " McCain told ABC News ' Charlie Gibson in an exclusive interview last week .
" I 'm the underdog .
I 've always been the underdog from the beginning . "

Pelamis in action at Aguçadoura Suddenly a lonely spot on the Portuguese coast has become the centre of the wave power industry .
The beach at Agucadoura , just north of Porto , is where electricity from the world 's first wave farm is being cabled ashore .
Five kilometres out to sea a Pelamis wave machine is gently riding the Atlantic swell , generating power for the Portuguese grid .
The wave farm has just been officially launched after a frustrating delay of more than a year .
" We had an issue with the underwater connections " , explains engineering manager , Ross Henderson .
He is sitting with me in the beachfront substation which takes in the power .
" I can't believe such a small thing cost the project a whole year . "
The practicalities
To understand the engineering problem , you have to appreciate how the wave machines work .
Pelamis is an ancient word for sea snake .
And it is true that the machines look like giant metal snakes floating in the water .
Each one has four long sections with three " power modules " hinged between them .
There are large hydraulic rams sticking into the modules .
As the long sections twist and turn in the waves they pull the rams in and out of the modules like pistons .
The huge force of the rams is harnessed to run generators in the power modules .
But tethering the snakes to the seabed is a major challenge .
The system has to be able to cope with the worst sea conditions .
The Portuguese machines in production Pelamis Wave Power developed an underwater plug , which floats 15 to 20 metres below the surface .
The snakes can be attached in one movement without any help from divers .
But when the system was installed off Portugal in slightly deeper water than engineers were used to , the plug would n't float properly .
The foam keeping it buoyant could n't stand the extra water pressure .
" We worked it out quickly , but it took a while to fix the problem , " laments Ross .
" Our buoyancy foam was fine when we tried it out off Orkney but it could n't cope in Portugal . "
The Pelamis engineers designed new floats , changing the foam .
Then they had to wait through a stormy winter before they could install them .
What happens next ?
Two more wave machines should soon be in position , making three in all .
At full production the company says they will be able to generate enough power for 1,500 homes .
And 25 more machines are on order for Portugal .
It 's been an expensive wait , but Ross Henderson believes the company has built up the expertise to deal with a variety of sea conditions .
" We managed to do the changeover using much smaller boats than we 're used to in the North Sea , where everything is geared up for the oil industry . "
So installations should be cheaper in future .
Pelamis is looking at new projects in Norway , Spain , France , South African and North America .
Meanwhile , four machines are being installed off Orkney next year , with seven more due to go in north of Cornwall the year after .

What are these ?
GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin is effectively turning over questions about her record as Alaska ’s governor to John McCain ’s political campaign , part of an ambitious Republican strategy to limit embarrassing disclosures and carefully shape her image for voters in the rest of the country .
That ’s the lead in from the Anchorage Daily News story about the latest GOP strong - arm tactics to perform what many Alaskans feel is an outside political takeover of the state ’s Troopergate investigation .
A pack of high - powered east coast lawyers are the new artisans of the Palin “ image ” .
If anyone has a question about Palin ’s 20 months as governor , ask the McCain campaign , because apparently no one else can give you the answers .
This is not going over well in Alaska .
I ’ll use my usual caveat that there are lots of Alaskans who happily subscribe to the “ Sarah right or wrong ” mentality , and will continue to do so .
However , the progressive take on this whole latest mess is only slightly short of taking torches and pitchforks and surrounding the Attorney General ’s office , demanding an end to the stonewalling .
I ’ve watched Alaskan progressives that I personally know go from saying , “ Wow !
I ca n’t believe I voted for a Republican ! ” to , “ She ’s doing OK .
I do n’t agree with everything , but I do n’t regret my vote ” to being so furiously seething angry they just ca n’t say anything .
This means that there ’s a shift , and shifts tend to bring along all people to a certain degree .
If there ’s one way to tick off Alaskans it ’s by bringing in ‘ outsiders ’ to try to control state affairs .
Imagine if you will how a small independant nation would feel being invaded by the superpower next door .
It ’s like that .
I ’ve even lived to see the day that Republican State Senate President Lyda Green ( often vilified by Democrats over the years ) agreed to do an interview on the local progressive talk radio station , and was practically hailed as a hero .
Why ?
For simply stating the investigation should and will move forward despite the fact that the Attorney General , under the influence of McCain lawyers , said that state employees would defy their subpoenas .
“ Nothing has changed , ” she said .
“ Our job is to find the truth . ”
Real integrity coming from either side of the aisle is what Alaskans want .
It ’s in desperately short supply these days .
And again , and again , I hear Alaskans quoting that now infamous promise of our governor ( who is still our governor by the way ) to run the state with “ ethical , open and transparent ” government .
It remains to be seen how effective the so - called “ Truth Squad ” is in ‘ shaping her image ’ in the rest of the country , but they are not doing her any favors here at home .
I ’ve never heard so many people say they ca n’t wait to see her new approval ratings .
Meanwhile , the opposing side , not to be outdone by a goofy name , has come up with “ Alaska Mythbusters , ” a nod to the popular television show .
This white hat version of the Orwellian “ Truth Squad ” is made up mostly of elected officials who have opposed or know Palin and who criticize her work .
So what does the Attorney General Talis Colberg have to say for himself ?
I know a couple people who know Colberg , and respected him deeply until recently .
I heard from a friend of his that this whole thing is really taking a toll on him .
“ He ’s really a decent guy , ” says my bewildered friend .
So , what say you sir ?
Hello ?
Are you there ?
Oh .
Talis Colberg just went “ on vacation ” to Kansas .
You ca n’t make this stuff up .
Beware of tornadoes , falling houses , and flying monkeys !
Nothing would surprise me any more .
The new banknotes have failed to curb inflation Zimbabwe 's annual inflation rate - already the world 's highest - has soared to 231,000,000 % , newly released official figures for July show .
The rise - from 11,200,000 % last month - was largely due to increases in the prices of bread and cereals .
A landmark power - sharing deal between President Robert Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has failed to ease the country 's economic crisis .
Meanwhile , the UN says it needs $ 140 m for food aid over the next six months .
The UN World Food Programme estimates that two million people are in need of food aid , and that the figure will rise to 5.1 million - or 45 % of the population - by early 2009 .
" Millions of Zimbabweans have already run out of food or are surviving on just one meal a day - and the crisis is going to get much worse in the coming months , " said WFP official Mustapha Darboe .
The inflation figures are from July - before the power - sharing deal - but reports from Zimbabwe suggest that the prices of many goods has continued to shoot up , while the value of the Zimbabwe dollar is plummeting .
Mediation row In September , it was agreed that Mr Mugabe - Zimbabwe 's leader for the last 28 years - would remain president while Mr Tsvangirai would become prime minister .
Some outlets have been licensed to sell goods in US dollars
But more than three weeks later , the two sides have yet to reach agreement on the make - up of the new cabinet .
On Thursday , Mr Tsvangirai repeated calls by his Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) for South Africa 's former President Thabo Mbeki to resume his role as mediator and help break the stalemate .
" We have declared a deadlock and therefore the process cannot move forward except in the presence of the facilitator , " he said .
Negotiations are deadlocked over who will control key ministries including defence , finance , home affairs and state security .
But Mr Mugabe 's Zanu - PF has rejected the MDC 's call , saying no outside mediation is needed .
The president had said a government would be formed last week .
Unemployment is reported to be about 80 % of the adult population .
In a bid to combat the shortages of many basic goods , the government has allowed some shops to sell in foreign currency .
Critics of Mr Mugabe say he triggered the economic crisis when he began seizing white - owned farms for land redistribution ahead of parliamentary elections in 2000 .
But Mr Mugabe blames Western sanctions which target him and his chief supporters for wrecking Zimbabwe 's economy .

A Toronto Liberal incumbent has won a court injunction against his Conservative rival ordering him and his campaign to pull a defamatory campaign flyer that alleges he has a poor attendance record .
Ontario Superior Court Justice George Strathy ruled Sunday that Conservative candidate Axel Kuhn and his staff must stop publishing and distributing a brochure that makes false claims about Borys Wrzesnewskyj .
The pamphlet claims Wrzesnewskyj skipped dozens of parliamentary committee meetings , but the Liberal incumbent for the riding of Etobicoke Centre said he 's only a full - time member of one of the six committees listed in the brochure .
In his ruling , the judge wrote that the words in Kuhn 's flyer are " clearly defamatory . "
" They imply that the plaintiff has been derelict in his duties as a member of Parliament and that he does not deserve to be paid his salary , " Strathy wrote .
" Based upon the sworn evidence of the plaintiff , the words cannot be justified . "
In a statement released after the ruling , Wrzesnewskyj defended his record in Parliament and called on Kuhn to withdraw his candidacy ahead of Tuesday 's election .
" The Conservative candidate and the Conservative Party of Canada have made blatantly false statements about my voting record and attendance in the House of Commons and at committee meetings , " Wrzesnewskyj said .
" He 's dropping flyers with these statements on Thanksgiving weekend just before the election knowing that there 's a virtual impossibility to respond . "
In the injunction papers , Wrzesnewskyj alleges that Kuhn 's campaign team distributed tens of thousands of the brochures in the riding and that the Liberal candidate only found out about it this weekend after his campaign was contacted about the claims made in the document .
The Conserative candidate 's campaign was not immediately available for comment .

Rush Limbaugh , somewhat predictably , is n't backing down from his claim that Colin Powell 's endorsement of Barack Obama was a product of their both being black men -- that is , that it was about race , not policy ;
" I thought it should be about race , " he said .
" I thought you liberals thought this was a historic candidacy because finally we are going to elect a black guy …why hide behind this , why act like it 's not about race ? "
" This was all about Powell and race , nothing about the nation and its welfare , " Limbaugh added .
Limbaugh simply does n't get it .
Obama 's candidacy is historic , yes -- but what has made it possible all along is that his campaign has been about transcending race , not wallowing in it .
Obama has carefully eschewed identity politics throughout this campaign .
Meanwhile , the Republican campaign has been about nothing but .
And it has its most transparent mouthpiece in Limbaugh .
Limbaugh is the guy at the sports bar who carefully tabulates the racial composition of every team on the screen and roots accordingly .
If a team has a black quarterback , he predicts they 're going to lose .
Heaven forfend that any black player demonstrate too much enthusiasm over a touchdown or a dunk or a home run , or that any black linebacker should level a white quarterback , because then the " thug " and " jungle " references come out .
He hates Tiger Woods with an inexplicable venom ( mostly because he 's too uppity " full of himself " ) .
We all know that guy .
( Some of them are in our families . )
And anyone who 's even moderately serious about sports , and moderately knowledgeable about them , knows that that guy is completely and hopelessly full of shit .
What anyone who knows sports can tell you is this : certain races may tend to certain attributes culturally , but the only thing that matters in sports is how you perform on the field .
Race is obliterated by this .
Because whites , blacks , Latinos , Asians , Pacific Islanders ... their ultimate athletic measure is how they do their jobs .
Well , sports are n't politics , but they can be a useful analogy .
The choice Americans face this election is of such immense gravity , the stakes so high , that we simply can't afford to be distracted by the rantings of know - nothings more intent on sowing division than solving the all - too - serious problems -- indeed , a challenge of Augean proportions -- that lie ahead of us .
What matters is finding the person who clearly is most likely to perform well on the field .
And the majority of Americans know that .
The cloistered True Believers like Limbaugh , clinging to their race - baiting ways ... not so much .
Yes , we can be proud to elect a black man President for the first time in history .
But we are only doing so because we have judged the content of his character , not the color of his skin .
Obama will be the next president not because he is black , but because he is the best man for the job .
I suspect , deep in his heart of hearts , Rush Limbaugh knows this .
And it is driving him insane .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. employers cut payrolls at the steepest rate in 5 - 1/ 2 years in September , slashing an unexpectedly large 159,000 jobs as employment contracted for a ninth straight month , suggesting the economy may be in recession .

REUTERS / Chip East
The unemployment rate was unchanged from August at 6.1 percent , the highest rate in five years , as 121,000 people left the workforce , the Labor Department reported on Friday .
September ’s job losses were much more severe than predicted by Wall Street economists surveyed by Reuters , who had forecast 100,000 jobs would be cut .
The report likely will ratchet up pressure on members of the U.S. House of Representatives to vote for a $ 700 - billion rescue package for banks and other financial firms burdened by bad mortgage - related assets , which is contributing to a spreading credit crunch .
Some analysts said the monthly employment data pointed to deepening economic woes .
“ We ’ve seen weaker data in history , but these look pretty decisively to be the beginning of something worse , ” said Pierre Ellis , senior economist with Decision Economics Inc. in New York , adding it might make the Federal Reserve more inclined to cut interest rates despite its concern over inflation .
But David Watt , senior currency strategist with RBC Capital markets in Toronto , said it was moderately encouraging that the unemployment rate , which is compiled from a separate survey , did not shoot higher .
“ I do n’t think there ’s any doubt that the labor market has weakened , but it ’s not deteriorating quite as quickly as the headline indicated , ” Watt said .
U.S. stock index futures rose on hopes Congress will approve the huge financial bailout package .
U.S. government debt prices pared gains and the dollar pared losses against the euro .
Federal fund futures held gains , with traders expecting a 50 basis point rate cut in October .
September ’s cuts follow revised losses of 73,000 jobs in August and 67,000 in July and show the decline in employment is accelerating .
Some 51,000 manufacturing jobs were lost last month on top of 56,000 cut in August , the 27th straight month in which manufacturers slashed their payrolls .
Job cuts were nearly across the board in September in every major category with the exception of government , which added 9,000 jobs .
The average work week in manufacturing industries was the lowest in three years at 40.7 hours .
Overall hours of work in all industries slipped to 33.6 a week in September from 33.7 in August -- the lowest since November 2004 .
Hurricane Ike , which hit the Gulf coast , and a strike at aircraft maker Boeing Co. did not impact the data because the employees affected were on payrolls for at least part of the Labor Department ’s survey period .

Reporting the Oil Story – panel discussion

A “ sea change ” this year in reportage on peak oil .
A higher acceptance of the notion , primarily driven by price & public alarm .
If the price remains below the pain threshold , we may see coverage diminish and a loss of momentum in more efficient vehicles etc .
It ’s been a very strange year for the oil business , with wicked volatility but no major geopolitical events .
What lessons should we draw from this ?
What are the bigger concepts ?
Various factions … from techno - optimists to hardcore doomers .
Analysts , journalists , traders … all focus on different aspects of the story , be it inventory levels , or official announcements , or trading patterns .
The Oil Drum is one of the few domains where the conversation is factual and interesting and intelligent .
But there is an element of willful blindness also that we are working against in the media ; when gas prices fell below $ 4 / gal , a lot of ears started to close .
“ Our problem is that the supply is old and the demand is young . ” – quote he heard at an IEA meeting in Paris last week .
Doomers vs. arch - optimists : the reality will lie somewhere in between , but where ?
He ran a couple of informal polls amongst his contacts to predict the price of oil 6 months in the future … and everybody was very wrong .
Erica Etelson
Peak oil was one of the most censored stories of 2005 , but we ’re past that now .
Still , many articles seem to studiously avoid the term .
Google the term “ peak oil ” and you find yourself in a deep , dark realm where the collapse of society is a foregone conclusion .
Media has short attention span and when the pain / price level falls , media coverage falls too .
Most journalists would be happy to see the price fall and stay down so they do n’t have to write about it anymore .
The framing of the story is a problem .
It ’s currently framed as an industry problem , with no sense of government accountability , even though gov’t has known about this issue for decades and done nothing about it .
The Hirsch Report in 2005 should have been greeted with screaming headlines , likewise the GAO report ; in fact there were no headlines at all .
Journalists have failed to hold politicians ’ feet to the fire or ask them the hard questions about these glaringly serious issues .
Industry is n’t going to somehow save the day with some new technology .
Journalists really need to ensure that stepwise changes are made .
E.g. , Ask for meetings with the editorial boards of news organizations .
Contact ombudsman ’s office for newspapers and ask for coverage .
Do n’t forget about local media .
Write your op - eds and letters to the editor .
At the highest levels of government , they ’re asleep at the wheel , but at the community level , there is much being done .
Try to reach sympathetic ears in your alumni networks & publications .
Minority journalists for communities of color need to get the word and get the word out faster , because they will be hit by the effects first and worst .
There actually is quite a bit of good reporting out there , but we do n’t make adequate use of it .
Every time you see a good article on peak oil , send it to everyone you know , including elected officials .
Bart Anderson
The peak oil meme is more common now than it was , but the understanding is very shallow and driven by price pain .
Oil is n’t the only crucial thing at peak .
Consider peak phosphorus !
Presentation : “ The Evolution of Peak Oil Coverage ” Problem at the beginning : little awareness ; media & gov’t uninterested ; nowhere to publish ; few ways to communicate Around 2004 , some new books ( Simmons , Kunstler , Heinberg , Goodstein , Deffeyes ) ; a few media mentions ; new sites ( peakoil.com , Energy Bulletin , LATOC , etc. )
Around 2005 , new communities : ASPO - USA , TOD , PCI ; personal blogs & new writers ; documentaries ( “ The End of Suburbia ” ) , Gov’t reports ( Hirsch Report , GAO Report ) ; media interest ( but little depth ) 2008 : Mainstream now , with more books , web sites , documentaries , new writers , investors , regular coverage in the press esp .
the financial press , and a spike in prices .
There are now 4.3 million hits on Google for “ peak oil ” .
New interest from industry and governments , and local groups ( PCI , Transition Towns )
A continuing role in critiquing energy technologies , lobbying , monitoring , & working with media and allies ( investors , planners , environmentalists )
What we ’ve done right : networked , non-hierarchical ; non-partisan ; more volunteers ; welcoming ; stimulating , constant stream of content ( “ like an ongoing graduate seminar ” )
Limitations :
It ’s all volunteers ; limited to information and persuading – we can’t actually do things ; narrow demographics ( mainly white technical professional males in English - speaking countries )
Trends : climate , politics , economics , food & ag , urban design & transportation
Other peaks : fossil fuels ( nat gas , coal , uranium ) , other minerals ( phosphorus ) , water , eco-systems ( we have only a 13 - year supply of indium at current rates ( ? ) )
New voices : Third World , women , farmers , blue - collar workers , small business , artists
Q&A
What about the “ drill here , drill now ” crowd ?
What about peak oil and invading Iraq ?
Kjell Aleklett : How do we reach non-English speakers ?
How do we share materials that originated in other languages to English - speaking audiences ?
Chris Nelder :
How can we improve the factual reporting of peak oil ?
Etelson : Send the Peak Oil Media Guide to editorial boards .
Anderson : Contact the writers directly , be nice , do n’t be accusatory .
King :
Try to establish a dialogue with journalists and editors .
How do we get economists involved ?
Anderson : economists are not our friends , they are a hotbed of opposition !
Try to find the sympathetic ones .
Etelson and Anderson : Paul Krugman , and the editors of Freakonomics are sympathetic .
Mike Ruppert : Optimistic stories are always above the fold ; negative stories are always on p. 22 .
What ’s up with that ?
King : Disagree ; new articles on difficulties of oil sands , shales , offshore , etc. have regularly appeared on p. 1 of the WSJ .
There is a greater sense of urgency about peak oil now than there once was .
Ron Swenson : Desperation is driving us to oil shale , tar sands , extreme technology , etc. with greatly over - optimistic expectations , while at the same time solar and other renewables are regularly dissed .
Can coverage become a little more balanced about renewables , or an improving trend ?
King :
There are a lot more energy ads now than ever before .
Energy stories of all kinds are certainly dominating the news .
Etelson : I write about permaculture regularly but I do n’t call it permaculture because I want to get it published .
How can we get more politicians to talk about it ?
King : Roscoe Barlett has been giving his talk many , many times to a mostly - empty chamber .
It ’s a hard thing to get politicians to talk about a story that nobody wants to hear .
Liz Warren ( who covered peak oil as a “ most censored story ” in her thesis ) :
We seem to expect media to be entertaining ; how can peak oil be presented in a more entertaining way , and how can we reach youth ?
Etelson : Youth are particularly interested in community gardening , permaculture , etc. King : Props to Oily Cassandra and KrisCan !
[ Hear , hear ! ]
Do IEA officials express privately a different sentiment than what is reported ?
King :
Yes , absolutely , there are folks at EIA , IEA , Saudi officials , even President Bush who know that the options are limited going forward .

Analyses from The Oil Drum – panel discussion
Robert Rapier , Oil Drum Contributor , R - Squared Energy Blog , Accsys Technologies ,
Jeff Vail , Oil Drum Contributor , Davids Graham & Stubs LLP
Brian Maschhoff , Oil Drum Contributor
Kyle Saunders , Oil Drum Editor , Moderator
Robert Rapier : “ The Energy Information Providers “
His first ASPO conference because his previous employer , ConocoPhillips , did n’t want him to come !
Review of the most common energy information agencies : EIA , IEA , CERA
EIA is good for : Current data on exports , consumption , optimistic forecasts , etc. Good statistics .
Outlook reports , etc . This Week In Petroleum ( TWIP ) – weekly – has the power to move markets because it has the inventory updates .
How I use the EIA :
To debunk the claims made by confused politicians , etc .
To get good shared information , e.g. , import data .
For current reporting , e.g. , gasoline stocks during a hurricane .
What I do n’t use the EIA for : Price forecasting : over the past 12 years , have been consistently wrong , by as much as 127 % .
Average error was 53 % .
Supply forecasting : consistently too optimistic .
But the problem is that everyone uses their forecasts for policy planning !
Zoom in on 2008 Annual Outlook : expects oil imports to suddenly drop after a long period of constant growth !
IEA ( International Energy Agency ) : Energy policy advisor to 27 countries IEA Oil Market Report , World Energy Outlook , other good reports , special reports , statistics on oil , natural gas , coal , etc .
How I use the IEA : Monthly OMR ( Oil Market Report ) has the most current estimates of world oil supply .
Excellent source of worldwide inventory data , world refining margins , etc . Understanding supply / demand risks .
Watch the charts , e.g. , stock builds , days of forward cover .
IEA has adopted a more pessimistic tone than the EIA …. downward revisions of OPEC spare capacity , impending supply crunch , “ peak lite “
CERA : Clients are big oil companies , and CERA reports the story they like .
Forecasts have been terrible since 2002 .
E.g. , prediction of $ 20s – $ 30s in 2005 for oil price , actual was $ 65 / bbl Forecasts of supply wildly overdone
In 2008 , they reversed course and noted a “ perception ” of supply issues .
Misc sources : BP Statistical Review of World Energy Drumbeat on TOD Oil Price information Service ( OPIS ) Platts
The major agencies do a great job of reporting data , but a terrible job of forecasting .
Government and business leaders who depend on this data for their decisions will be badly misled .
Jeff Vail : “ The Geopolitics of Energy “
“ Rational extraction sets the stage for geopolitical problems . ”
Geopolitical challenge rises as geological challenges increase ( ? )
“ Market - driven conservation & efficiency increase in elasticity . ”
More extreme measures are needed to ensure supply .
“ Highly theoretical disputes drive very real conflict . ”
Oil as a subset of the intersection of “ nation ” and “ state . ” E.g. , disputes between legal owners and moral owners of oil resources .
How do you meet the needs of all stockholders together ?
“ Actors seek to secure their slice of a shrinking pie . ”
If we seek to maintain our current share of energy supply as others ’ shares shrink , who loses ?
Pipelines are a good example of this , predetermining who has access and who does n’t .
“ Military adventurism . ”
“ Tactical evolution increases geopolitical threat to energy . ”
“ These developments act as positive feedback loops ”
“ Geopolitical feedback loops exacerbate peak oil ” [ interesting graph ! ]
… Production under geopolitical reality ( feedback loops ) will make the reality considerably worse than the geologically feasible production curve .
“ This is a global feedback system . ”
Mexico ’s events affect Iraq , affects Nigeria , etc .
“ ‘ Solving ’ symptoms leads to alternative negative outcomes . ” A lesson in unintended consequences .
“ Addressing causes requires radical restructuring . ”
Radically : Decentralized ?
Renewable ?
Vernacular modes of consumption ?
Realistic ?
What is a realistic way to choose and then implement an approach to stopping geopolitical feedback loops ?
Really , geopolitics is a force of nature .
Our energy future is n’t solely determined by what is possible geologically , politically , or economically .
Geopolitics can always trump those factors .
Brian Maschhoff ( “ JoulesBurn ” on TOD ) : “ Saudi Aramco and the Art of Oilfield ‘ Maintenance ’ “
What does “ maintenance ” mean ?
It really means production … maintaining a certain level of production .
But “ production ” is n’t right either , because you ’re not making anything , you ’re extracting .
Maintenance : Putting wells where no well has gone before ( unswept zones ) .
Reworking existing vertical wells ( simulation , horizontal tracking )
What about existing Saudi Aramco megaprojects ?
2003 -2011 … delays are common .
A lot of inflated numbers on the heavy oil side for KSA
Madness : Monitor Saudi Aramco from the comfort of your own home .
Classify and quantify oil field infrastructure from satellite photos .
On a paltry budget .
But we ca n’t measure oil flowing from wells , nor make money from doing it .
Methods : Google Earth , Digital Globe imagery ( Quickbird Satellite ) , finding wells , counting , aligning and comparing imagery with dated maps ( find what has changed )
“ Jeopardy ! ” slide … what fields are really being discussed in the press ?
Looking at satellite photos , it can be tough to distinguish what is what …e.g. , gas wells vs. oil wells .
North Ghawar shows major overhaul , after 40 years of operation .
[ Numerous slides showing progression of oil wells drilled in various parts of Saudi Arabia . ]
Diagnosis :
Old production is being replaced daily .
But they ’re running out of dry rock in Ghawar .
Still a lot of oil , but they ’re out of giant fields .
Expanded production will depend on a collection of a lot of smaller fields .
Q&A :
How concerned is the US military and what are they doing ?
Vail : Studies are being conducted into the energy footprint of various options .
Military is clearly concerned but they may not yet understand the long term implications of it .
Why did n’t Robert Rapier include USGS data ?
Because the data is pretty worthless .
What about population ?
Vail :
Third world is getting priced out , but there do n’t seem to be any good ( implementable ) and equitable solutions .
How much oil is left in Saudi Arabia ?
Maschhoff :
We can only go by the information they put out there .
When will Russia ’s exports fall to zero ?
Vail : Russia is one of the few cases where population ( decline ) is actually working for them .
But Russia is also exerting more control over the FSU countries that surround them .
What about water ?
Vail : Used to work on water reclamation .
Water is even less substitutable than oil .
On a question about unconventional oil production , Rapier : “ It ’s a fact that there is more than a trillion barrels of oil in shale ; it ’s also a fact that it will take more than that to get it out . ”
On the Pickens Plan : Maschhoff : Transportation fuel is a huge gaping mouth that you can throw anything into and it still wo n’t be enough .
6:30 pm – 7:30 pm
Dr. Peter R. A. Wells : “ OPEC Dilemmas , Issues , and Responses “
Introduction by Steve Andrews ; Toyota has known about peak oil since 1992 , internalized it , and thus became the Prius .
OPEC produces 42.8 % of the world ’s crude , proportion will grow as time goes on
When OPEC increases capacity , they get stuck with a loss in demand .
How much spare capacity should they invest in ?
Spare capacity currently 1.5 million barrels per day ( mbpd )
OPEC is diverse ; price hawks in Venezuela , Iran , Iraq ; others like Qatar , KSA and Kuwait with higher per capita GDP are less keen on expanding capacity
Decision making is very slow ; national heritage , timing of investment , etc…save some for the grandchildren .
When should they time the investment ?
How not to get stuck in the same situation they were in the in the 1980s ?
Why expand to reduce prices ?
Politics … Iran , Iraq , Venezuela , Nigeria , Kuwait
Fields are old , and there is competition between the old & newer producers .
Kuwait , Qatar , UAE , KSA : $ 1,5 trillion invested , mostly in the US .
They do n’t want the price to go too high for demand destruction , and they do n’t want to hurt the US too much for the sake of their investments .
New production capacity is also high risk .
Exploration success in OPEC peaked 40 years ago
The large OPEC fields are mature ( fields > 2 billion bbls reserves ) … not much has been discovered to replace the older fields .
Fields are being replaced at a very conservative rate .
World liquids supply model : OPEC is expected to make up the loss for non-OPEC supply .
Crude oil makes up 86 % of the “ crude oil ” supply [ the rest is natural gas liquids , etc. ] (? )
But it ’s not just geology ; marginal cost of supply alters the mix and the size of reserves
Balance & interaction between geology , money and politics .
Balance affected by long lead times in supply projected 5 - 15 years forward , and ultimately the finite nature of supply .
Insufficient spare capacity leads to high oil prices and demand destruction .
Excess spare capacity weakens oil prices and can reduce supply at the margin .
Most of the time , spare capacity does n’t matter to price .
It mattered in the 1980s when there was too much spare capacity , but that floor was set by the needs of the KSA budget and it stuck for 20 years .
Around 2002 , KSA capacity started to fall , in part due to increasing demand from China , but there was also the declining production from non-OPEC .
Then price started to rise dramatically .
Now high prices will lead to some new capacity and a short period of lower prices .
We have produced 864 billion ( bn ) barrels ( bbls ) to date ; 1,111 bn remaining & TBD ( HIS data )
According to USGS / CERA , another trillion bbls remain to be discovered .
But we have nowhere near that .
Enhanced Oil Recovery ( EOR ) :
In US peaked around 2000 via miscible non-hydrocarbon gas injection ( CO2 , N2 )
US EOR : specific to field , reservoir , oil type , location … works best in poor reservoirs with light oil ; not so much for deepwater .
No gains for light - medium oils in good quality reservoirs
Global EOR : potential 220-470 billion barrels ( CERA : 592 billion barrels ) and most of that is in OPEC , so we wo n’t see it for a long time in the future .
Total potential : ~ 3 trillion barrels
Peak around 2012 - 2013 for conventional crude .
( CERA estimate way , way higher , assumed to be filled by exploration success and EOR )
Methodology : using simulation model approach to crude forecasting , using probabilities , time between discovery & first production , field - by - field specs
EOR : good match to historical production for non-OPEC .
Most non-OPEC , non-FSU EOR projects are offshore ( 80 % ! ) ( ?)
625 bn bbls produced , 530 bn to go for non-OPEC ; we ’re at the peak for non-OPEC .
Most of OPEC is “ above ground ” risk ; for non-OPEC , “ below ground ”
OPEC : issue is not reserves but maximum sustainable rate and pace of getting there .
KSA field - by - field assessment : total remaining : 278 bn bbls ; production to end of 2007 : 115 bn bbls
Iran : produced to end of 2007 : 61 bn bbls ; Total remaining : 90 bn bbls
Iraq : produced to 2007 : 31 bn bbls ; remaining : 177 bn bbls
Venezuela : 58 bn bbls produced by end of 2007 ; remaining : 322 bn bbls…will mostly be produced after 2020 because it ’s undesirable heavy oil
OPEC production forecast :
Will reach 40 mbpd , no higher , mainly due to political decisions
Challenges for OPEC
Balance creation of capacity to guesstimate future call on OPEC Difference between non-OPEC liquids and demand Excessive investment needed …
Natural gas liquids ( NGL ) : Peak around 2020 ; non-crude oil liquids ( CTL , GTL , tar sands , etc ) peak around 2025 ( ? )
Peak liquids : ~98-105 mbpd around 2020 ( 2017 -2030 ) … demand has surprisingly little impact
World crude oil peaks around 2015 ; around 2015 will be a major crisis in price .
Other liquids like biofuels , tar sands , etc. help to defter world liquid peak by 3 - 5 years , but cannot ramp up quickly .
They take a long time & a lot of investment .
Does not believe that north Ghawar is about to water out .
They will have to start EOR in the region within the next few years because it will then begin to water out .
Re : Kashagan , the problems are technical and environmental .
Expensive gas extraction & processing & reinjection ; also impacts on sturgeon .
2013 -2015 is when oil production might begin , and will ramp up slowly , disposal of sulfur will be an issue .
Estimating yet - to - be - discovered oil is “ an opinion . ”
About 300 bn bbls yet to be discovered ; few oil geologists agree with USGS .

OIL : Once Cheap , Never Easy
Panel discussion
Ken Verosub , Professor of Geology , UC Davis
Gill Mull , Alaska Geological Survey , retired .
Jeremy Gilbert , Barrelmore , Ltd. formerly BP Chief Petroleum Engineer
Sally Odlund , ASPO Board Member ( Moderator )
Gill Mull is ill and was unable to attend but his presentation is posted online .
Ken Verosub : “ Petroleum 101 “
Recalling Sinclair oil company and the notion that oil comes from dead dinosaurs .
Oil in fact calls from small marine micro-organisms in the ocean , which fall to the bottom when they die , to become incorporated into source rock as they decay .
A porous rock like sand or carbonate reef then must be deposited to collect the material .
On top of that there must be a cap rock to secure the deposit in a trap , and keep it from migrating to the surface .
Then the organic material must be cooked at just the right temperature : the “ oil window . ”
Most oil comes from rocks that are hundreds of millions of years old .
Reviewed various kinds of stratigraphic traps .
Reviewed seismological methods of surveying traps , like “ thumper trucks ” and “ geophone arrays ” that listen for the thumps , on up through 3 - D computer models .
All of the easy oil has been found .
Efforts to find oil are getting more extreme and technologically complex .
Reviewed the rough bell curve of an oil field ’s production , the Hubbert Curve , and his correct prediction of the peaking of US oil production in 1971 .
Discussed the relationship between discovery and production curves .
We are long past the peak of oil discovery , and have been running a growing deficit for years .
Ridiculed the scientific illiteracy of Newt Gingrich ’s “ Drill here , drill now , pay less ” campaign , and the unsubstantiated claims of Wall Street analysts who claim that we just need to drill more ( most of whom , thankfully , probably do n’t have jobs anymore )
Deepwater offshore is where much of the remaining oil is to be found .
But we wo n’t find any big fields … reviewed Hubbert Curve of oil discovery , showing the declining size of oil finds .
Even if we did have some large new finds , it takes about 10 years to bring any of it to market .
How much time do WE have left ? : Total US reserves : About 20.9 billion barrels Total US daily consumption : 20.7 mbpd , of which we import 11.7 mbpd Domestic oil , daily consumption : 9 mbpd US domestic oil , annual consumption : 3 billion barrels per year 20.9/3= 7 years
So : we only have until about 2015 +/- 2 years for remaining domestic production !
Global competition for remaining oil , with a likely global peak around 2010 , means that prices must rise to resolve the tension .
World : 32 billion barrels per year ( bpy ) , call it 35 billion bpy / 365 or ~ 100 mbpd is the theoretical peak .
Again : 2015 , +/- 2 years … ” It ’s crunch time ! ”
Official future production estimates defy this reality …
As consumption rises fairly slowly in industrialized countries , it ’s rising much faster in developing countries , leading to a fairly sharp global increase in the rate of oil consumption .
“ This is a global problem ! ”
In China , everybody wants to drive an SUV , and aspire to a US standard of living .
Since 1965 , US consumption has increased 70 % , while China ’s has increased over 3000 %
100 mbpd on the chart is likely to be around 2016 , the maximum theoretical peak .
“ In about 7 years , demand for oil will exceed maximum total oil production .
Then what happens ??? ”
Why ca n’t we be like the Europeans , and use far less oil per capita ?
Are you ready to live like a European and cut your oil consumption in half ?
Then which two of your family ’s four cars are you willing to give up ?
Which processed foods will you give up ?
Which half of your wardrobe ?
Etc .
But because there are so many more people in the developing world than in the US , a 50 % reduction in our energy consumption only gives them a 33 % gain .
Inversely , if the rest of the world were to increase their consumption by 100 % , we would have to reduce ours by 80 % .
Gill Mull : “ Alaskan Oil : Prudhoe Bay Discovery and Outlook for North Slope Oil “
Mull is ill and unable to attend , so some slides were highlighted by Sally Odlund of ASPO .
TAPS has min capacity of 200 Kbpd to keep it flowing .
Some photos and maps of ANWR and various wells
Alaskan oil production peaked in 1988
ANWR has surface seeps , rich source rocks with anticlines and caps
P50 [ 50 % probability ] estimate for ANWR : About 10 billion bbls in aggregate
All of the new fields put together can’t come close to overcoming the peak profile caused by the North Slope
Jeremy Gilbert : “ Peak Oil Global Overview , An American Wake Up Call “
“ It ’s time for you guys to wake up ! ”
First wake up call : [ ASPO conferences in ] Uppsala 2001 , then Denver 2005 … .
Now , after 7 years , what ’s changed ?
While America slept : Discovery rates continue decades - long fall Calculations suggest reserves can’t meet demand projections
Some recognition of political , investment risk in developing resources
2008 : No improvement in resource situation .
New , more accurate calculations of supply define earlier and clearer peak .
Political will to increase supply clearly absent ; prices not stimulating investment to increase supply .
IOCs are not investing the way we have hoped and expected .
Oil consumption per capita :
The US , Canada and the Middle East use the most by far , and there has been little changed on a per-capita basis .
[ Excellent morphed maps ! ]
IEA ’s wake up call : “ There are three problems : Geology , investment , and policy of main producers .
These , taken together , make the future of oil very difficult . ” – Fatih Birol , IEA Chief Economist
Some wild statements of wishful thinking …
“ In your dreams ”
The explorers will fix it ; there ’s lot of oil out there – think of Jack and Tupi ; add in the OCS ( Outer Continental Shelf ) and ANWR ( Arctic National Wildlife Refuge )
Worldwide reserves / production ratio is still 40 , there ’s lots of time to find other energy sources .
Technology will deal with the problem : add just 10 % to recovery efficiency and we ’re fine .
While we still have people like Kissinger and Gingrich giving us palliatives , we ’re not in a dream , we ’re in a nightmare .
Discovery peaked 40 years ago ; production increases all the time , but what we ’re producing is the oil we discovered 40 - 50 years ago .
Once the cushion of discoveries from the 1940s - 60s is used up , where will we turn ?
We discover about 1 for every 4 - 5 bbls we use today .
If all of the OCS were opened to exploration , we might get a 20 % increase in reserves .
You have to look 15 - 20 years ahead to see any substantial amount of that oil come to market .
“ This is not going to help you ! ”
It will not move the peak .
The reserves / production ratio…oil production does n’t go flat and then hit the end and plummet to zero ; it declines in a curve over time .
The world falls from ~ 85 mbpd to ~ 18 mbpd in 40 years , and ~8 mpbd in 60 years !
So yes , the oil will be produced , but not at nearly the rate we now have .
New technology : Little indication that recovery efficiency is increasing in established fields .
Main benefits seems to be in dealing with unexpected problems and in finding small accumulations .
We ’re trying harder and drilling a lot more wells , which close to doubled over the last few years , but production has been flat .
Russian oil production was counted on to keep non-OPEC production growing .
But their production has fallen from about 9.9 mbpd in 2007 to about 9.7 mbpd in 2008 .
It looks as though their production has peaked ( for whatever reason ) .
Consider that energy growth is relative to GDP growth , then realize that non-OECD is way behind us .
High gasoline prices produced a decline in gasoline consumption growth since December 2007 , with about 100 - 150 kbpd of gasoline consumption decline per month
Looking at long queues for fuel when shortages developed in China and Scotland recently .
WAKE UP , AMERICA !
Q&A
Gilbert :
The biggest problem is the general ignorance of the oil supply / demand situation .
Proposes that those who take a 10 - hour class in supply and demand on oil get a 10 % cut in their income tax .
[ If I may : A capital idea ! ]
Verosub :
The message needs to be that the problem is real , it ’s huge , it ’s global , and it ’s transformational .
Some people will die from famine , disease , etc. , but civilization as a whole will survive .
This will change the world in a way that we have not seen since the industrial revolution !
We need to throw resources at this problem in an international way .
And we should stop throwing money away on space trips to Mars , bad biofuel policies , bridges to nowhere and other wasteful projects .
Gilbert : Ca n’t account for Nansen Saleri ’s much more optimistic expectations for reserve growth .
New tech does in fact give higher efficiency & greater recovery , with recovery factor increasing from 30 % of oil - in - place years ago , to as much as 50 % today , but we need that new technology to deal with the more extreme characteristics of the remaining fields .
[ The implication being that net production will not grow due to EOR . )
The fact that remaining oil is largely heavy and sour will make life more difficult .
Verosub : Cuts will be in manufacturing , food production , etc. , not just driving less .
Gilbert : About a half - trillion dollars per year flows into the Middle East for oil .
We ’ll see wars , we ’ll see famine , we ’ll see increased blackouts and shortages .

Matthew Simmons : “ Grappling with Energy ‘ Risk ’ ”
[ See video and related interview at the conference here . ]
Aging Infrastructure , Workforce , etc .
The combination of Ike , Bernanke and Paulson made for a week that will go down in history .
How casually we take the concept of risk !
Era of deregulation , “ transparency , ” globalization of capital markets and securitization were suppose to take out “ financial risk ”
Derivatives were supposed to disperse risk “ elsewhere . ”
Risk has reached 300 or 400 - to - 1 in some cases .
We ’ve made a situation that is far worse than the 1920s .
Proper size was deemed to create a system that ’s too big to fail
LTCM was a prelude … Enron happened 7 years ago and was a prelude to what might happen next
And the lava gushed … Merrill , Fannie , Freddie , Lehman …
Risk is a very real term , still exists , leverage can be extremely dangerous .
The greater the risk , the faster big systems can fail
Peak oil and gas has ominous parallels to financial crisis .
Most observers do no graphs of peak oil , (? ) or how savage a post - peak world can be
Were Gustav and Ike the initial tremors of the big bang crisis ?
Recent collapse in petroleum prices created a false sense of security
Hurricane aftermath : GoM has been offstream since early Sept ( ~30 million barrels not produced ) … many plants still not producing … LOOP pipeline and HSC were crimped .
This is all draining inventories .
Could we have a “ run on the bank ” with fuel stocks like we have in the financial system and breach MOL [ minimum operating levels ] ?
Topping off tanks literally creates a run on the bank .
An example of how fast we could break the bank : 220 million vehicles 20 gal capacity each Average tank has 5 gals in it Topping off ~ 15 gallons x 220 million = stock draw of 78 million barrels .
Current finished stocks : ~ 87 million barrels !
What happens when stocks deplete ?
Food supply in jeopardy within a week Economy slows to a crawl Financial markets panic Energy risk is finally grasped .
If heating oil also becomes scarce , a cold winter will be a disaster in the US .
A few weeks of winter could deplete usable stocks .
9 -10 million homes rely100 % on heating oil for winter heating .
What are the odds ?
No one knows .
Reported petroleum stocks are only estimates ; there is zero data on secondary / tertiary stocks .
The odds of this eruption occurring are higher than another hurricane occurring .
Reported petroleum stocks are only estimates ; there is zero data on secondary / tertiary stocks .
The odds of this eruption occurring are higher than another hurricane occurring .
“ How could the world ’s most prosperous , advanced society move into harm ’s way so fast ? ”
Peak Oil is like Gustav / Ike squared .
The ebbing of supply is equivalent to current crisis …are we flying blind into a Cat 6 storm ?
We need to demand country - by - country production data , including key fields , various grades …
Key fault lines : Energy intensity to create usable petroleum from unconventional crudes ( shales / tar sands ) .
Drilling rig tightness & shortages , but we have no data !
( No rig count !
We just have estimates ) .
We lack realistic expectations …
Is the size of oil markets “ too big to fail ? ” 85 mbpd is the world ’s largest single industrial market by several fold .
But there are no regulators like the Fed , etc .
Other risks :
The straits : Malacca , Hormuz , Yucatan / Cuba passage , etc . Key facilities : Abqaiq , LOOP , TAPS
What about insurance ?
SPR is limited and should not be used to manage prices .
Untested EIA member country energy stocks .
Line fill in pipelines and tank bottoms , then we ’re out of gas ( finished product ) .
Afterwards , we are in an uncharted sea and probably “ out - of - gas . ”
Could an energy pandemic really happen ?
Most global leaders have no idea of any of these risks .
Peak oil is still barely understood .
Peak oil is still barely understood .
It took 5 months to melt down the whole financial markets .
Energy markets could unwind in less than 30 days .
Risk is real , energy risk is real risk squared .
Rust is also energy risk squared .
98 % of the infrastructure is built out of steel … a ticking time bomb .
Energy oxymorons : Energy independence : 100 % impossible .
Improved technology : zero impact on any of these risks .
More drilling : we have no spare rigs and few places to drill with timely high impact .
We live in a dark world of hidden data on energy .
All past great crises were also ignored until we hit the tipping point .
Peak oil is the singular and most ominous risk of the 21st Century .
Q&A
Topping off tanks could cause shortages , and it will take a long time to rebuild the supply cushion .
Running out of food is the most serious implication .
Shelves can go empty in 5 - 7 days .
This last week was potentially the “ big bang ”
The Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) has n’t had a serious energy event since 2004 .
They ’re almost energy illiterate , despite being geopolitical experts .
If we radically increase tight sands and gas … Barnett Shale has saved us from some serious gas supply issues .
Net energy of Barnett Shale ( traveling 70 - 80 miles per day to the rig , plus transport of rock , etc. ) is questionable … it could be a net energy loser .
We have real limitations of rigs , people , etc .
We ’re not gonna flood the world with shale gas .
I would n’t want to be in a presidential cabinet for one minute …
Peak oil is so much more real , and more immediate , and serious than global warming , but we have a large consensus about the latter ( when the data is even less clear ) and near total illiteracy on the former .
Comment on Peter Wells ’ more optimistic assessment of KSA reserves last night :
We really do n’t have any idea how much is there .
110 billion proven , 260 billion est .
What we really need to know is how much is light sweet , and when / how fast will the largest fields decline ?
If I could get over the worry about people topping off their tanks , I ’d be more optimistic .
We ’re going to have to rebuild our energy infrastructure .
The Starbucks economy came to a grinding halt , and we ’re going to have a long period of Wall Street remorse .
Dr. Sadad al Husseini says that the world basically has no spare production capacity left , and I believe his estimate .
The fact that we have to guess at the global depletion rate should make us all nervous .
Why do n’t we have better data on depletion ?
When will it be possible for an American politician to tell the truth about energy ?
I think it ’s possible , based on my experience in speaking before many audiences in the last several years .
Re : the new IEA report in November … Birol has been working on it full time for months .
For the first time we ’ll have a supply driven model .
Birol is having a terrible time finding any significant pockets of good news .
All of the agencies are under incredible pressure to cheer up their news .
Stay tuned for November 15 , it should be a shocker !
We need to liberate the workforce and let people work from home … that day might finally be here .
We ca n’t actually ration anymore .
What we did in the 70s with even - odd days required service station attendants … only about 1 out of 4 stations has attendants anymore !
We will need to print up rationing coupon books like we did in WWII to prevent a “ run on the banks ” in gasoline .
Evidence suggests that many people are running around with $ 5 or less worth of gas in the tank !
Get rid of vulnerable investments .
Buy infrastructure companies because we have to rebuild everything ( Baker Hughes , SLB , RIG , etc . )
Re : the Energy Watch Group report saying that oil actually peaked in 2006 .
EIA ’s databook shows that 2005 production was the all - time peak near 74 mbpd , slight decline since then .
Newest data just barely exceeds that all - time peak , but it is subject to further revision .
It ’s very hard to imagine how we could ever get to 75 mbpd of crude .
Should we try to print our way out of the financial crisis ?
We ’re lucky that foreign countries are still willing to ship us any oil !

Awards
Julian Darley , John Theobald and The Oil Drum received awards
Jim Buckee , Talisman Energy : “ Peak Oil and Resource Nationalism “
World oil field sizes : the top three fields ( Ghawar , Burgan , Cantarell ) are huge compared to everything else .
Ghawar is unknown , but the other two are in decline .
97 % of the world ’s known reserves are in 10 % of the fields .
Prudhoe Bay ( and indeed all fields ) go into exponential decline .
Samotlor , Forties , West Texas – all in terminal decline .
[ Charts showing numerous fields in terminal decline . ]
On average , fields decline after 50 % has been produced , on average decline at 10 % pa .
Depends on quality of the reservoir , facility constraints , etc .
Demand growth 1.5 % pa. World decline : 5 - 7 % pa. Decline will be 50 - 60 mpbd in 10 years ( 6 Saudi Arabias ) .
[ Numerous detailed maps and charts on Saudi oil fields … Abqaiq is good , north Ghawar is good , but south Ghawar is bad . ]
Ghawar 174 x 16 miles …190 bn bbls OOIP ( assuming 60 % recovery factor ) .
Reserves 80 - 90 bn bbls… 5 mbpd current production .
Cantarell … massive decline rate
Sadad al Husseini : “ natural declines in existing capacity are real , ” getting KSA to 12 mbpd of production would “ wreak havoc within a decade . ”
Chairman Farouk Al - Zanki : Burgan “ peak output in 2007 at 1.7 mbpd not 2 ″ … reserve uncertainty
Daqing ( 16 bn bbls ) : liquids 3 % decline
Alternatives : rate vs. volume .
World NGL production will peak in 2010 - 11 ( over 9 mbpd )
World XTL ( anything - to - liquids ) … peaks at 2.5 mbpd in 2012 .
If conventional oil reserves are 750 - 1000 bn bbls , decline is 50 - 60 mbpd over 10 years .
NGLs ( probable ) , yet to find ( 10 - 20bn bbls ) , EOR , plus bitumen / extra heavy all together equals about 300 bn bbls , and ca n’t make up for conventional decline .
Why Majors are quiet on peak oil :
In a big company , CEOs are advised by economists : “ commodities always go down , ” “ ingenuity overcomes scarcity , ” … Club of Rome , Malthus cast ridicule on scarcity arguments “ There is plenty of oil we could get at it ” – ignores volume vs rate argument !
“ Low cost producer wins ” – true but opportunity missed .
Political implications ?
Heavy implications !
There are signs of change : “ end of cheap oil ” Predicting oil price is difficult
Industry Outlook Exploration is tough – F&D [ finding & development cost ] is rising Industry is extremely tight : people , services , equipment Costs have doubled in the past 3 - 4 years Industry fights declines every day No opposite of a train wreck .
Things do n’t suddenly get better than they have been .
Resource nationalism is rampant !
Host gov’ts want sovereignty and control , not tax collection .
Also a rebalancing of power and status with the West .
Mineral resources deplete – finite pie to cut up Not limited to OPEC !
But oil in the ground has no value !
Governments should maximize value … leave some in the ground
Various slides on the share of revenues depending on the PSCs [ production sharing contracts ]
Resource nationalism IOC [ independent oil company ] motivation is to grow production , reserves , hence revenue
But host government motivation is more complex
How much money is enough ?
An empty purse is bad but in high prices other factors play
Do mechanisms exist to spend money usefully ?
What to do with petrodollars ?
Oil as a weapon ( Venezuela , Russia , etc . )
Current account balances are terrible for India , China , etc. , and are huge for Venezuela , Libya , etc .
Remaining fields with access to outside investors have extremely low financial returns .
Rise of the NOCs [ national oil companies ]
Libya takes 55 % from Oxy Shah takes 55 % from Anglo Persian Venezuela takes 60 % KPC took over Gulf Oil , etc .
Majors are rather minor in terms of reserves !
Exxon , the largest of the “ majors ” is only # 17 worldwide in terms of reserves !
Rise of the International NOCs ( INOCs ) : Statoil , Yukos , BP - TNK , etc. Benchmarking and chest thumping .
ONGC , CNPC , Sinopec , CNOOC etc. are serious competitors .
NOCs have problems Uneasy relationship between NOC and government Often used as a piggybank by gov’t , starving reinvestment ( Pemex , Petronas ) Upper echelons often choose other than by merit Corruption – money siphoned off Contract and sourcing sub-optimal NOCs reflect the national culture … deference , unwillingness to say no , promotion by status or age , bad news messenger gets shot …
Inefficient : $ 15.28 revenue per barrel for IOC vs. $ 5.25 for NOC
Exports fall faster than production .
Population growth , food prices , subsidies for fuels , etc .
In Indonesia , subsidies are 30 % of the state budget !
NOCs and INOCs get priority
But NOCs provide more certainty for complex projects , and are aligned with host governments ( as opposed to service companies )
Not all governments want neo-colonialism
The problem of reserves stalls progress .
Oil companies are partly valued in the stock market by booked reserves
In order to book reserves there must be “ ownership ”
Gap between supply and demand increases relentlessly between 2005 and 2050 .
The world is expected to consume over 693 bn bbls of oil and over 2,500 tcf of natural gas from 2005 - 2025 .
By 2050 , oil is very expensive and limited to transportation .
On the demand side , OECD is still falling but non-OECD is still growing
World produces 30 + bn bbls pa , replaces < 10 bn bbls
World ’s reserves dominated by large fields
Signs of decline in largest fields
Alternatives can’t offset decline rate
Nationalism reduces access for IOCs , reduces efficiency
Demand is still increasing
Price of oil is going up
Q&A
Natural gas and oil have different uses , so gas is a very limited substitute for oil .
Not enough overlap .
Thermal equivalents of oil and gas reserves are about the same !
But peak gas is actually about 5 - 10 years after peak oil .
Is it possible that the Club of Rome predictions could be true , but late ?
Ingenuity will not solve this problem .

Economic Impacts of $ 100 Oil : Energy is the Original Currency
Panel discussion
Jeff Rubin , Chief Economist , CIBC World Markets
Herman Franssen , International Energy Associates
Jim Puplava , Financial Sense ( Moderator )
Jeff Rubin : “ Triple Digit Oil Prices Will Reverse Globalization ”
Rubin was unable to attend , but a video presentation of his remarks with charts was shown .
Transport costs have to become incidental .
Globalization must be reversed .
At $ 100 oil , transport costs are 40 % of total shipping costs .
At $ 200 oil , it ’s 80 % of total shipping .
Global trade is now about shipping and logistics , not the lowest labor costs .
At $ 150 oil , it will be a quadrupling of tariff rates .
This will take us back to the 1970s …
Cost of shipping a standard 40 ′ shipping container from Shanghai to NY : Went from $ 3000 a few years ago to about $ 9000 today .
Cost of shipping ore to China to make hot rolled steel and then shipping it back to US adds about $ 90 to an $ 800 unit .
Consequently US steel production is actually up now .
Who would have thought that high oil prices would breathe new life into the Rust Belt ?
But that ’s what ’s happening .
And it ’s not just steel – it ’s in many industries and products .
Herman Franssen : “ Adjusting to a High Cost Energy Economy : Winner and Losers “
OPEC meeting in Sept 2008 .
OPEC leaders are getting very worried .
Price hawks wanted to cut production to defend price , but collapse of US financial markets took prices back up again .
US inventories are below the 5 - year average .
Inventories for gasoline are extremely low – panic in Arkansas and elsewhere for gasoline supply .
Will be surprised if this year ’s global demand growth is over half a million barrels per day .
IEA estimates 0.69 mbpd growth ( 0.8 % ) for 2008 , 0.89 ( 1.0 % ) for 2009 .
( IEA , Monthly Oil Market Report , September 2008 )
Huge increase in demand in OPEC this year .
North America supply growth in 2007 - 2009 depends on biofuels and tar sands growth
Call for OPEC oil down in 2009 ( ~ 1 mbpd less than in 2008 ) according to OPEC .
This is a function of weak demand , strong supplies ( crude + NGLs + biofuels )
OPEC ’s view was that non-OPEC supply would increase by 10.4 mbpd even without Angola and Ecuador over 2000 - 2008 !
EIA thinks surplus capacity will increase by over 1 mbpd in 2009
OPEC believes OPEC spare capacity will grow from 3 mbpd in 2008 to 6 mbpd in 2010 !
[ Ed : 3 mbpd of spare capacity today is highly doubtful . ]
No major energy legislation between Carter and second term of GW Bush Post 1980 : Energy left to market forces .
By contrast , Europe and Japan increased fuel taxes ; Europe moved to diesel ( 25 % more efficient ) and Japan developed the hybrid engine .
1985 -2006 : US oil consumption rose by 5 mbpd ; Europe ’s by 3 mbpd .
US oil production fell from 10.6 to 6.8 mbpd ; Europe ’s rose from 4 - 5 mbpd …
Result : Expanded EU of 450 million people and Japan ’s 130 million people consume about the same volume of oil as the US with 300 million people .
Revised EIA
Outlook for energy through 2030 of March 2008 March 2008 EIA Outlook : US oil consumption to rise from 21 to 25 mbpd by 2030 .
Oil imports stable at around 12.2 mbpd in 2015 , rising to 12.7 mbpd in 2020 …
US slowest in the move towards efficient cars , behind EU , Japan , China , Australia , Canada , and California .
Oil consumption is an indicator of the wealth of nations .
Huge increase in demand in China and India spell the end of globalization ?
Expecting about a doubling of cars between now and 2025
With 9.5 billion people by 2050 , we would use 138.8 mbpd worldwide at 1 % demand growth !
A French study showed that if there were absolutely no constraints on further oil development , liquids production would peak at around 2020 - 2028 just shy of 100 mbpd .
The oil supply outlook ;
Assume that supply will always meet demand at reasonable prices
If projected supply fails to materialize , “ there is no Plan B . ”
IOCs only have access to 6 % of the world ’s remaining reserves .
Oil reserves held by new Russian companies : 6 % . Less than 25 % of worldwide reserves are accessible to private international capital .
What kind of peak ?
Mt. Massive , CO ( long flat “ peak ” ) or Mt. Rainier ( peak with short plateau at top ) or Matterhorn ( sharp peak )
As regards OPEC , “ they may be sons - o’- bitches , but they ’re our sons - o’- bitches ”
Andy Weissman : “ Time to Stop Playing Russian Roulette with the U.S. Economy – Urgent Need for a Realistic Strategy “
Electricity & gas crisis could be just as severe as peak oil .
Impact of $ 100 / bbl oil not limited to transportation .
Electricity & nat gas = 56 % of total energy use
Could lead to $ 150/200 bbl electricity
Global LNG price already near parity with oil .
Spot price already near parity this winter despite multi-year low US imports
While prices could moderate in ’09 and ’ 10 , premium pricing likely by early next decade .
We ’ll see shortages of global LNG by 2012 - 2013 .
Potential doubling of both nat gas and electricity prices .
Half a trillion dollars per year increase !… $ 5 trillion impact over 10 years .
Prices exquisitely sensitive to supply / demand balance as first part of 2008 demonstrates
Need new approach to energy planning .
Needless supply risks should no longer be tolerated Future of US & global economies at stake Requires far more realistic , more hard - nosed approach to developing comprehensive strategy .
Critical not to over - rely on lowest common denominator , feel - good solutions .
Feasibility & cost - effectiveness must be rigorously demonstrated .
Minimizing consumption growth & ensuring reasonable supply are not competing strategies !
Five essential steps
Far greater sense of urgency required .
Few other issues likely to affect nation ’s future as deeply .
Replace EIA to provide realistic estimates of supply & demand .
We ca n’t tolerate bad forecasts any longer !
We ’re currently flying blind !
Estimates mislead rather than inform .
Requires a new National Energy Security Supply Board .
There is absolutely no time left to develop a comprehensive program to meet our energy needs .
The precise date of the peak is n’t that important when it takes 7 - 10 years to develop mitigation strategies .
Until the federal government issues more realistic numbers , the oil companies are n’t going to do anything different .
Develop comprehensive national energy strategy applicable to energy use across the board .
Must include electricity & natural gas , not just oil .
Integrated planning essential .
Market will ruthlessly seek out lowest cost BTUs and push prices to parity .
Maximize use of all cost effective domestic resources that can be developed in an environmentally sound manner .
What ’s going on is crazy at the national level !
We ca n’t afford to rule out resources or rely on pipe dreams .
We have no national energy plan , nor an effort to develop one .
Instead we need the most rigorous planning possible .
Use best expertise available to evaluate limitations of every supply option in objective , cold - blooded manner .
Include limitations on available capital .

[ Good charts on relationship between energy and population . ]
Q&A
Weissman :
We have an increasingly unstable situation , and it ’s frightening .
Franssen :
We must hope that the EIA will start to take depletion into account properly in their models .
Latest IEA models assume sharp increases in imports , totally unrealistic .
So the price mechanism will resolve the tension .
Weissman :
When you take the covers off the energy data , it ’s ludicrous to think that non-OPEC oil will increase .
We ’re talking about the wrong set of solutions right now .
We need to talk about the impending oil crisis in a whole different way .
Franssen : Viable scenarios for taxing oil consumption to reduce demand ?
Not a snowball ’s chance in hell that any politician will support more taxes .
Consumers stretched to the breaking point could n’t take it anyway .
Puplava : 90 % of the time , the markets are irrational , so they ’re not a good allocator of resources in the short term , but in the long term , they basically are good at it .
Weissman : if we wait for markets , which respond to very short term signals , to address this long - term challenge , we will be very disappointed in the results .
Franssen :
If OPEC suppliers were fully rational , they would either freeze or lower the current levels of oil production , but they would never tell us !

4 Billion New Consumers : What Asian Growth Means for East , West and the World
Panel discussion
David Fridley , Lawrence Berkeley National Lab
Vince Matthews , Colorado State Geologist
John Theobald , ASPO - USA , UC Davis ( Moderator )
David Fridley : “ China and Energy in the 21st Century “
[ Missed first part of presentation ]
80 % of electrical energy is generated by coal in China
Just last year China added 105 GW of power generation ( equivalent to building California ’s entire base twice a year ) almost all of it from coal .
China has third largest reserves of coal .
China is moving toward net coal imports , largely due to price differentials with imports / exports
CTL and coal - to - chemicals is growing .
Total CTL capacity is forecast to reach 50 - 60 mt by 2020 .
Current CTL requirements : 4 - 5.5 ton of coal per ton of product ; 10 tons of water per ton of product .
Shenhua is commissioning a 1 million ton direct coal liquefaction plant in 2008
Coal - to - chemicals production , targets & requirements Methanol production is displacing biofuel production Coal is increasingly viewed as a chemical feedstock
In 2007 China consumed 9 million tons ( Mt ) of methonal ; 2.7
Mt blended with gasoline 2010 production capacity is expected to reach 39 Mt
Can China produce the coal it needs ?
If Chinese steel and cement peaks in 2015 , and all Asian countries meet their efficiency targets , and we do n’t have a global financial meltdown , then the scenario shows that the IEA ’s demand - driven forecast shows a gap opening by 2015 .
EWG report supports similar outlook ( actually worse )
Prime coal exporting countries to China are declining : Vietnam , Indonesia , Australia ( short term problems )
Chinese coal imports increasing for a lack of alternatives ; India way up due to cost issues ; Japan due to nuclear & LNG problems .
China ’s CO2 emissions just from coal will exceed total emissions by US by 2010 .
China wipes out the entire EU commitment to Kyoto by 2012 .
China ’s crude production has plateaued , imports are skyrocketing .
China is 50 % oil import dependent .
Decline rate is 4 % pa. Daqinq looks a lot like Prudhoe Bay in profile .
The decline of the giant and large fields has increased the energetic costs of extraction .
Energy inputs have increased to about 1/7 of the oil they produce .
China has the second - most complex refining setup in the world .
But China is a diesel - based economy .
Diesel demand is 40 % of a barrel .
Oil consumption in China supports fewer discretionary activities than in other large consuming countries .
43 % is for transportation .
Most of new buildings are dependent on diesel .
Personal cars are not the main driver of Chinese oil demand !
Moving stuff is .
China is still a very material economy .
The first thing they have to move is …coal !
50 % of China ’s coal now runs on rail , with very efficient rail .
Inadequate coal rail transport capacity drives oil demand higher .
The rest has to run by transport truck running on diesel , increasing the energy needed for transport by 16 x .
This is also forcing transport for other goods to road transport .
Subsidies for all fuels greatly exacerbate the problem .
Ambitious plan to expand natural gas use relies heavily on imports .
Spot cargoes coming in at $ 22 / mmbtu .
They ’re now seeking new supplies everywhere , like Turkmenistan via pipelines through other “ ‘ stans ”
China ’s coal soot is now the largest source of mercury deposition in California .
Major explosion in cement and steel production has caused growth in energy demand to far outpace growth in GDP .
China is now the largest cement producers in the world , and most of it is being used domestically .
This offset their long - term decline in energy intensity .
The loss of control led to imposition of new 2010 target of reducing energy / GDP intensity by 20 % .
Quotes from a Chinese official : “ The model of economic development that we are currently pursuing is unsustainable . ”
“ China ’s current supplies of energy and natural resources are unsustainable ” “ China ’s environment is unsustainable ”
Vince Matthews : “ China and India ’s Ravenous Appetite for Natural Resources – Their Impact on the US “
Population is driving growth , 1.3 billion for China vs. 1 billion for India and 0.3 billion for US
By 2030 , China is likely to pass the US in GDP .
Average growth of 10.4 % per year for the last 4 years
World electrical consumption growth increased by 8 terrawatts in the last 10 (? ) years , 2.7 from China .
2005 : China opened 70,000 new supermarkets
2006 : Became # 3 car manufacturer
Minerals : China ’s share of world mineral production is # 1 , # 2 or # 3 of all major metals .
China is # 1 importer in the world of copper ; they import about half of what they consume .
Thefts of copper have increased all over the US .
Increasing prices are the impetus ; cost increased by 457 % from 2003 to 2006 .
Iron ore : China is # 1 producer in the world , and the # 1 importer .
Went from 1 to 300 skyscrapers since 2001 .
Price of scrap iron up 559 % in the last five years Charts since 2003 : [ ASTOUNDING CHARTS of the price increases of all major metals ! ]
US molybdenum exports doubled ; price nearly doubled .
Gold prices up 205 % Silver 367 % … plantinum , palladium , etc….similar price increases .
Coal : Spot prices for coal went from $ 17/ton to $ 37 from 2004 - 2005 , although contract price in 2004 was $ 24.4 / ton … in 2007 , $ 29.75 .
This is a natural resources driven price inflation .
This is not a normal inflation and should n’t be fixed with monetary policy .
Cement : China began importing cement in 2003 , with consequent shortages in half the states in the US
Cement producers : # 1 China , # 2 India , # 3 US
China is going around the world and tying up every raw material in the world , anywhere they can get it …buying mines , everything .
94 % of US energy comes from traditional sources ( coal , oil , uranium , nat gas ) .
All have increased 200-400 % in prices since 2003 .
Natural Gas China imports NO natural gas !
US nat gas production has plateaued , we now import about 16 % (? ) of our usage .
Nat gas consumption in the US declined from 1971 to 1985 due to various events and policy changes , then grew again as we attempted to replace coal with nat gas for electricity generation .
We import about 4 Tcf from Canada … but Canada ’s gas production has been flat since 2000 … and production in 2006 required 5000 more wells per year than in 2001 .
Domestic natural gas production vs rig counts : as rig counts have gone up , and with nat gas at the highest price in history , production fell …it ’s lower than 2000 levels now .
US nat gas production has been basically flat since 1995 , but wells drilled went from 8,900 to 30,180 from 1995 – 2007 Price of nat gas has tripled since 1999
Coal consumption in China : Began importing in 2006 .
Prices went from $ 38 / ton to $ 140 / ton .
India coal growth enormous as well
China oil consumption : imports over 50 % .
India imports over 2/3 , so does the US
Nuclear : China and India are both dramatically increasing nuclear … India plans 17 new reactors in 7 years .
US generates far more than any other country in the world .
World ’s 439 nuclear reactors currently need 180 million pounds of uranium each year .
We ’ve been living off the stockpile we built since Three Mile Island and consuming old weaponized uranium .
Oil shale ( in Colorado ) is being looked at again .
The notion that oil shale is being blocked in the US is simply wrong .
Open bidding was conducted , 20 proposals received , 6 approved .
Companies were granted free access to the lands ( without royalties ) to begin production .
30,000 acres total granted for the six acres ; equivalent to 60 billion bbls of oil .
And yet , there is n’t even an active permit to produce that oil .
Alternative energy requires significant amounts of rare metals etc. [ good chart ]
A 690 unit apartment complex in Beijing will use a huge ground source heat pump project .
Overall impacts : Coloradans will suffer from effects of inflation Coloradans may see increasing shortages of critical materials and pressure to produce raw materials and develop new resources .
Q&A
Fridley : China largely uses crop residues ( corn husks , etc. ) for home heating ; wood gathering has been largely banned .
Fridley : “ Clean coal ” is a complete oxymoron .
US is going big with IGCC gasification process about 60 % (? ) efficient .
Whereas China has gone with a supercritical process .
Accordingly , there is no real cooperation between China and US to do carbon sequestration .
CCC costs about 25 % of the energy in the coal .
Matthews :
What about lithium for batteries ?
Ca n’t really get any useful information .
Matthews :
The claim that the cost of producing commodities falls over time is simply wrong
Matthews :
The increasing switch from high - Btu black coal to poorer grades of bituminous coal is a treadmill .
Over half the mining claims in the US in the last three years were from foreign buyers !
Fridley : 95 % of China ’s coal production is bituminous .
Matthews :
Is cement traded across oceans ?
Yes , 22 % of US consumption is imported .
Matthews :
Half of all copper ever produced is now in landfills .
It ’s probably inevitable that we will eventually resort to mining landfills .
Matthews :
Shale gas in the Rockies is a serious treadmill ; you have to drill more and more to keep production flat .
Decline curves tail off rapidly after first production , and it costs a great deal more than conventional gas .
If we stopped drilling for a year , production would tumble .
Fridley :
We are in competition with China basically everywhere for all natural resources .
This is leading to conflicts like the one in Sudan .
Conflict is brewing over access to resources in the South China Sea , between Vietnam , Philippines , etc .
Matthews : China already controls 98 % of the rare earth metals in the world .
What they ’re doing is far beyond what the US is capable of .
Their strategy is all - encompassing and it will corner the global markets .
Fridley :
The US demand for Chinese products is not the primary source of China ’s emissions ; more like 10 % .
Fridley : China has a bad data problem just like we do .
Provincial governments have been feeding bad data to the central government ; now that is changed and it goes directly to the central gov’t so it ’s a little better now .
New data is more discrete and hopefully will result in better policy planning now .
Robert Hirsch : Reflections on the conference so far
Terminology : “ peak oil ” implies sharpness , but really it ’s been a fluctuating world oil production plateau since mid-2004 .
Onset of decline of world oil production is the greatest problem , and the timing is uncertain .
( Est. 3 - 5 % pa )
Careful attention to small numbers is important !
5 % decrease in US oil – Recession ( 1973 ) 1 % of world oil consumption is huge : ~ 860,000 bpd 3 - 5 % changes in oil production cannot be identified as true trends until years later , because the plateau is that bumpy .
Time frames Production decline will likely start in 2 - 5 years , but worldwide physical mitigation will require maybe 20 years .
A precise forecast of the decline point is impossible but not critical to planning & early action .
Consider where you have your money , and how you will adapt in your personal life : personal , business , national , int’l .
The meltdown in the stock markets is prototypical of what will happen when peak oil consciousness hits the public .
It is not realized yet !
The bad things that happened last week will happen again , only worse , because there are no quick fixes to the problem !
One - liners : “ Willful human blindness ” – really describes the problem we have communicating this stuff with decision makers .
Talk about discussing peak oil and global warming in the same way is n’t really quite right .
When people are losing their homes , cars , etc. , people will be screaming for a fix right now .
“ Peak roads ” –
We probably have enough roads now , but think about going up against the road - building lobby and associated special interests !
“ The proactive choir ” – That ’s us at the conference .
As we try to convince people , follow the KISS principle !
Keep it simple , and do n’t mix the message with other things .
Point was made that panic is probably necessary to inspire real action .
As distasteful as that idea is , it ’s probably true .
On the issue of rates of change , we should start doing some calculations … how long does it take to build new CTL plants , etc ?
The more you look at it , the more you see that the problem will outrun our efforts .
This shock will have widespread effects .
It will severely impact state & local budgets , further impacting services like fire and police .
With all the other pressing problems like Medicare and SS , how do we get people to focus on peak oil ?
Denial … Faith in technology … Faith in government … these things stand in the way of getting the message out .
“ biggest robbery in history ” re : African oil production Yes , we contribute to African misery by consuming their oil , but we also have “ The biggest wealth transfer in history ” under way as we send trillions of dollars overseas for oil .
Kudos to the organizers of the conference !
Do n’t think of this as an energy problem !
It ’s a liquid fuels problem !
We ca n’t start running cars on PV panels right now , but in the near term , we have about $ 50 - 100 Trillion of investment in the existing fleets of vehicles and ships !
We have to keep that stuff running or we ’re going to have total anarchy .
We need to have substitute liquid fuels regardless .
Re : environmental problems of hydrocarbon production .
Do n’t think about the world of the past .
Think about the world of the future .
What compromises can we make ?
We will have to save ourselves and prioritize environmental protection .
We ’re going to have to be pragmatic above all .
The transition will spell enormous opportunities for those who offer solutions , who will prosper amid the coming miseries .
I would love to see a politician , or a president , who will tell the straight story .
But when it ’s said , people will freak out , so it has to be said along with a plan to get us out of the problem .
Or we could see the kind of chaos we saw in 1973 when OPEC cut us off .
People have been staying politically neutral about energy and that ’s important ; it ca n’t be a partisan issue .
This is not the end of the US .
This is not going to be like the end of the Roman Empire .
I have not lost my optimism .
We are going to come out on top ( after a difficult period of adjustment ) because we ’re Americans , and that ’s what we do .

Visions of a Post - Peak Oil Future
Panel discussion
Denis Hayes , creator of Earth Day , founder of the Bullit Foundation
James Howard Kunstler , author of The Long Emergency and World Made By Hand
Randy Udall , co-founder of ASPO - USA
Richard Brenne ( Moderator )
[ This was a nearly impossible session to take notes for …the jokes went by quickly … but I did my best . ]
Brenne gave a hilarious and ironic introduction to the panel .
Could Kunstler ’s apocalyptic visions come true ?
Hayes :
Yes , and the financial market meltdown is a prelude .
Only with radically different leadership could we avoid it .
A combination of other countries mobilizing to address the threat , coupled with a great flow of venture capital , could potentially make a difference in averting it .
With the right advisors , Obama could succeed in making a difference .
Udall : How many of the members of Congress are lawyers ?
4/5 ? Every once in a while we have a great president , and even McCain could be a great president .
You need to have hope as a companion rather than fear .
Kunstler :
The long emergency is only one scenario ; there are others .
I just wanted to come up with a vivid description of what life might be like in the future .
What are the other things peaking you ’re concerned about ?
Kunstler :
Well , peak women my age … and this is n’t the place to go looking for them !
Udall :
Well there ’s impotent and “ Aspo- tent ”
Are we nearing peak stupidity ?
Kunstler :
We ’re good at measuring things but not so good at doing something about them .
Especially in the environmental community , there is a problem with “ techno triumphalism ” or “ techno grandiosity . ”
The idea that we can conjure up solutions … the idea that we ’re entitled to an orderly transition to the future .
Hayes :
Well we were certainly much more stupid in 1998 , when oil prices were so low .
We were stupider yesterday , when oil was $ 27 cheaper .
Kunstler :
It ought to be obvious that the airline industry is dying , and we have to restore the rail system asap , or else we ’re not going anywhere .
Denis :
Hell if the Italians can do it , the French can do it ( Kunstler : the Bolivians do it ! ) , the Chinese can do it , then we can do it !
Richard Heinberg ’s new book is called Peak Everything … let ’s talk about the order of things you ’re concerned about peaking .
Udall : Energy , courage , and time ( “ Kind of a haiku of where we ’re at right now . ” )
Kunstler : at the TED conference , the winner was this idiot who did a presentation about flying cars … right out of Popular Science 1953 .
The most preposterous thing you ’ve ever heard in your life … that ’s what the Silicon Valley geniuses thought the future would be all about … it was very demoralizing .
Brenne ( [ what was that question ? ? ] …
Hayes : the opposite of TED would be DE ( b ) T… between all the forms of national debt , when we refuse to tax ourselves , when our debt is 5 x our GDP , options for the future are limited .
Oil , natural gas , coal , and uranium …is that the order of things to be concerned about peaking ?
Kunstler : Yes , but this is basically a liquid fuels problem .
Hayes : Energy is n’t anywhere near my top peak worry .
I know how to solve the energy problem … that ’s easy compared to racism , religious bigotry , water shortages , the loss of topsoil … those are really tough issues .
Udall : Peak oil just punctures everything ; it augurs a new era .
It could be tragic or it could be a glorious time .
Thank God this banal 30 years is over .
We should welcome and celebrate peak oil in our lives .
Hayes :
When you throw coal and uranium into the mix …if this were a different type of group , and you asked them which issue is their top concern , they would say climate .
Iran has a very sensible approach to their long - term energy survival by pursuing nuclear .
The problem is n’t the scarcity of coal and uranium , it ’s the abundance of them !
From the localized “ London fog ” of coal smoke , up through the larger problem of acid rain , up to climate change which is clearly a global issue .
Are we at the point where all of these problems are global , not national , and we have to think of ourselves as citizens of the Earth ?
Kunstler : that ’s a sweet sentiment , but it ’s wrong .
The world is n’t flat , it ’s ever rounder , and we ’re going to be retreating into our various corners .
We ’re fooling ourselves if we think we ’re going to have a worldwide Kum - ba - yah and a festival of worldwide cooperation .
Hayes : Worldwide , people are building networks in which boundaries are irrelevant , and global communities around certain things are tighter than physical neighborhoods .
We must resolve bigotry and racism if we are to solve our problems .
The great successes are local ; fighting a freeway through town , etc .
But against the combined might of all these energy industries , auto industry , etc. , we have maybe $ 100 K total on our side , yet we can still win our objectives in Congress , because we ’re right .
Udall : A lot of the achievements we made in the 60s and 70s were made possible by coal and cheap oil .
We must recognize our debt to cheap energy and food , or we ’re doomed .
We have 4 million Chinese underground today in pursuit of the black rock that would be the road to prosperity .
We ca n’t go forward without recognizing our indebtedness to all forms of energy .
Hayes :
The entire science of ecology is about how you get energy in the most effective way , from photosynthesis to higher primates and everything in between .
If we have an attractive future , it ’s information dense , it makes use of abundant renewable energy … maybe the fuels of the past are transitional bridges to the post oil and gas world .
Udall : Flows are different from fuels .
Half of us would n’t be alive without natural gas made fertilizers .
The future belongs to flows , efficiency , and conservation … but we ca n’t go there until we recognize how we got here .
We won the wars because we had more domestic oil than they did in Germany , etc .
We ’ve always had a land ethic in this country ; we ’ve never celebrated the value and beauty of energy , and this is a mystery because it ’s part of our genius .
What metals are you concerned about peaking ?
At current rates of consumption , we have basically less than 25 years ’ supply of most of the important metals .
Does that concern you ?
Hayes : Yes .
Gold is basically a storehouse of value .
Kunstler :
My book is n’t an ‘ end of the world ’ book , it basically describes a discontinuity to interrupt our assumptions and extrapolations about the direction that things are going .
We ’re going to have to make do with less of that stuff .
But I certainly believe we ’re going to persevere .
Hayes :
What we got out of these stocks of energy is 6.3 billion people moving up almost inevitably to 9 billion people , but at that level , the access to metals , foods , etc is much more limited than it would be if we had 2 billion people .
But the world is n’t necessarily better off at 9 billion than it would be with 1.5 billion people .
Udall :
We may go back to 1.5 billion , but the journey may be fascinating , or bleak … it remains to be seen .
Could we actually have a water infrastructure to support 9 billion people ?
Udall : I do n’t think that ’s the most important limit .
I would argue that food is the key limit .
Water is cheap and is n’t the most important limit .
Grain production is key , and is the source of the water limits .
Hayes :
If you depend on a finite supply of water , and you ’re growing exponentially , you ’ve got some serious , albeit localized , problems .
What if the limits to all these things turn out to be bell curves .
Udall :
We ’re living in a strange , bizarre , amazing moment where we live like gods and goddesses …it ’s a moment .
Kjell Aleklett thinks we might be at peak democracy …
Hayes :
It depends on how things devolve from here .
If we have self - contained and self - sustaining urban villages , we might actually have a good story for real democracy in the future .
I ’m interested in a principled , constitutional democracy that is removed from such forces .
Are peaks symptoms of a more fundamental problem ?
Kunstler : Some people did n’t like the supernatural bit at the end of my book , World Made By Hand .
The point is that our beliefs about reality , our consensus , would yield to something more magic and an apprehension of a more supernatural reality outside of the bounds of life as we know it .
The biggest problem we have is constructing a coherent consensus about what reality is .
Udall :
So who is offering this new narrative ?
Kunstler :
To me , this is like the 1850s , which preceded the last great convulsion that America went through , when all of our beliefs and conventions fell into disrepair .
The Whigs vanished almost as fast as AIG .
The Democrats were the party of slavery .
The leadership of the 1850s was made of empty cravats , and into this void stepped a lawyer with a clarifying rhetoric that defined the convulsion that was going on …and that ’s sort of where we ’re at today .
I want to redefine and re-brand the Republican Party as “ the party that wrecked America . ”
England did n’t abolish slavery until we had abundant coal … Energy is key to overcoming these issues .
Udall : Ingenuity will substitute for energy .
Kunstler :
We ’ve reached peak crybabies .
Hayes :
There are little chances for profound change in our polity .
[ Stories about Johnson & Nixon … ]
I think the Enlightenment was of crucial importance …
Kunstler :
Do n’t be surprised if all of that yields to the reality of what will happen to us .
Udall :
We had elements of paganism , naturism , etc …
Is peak oil the best gateway to understanding the problem of resource overshoot ?
Kunstler : it ’s a bitch - slap upside the head : “ Yo , wake the fuck up ! ” Hayes : I do n’t think people have ever had a better connection to reverence for nature than today .
Pre -Enlightenment , it was all about witch hunts and craziness …
Udall :
We ’ve got a lot of that now …
Brenne :
There seems to be an agreement between Islam , Christianity and Judaism that none of them can share an Enlightenment at the same time .

[ Some good quotes ]
Something about how we ’ve got a turkey syndrome going here :
Turkeys get three squares a day , a nice warm place to sleep , and everything seems to be going just fine … until Thanksgiving .
China has been building a coal plant each week … .
They will have 5000 more over the next 6 years .
India 200 more over the same period
In US , 28 coal plants under construction … more in Europe .
Seaborne supplies are tight , and prices have doubled in the last two years
History Chart of phenomenal reproductive success of the human race since 10,000 BC Population and energy consumption since 1500 … extremely high correlation World energy consumption is up by 190 % in the last 40 years [ Great charts on energy growth by region and fuel type ! ]
Per capita world energy consumption is up 761 % since 1850 .
The average world citizen consumes as much food (? ) as the average person in 1850 , but uses 2.5 x more energy Coal is 2/3 of the total remaining hydrocarbon energy .
28.6 % of the world ’s primary energy consumption in 2007 , second only to oil … Lowest cost heat source .
Double the carbon footprint of gas using conventional technology …. clean coal and reduce emissions almost to that of gas Total world coal consumption since 1850 has been straight up … 90 % of the total was consumed since 1910 Enormous world consumption of coal since 1980s
On a Btu basis , 57 % of the hydrocarbon energy we used in 2007 was coal Middle East has no coal !
Price of hydrocarbons : Oil : $ 16.15 / Gj Gas : $ 7.61 / Gj
By energy content , peak of coal was 1998 , even though tonnage is going up , due to the lower energy content of Powder River Basin coal .
US now imports about 30 million tons / year from Columbia Net US coal exports : 20 % of production in 1981 , now about 3 %
How much coal is there ?
Quotes from US National Academny of Sciences , June 2007
EWG report from 2007 suggests global peak of coal in 2025 , China peak in 2020 .
Uppsala forecast of 2008 says peak will be around 2030
According to Dave Rutledge ( of CalTech ) , we have 4.7
Tboe fossil fuels ( oil , gas coal ) and 90 % of it will be consumed by 2076 .
Does not believe that there is enough recoverable carbon to meet the lowest IPCC projection on emissions ( “ production constrained projection ” ) .
EIA electricity growth : World : 92 % total increase 2005 - 2030 .
Coal up 115 % , nat gas up 145 % , hydro and renewables will contract in market share
57 % of US electricty generation will be from coal by 2030
90 % of our generation capacity since 1990 is from gas , but in the future will be largely coal
What about “ clean coal ? ” CO2 can be reduced by 25 % , with 99 % reduction in Sox , NOx , and 90 % in Mercury
The most efficient technology is ultrasupercritical ( USC ) combustion at 43.5 % , compared to 34 % for a ‘ 60s era subcritical plant Denmark is the world leader in ultrasupercritical plants
Challenges with CCS … MIT study 2007 , “ The Future of Coal ” : Capture of emissions typically requires about 23 - 37 % of the capital cost , depending on the type of plant .
IGCC is the cheapest .
Best tech with heat capture vs IGCC with CCS USC : 43.3 % efficient USC with heat capture : 70 % efficient CO reduction vs Old Coal with Best tech / HC : 51 % efficient IGCC : 38.4 % efficient IGCC with CCS : 31.2 % efficient CO2 reduction vs old coal with CCS : 85 %
Proponents of CCS often assume there is no energy problem because of the belief that coal is so abundant
Scale and complexity of CCS … Vaclav Smil quote from Nature , May 2008 … ” Beware of scale ! ”
Managing carbon and global warming by energy intensive and complex means such as CCS , and uncontrolled geoengineering experiments with Space Shields , seeding the atmosphere with sulphate crystals , and seeding the oceans with iron filings only compounds and exacerbates the energy issue .
China will top out around 1.4 billion people by 2030 … India will go to over 1.5 billion by 2030 , to become the world ’s most populous nation
Per capita , Canada is the worst energy consumer , Europe is less than half of US per capita
China will be the world ’s top energy consumer by 2030
World pop in 2030 will be over 9 billion , plus adding as many cars as we added people in 2007 .
Total per capita energy consumption in 2030 … 65 x as in 1850 , 89 % of it non-renewable , almost all of which will peak in the first half of the century
“ Anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist . ” — economist Kenneth Boulding , early 70s
“ The term ‘ sustainable growth ’ is an oxymoron . ” – Albert Bartlett , 2000
Joseph Tainter 2006 – Sustainability , Resilience , Complexity and Collapse
Ever increasing complexity is one problem - solving solution to a sustainability , provided the resources are available to pay for it – both in financial and energy terms .
Eventually though , it leads to collapse .
The Sustainability Game ( Tainter 2007 ) _ Complexity … ” The party ’s getting close to last call ” … declining EROI
Crucial questions :
Will we think our way down to resilience , or will we keep our pedal to the medal to collapse ?
Robert Rapier : “ Biofuels : Facts and Fallacies “
Currently works on wood acetylation technology to impregnate softwood with carbon to make it as strong as steel and other building products , making it a carbon sequestration technology .
Has written about 150 essays for The Oil Drum and hundreds more for his blog
The biofuel contenders : Ethanol , renewable diesel , misc . [ e.g. , methanol , butanol , etc. ] , algae , anything - to - oil , etc .
Corn ethanol : sets up a food vs fuel crisis , and essentially is a jobs program for the Midwest .
But it ’s just a bridge fuel … unfortunately it ’s a bridge to nowhere and we should say “ Thanks but no thanks ” [ Deft , oblique reference to Palin ’s political statements ]
We have single oil refineries that out - produce any corn ethanol producer
By subsidizing ethanol we ’re really subsidizing fossil fuels [!]
Can the US emulate Brazil ?
Sugarcane ethanol is keyed on the bagasse waste , which is a good fuel for boilers to make the ethanol ( in the US we use it in animal feed ) .
For tropical countries , sugarcane ethanol works .
But it ’s a solution for them , not for the US .
Cellulosic ethanol … we ’ve been working on it for 40 years .
Serious logistical problems .
A small ( 50 mgy ) cellulosic ethanol plant would consume a small forest of trees every year
Ethanol from biomass gasification
It ’s really pseudo - cellulosic ethanol
Diesel Biodiesel is an alkyl ester , not a hydrocarbon diesel Green diesel is gasification / FT process with any biomass , or hydrocracking to use waste oil via hydrocracking to make a true hydrocarbon diesel .
Misc contenders LS9
Di-methyl ether …methanol produced from syngas , converted to DME , which can be used in gasoline or diesel engines Butanol is an industrial chemical produced from propylene and synthesis gas .
Bio-butanol is produced via the acetone –> butanol –> ethanol process .
Commercial production via this route is not viable
Contenders
Our most pressing problem is energy storage , because it enables all the renewables .
Various fuel options … [ dense slide ]
Can we emulate Brazil ?
Oil usage in Brazil is still 90 % of Brazil ’s energy needs .
Annual oil usage in Brazil is 4.3 barrel per person ; ethanol , 0.4 per person !
To be like Brazil , the US would have to quadruple its oil production or cut consumption by 75 %
The thermal depolymerization ( TDP ) story Discover magazine had a gushing article in 2005 that was basically sci-fi…costs turned out to be much higher in 2006 update Hard to scale from the lab to the commercial Claims about ethanol are similarly overblown
Algal Biodiesel
Algae could produce 15,000 gals oil per acre per year ( 1998 ) …
Biodiesel costs make it a far - fetched reality … comparable to retrieving the trillions of dollars of gold that are dissolved in seawater
Techno- hustling : algal biodiesel investing hype
Where politicians fail By misleading the public ( “ we can be like Brazil ” )
By changing energy policies every year , lack of long - term planning Lack of political courage
Solutions Cease the delusion of “ cheap gas for everyone ” .
Need a frank discussion with the public !
Increase fossil fuel taxes … rebates , income taxes to make it revenue - neutral
Encourage energy conservation Encourage alternatives Encourage mass transit Stop waging war with the oil companies ; they have the experience !
Encourage behaviors that reduce energy consumption , including rebates for solar hot water ( SHW ) , fuel efficient cars , etc .
Andy Weissman : “ Time to Stop Playing Russian Roulette with the U.S. Economy – Urgent Need for a Realistic Strategy “
Electricity & gas crisis could be just as severe as oil .
All of our energy costs could go to parity ( or a premium ) compared to oil .
Global LNG prices already near parity with oil .
Spot prices already near parity this winter .
Prices could go lower in ‘09 and ’ 10 with increased LNG supply , but premium likely by early next decade .
Demand could far exceed supply , far beyond EIA estimates , even in status quo scenario…EIA severely underestimates likely demand … projects little or no year - over - year growth !
More likely , increase at least 3 Tcf / yr. Cancelling of coal - fired power plants in the last 24 months locks in the likelihood .
Adverse impact of rising grid prices on US economy could be severe … half trillion a year shock to the US economy
Natural gas demand could explode in the next decade
Demand is set to spike starting right now , but it takes years to get ready for that …
EIA just does n’t get it about nat gas demand growth for power sector , the key driver
Annual Energy Outlook reports for 2006 , 2007 , 2008 all badly underestimated power sector demand for nat gas .
We have about 400 Bcf growth per year in recent years
Future long - term projections are equally bad : say that long term growth will be satisfied by coal .
Long - term nat gas demand forecasts still assumes coal provides > 80 % incremental electricity .
Will only occur with CCS …
Gas use in power sector is already growing
If CO2 restrictions enacted , increase in nat gas could be staggering …CCS can’t satisfy restrictions for 10 - 15 years !
Decision - makers flying blind : EIA understating future US gas demand by as much as 6 - 10 Tcf / yr ( 16 - 27 Bcf / day ) … leaving producers , regulators without any reliable basis for decision - making
Potential adverse consequences from such misleading signals
We ’ve seen this story before by expanding number of gas - fired plants , only to see prices spike .
How do we avoid being in that situation again , and having to turn to LNG ?
Urgent need for a new comprehensive strategy …
Must assess energy efficiency first .
Huge potential savings , esp. with PHEVs , CHP plants , etc .
But programs often undershoot , are unrealistic , difficult to motivate implementation .
We need radical and large - scale solutions , replacing most the commercial HVAC systems , including forced cut - backs , to achieve major reductions in a short period of time .
It ’s all about risks .
We fall well short of our goals , resulting in spiking prices ( to destroy additional demand ) .
On - shore production skyrocketing , but pace not sustained due to various problems …
LNG imports have been actually shrinking y- o -y , but that could change in the next 1 - 2 years for a temporary period of excess supply
Emerging shale plays , e.g. , Barnett Shale … Studies expect a potential glut , but most of the growth in unconventional gas is from tight sands and coal bed methane ( CBM ) and Barnett Shale .
Barnett could peak early next year … takes 10 years to reach 4 Bcf / day .
Haynesville shows promise but is only getting started , and is unproven .
We need more evidence to see if the other shale plays are really exciting and comparable to Barnett or not .
Conventional supply could rapidly decline over the next decade … expected decline of onshore conventional and imports from Canada .
Factors to slow development of shale gas …
US is dangerously dependent on LNG — we ’re already committed to that without realizing it .
Growth in supply certain to level off .
Scaling nuclear …unlikely to make major contribution before 2025 or later … cost projections exploding , capacity to fabricate components limited , etc .
Wind also likely not a near - term panacea … huge long term potential with sufficient capital .
Renewables ’ share of total US electricity in 10 years remains small .
Burden for future grid growth thus falls on coal , but without CCS its future is dubious .
CCS must move forward because increase in coal consumption is basically guaranteed .
Under any plausible scenario , global coal use will increase > 2 billion tons per year ( tpy ) , but we ca n’t achieve aggressive CO2 reduction goals without CCS .
Q&A
Rapier :
If bagasse is burned instead of returned to the soil , is it sustainable ?
Some waste is composted , plus ash from the burning , so it ’s much better than the essential strip - mining of soil via corn ethanol … some studies say it is sustainable .
Hughes : World coal exports are probably tight … China and India both just became net importers .
US is only a slight net exporter of coal on a net energy basis .
Expect prices to remain high and supplies tight .
Weissman : Re : Barnett and other shales , much of the gas is extracted in the first 6 months , then flows quickly tail off ( to a long thin tail )
Hughes :
How can we achieve a planned descent to a lower energy future ?
The North American way of life cannot be propagated to the rest of the planet if you look at per capita data … there is n’t enough energy in the world to do that .
We need to forget BAU .
The low - hanging fruit is efficiency , rethink infrastructure ( e.g. , suburbia ) , save fuels for their highest uses ( e.g. , CTL requires a lot of infrastructure ) .
Reduce consumption , intelligent deployment of renewables .
Realize scale problems !
There are no silver bullets .
EROI for cellulosic ethanol and algal biodiesel ?
Rapier : EROI for cellulosic ethanol of 18 + is nonsense , requires that residues are burned and that has never been commercially demonstrated !
The 18 for sugarcane ethanol depends heavily on the value of bagasses residues .
USDA has done some highly misleading work on corn ethanol , e.g , . hide energy inputs of distillers ’ grains .
Actual net energy of corn ethanol is probably 5 % gain .
Weissman : Is n’t Mackenzie Valley gas good for 5 - 7 years ?
The project has already been greatly delayed and its future is uncertain due to pipeline costs .
Initial project target dates are based on hope , but reality falls short .
Same problem has greatly delayed long - anticipated LNG supply .
Grid operators assume that more gas will be available when it might not .
Weissman : Applauds T. Boone Pickens ’
Plan for getting the dialogue going .
Pickens probably knows this stuff better than energy policymakers .
But the full evaluation of his approach still needs to be made and quantified .
Aleklett to Hughes : China will have to go deeper to increase its coal production , how will this affect production ?
EROI is an issue .
We ’re getting into thinner seams , decreasing EROI , and will need much increased investment to maintain production .
Rapier : Ethanol can be useful as an octane booster , even corn ethanol ( in Iowa ) .
Where ethanol does n’t work is as a commercially scaled substitution for gasoline .
Rapier : Algae are good for wastewater treatment and other benefits .
It ’s a good area for research .
It may have a future , but we need to clear away the hype first and do a sober assessment .
When can renewables replace traditional fuels for power generation ?
Hughes : I do n’t think there ’s a hope that we could replace today ’s scale of hydrocarbons with renewables … intermittency is an issue , and the scale is too large .
We need to reduce demand .
Feebates , using grid as storage , demand response , etc. all that are useful and should be pursued , but there ’s no way to maintain BAU .

Coal is an abundant resource , US has the largest reserves in the world
Coal satisfies 53 % of our power generation in the US ; Petroleum is only 2 % ( was 17 % in the 1970s ) … we then switched to coal deliberately to reduce petroleum use
Coal price is less expensive and less volatile than oil and gas , making it more attractive to investors .
Older pulverized coal plants had 30 - 35 % efficiency ; new plants are 40 - 45 % efficient , with heat capture goes up to 70 % , vs. nat gas combined cycle plants which are ~ 50 % efficient .

The federal judge overseeing California 's decrepit prison health system told reluctant state officials Wednesday to tell him how soon they can provide $ 250 million to start building new hospitals for inmates , the first installment of an $ 8 billion construction plan .
U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson of San Francisco issued the order to Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and state Controller John Chiang , brushing aside their lawyers ' argument that only the Legislature can commit state funds to prison construction .
Henderson said legislators have already approved the $ 250 million , for unspecified " infrastructure " costs , as part of a prison expansion bill Schwarzenegger signed more than a year ago .
Henderson ordered state representatives to spell out at a hearing Oct. 27 " their specific plans to transfer $ 250 million of previously appropriated and unencumbered ... funds " to Clark Kelso , the court - appointed receiver who is managing the prison health system .
Kelso has asked the judge to hold Schwarzenegger and Chiang in contempt of court if they refuse to pay for new prison health facilities .
Henderson said he issued Wednesday 's order , at Kelso 's suggestion , " as an intermediate step short of a contempt finding . "
A contempt order could carry fines of as much as $ 2 million a day .
Kelso has not asked Henderson to jail any state officials held in contempt .
Kelso said Wednesday 's order was " a green light " on the road to full funding of his construction plan .
He said he was reluctant to seek authority to draw money directly from the state treasury , in light of California 's financial problems , and would prefer bond funding , which the Legislature has so far rejected .
Henderson took control of the $ 1.1 billion prison health system in 2006 as a result of a lawsuit filed on behalf of inmates .
The judge said that inadequate medical care was killing at least one prisoner a week and that state officials had shown themselves incapable of complying with the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment .
Kelso , a professor at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento and a veteran troubleshooter for state agencies , has submitted a plan to build seven new health care centers for 10,000 ailing inmates , improve some existing facilities and construct a building for dental care .
He has requested $ 250 million by the end of this year , a total of $ 3.5 billion in the first year and the remaining $ 4.5 billion spread over the next four years .
Construction would begin in February .
Schwarzenegger has asked the Legislature to approve bond funds for Kelso 's proposal , but lawmakers have voted it down four times , with Republicans leading the opposition .
At a hearing Monday , state Deputy Attorney General Daniel Powell told Henderson that federal law prohibits judges from ordering prison construction without legislative approval .
Powell also contended Kelso had failed to show that his plan - still largely under seal - complied with a federal law that allows judges to order only the minimum improvements needed to comply with prisoners ' constitutional rights .
Henderson replied that state officials had taken part in the preparation of the plan and had not objected .
Powell said Wednesday that the attorney general 's office would consult with Schwarzenegger and Chiang on how to respond to the judge 's order .
The lawyer said he was pleased that Henderson " recognized that contempt proceedings are inappropriate in this case . "
Any such celebrations are premature , said attorney James Brosnahan of San Francisco , who represents Kelso .
" If they do n't pay the money the court has ordered , " he said , " we 're going to ask that they be held in contempt . "
Sarah Palin says she learned that the McCain - Palin campaign was conceding Michigan to Obama when she read about it in the newspaper this morning :
Bonus Flub Update : And , yes , as readers have pointed out , Carl Cameron mistakenly identifies Palin as the Democratic nominee for vice president .
Enlarge By Malinda Hartong , The Enquirer / AP Alaska lawmakers concluded that Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin , governor of Alaska , abused her power under her administration .
Here , Palin is seen on Thursday talking to supporters in Deerfield Township , Ohio .
PALIN BIOGRAPHY PALIN BIOGRAPHY Name : Sarah Heath Palin .
Age : 44 ; born Feb. 11 , 1964 ; Sandpoint , Idaho .
Experience : Alaska governor since December 2006 ; unsuccessful run for Republican nomination for lieutenant governor in 2002 ; chairwoman of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission , 2003 - 2004 ; served two terms as Wasilla mayor and two terms on city council .
Education : Graduated University of Idaho , 1987 , journalism .

Business : Worked as sports reporter for two Anchorage television stations ; owned with her husband a snowmobile , watercraft , ATV business from 1994 - 97 .
Husband is a North Slope oil field worker .
Source : Associated Press . Stephen Branchflower By Matt Hage , AP ANCHORAGE ( AP )  Sarah Palin unlawfully abused her power as governor by trying to have her former brother - in - law fired as a state trooper , the chief investigator of an Alaska legislative panel concluded Friday .
Investigator Stephen Branchflower , in a report to a bipartisan panel that looked into the matter , found Palin in violation of a state ethics law that prohibits public officials from using their office for personal gain .
POLITICS BLOG : More on the investigators ' findings DOCUMENTS : Todd Palin had top access to wife 's staff
The inquiry looked into her dismissal of Public Safety Commissioner Walter Monegan , who said he lost his job because he resisted pressure to fire a state trooper involved in a bitter divorce and custody battle with the governor 's sister .
Palin says Monegan was fired as part of a legitimate budget dispute .
Monegan 's firing was lawful , the report found , but Palin let the family grudge influence her decision - making — even if it was not the sole reason Monegan was dismissed .
" I feel vindicated , " Monegan said .
" It sounds like they 've validated my belief and opinions .
And that tells me I 'm not totally out in left field . "
Branchflower said Palin violated a statute of the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act .
Lawmakers do n't have the authority to sanction her for such a violation , and they gave no indication they would take any action against her .
Under Alaska law , it is up to the state 's Personnel Board — which is conducting its own investigation into the matter — to decide whether Palin violated state law and , if so , must refer it to the Senate president for disciplinary action .
Violations also carry a possible fine of up to $ 5,000 .
Palin attorney Thomas Van Flein disagreed with Branchflower 's conclusions .
" In order to violate the ethics law , there has to be some personal gain , usually financial .
Mr. Branchflower has failed to identify any financial gain , " he said .
Palin and McCain 's supporters had hoped the inquiry 's finding would be delayed until after the presidential election to spare her any embarrassment and to put aside an enduring distraction as she campaigns as McCain 's running mate in an uphill contest against Democrat Barack Obama .
After a court fight to block the report failed , the panel of lawmakers voted to release it — though not without dissension .
The panel did not vote on whether to endorse its findings .
" I think there are some problems in this report , " said Republican state Sen.
Gary Stevens , a member of the panel .
" I would encourage people to be very cautious , to look at this with a jaundiced eye . "
The state paid Branchflower , a retired state prosecutor , $ 100,000 to prepare the nearly 300 - page report .
He interviewed or accepted affidavits from about two dozen people in the eight - week investigation .
" Legislative Council seriously overreached , making a tortured argument to find fault without basis in law or fact , " McCain campaign spokesman Meg Stapleton said .
The Legislature could vote next year to censure Palin , but committee members appeared divided over the report and Democratic state Sen.
Kim Elton , the committee 's chairman , gave no indication that would happen .
Stapleton also dismissed the report as " a partisan - led inquiry run by Obama supporters . "
The inquiry has been dogged by such criticism since Democrat Hollis French , who oversaw the investigation , predicted an " October surprise " for the McCain campaign .
Elton rejected the accusation of partisanship .
" When we began investigating this , we had no idea that Sarah Palin would be a part of the national ticket , " said Elton , an Obama supporter .
The report notes a few instances in which Palin pressed the case against trooper Mike Wooten , but it was her husband , Todd , who led the charge .
Todd Palin had extraordinary access to the governor 's office and her closest advisers and he used that access to try to get Wooten fired .
Gov. Palin knowingly " permitted Todd to use the governor 's office and the resources of the governor 's office , including access to state employees , to continue to contact subordinate state employees in an effort to find some way to get Trooper Wooten fired , " Branchflower 's report reads .
Wooten had been in hot water before Palin became governor over allegations that he illegally shot a moose , drank beer in a patrol car and used a Taser on his stepson .
The Palins said they feared for their family 's safety after Wooten made threats against them .
In proceedings revealed by the report , former Alaska State Trooper Col.
Julia Grimes told investigators that Sarah Palin called her in late 2005 to discuss why Wooten had n't been fired , and Grimes told her the inquiry was confidential by law .
" Her questions were how can a trooper who behaves this way still be working , " Grimes said .
" I asked her to please trust me , that because I can't tell her details I would ask her to please trust me that I would take the appropriate action if and when I knew what the findings were .
... I could n't have another conversation with her about it because , again , it 's protected by law . "
Grimes said Todd Palin also contacted her by telephone in late 2005 to discuss the confidential investigation of Wooten .
Wooten 's disciplinary case was settled in September 2006 — months before Palin was elected governor — and he was allowed to continue working as a trooper .
After Palin 's election , her new public safety commissioner , Monegan , said he was summoned to the governor 's office to meet Todd Palin , who said Wooten 's punishment had been merely a " slap on the wrist . "
Monegan said he understood the Palins wanted Wooten fired .
" I had this kind of ominous feeling that I may not be long for this job if I did n't somehow respond accordingly , " Monegan told the investigator .
For months afterward , Todd Palin filed complaints about Wooten , saying he was seen riding a snowmobile after he had filed a worker 's compensation claim and was seen dropping off his children at school in his patrol car .
Monegan said Wooten 's doctor had authorized the snowmobile trip and his supervisor had approved his use of the patrol car .
Monegan said Alaska 's attorney general later called him to inquire about Wooten , and Monegan told him they should n't be discussing the subject .
" This was an issue that apparently was n't going to go away , that there were certainly frustrations , " Monegan said .
" To say that ( Sarah Palin ) was focused on this I think would be accurate . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The latest fall style for credit - addicted Americans : paying with cash .
But that 's not necessarily a good thing for retailers who are struggling to lift sagging sales .
What 's more , industry watchers point out that a growing preference for cash poses a more direct challenge to online retailers - since computers do n't accept cash just yet .
Credit expert Howard Dvorkin said Americans tend to resort to cash in troubling times .
" There was a retreat to cash after 9/11 ( the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks ) and the recent market collapse is having a similar effect , " said Dvorkin , who is also the founder of Consolidated Credit Counseling Services .
To his point , a survey conducted last month by Javelin Strategy & Research showed 39 % of consumers decreased their credit card usage , up from 37 % in April .
The survey polled 2,339 consumers nationwide .
Still , since Americans are hard - wired to use credit , Dvorkin thinks this shift to cash will be temporary .
" It 's hard to to teach an old dog new tricks , " Dvorkin said .
" Consumers have short memories .
When the economy turns around , they 'll return to the same old ways . "
Do n't tell that to Deanne Durkee .
The 44 - year - old computer programmer who lives in Dudley , Mass. , still has her credit cards but has n't used them in more than two years .
And she 's sticking to cash to make all of her Christmas gift purchases .
" I had $ 35,000 in credit card debt .
I consolidated my debt and I 've almost paid off all of it , " she said .
She intends to hold on to her credit cards for " emergencies only . "
" Using cash has been a great lesson for my kids .
It 's taught them to budget and it's taught them about delayed gratification , " Durkee said .
" If you wait to buy something , sometimes you realize you do n't need or want it anymore . "
Christopher Bukowski , 29 , a video producer from Florida , uses cash every time he shops .
" It keeps me honest and within my means , " he said .
That was n't always the case .
Like Durkee , he also had thousands of dollars in credit card debt .
" I was living in a false reality , " he said .
" I was so used to reaching for the credit card .
It was easy to buy the big flatscreen TV even when it was n't necessary . "
Bukowski has eliminated his debt and he 's making only cash purchases .
" I might get a credit card again in the future , " he said .
More shockwaves for retailers
The shift away from credit cards - even if it 's short - lived - could be another blow for retailers who are already facing a very difficult sales year .
" With credit cards , consumers spend 30 % more ( on purchases ) than with cash , " Dvorkin said .
So if retailers see cash being used more in coming weeks , it could potentially hurt sales over the critical holiday shopping period of November through December .
That two - month period typically accounts for half or more of merchants ' annual profits and sales .
" Obviously there is much more disappointment coming [ for retailers ] , " said Stevan Buxbaum , retail analyst with consulting firm Buxbaum Group .
" If consumers are paying with cash , they will be more selective in what they 're buying and they 'll probably buy fewer items , " Buxbaum said .
Online merchants are feeling especially anxious .
" I am very worried about consumers using cash , " said Neel Grover , CEO of Buy.com .
The e-tailer sells a variety of products , including clothes , computers , books and luggage .
So Grover said he 's partnering with vendors who provide alternative payment options in a bid to hold on to crucial sales in the days ahead .
Grover said Ebillme is one such partner .
Ebillme is a cash - based payment system through which consumers do n't have to provide the e-tailer or ebillme with their credit or debit card number , or any other financial information .
Ebillme CEO Marwan Forzley said his company has received a lot of interest lately from top e-tailers .
" We are in active discussions with many of the leading pure - play online merchants and traditional retailers with Web sites , " he said .
Gilbert Fiorentino , CEO of Tigerdirect.com , an online electronics seller , offers its customers the ebillme payment in addition to credit card payment options .
" We 've definitely seen some of our customers migrating to ebillme over the last few weeks , " Fiorentino said .
" The way I see it is that life has changed for Americans , " Forzley said .
" It 's no longer a buy now , pay later mentality out there .
" People want to buy now and pay now , and sleep better at night , " he said .
To that end , Consolidated Credit Counseling Services ' Dvorkin offered a win-win proposition for both consumers and retailers .
" In general , using credit cards is n't a bad thing in itself . " he said .
" Just make sure you do n't carry over any balance when you do . "
Pictured : The ' humanoid robot ' that can dance and do the household chores
Action man : Mahru has been designed so he can move his body in a similar way to a human
Scientists have created a ' humanoid robot ' that can dance and do the household chores .
' Mahru ' has been developed to mimic humans and can move its lips , eyebrows and pupils .
The machine can also move its upper and lower body freely and automatically stop itself when walking .
In addition , it has been programmed to emit two kinds of fragrances to match its emotions .
The 1.5 m tall robot was produced by researchers at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology ( KIST ) and is the first South Korean - developed machine of its kind .
' Mahru will open the way for the commercial use of humanoid robots doing housework , ' You Bum - Jae , leader of the development research team , said .
' Mahru can dance while walking on its legs and is capable of working in place of a human . '
Through an advanced motion capture system , Mahru can follow a variety of human movements and is able to move its hands freely enough to cope with any interference or obstacles that may get in his way when walking .
State - funded KIST unveiled the robot during a presentation at its headquarters in Seoul .
In the groove :
The robot showed off some slick dance moves at a demonstration
Onlookers were treated to an entertaining demonstration which saw the humanoid show off the full range of its skills , most notably a series of animated dance moves .
The research team added that they had designed another Mahru , this time with sensors allowing it to differentiate between faces and objects .
View video of Mahru here ...
The unveiling of Mahru comes a week after researchers in Japan revealed they had created the ' most human - like ' robot in the world .
A team at Osaka University 's robotics department claim that ' robogirl ' , Repliee R - 1 , looks , moves and interacts like a human , and has silicone skin that feels almost human to the touch .
Settling in :
The humanoid robot looks at home with a cuppa
The deadlock between Robert Mugabe 's Zanu - PF party and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change over forming a new government was not helping , he added : " What is baffling is that the political players seem to take a cavalier attitude over the political crisis whose resolution is tied to the economic turnaround . "
But according to independent analysts , even the 231 million per cent statistic is a woeful underestimate .
Sign wars
Jonathan and I have both gotten a lot of email about the perennial election year sport of stealing the other side 's lawn signs .
Also , some creative defenses , as in the West Georgia ( above ) and North Carolina pictures of Obama signs here .
My Georgia correspondent writes , " People are now covering their signs in roofing glue or dog poop , almost hoping that someone will try to grab one .
One guy I know is working to run an electric current through his sign .
I , on the other hand , have placed a note on my sign , warning anyone that every sign they steal will be replaced by a new sign , thereby making another 8 $ contribution to the Obama campaign . "
Jonathan 's Virginia reader , defending McCain - Palin signs , meanwhile , writes that he covered his in " doe menstrual urine that I found at Wal - Mart . "
Gary McKinnon says he acted out of curiosity , not malice Lawyers for a Briton accused of hacking into secret military and Nasa computers are asking the home secretary to ensure he is not jailed in the US .
Glasgow - born Gary McKinnon , 42 , who last month lost his appeal against extradition , could face life in jail if convicted of accessing 97 computers .
His lawyer Karen Todner said his human rights would be breached if he did not return to the UK after a trial .
The Home Office said his case was " receiving consideration " .
A spokesman said : " Further representations have been received today from solicitors against Mr McKinnon 's surrender to the USA which are receiving consideration . "
' Biggest ever attack ' Unemployed Mr McKinnon , from Wood Green , north London , was said to be " distraught " after losing his extradition appeal to the European Court of Human Rights .
He has admitted breaking into the computers , but says he sought information on UFOs and only got in because of lax security .
The US government , however , insists he committed a malicious crime - the biggest military computer hack ever .
They say he stole passwords , deleted files and left 300 computers at a US navy weapons station unusable immediately after the September 11 terrorist attacks .
Clearly it is time to re-think summary extradition when US prosecutors threaten to ' fry ' a non-violent computer hacker
James Welch , Liberty Ms Todner said she had written to the Home Office asking for an intervention on her client 's behalf .
She said : " We have requested that the home secretary obtain an assurance from the United States government that Mr McKinnon be returned to the UK immediately on receiving a sentence in the US , should he be extradited .
" It is standard practice for both the Dutch and Israeli governments to seek this assurance on behalf of their nationals who face extradition to the United States .
" In light of Mr McKinnon 's being diagnosed with Asperger 's Syndrome , it would seem to be highly appropriate that the home secretary obtains this assurance . "
' Non-violent ' Mr McKinnon was arrested in 2002 but never charged in the UK .
He first lost his case against extradition at the High Court in 2006 before taking it to the highest court in the UK , the House of Lords .
His lawyers want his case to be tried in Britain , arguing that the alleged offences were committed on British soil .
James
Welch , legal director of human rights group Liberty , said : " Clearly it is time to re-think summary extradition when US prosecutors threaten to ' fry ' a non-violent computer hacker .
" It is a shame that the Court of Human Rights will allow his extradition even as they consider whether US extradition measures were fair . "
A demonstration in support of Mr McKinnon will take place outside the Home Office on Tuesday .

What are these ?
These days , we are hearing a lot of people urging an attack on Afghanistan because Osama Bin Laden , who is suspected of committing criminal acts , lives there .
Well , sounds fine to me !
Let 's nuke the place , glaze it over , and while we 're at it , let 's nuke a few other well known homes of criminals .
Let 's start with Chicago .
After all , they harbored the likes of Johnny Torrio , Alfonse ' Scarface ' Capone , Dion O'Banion , Frankie Yale , Albert Anselmi , John Scalise , Hymie Weiss , George ' Bugs ' Moran , Jack ' Machine Gun ' McGurn , Paul ' The Waiter ' Ricca , Anthony ' Joe Batters ' Accardo , Sam ' Mooney ' Giancana , Felix ' Milwaukee Phil ' Alderiso , John ' Jackie ' Cerone , Samuel ' Mad Sam ' DeStefano , Tony ' The Ant ' Spillotro , Joe Auippa , and Joe Ferriola ; so many gangsters that Chicago has become synonymous with the very concept of the gangland mob .
The place is full of criminals .
Let 's just nuke it ; teach 'em a lesson .
Or how about Milwaukee , which harbored cannibal Jeffrey Dahmer ?
Let 's nuke them , too .
Or how about Los Angeles , which harbored Richard " Night Stalker " Remirez , Charlie Manson and his girls , the Hillside Strangler , and still harbors to this very day Rodney King rioters and druggie drive - by shooters .
Should n't we nuke them , for the sake of our own safety ?
After all , are we really sure O.J. was all that innocent ?
Better drop the big one , just in case .
You can't be too careful .
Nuke 'em .
Nuke 'em all , I say .
Let 's teach them a lesson they will never forget !
Let 's do it for national security .
Let 's do it for the economy .
Let 's do it for the children .
Just do it .
( Ahem )
If you stop and think about it for a moment , it is rather a silly idea to insist on bombing or invading an entire people because one of them is a criminal .
The correct and civilized thing to do is to punish just the criminal , and not the neighbors who truth be told have very little to say about where anyone else can live .
Most folks in Chicago did n't know if their neighbors were gangsters , and probably could n't have done much about it even if they had .
The same is true of the Afghani people , who probably do n't know where Osama Bin Laden lives and could n't do much about it if they did .
The proper thing to do is to catch the criminal .
That 's what was done with Al Capone , Jeffrey Dahmer , and ( almost ) all the rest .
We did n't bomb Al Capone 's neighbor .
We did n't bomb the school across the street from where Jeffrey Dahmer lived .
We did n't bomb the shopping mall where Richard Ramirez bought his blue jeans .
That 's not how civilized people behave .
That 's not how civilized nations behave .
It ’s Tidy
Spitting is , quite simply , messy .
Having a paper towel at the ready can help , but even then , you have a cum - soaked towel to dispose of .
Same is true if he comes somewhere other than inside your mouth , there ’s plenty of sticky jizm to wipe up .
Just swallow and there 's no muss or fuss .
It ’s Quick
Even if cum is unpleasant ( we have tips for making it much less so ) , the fastest way to deal with it is to swallow .
Running to the bathroom to dispose of it or spitting it out on the spot will take more time , and be less efficient , than just swallowing it .
It Lets the Man Relax
If a man has to worry about coming , feeling that it is an imposition on the woman or the cause of unpleasantness , it creates tension while receiving the blowjob .
He can not fully relax , and cannot fully enjoy his climax .
A woman who swallows both puts her partner at ease .
Also , she can continue sucking through the orgasm , “ sucking him dry ” , which men find both physically and emotionally satisfying .
The Symbolism of Swallowing
In Western culture , swallowing has deep symbolic significance .
The act of swallowing signals acceptance , blessing , and complete transformation .
Imagine spitting out champagne after a toast or spitting out the wafer during communion .
The insult and sacrilege would be overwhelming .
In the same way , spitting out cum is a symbolic rejection to many men .
By swallowing , a woman indicates complete acceptance .
She wishes to consume , to commune with whatever comes from her lover .
As she imbibes the cum , it becomes part of her , he becomes part of her .
They are joined together in an intimate sacred bond like no other .
It 's Polite To quote one woman : " What sort of message does that convey to immediately run to the nearest sink to spit ?
I ’m comfortable enough to get down on my knees and wrap my lips around your cock , but not comfortable enough to swallow the fruits of my labor ?
I know I ’d be offended if my boyfriend ran to the bathroom to gargle with mouthwash after going down on me .
So , sure I swallow .
It ’s almost impolite not to . "
It 's Environmentally Friendly Leaving your spunk in public places just is n't right , whether you 're dogging in the park or sucking the cinema .
And wasting tissues and paper towels destroys trees and adds to our landfill problems .
Swallowing is the ultimate form of enviromentally - friendly recycling .
I do n't know if nutrition is 50 percent of the bodybuilding game , 70 percent , or 99.9 percent .
All I know is that ignoring it is the worst mistake you can make .
You wo n't look like you want to look or feel like you want to feel .
Chances are , if you look in the mirror and do n't like what you see , it 's your diet that 's to blame .
One of the best books I 've ever read on food and nutrition is called The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth , by Jonny Bowden , Ph.D .
Bowden is not only a renowned expert on weight loss and nutrition , he 's also the go - to - guy for other diet experts .
His books have been recommended by everyone from Barry Sears of Zone Diet fame to Charles Poliquin of gigantic biceps fame .
( Bowden wrote the nutrition portion of Poliquin 's certification course . )
I recently met up with Bowden and hit him with a few questions that have been on my mind since I started reading his work .
Testosterone Nation :
One of your books ,
The 150 Healthiest Foods on Earth , is considered to be controversial because some of the info goes against what most people believe .
For example , soy does n't make your favorite list but whole eggs do .
Yet most Americans think soy is a miracle food and whole eggs are bad for you .
There are a lot of foods and ingredients that do n't fall cleanly into the good and bad category .
The same thing is true with exercise .
Is a low - rep bench press a good exercise ?
Well , sure it is , but not if you 're a 74 - year old woman trying to get some strength to open a jar .
It would be a stupid exercise for that person .
In much the same way , many foods and ingredients fall into that category .
Some foods are naturally high in sugar .
Not a problem if you do n't have any issues with the metabolism of sugar .
If you do , then you might want to stay away from bananas or mangoes .
Those are great foods , lots of nutrients , but may not be a good choice for someone who 's pre-diabetic .
T Nation : Any " health foods " being touted today that , well , really are n't that healthy ?
Our huge emphasis on grains is very misplaced .
A very substantial portion of the population has sensitivities to gluten .
One in 133 people have full - blown celiac disease .
Grains are fairly new in human history – the last 10,000 years , which compared to 2.4 million years is n't that long .
Grains cause problems for a lot of people .
If you 're not one of those people , it 's fine food .
But for a lot of people , more than you might think , a grain - free or at least gluten - free diet may be a smart idea .
T Nation : How about saturated fat ?
Very misunderstood .
I 'm not convinced that saturated fat is the worst thing in a person 's diet , and I 'm completely convinced that heart disease is not caused by cholesterol .
Saturated fat comes in lots of " flavors . "
It 's a whole family of fatty acids , and some of them , like the medium - chain triglycerides in coconut , are downright healthy for you .
Coconut oil has been a terribly misunderstood food because people think that because it has saturated fat it 's not good for you .
Not so .
Saturated fat can come in the form of the crap that 's in McDonald 's fries or it can come in the form of some of the fat in an egg yolk .
These are not the same animal , so to speak .
They 're very different in terms of their effects on the body .
The saturated fat in coconut and yolks is extremely healthy , good for the heart and the brain .
An egg - white omelet is one of the dumbest things in the world .
T Nation :
Are we talking standard eggs here or the free - range , omega - 3 enriched variety ?
All animal products are only as good as the diet of the animal and living conditions of the animal .
Or , as I write in my book , the quality of the food we eat comes from the quality of the food our food eats .
So yes , free range is important .
If you put cows in a little stall so small that they can't turn around , feed them grain ( which is not their natural diet ) , give them antibiotics to deal with their gut illnesses from the grains , milk them 24/7 and give them more infections and therefore more antibiotics and steroids ... well , that 's a whole different animal compared to the one on Grandma Jones 's farm grazing in the pasture .
Everything about them is different -- CLA content , everything .
With chickens it 's the same thing .
Unfortunately , agribusiness has co-opted the term " free range " so it does n't really have as much meaning as we hoped it would .
We picture chickens running around a farm , but the term has been downgraded to mean that the chicken simply has " access " to the range .
That " access " may only mean two weeks a year .
Or it may have " access " to a little gate that he does n't even know how to use .
I 'd still try to find free - range , farmers - market , omega - 3 enriched eggs , though I do n't even care much about omega - 3 enriched .
If they 're truly free range and they 're eating their natural diet and pecking at worms , then they 'll have plenty of omega - 3 anyway .
T Nation :
To go along with the corporate abuse of " free range , " it seems like the word " natural " is also misused a lot .
" Natural " does n't mean anything – no legal meaning , no agreed - upon meaning , no meaning whatsoever !
There are natural mushrooms that will kill you .
Poison ivy is natural , so is gasoline , and I 'm not eating either one of them .
" Natural " is a complete marketing gimmick .
You 're now seeing that label on foods that were never grown , hunted for , fished for , plucked or gathered .
What 's natural about food that comes in a plastic box ?
Even vitamin supplements are n't natural .
They do n't grow on trees .
T Nation : I see that Lucky Charms are now proudly made with whole grains ...
That 's a perfect example of how the language has become degraded .
T Nation :
And if I 'm correct , the label " made with whole grains " can mean that they only threw in a sprinkle of actual whole grain .
That 's exactly what it means .
It started life as a whole grain but by the time you get it there 's nothing left in it .
It 's kind of like making yogurt with live cultures .
They hope you do n't notice this , but there 's quite a distinction between starting with live cultures and actually having any left when you eat it .
It has to contain live cultures .
And by the way , I do n't think whole grains are that much better than the crappy kind .
They 're only marginally better .
They still have about the same effect on blood sugar -- they only marginally lower glycemic load .
They still affect people who are gluten - sensitive , and they still have the same effect as far as bloat goes .
Whole grains do have more vitamins and supposedly more fiber , but not much .
It 's like eating white sugar vs. brown sugar .
Whole grains are better than regular , but not significantly .
T Nation : Ouch .
That 's painful to hear .
It 's sometimes easy to justify a too - high carb intake if it's " healthy " whole grain .
So , what other supposed " health - food " trends make you want to tear your hair out ?
Bowden : Special K cereal being marketed as a healthy cereal .
That 's nonsense .
T Nation :
And the commercials encourage women to eat it at night !
Scary .
What do you think the next " super food " will be ?
That 's a good question , but it needs a little parsing .
What 's going to be the next big super food has more to do with marketing and commercialization than it does with the inherent value of the food .
Kale , blueberries , and prunes are superstar foods on any level , but are they going to be the next big thing ?
If there was a new food discovered that had even half of what those foods have , everyone would be clamoring about it .
You can construct an amazingly healthy diet with the foods that are already out there .
There 's not one food on earth that has everything you need .
Wild salmon , one of my favorites , still does n't have any fiber .
The best vegetable in the world , like kale , is n't going to have any protein .
You can't get everything you need from one food , even a super food .
Instead you put a wide variety of these foods into heavy rotation .
Another problem with the super food label is that it creates a false impression that you can continue to eat crap as long as you have a glass of MonaVie everyday .
[ Editor 's note : MonaVie is a drink made from acai berries . ]
That , by the way , is another trend that makes me want to pull my hair out : the multi- level - marketing juices with false health claims .
They actually claim it cures cancer .
It 's B.S.multi - level marketing at its slimiest .
T Nation : Let 's talk man-food .
Are there any specific foods for men that may help boost testosterone levels , or help prevent any male - oriented diseases ?
I have n't yet found any substantial evidence that any particular food raises testosterone levels .
You can raise testosterone by being at a football game and having your team win .
Hormones are actually very responsive to thoughts , moods , and feelings .
Now , as far as foods go , I think there are some foods that are estrogenic .
Soy , for example .
Soy is n't the worst food in the world , but it has estrogenic compounds .
So does beer -- that 's one of the reasons people get beer bellies .
So those are things you do n't want when trying to build muscle and optimize the hormonal environment .
So do n't think of it as raising testosterone , but moving stuff out of the way so it can do its best work .
Here 's an analogy : Let 's say you 're a swimmer and you want to go as fast as possible .
You could research those titanium Speedos that might give you a slight edge , but if you 're wearing weights around your ankles , fuck the Speedos ; first drop the ankle weights !
I think a lot of people are in this position of walking around asking , " What 's the fastest Speedo ? " when they should be simply getting the weights off their ankles .
With testosterone , what breaks down muscle ?
Cortisol , right ?
How about lowering your cortisol levels ?
There 's only so much we can do to naturally boost testosterone , but we can do a lot to get the weights off our ankles .
And cortisol , as Dr. Michael Colgan once put it , is the Grinch of bodybuilding .
It eats up muscle .
What bodybuilders rarely do is use some type of stress reduction technique or meditation or deep breathing .
Those things , along with uninterrupted sleep in a dark room without the TV on , lower cortisol more than anything .
I think that 's more important than trying to boost testosterone .
T Nation : Interesting points there .
Now , you 've written a couple books about low - carb diets , so what do you think of the idea that there 's no such thing as an essential carbohydrate ?
That 's correct .
There are essential fatty acids and essential amino acids , but not essential carbohydrates .
Let 's say we put all T - Nation readers on an island for a year .
We give half of them nothing but protein and fats for that year .
The other half gets all carbohydrates – no protein , no fat .
That group , the carb - only group , would be dead in a year .
The other group will do just fine .
The actual dietary requirement for carbs in the diet is zero .
Now , does that mean we should eat zero carbohydrates ?
No .
There are incredibly important things in carbohydrate - containing foods such as phytochemicals , flavonoids , vitamins , minerals , anti-inflammatories and all kinds of stuff we desperately need for optimal health .
But is there a physiological need for the metabolism to have carbohydrates in the diet ?
No .
There is , however , a physiological need for glucose .
The brain needs a certain amount of glucose per day .
But , the body can make that amount of glucose just fine from fatty acids and proteins .
You know , it 's kind of weird that the idiotic American Dietetic Association has us eating a 65 to 70 percent carbohydrate diet , the one thing we actually do n't even need !
When you see a dietician , run the other way .
Sure , talk to experts in nutrition , but avoid dieticians like the plague .
It 's like trying to get objective advice about religion from the Taliban .
The ADA is a pathetic and irrelevant organization .
And doctors are n't much better .
Doctors know dick about nutrition .
They 're not trained in it and they know nothing about it .
Those that do know something about it got that education on their own .
They did n't get it in medical school .
T Nation : Okay , given that you 've written books on the healthiest foods and healthiest meals on earth , many would expect you to be anti-supplement .
Are you ?
No , I 'm not at all .
My next book is on supplements , in fact .
I 'm a big believer in supplements .
I 'm not a big believer in taking supplements and ignoring your diet though .
The thing is , supplements are a technology for delivering nutrients , and we need the nutrients .
Now , if we all lived on organic farms , lived a stress - free life in the same village , with little exposure to pollutants and chemicals , then we 'd probably do quite well with our organic food , grass - fed cows , free - range chickens , and fish from pristine waters .
But that 's not how we live .
We really do n't get optimal nutrition from our food , even when we 're eating really well .
T Nation :
What would you say is the most underrated supplement on the planet ?
Bowden : Vitamin D. People are finally beginning to know about fish oil , but they have n't learned yet that we 're massively deficient in vitamin D. New studies have shown that people with the highest level of vitamin D had a 27 percent less chance of dying from any cause whatsoever .
Vitamin D helps prevent cancer , it increases physical performance in older adults , it 's a mood enhancer , and it's a bone strengthener .
It 's a vitamin we just do n't get enough of in our food , unless you 're drinking cod liver oil .
Plus since it's a vitamin made in the skin when we go into the sun , we do n't get it there either since we slather on SPF 45 every time we go outside .
We 're sun-phobic .
So , there 's a case for taking Vitamin D supplements every day .
T Nation : Okay , lightning round .
I throw out some foods and you give us your thoughts on them .
First , corn .
Dr. Bowden : Corn is n't a bad food .
It 's okay for some but not for others .
Of course , corn syrup should be out of the diet .
Whole corn can raise blood sugar , especially if it 's eaten by itself , but there 's some good stuff in corn .
Just treat it as a starch and not as a vegetable .
Small amounts are fine for most people .
It 's okay , nothing like white potatoes .
T Nation : Milk .
I 'm not a big fan of milk .
It 's actually one of the top seven food allergens .
I do like raw milk however .
It 's just a different food than homogenized , pasteurized milk .
It still has all of its healthful bacteria , its fat content is healthier , etc .
It 's quite safe too , in spite of what the dairy industry likes to tell you .
T Nation : Alcoholic beverages ?
Well , they can make you fat .
That 's a definite .
It 's not just the calories , it 's the fact that your body stops processing fat while it gets rid of the alcohol .
Now , there 's a lot of evidence that a small to moderate amount of alcohol , one or two glasses of red wine a day , can be life - extending and healthful .
But you also have this critical mass of people who do n't know what " small amount " means , hence alcohol 's role in car accidents , murders , and broken marriages .
For some people , alcohol is like peanuts .
Peanuts are a good food , but not if you go into anaphylactic shock .
If you do that , then eating peanuts " in moderation " is probably not a good idea .
So alcohol is a very personal decision .
If you can manage it and drink only small amounts , you do n't have an addictive personality , and you 're not one of those people who craves more , then it can be a healthful compound .
But so are grapes , and you can eat those without the other risks .
T Nation : I think the only thing worse than a beer gut is beer goggles .
Now that 's a health risk !

The Church of England , which this week condemned the practices of some City traders , has been using aggressive tactics to maximise profits on its £ 5b investment portfolio , according to a thinktank .
The Archbishop of York , John Sentamu , branded financiers who cashed in on falling share prices as " bank robbers " and " asset strippers " , and the Archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams , called for fresh scrutiny and regulation of the financial markets .
But yesterday the religion and society thinktank Ekklesia claimed that in 2006 the Church Commissioners , who manage the Church of England 's investments , set up a currency hedging programme , in effect short - selling sterling to guard against rises in other currencies .
Ekklesia also criticised the church for its shareholdings in oil and mining companies .
Jonathan Bartley , co-director of Ekklesia , said : " The archbishops should be extremely careful when attacking City bank robbers for short - selling and speculation .
Amongst the billions of pounds that the church currently invests in property and shares are hundreds of millions invested in oil and mining companies . "
He said the church has substantial share holdings in banks and a stated aim of making a profit on its investments of 5 % a year above the rate of inflation .
Last night the church denied it was involved in short - selling , saying the think - tank 's comments were " misleading " .
" The currency hedging programme , set up in 2007 , is designed to protect the sterling value of the commissioners ' foreign currency - denominated assets , " a spokesman said .
" It is designed for protective , not speculative purposes and was put into place because the commissioners ' foreign currency positions have been growing in significance as part of a wider move to improve the diversification of their asset base . "
Bartley said the Church should invest more in institutions such as cooperatives , friendly societies and housing associations in return for a slightly lower profit .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democratic congressman John Lewis , a veteran civil rights leader , accused Republican John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin on Saturday of “ sowing the seeds of hatred and division ” and said it reminded him of the segregationist era of Alabama Gov. George Wallace .
McCain , trailing Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama in the polls in an increasingly tense campaign , quickly hit back , branding Lewis ’s remarks “ shocking and beyond the pale ” and calling on Obama to immediately repudiate them .
The Obama campaign said while Lewis was right to condemn “ hateful rhetoric ” the Illinois senator did not believe McCain or his policy criticism were comparable to Wallace or his segregationist policies as governor of Alabama in the 1960s .
The issue of race has mostly been an undercurrent in the presidential contest between McCain and Obama , who would be America ’s first black president , and it remains unknown how much of a factor it will play in the Nov. 4 vote .
Lewis ’s comments , posted on his re-election website , follow widely reported outbursts of anger against Obama at McCain campaign events .
McCain on Friday urged his supporters to be respectful of his Democratic rival .
“ I am deeply disturbed by the negative tone of the McCain - Palin campaign , ” said Lewis , an Obama supporter , civil rights icon and Georgia Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives .
“ What I am seeing today reminds me too much of another destructive period in American history .
Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin are sowing the seeds of hatred and division , and there is no need for this hostility in our political discourse , ” he said .
Noting that Wallace , a divisive political figure in his day , had also run for president , Lewis said , “ He created the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans who were simply trying to exercise their constitutional rights . ”
“ Sen . McCain and Governor Palin are playing with fire , and if they are not careful , that fire will consume us all , ” Lewis said .
MCCAIN : ‘BASELESS ATTACK ’
In a strongly worded rebuke , McCain said : “ The notion that legitimate criticism of Sen . Obama ’s record and positions could be compared to Gov. George Wallace , his segregationist policies and the violence he provoked is unacceptable and has no place in this campaign . ”
“ I am saddened that John Lewis , a man I ’ve always admired , would make such a brazen and baseless attack on my character and the character of the thousands of hardworking Americans who come to our events to cheer for the kind of reform that will put America on the right track , ” McCain added .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton dismissed the Wallace comparison but said Lewis “ was right to condemn some of the hateful rhetoric that John McCain himself personally rebuked just last night , as well as the baseless and profoundly irresponsible charges from his own running mate that the Democratic nominee for president of the United States ‘ pals around with terrorists . ” ’
McCain and Palin have both raised questions about Obama ’s association with former 1960s radical William Ayers .
Simple powder to beat 2,400 genetic diseases goes on sale in two years
Health breakthrough : Scientists hope a new powdered drug will treat genetic conditions such as muscular dystrophy suffered by physicist Stephen Hawking
A powdered drug which eases the symptoms of incurable genetic diseases could be on sale within two years , researchers say .
They hope it could treat 2,400 conditions , including some types of cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy , as well as the blood clotting disease haemophilia .
Many inherited diseases are caused by mutations in genes which stop cells from making vital proteins .
The new drug - known only as PTC124 - makes cells less sensitive to these mutations .
Given early enough , PTC124 could even halt the progress of some genetic illnesses - many of which are incurable .
The drug comes as a vanilla - flavoured powder to make it easier for patients to take .
This would be dissolved in water , milk or juice and taken with meals .
Researcher Dr Stuart Peltz said that there were many serious inherited diseases for which there is currently no effective treatment .
' We hope to be able to bring this to market not only quickly for cystic fibrosis but over time to many different patients with many different diseases for which there is no treatment , ' he added .
In cystic fibrosis , a mutation stops the body producing a protein called CTFR .
Its absence causes the body 's fluids to become abnormally thick and sticky , causing breathing and digestive problems .
In tests on patients , PTC124 boosted production of the protein and improved breathing , the British Society for Human Genetics conference will hear today .
It is thought that PTC124 could help 10 per cent of the 8,000 cystic fibrosis sufferers in Britain .
More trials are due to start soon .
Tests on youngsters with Duchenne muscular dystrophy , which affects 100 babies a year in the UK , have also been promising .
In mice , the drug repaired muscle mass lost to the degenerative disease and it is hoped that PTC124 could help 13 per cent of human sufferers .
In all , the drug has the potential to treat 2,400 diseases - proving effective for between five and 70 per cent of those suffering from each condition .
Dr Peltz , of PTC Therapeutics , said : ' The difference between this and other drugs is it does n't [ just ] treat the symptoms , it treats the underlying cause .
' The drug allows the body to make the lost protein . '
It is hoped the drug , which would have to be taken every day for life , could be on the market by 2010 .
PTC124 researcher Dr Lee Sweeney , of the University of Pennsylvania , said : ' This new class of treatment has the potential to help a large number of patients with different genetic diseases that have the same type of mutation . '
Dr Marita Pohlschmidt of the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign said : ' PTC124 has previously shown encouraging results in clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy .
' However , as the drug applies to boys with a specific mutation , only 10 - 15 per cent of the 2,000 boys living with the condition in the UK might be treated . '
Muscular dystrophy patients and their carers are being failed by the NHS , the charity added yesterday .
A survey of 850 patients found that half do not have access to a specialist consultant and many had to pay for their own wheelchairs .
' Nonsense mutations '
Between five and 15 per cent of inherited diseases are caused by ' nonsense mutations ' - subtle , but potentially devastating , spelling mistakes in DNA .
Cells in the body contain machinery that ' reads ' lines of DNA and uses the information to create proteins .
However , a nonsense mutation sends out a rogue ' stop ' signal before a cell has finished making a protein .
The resulting half - finished protein is useless .
The drug PTC124 works by over - riding the nonsense mutation 's stop signal - and letting the cell complete its job .
If you purchased Metallica 's new album Death Magnetic , you may have noticed that it sounds like complete shit .
But do n't blame Metallica , producer Rick Rubin or mastering engineer Ted Jensen — the real culprit here is Apple and their dammed iPod .
While the " loudness wars " have been going on since the late ' 80s , the development of digital music and the iPod have heated things up .
Industry insiders claim that they feel the need to sacrifice dynamic range for increased volume because digital music makes it possible to squeeze all of the sound into a narrow , high - volume range .
This temptation is pressed further when you try and optimize sound for the iPod 's crappy lo-fi earbuds .
They are under the assumption that this drives sales .
It is clear to me that the record industry needs to shift their focus from quantity and put it squarely back on quality .
I mean — who are they trying to impress anyway ?
Do people really care who has the loudest album anymore ?
According to a recent WSJ article , even metal fans are complaining that things are getting out of hand .
Do you agree ?

Security experts reckon the latest technology can detect hostile intentions before something bad happens .
Unless it is perfect , though , that may be bad in itself
MONITORING surveillance cameras is tedious work .
Even if you are concentrating , identifying suspicious behaviour is hard .
Suppose a nondescript man descends to a subway platform several times over the course of a few days without getting on a train .
Is that suspicious ?
Possibly .
Is the average security guard going to notice ?
Probably not .
A good example , then — if a fictional one — of why many people would like to develop intelligent computerised surveillance systems .
The perceived need for such systems is stimulating the development of devices that can both recognise people and objects and also detect suspicious behaviour .
Much of this technology remains , for the moment , in laboratories .
But Charles Cohen , the boss of Cybernet Systems , a firm based in Ann Arbor , Michigan , which is working for America 's Army Research Laboratory , says behaviour - recognition systems are getting good , and are already deployed at some security checkpoints .
Human gaits , for example , can provide a lot of information about people 's intentions .
At the American Army 's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland , a team of gait analysts and psychologists led by Frank Morelli study video , much of it conveniently posted on the internet by insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq .
They use special object - recognition software to lock onto particular features of a video recording ( a person 's knees or elbow joints , for example ) and follow them around .
Correlating those movements with consequences , such as the throwing of a bomb , allows them to develop computer models that link posture and consequence reasonably reliably .
The system can , for example , pick out a person in a crowd who is carrying a concealed package with the weight of a large explosives belt .
According to Mr Morelli , the army plans to deploy the system at military checkpoints , on vehicles and at embassy perimeters .
Guilty
Some intelligent surveillance systems are able to go beyond even this .
Instead of merely learning what a threat looks like , they can learn the context in which behaviour is probably threatening .
That people linger in places such as bus stops , for example , is normal .
Loitering in a stairwell , however , is a rarer occurrence that may warrant examination by human security staff ( so impatient lovers beware ) .
James Davis , a video - security expert at Ohio State University in Columbus , says such systems are already in use .
Dr Davis is developing one for America 's Air Force Research Laboratory .
It uses a network of cameras to track people identified as suspicious — for example , pedestrians who have left a package on the ground — as they walk through town .
As object - and motion - recognition technology improves , researchers are starting to focus on facial expressions and what they can reveal .
The Human Factors Division of America 's Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , for example , is running what it calls Project Hostile Intent .
This boasts a system that scrutinises fleeting “ micro- expressions ” , easily missed by human eyes .
Many flash for less than a tenth of a second and involve just a small portion of the face .
Terrorists are often trained to conceal emotions ; micro-expressions , however , are largely involuntary .
Even better , from the researchers ' point of view , conscious attempts to suppress facial expressions actually accentuate micro-expressions .
Sharla Rausch , the director of the Human Factors Division , refers to this somewhat disturbingly as “ micro- facial leakage ” .
There are about 40 micro-expressions .
The DHS 's officials refuse to describe them in detail , which is a bit daft , as they have been studied for years by civilian researchers .
But Paul Ekman , who was one of those researchers ( he retired from the University of California , San Francisco , in 2004 ) and who now advises the DHS and other intelligence and law - enforcement agencies in the United States and elsewhere , points out that signals which seem to reveal hostile intent change with context .
If many travellers in an airport - screening line are running late , telltales of anguish — raised cheeks and eyebrows , lowered lips and gaze — cause less concern .
Supporters of this sort of technology argue that it avoids controversial racial profiling : only behaviour is studied .
This is a sticky issue , however , because cultures — and races — express themselves differently .
Judee Burgoon , an expert on automated behaviour - recognition at the University of Arizona , Tucson , who conducts research for America 's Department of Defence , says systems should be improved with cultural input .
For example , passengers from repressive countries , who may already be under suspicion because of their origins , typically display extra anxiety ( often revealed by rigid body movements ) when near security officials .
That could result in a lot of false positives and consequent ill - will .
Dr Burgoon is upgrading her software , called Agent 99 , by fine - tuning the interpretations of body movements of people from about 15 cultures .
Another programme run by the Human Factors Division , Future Attributable Screening Technology , or FAST , is being developed as a complement to Project Hostile Intent .
An array of sensors , at a distance of a couple of metres , measures skin temperature , blood - flow patterns , perspiration , and heart and breathing rates .
In a series of tests , including a demonstration last month with 140 role - playing volunteers , the system detected about 80 % of those who had been asked to try to deceive it by being hostile or trying to smuggle a weapon through it .
A number of “ innocents ” , though , were snagged too .
The trial 's organisers are unwilling to go into detail , and are now playing down the significance of the testing statistics .
But FAST began just 16 months ago .
Bob Burns , the project 's leader , says its accuracy will improve next year thanks to extra sensors that can detect eye movements and body odours , both of which can provide further clues to emotional states .
Until proved innocent
That alarms some civil - libertarians .
FAST , they say , amounts to a forced medical examination , and hostile - intent systems in general smack of the “ pre-crime ” technology featured in Philip K. Dick 's short story “ The Minority Report ” and the film based on it .
An exaggeration , perhaps .
But the result of using these devices , according to Barry Steinhardt , the head of technology and liberty at the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington , DC , will inevitably be that too many innocents are entangled in intrusive questioning or worse with “ voodoo science ” security measures .
To the historically minded it smacks of polygraphs , the so - called lie-detectors that rely on measuring physiological correlates of stress .
Those have had a patchy and controversial history , fingering nervous innocents while acquitting practised liars .
Supporters of hostile - intent systems argue that the computers will not be taking over completely , and human security agents will always remain the final arbiters .
Try telling that , though , to an innocent traveller who was in too much of a hurry — or even a couple smooching in a stairwell .
The number of people losing their homes in California hit a record high of nearly 80,000 in the last three months , but a new state law appears to be dramatically slowing the foreclosure process -- at least for now .
Loan default notices , the first step toward foreclosure , fell to 94,240 for the three months that ended Sept. 30 .
That ’s down sharply from the record 121,673 for the previous quarter , according to research firm MDA DataQuick .
The big drop came in September , when a new state law took effect that blocks lenders from initiating foreclosure proceedings until 30 days after contacting the borrower or making “ due diligence ” efforts to do so .
Default notices sank to 14,995 in September , after averaging more than 40,000 for each of the five preceding months .

“ That new law virtually slammed the brakes on mortgage default filings , ” said Andrew LePage , a DataQuick analyst .
“ We do n’t know yet how many of those loans will get worked out versus just shifted to late this year or early next year . ”
State Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata ( D - Oakland ) introduced the bill after hearing numerous complaints from homeowners who said they had been unable to make contact with their lenders , or the firms servicing their loans , to avert foreclosure .
“ Once all this stuff exploded and you realized how these mortgages were sold , packaged and resold , it was no wonder that the homeowner was confused , ” he said .
“ There was n’t anybody to talk to about their condition . ”
Consumer advocates said they hoped the Perata bill would be more than a temporary brake on foreclosures .

“ Hopefully , the additional time will allow more win - win resolutions , where servicers and borrowers can figure out a modification that makes sense , is sustainable and provides some return for investors , ” said Kevin Stein , associate director of the California Reinvestment Coalition in San Francisco .
A mortgage lending group said another factor in the decline may be a new willingness on the part of lenders to renegotiate loans for struggling borrowers .
“ I think it ’s a sign of real progress , ” said Beth Mills , a spokeswoman for the California Bankers Assn .
“ We really have seen the lines of communication between lenders and borrowers improve , and we ’re hoping that leads to more people staying in their homes . ”
There are skeptics , though .
They say that the numbers are showing the end of just one wave of foreclosures , mostly from people who took out adjustable - rate mortgages in 2005 and 2006 that later reset at a higher rate that they could not afford .

With the economy slowing down and expectations of rising unemployment , a new wave of foreclosures could hit early next year .
“ I ’d be the first person to stand up and cheer , but I have to tell you it really is wishful thinking , ” said Rich Sharga , senior vice president of RealtyTrac , an Irvine housing research company .
RealtyTrac ’s latest nationwide numbers showed that 265,968 homes were in some state of foreclosure in September , up about 21 % from the same month a year earlier .
Sharga noted that other states saw a decline in foreclosure notices after adopting laws similar to California ’s , only to see a rebound .
Massachusetts started requiring a 90 - day notification in May .
Loan defaults dropped for three months before skyrocketing more than 400 % in September , he said .

But the difference now is that banks are feeling significant pressure , from both shareholders and regulators , to squeeze some value out of these bad loans , said Jeff Lazerson , president of online mortgage clearinghouse Mortgage Grader .
Lazerson recently returned from the Mortgage Bankers Assn.'s annual conference in San Francisco -- where protesters rushed a stage full of speakers at one point -- to say that he had noticed a significant change in tone .
“ I was as cynical as everyone else about what the lenders were doing , but now they really seem to understand just how ugly this is , ” Lazerson said .
“ Now we truly have the whole industry making this push to keep people in their houses . ”
According to DataQuick , 79,511 homes were lost to foreclosure in California for the three months that ended Sept. 30 , a 228 % increase over the same period a year earlier and the highest number since the company began tracking foreclosures in 1988 .

Chairwoman Sheila Bair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said the government was n’t doing enough to stem the rising tide .
“ We are falling behind , ” Bair said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee .
“ There has been some progress , but it ’s not been enough , and we need to act . ”
Bair said that one way to spur the process forward was to standardize protocols for mortgage refinancings , as the FDIC did in the case of IndyMac Bank , the collapsed Pasadena - based lender it took over this summer .
That would cut through some of the complications created by the fact that most mortgages have been packaged and sold as securities , and the investors in those securities may not want workouts to happen .

“ Through this week , IndyMac has mailed more than 15,000 loan modification proposals to borrowers .
More than 70 % have already responded to the initial mailings and . . . more than 3,500 borrowers to date have accepted the offers , and thousands more are being processed , ” Bair said .
“ The hope is that our mortgage relief program can be a model and a catalyst to spur loan modifications across the country . ”
Congress passed a $ 300 - billion foreclosure prevention measure over the summer that took effect Oct. 1 , but lawmakers have expressed concern that it may not be enough .
Members of Congress complained that the administration has been far more responsive to Wall Street ’s needs than to ordinary homeowners .
Since the subprime crisis emerged about 18 months ago , President Bush and his top advisors have relied on voluntary , industry - led programs to address the problem .
“ In the month of August , over 9,800 homes entered foreclosure every day , ” said Sen. Robert Menendez ( D - N.J. ) .
“ If this statistic was that 9,800 Wall Street jobs were being lost every day , we would have ended this a long time ago . ”

But others say there are signs of progress .
Bank of America Corp. , after acquiring mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp. , recently agreed to an $ 8.4 - billion , 12 - state legal settlement that required it to rework loans .
And some banks have simply realized that working out loans may help their balance sheets .
Downey Savings & Loan said in its quarterly report Wednesday that it was working aggressively to move people into better loans , modifying $ 1.4 billion worth of loans since the summer .
As a result , the company was able to exceed new capital requirements imposed by federal regulators .
Hope Now , an alliance of lenders , mortgage servicers and credit counselors , is expected to report this month another increase in the number of loan modifications .
So far , the group says it has prevented 2.3 million homes from going into foreclosure .

“ It ’s clear that servicers are month over month and quarter over quarter improving the number of loan workouts , ” said Faith Schwartz , Hope Now ’s executive director .
“ If this was n’t happening , you would see far more foreclosed homes in the market . ”

To anyone who really believed Barack Obama ’s candidacy represented “ hope ” and “ change , ” the selection of Joe Biden as his running mate should put that illusion to rest .
Antiwar activists point to Biden ’s vote in favor of authorizing Bush to go to war with Iraq , but even worse was his behavior in the run-up to the invasion .
Today he wails that he did n’t know , that nobody knew the truth about Iraq ’s alleged “ weapons of mass destruction , ” but it can not be said that Biden was all that eager to discover the truth , either .
As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee in 2002 , Biden was in a position to ensure that a real debate took place on the issue .
Yet , in the hearings held by his committee , not a single antiwar “ expert ” was called : all were spear - carriers for the War Party .
Biden was chosen for the number - two spot because he is thought to strengthen the Obama campaign in the area of foreign policy , where the candidate is considered weakest .
Biden is presented as a man of experience , and a foreign policy maven to boot .
However , it is precisely in the realm of foreign policy that Biden falls far short .
Biden supported the president ’s war policies , at least in terms of ends if not means , and he made that clear enough in a speech in the summer of 2005 :
“ Remember the $ 18.4 billion that Congress appropriated at the urgent request of the president of the United States in the fall of ’03 for which I helped floor - manage and took on the responsibility along with others to push hard because I believe there is a nexus between the reconstruction and the physical safety and possible success of our military in the region .
Just $ 6 billion of that $ 18.4 billion has been spent . ”
We are n’t spending enough money on Iraq , said Biden , and , by the way , we need more troops , not less .
Over and over again we heard from Biden  a favorite on the Sunday talk shows  that the president was n’t “ leveling with the American people ” and being honest about what it would take to “ win ” in Iraq .
Unlike Bush , Biden had  and has  a very clear idea of what “ victory ” in Iraq would have to mean : “ Success , as I define it , is leaving Iraq better than we found it . ”
Is it really possible for us to leave Iraq better than we found it after killing hundreds of thousands of Iraqis  and discovering that the rationale for the war was based on lies ?
As Americans began to grumble about the war , and some Democrats started talking about an immediate withdrawal , Biden stepped into the breach as the voice of maturity and responsibility :
“ Many Americans have already concluded that we cannot salvage Iraq .
We should bring all our forces home as soon as possible .
They include some of the most respected voices on military matters in this country , like Congressman Jack Murtha .
They ’re mindful of the terrible consequences from withdrawing .
But even worse , in their judgment , would be to leave Americans to fight  and to die  in Iraq with no strategy for success .
I share their frustration .
But I ’m not there yet .
I still believe we can preserve our fundamental security interests in Iraq as we begin to redeploy our forces . ”
The Democrats , claimed Biden , could carry out the policies of the War Party more responsibly , more efficiently , and with more dramatic flair :
“ As David Brooks reminded us in the New York Times yesterday , ‘ Franklin Roosevelt asked Americans to spread out maps before them and he described , step by step , what was going on in World War II , where the U.S. was winning and where it was losing .
Why ca n’t today ’s president do that ?
Why ca n’t he show that he is aware that his biggest problem is not in Iraq , it ’s on the home front ’ ? ”
Why ca n’t President Bush be more like FDR  you know , the president who lied us into war , as Clare Booth Luce famously remarked , yet did it with real finesse ?
He also put antiwar protesters on trial for “ sedition ” while rounding up “ enemy aliens ” ( mostly American citizens of Japanese descent ) , seizing their property , and putting them in concentration camps .
Is this really a tradition Biden would like to see revived ?
Biden has been one of the War Party ’s most reliable servants , endorsing as “ absolutely correct ” then - President Clinton ’s attack on hapless Yugoslavia  like Iraq , another example of a war in which the “ enemy ” represented no danger to the U.S. and whose crimes were vastly overstated .
This earned him the approbation of John McCain , who , on April 11 , 1999 , declared to Tim Russert on Meet the Press : “ We need Joe Biden for secretary of state . ”
An astounded Russert asked : “ Is that an offer by President McCain ? ” McCain replied : “ Absolutely ! ”
McCain was n’t joking , and his comments underscore the essential unity of Washington ’s bipartisan foreign policy consensus , which is firmly anchored in an interventionist outlook , a militarist mindset that assumes unlimited American power and a position of unchallenged preeminence .
Yet reality  economic reality  is setting in , and even the most stalwart advocates of America ’s role as the world ’s policeman are losing their pretensions .
Not , however , Sen. Biden , whose most recent noteworthy contribution to the Iraq war debate was a proposal to divide Iraq into three separate quasi - independent nations , one for each of the three main ethnic - religious factions .
The problem is , he did n’t bother consulting with the Iraqis before floating this idea , and the Iraqis were apoplectic .
Obama ’s claim that he ’s the harbinger of a new politics is , unfortunately , belied by his choice of a running mate .
A truly new politics , one that goes beyond the red -state / blue - state dichotomy that polarizes our politics between two false choices , would have at least seriously considered Sen.
Chuck Hagel , Republican of Nebraska , who has all but endorsed Obama and seemed to be in the running at some point .
Now that would ’ve been truly outside the box  but far too much to expect from the ossified party hacks who seem to have commandeered the Obama campaign , if not the candidate himself .
Hagel , for all of his faults , was and is vehemently against the Iraq war , and , what ’s more , had the balls to stand up to the warmongers in his own party .
A former Army infantry squad leader with a gruff persona and a personal history that rivals McCain ’s in its all - American machismo , Hagel as VP would ’ve sent seismic shudders through the GOP ’s base , already visibly cracking .
The “ new politics , ” it turns out , is pretty much the same as the old politics , of which Biden  a Washington insider for the past 35 years  is the exemplar .
The War Party is jazzed at this sign that Obama is n’t going to give them much trouble , especially when it comes to their latest project : demonizing Russia .
Just before winning the vice - presidential sweepstakes , Biden took a trip to Georgia and returned bloviating at top speed , sounding for all the world like John McCain .
As the Washington Post reported :
“ Some Democrats have been pleading with Obama to use McCain ’s tough response to the Russian invasion of Georgia to paint him as a trigger - happy interventionist who would risk bringing a war - weary nation into military conflict in regions where the United States has no interest .
“ For those Democrats , Biden ’s conclusions from his trip may be a disappointment .
“ Consultations with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili , Georgian Prime Minister Lado Gurgenidze , Georgian Parliamentary Speaker David Bakradze , and U.S. Ambassador to Georgia John Tefft left the Democratic senator seemingly as angry as McCain is .
“ ‘I left the country convinced that Russia ’s invasion of Georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in Europe since the end of communism .
The claims of Georgian atrocities that provided the pretext for Russia ’s invasion are rapidly being disproved by international observers , and the continuing presence of Russian forces in the country has severe implications for the broader region .
The war that began in Georgia is no longer about that country alone .
It has become a question of whether and how the West will stand up for the rights of free people throughout the region . ' ”
Georgian atrocities ?
Oh , never mind those !
A Georgian invasion ?
It never happened  just ask those “ international observers . ”
It ’s time to get on Russia ’s case .
It ’s time to start saber - rattling and spreading the conflict throughout the region .
That ’s what Biden , who poses as a foreign policy expert , wants U.S. policy to be , and what it will be if and when Obama gets in the White House .
No , he ’s not Cheney , but that does n’t mean he wo n’t be Cheney - esque .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
It ’s all too easy for Johnny - come- lately “ antiwar ” politicians and their cheering sections to come out against a wildly unpopular war , but where were they in 2002 , as the war drums were beating and it was downright dangerous to oppose the war plans of the current administration ?
Where was Joe Biden ?
I ’ll tell you where he was : he was on the Senate floor demanding the “ liberation ” of Iraq .
This just goes to show that the antiwar movement cannot put its trust in politicians : they ’ll sell us out every time .
I did have some hope in Obama , in the beginning , I ’ll admit it , but that has quickly dissipated into a sinking feeling that the War Party  already shifting away from a focus on Iraq , and taking up a new campaign to target Vladimir Putin ’s Russia  is way ahead of us on that front and has all its bases covered .
Yes , I know , it ’s depressing .
We all want change , especially when it comes to our war - crazed foreign policy , yet it does n’t at all look as though we ’re going to get it , come November , much to my regret .
So , what now ?
Well , we may not be able to influence the councils of power in Washington , but what we can do is build and maintain our own institutions and make our case directly to the American people and people worldwide .
Which is precisely what Antiwar.com is all about .
Speaking of which
We ’re past the second week of our summer fundraising campaign , and we still have n’t made our goal of $ 70,000 .
Now , by the standards of most nonprofit groups , that ’s not a lot to budget for an entire quarter .
That ’s what the War Party and its various foundations , think - tanks , and front groups spend on lunch every month .
It is , however , enough to enable us to do our job , which is keeping you , our readers and supporters , abreast of the latest developments on the war front .
From the War Party ’s latest scam to the most recent pack of lies being circulated as undiluted truth by the “ mainstream ” media , we keep you on top of the news  the real news , not the war propaganda being fed to you by complicit ( or just plain lazy ) “ reporters . ”
Without regard for partisan bias or political correctness in any form , we tell it like it is and let the chips fall where they may .
That ’s why Antiwar.com ’s continued existence is so important : because there is n’t anything else like this Web site .
No matter what your particular politics or views might be , Antiwar.com is the place to go to for foreign policy news and commentary .
Here you can read opinions from writers who span the political spectrum , from left to right , as well as news  a growing portion of which is reported and written by our staff  that you just ca n’t get anywhere else .
None of this comes free , even though you have free access to the site .
It takes money  not a lot , but some  to run this operation , and the truth of the matter is that we ca n’t do it without your help .
And we need your help today , right now , in fact , because this fundraising campaign , which seems endless , has to end , sooner or later , and it has to end in success .
Or else we wo n’t be around any longer .
It ’s as simple as that .
C’mon , we ’re almost there !
Help us make it over the top  because you know a world without Antiwar.com will be a darker , much more sinister place .
Light a candle to drive back the darkness .

Doing a startup is always tough ( been there , done that ) and the economic meltdown is n’t going to help ; well , unless you ’ve found a works - great - in - bad - times niche .
Every startup considers venture - capital investment .
For most Web startups , this is a lousy idea , and I think the current business climate makes it worse .
[ This is part of the Tough Times series . ]
VC Fear Primer · For my own introduction to things VC - related , see Bouncing Termsheets .
Others have covered the territory and written about it well : I recommend Joel Spolsky ’s Fixing Venture Capital , Mark Cuban ’s The Best Equity is Sweat Equity , and a bunch of pieces by Paul Graham ; I particularly like How to Fund a Startup and The Venture Capital Squeeze .
These days you can do a Web startup for almost no money and , within a few months , find out for real if anyone will pay for what you ’ve built .
So why on earth would you sell part of it before you find that out ?
I strongly believe that a Web startup ’s chance of success is significantly reduced by letting VCs into the picture .
And I think it ’ll get even worse .
In tough times , it ‘s hard for VCs to see how they ’re going to get their money back .
I bet every serious VC firm in the planet has been having come - to - Jesus meetings this last month or two , trying to figure out how to make it through .
They ’ll try all sorts of strategies , and I ’m pretty sure that one of them will be to get tougher with their investees ; they ’ll demand more equity , better liquidation preferences , more onerous ratchets , you name it .
Which means that a deal that was already bad is getting worse ; just do n’t go there .
excursus into the hidden complexities of something the rest of us mere mortals find merely trivial or not a recognisable pleasure at all .
Richard Dawkins , for example , reveals his guilty pleasure is ' computer programming ' : Yesterday 's Guardian weekend magazine included an odd filler - article which let a number of ' great brains ' let us in on their guilty pleasures .
Read it online here .
There was a healthy variety of intellectuals assembled , but I get the feeling that they either did not all get the point or else found it impossible not to turn a simple statement of their preferred leisure activity into a deep and meaningfulinto the hidden complexities of something the rest of us mere mortals find merely trivial or not a recognisable pleasure at all .
Richard , for example , reveals his guilty pleasure is ' computer programming ' :
I have now kicked the habit , but every so often the craving returns and I must thrust it down and away .
But whence the guilt ?
Is n't programming useful ?
In the right hands , yes .
But my projects ( inventing a word processor , machine translation from one programming language to another , inventing a programming language of my own ) could all be done better ( and were ) by professionals .
It was a classic addiction : prolonged frustration , occasionally rewarded by a briefly glowing fix of achievement .
It was that pernicious " just one more push to see what 's over the next mountain and then I 'll call it a day " syndrome .
It was a lonely vice , interfering with sleeping , eating , useful work and healthy human intercourse .
I 'm glad it 's over and I wo n't start up again .
Except ... perhaps one day , just a little ...
Such a wag , that Dawkins .
Others ( Stephen Pinker , say ) threaten to turn their chosen pleasure ( in his case , rock music ) into another domain for their particular intellectual efforts but eventually recognise how odd this would seem .
( Martha Nussbaum gives a nice account of why she loves baseball only slightly marred by a gratuitous reference to Marcus Aurelius . )
Popbitch disappoint our expectations if he feels the urge to point out the interesting syntactical and lexical quirks of pop lyrics ?
( Or , perhaps , rage at My question , reading this , was :
What are our expectations , as non-intellectuals , reading this ?
Would we be comforted if Professor X said she simply loved readingevery week ?
Or are we disappointed since we want to imagine her relaxing with some challenging Hungarian cinema ?
Do we want these people do have a life beyond their profession or do we think there should be no possibility of having sensibly compartmentalised bits of a person 's life ?
Does a linguist confirm orour expectations if he feels the urge to point out the interesting syntactical and lexical quirks of pop lyrics ?
( Or , perhaps , rage at the confusion of two similar verbs ...)
I hope we do n't insist that these pleasures should be guilty ( a point one or two contributors do make ) or else our ' intellectuals ' are condemned to be less approachable and less relevant to the rest of us .

U.S. Republican presidential nominee Senator John McCain ( C ) is joined by former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney ( R ) and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman at an economic roundtable in New York September 24 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential nominee John McCain got an update on the Wall Street financial crisis from several economic experts on Wednesday and was cautious on whether he would vote for a $ 700 billion ( 377.5 billion pound ) bailout .
The Arizona senator said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat , was wrong to say on Tuesday that McCain planned to vote for the hotly debated rescue plan .
“ I did not say that , ” McCain told reporters .
Later , top McCain aide Mark Salter added : “ He has n’t said that to ( Treasury Secretary Henry ) Paulson or to Reid or to anybody else .
He has n’t said that to me . ”
McCain ’s comment came as he met with several economic experts and current and former corporate executives , such as Cisco CEO John Chambers , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney , former eBay CEO Meg Whitman and former Merrill Lynch CEO John Thain .
Neither McCain nor Democratic rival Barack Obama has said he would oppose the plan being negotiated with Congress , although both have been critical of it .
Both are jockeying for position to try to project to voters strong leadership during the crisis , six weeks before the November 4 election .
“ Most Americans feel very strongly that this is n’t their fault but it ’s Wall Street and Washington and the cosy insider relationships that have caused a great part of the problems , ” McCain said .
He said any package must have “ transparency , accountability , CEO responsibility and obviously be in the best interest of the people ( of ) this country who are going to pay $ 10,000 per household in order to take the necessary measures to restore our confidence . ”
While Obama was in Florida getting prepared for his first debate with McCain on Friday in Mississippi , McCain was engaged in a round of meetings with foreign leaders in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly .
The list included a joint session with the presidents of Georgia and Ukraine , both of whom are concerned about Russia after Moscow ’s invasion of Georgia last month .
He was also to meet Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .
For my first post , I figure I ’ll come in with a bang .
I ’ll start by going straight for the jugular of the concept of government , and point out why government - at least no contemporary , existing government - cannot possibly be construed as good , in any sense of the word .
I aim to showcase and even use the supposed “ logic ” of government in order to make a refutation .
From the Social Contract to the Hobbesian Theory of Human Nature to Utilitarian justifications , I will knock each one down and expose it for the veil of force and violence that it is .
The Social Contract
Quite possibly the most prevalent of the arguments in favor of the government , it can basically be broken down to the idea that those who reside within a specific area and use specific services are implicitly agreeing to a “ Contract ” between the user and the government / state .
The contract exists sui generis , and cannot be voided by any party barring that of the government / state ( although this act is highly unlikely , if not impossible ) .
While also being the most common , it is admittedly the trickiest .
On the face of it , it seems almost legitimate - you choose to live in a certain area and you do use certain services provided , so by default , you must be consenting .
However , the reasoning of this is n’t all that solid when it comes down to it .
For one , you ’re left with the fact that you ca n’t actually go to another service provider to receive the services which government has an effective monopoly over .
The usual response to this objection is that you DO use the services , and you ARE living within their territorial limits ( you always have the option to move , they say ) , thus you are consenting .
However , the mere fact that you do use services is not consent to the relationship between the individual and the government ; by this very logic , if a slave eats a meal from his master or does not run away , he is consenting to the relationship between him an the master .
Most importantly , it begs the question of who is more entitled to your property - you , or the government ?
An extension of this argument for the justification of the social contract is that since it is agreed upon through a democratic process , it is a valid contract .
At this point , we have essentially fallen to the point of unilaterally forcing the will of one or many upon others .
Using the same logic , if nine men vote to rape a woman , the relationship between the nine men and one woman has become legitimate .
Ultimately , the act of the vote has become nothing more then glorified and institutionalized gang rape .
Moreover , the act of voting does nothing to actually change the system if you inherently disagree with the very system itself - you cannot vote to opt out , so it really ca n’t be said that you have a choice to opt out .
With this all established , we can actually conclude that the social contract is not in fact a contract as we know it - it is unilateral and implicit , and most strangely , applies only to geography .
Now , some of you may be thinking “ Well , what ’s wrong with this ” ?
Well , plenty .
If we ’re to accept that a contract can be unilateral , implicit , and geographic , could I not create one as well for those living within a 10 mile radius of me ?
Imagine if I sent out letters to each resident within a 10 mile radius from my home asking for them to choose between two brands of refrigerators .
They must choose one or the other , and if they do n’t choose , they get what the majority picks .
With it , I enclose the bill of $ 900 , and the additional statement that if they refuse to pay , legal action will be taken , or they have the option to move elsewhere .
When people inevitably refuse to pay ( which they would ) , I could take the claim to court and sue for a breach of contract .
Invariably , I would be laughed out of the court and my case would be relegated to the “ News of the Weird ” and “ Uncle John ’s Bathroom Reader ” .
However , I ’ve fulfilled all of the required steps for establishing a social contract - it is unilateral , it is implicit , and it is geographic .
Thus , by the very act of rejecting my case , the government courts would invariably be rejecting the system by which they claim legitimate authority , and completely negate whatever authority they actually do claim to have .
The Argument From Human Nature ( Hobbesian State of Nature )
In my experience , this seems to either be the second most used argument in defense of the State , or as a fall back when the holes and ultimate logical incoherency of the Social Contract are revealed .
For those of you who have n’t heard of the concept of the “ Hobbesian State of Nature ” , you ’ve most certainly heard of or even thought of the concept - that humans are naturally in a state of “ war against all ” ; that is , if unchecked , humans are rampantly violent and vicious .
This of course acts as a justification for the existence of government , which claims to exist as a means to mitigate the potential harm that would be done by otherwise evil humans .
Unlike the Social Contract , the problems with this are easier to identify , the most obvious being that it completely contradicts itself .
You see , in order to believe that humans are naturally inclined towards a war against all as a matter of our inherent nature , we would have to accept that the identification of the problem and the subsequent creation of government would have been impossible , because we never would have had the moral and intellectual fortitude to create such an institution with such a goal in the first place .
The entire idea that humans are inherently inclined to take advantage of each other would mean that government itself is but an extension of this evil which they seek to mitigate !
For those of you who are not picking up what I am putting down , let me spell it out - the very fact that government or any other organization exists is proof enough to debunk this claim .
Institutions like the Red Cross , Direct Relief , The Center for the Advancement of Health or other such organizations would not exist .
Our natures as cruel and violent beings would interfere with our establishing of such institutions , to the point where we would quite “ naturally ” still be at odds with each other , always seeking to take advantage .
But for a moment , let us look past this and see what else we can infer and observe from this argument - we ’re still left with the supposed “ fact ” that people are all genuinely bad .
Well , if this were so , why do we have such anomalies like Mother Theresa , Martin Luther King , Jr. , and Gandhi ?
According to this theory , they should n’t even exist .
Moreover , consider the actual implications of what is being advised - that stupid , evil , terrible people should be in charge of stupid , evil , terrible people !
So we ’ve gone from trying to create an institution that protects people from their own barbarity to giving more power to those very people !
In a sense , we ’ve taken one step forward , and an entire lifetimes worth of walking back .
To that end , the mere act of becoming part of government does not magically endow one with superior moral faculties .
To drive home the point further , let me quote Frederic Bastiat :
“ If the natural tendencies of mankind are so bad that it is not safe to permit people to be free , how is it that the tendencies of these organizers are always good ?
Do not the legislators and their appointed agents also belong to the human race ?
Or do they believe that they themselves are made of a finer clay than the rest of mankind ? ”
The very idea that government should be made of people who are naturally bad to “ control ” those who are naturally bad is simply a recipe for disaster , if not just plain absurd and nonsensical .
To draw an analogy , we ’d be creating a prison like institution , and then handing over the keys to the very prisoners we ’re trying to keep locked up !
Now let us , for the sake of argument , suppose the very opposite of the Hobbesian State - that everyone is naturally good .
Of course , the absurdity of the idea that humanity is inherently inclined towards good or evil by nature not withstanding , we ’re left to wonder “ why do we need government if everyone is good ?
Why must we be forced to participate ? ” , to which the answer is a deafening roar of silence ( whether this be due to the admitted absurdity of the question , or the fact that it reveals the logical flaws of the opposing argument , I do n’t know ) .
But the point remains - if people are all good , there is no necessity for government , and any government would function simply as a means of putting people into power when they need not be there in the first place - while acting wholly contradictory to the nature of humans .
With this revealed , it would be far more accurate to say that people are not inclined towards good or evil by way of nature , but that people have the propensity to act on both concepts .
With this established , it would not make sense to keep a government that only functions to keep “ bad people in line ” , when it does nothing to distinguish between “ bad ” and “ good ” people , as all are held to the same violent and vicious creed .
To this end , government acts as no more then a blind distributor of punishment , targeting both the good and bad without actually distinguishing between the two , while at the same time claiming to target only “ bad ” people .
The Utilitarian Justification for Government
Finally , we ’re left with the Utilitarian justification for government - that government functions as a tool to secure the most good for the most people .
The reasoning cannot be more plain - would n’t it be good to secure the most good for the most people ?
But , like the aforementioned justifications , the reasoning is still inadequate .
How are we to define what is “ good ” ?
Different people invariably have different opinions as to what is and is n’t “ good ” .
Your next door neighbor may say “ Abortions are great !
Free abortions for whoever needs ’ em ! ” , but you do n’t quite see eye to eye with him on this .
Who is to say who is more “ good ” between you two though ?
Surely , your neighbor feels he is good , but so do you .
Now apply this to people on your bloc- it becomes more complicated .
Then apply it to everyone in your town .
State .
Region .
Nation .
Planet .
How can we possibly figure out what is good with such diverse opinions across such a diverse spectrum of issues ?
It would be literally impossible to calculate and know all persons opinions at all times .
But let ’s assume for a moment that we can all actually agree on what is good .
We all agree that the issue of poverty should be solved .
But that leaves us with the issue of “ well , how do we solve it ” ?
Like the same problem before , it ’d be difficult to get anyone to agree with how one would go about solving such an issue .
Not everyone can agree - and again , we ’re faced with the aforementioned calculation problem .
Now forget all that - let ’s say we know what is good , and we can all agree on how to fix it !
Yes , we all know how to fix our problems - except for one very specific problem .
The problem that in all cases of social and economic planning , it has always ended in disaster and led to an atrocious abrogation of individual rights .
Almost naturally , the defenders of the utilitarian perspective will say that this is an unfortuate result of being secured happiness - but this is nonsensical .
It would be like myself shouting in your face “ I do n’t exist ” , when in fact , I clearly do .
Put simply , it ’s a performative contradiction , in that one must advocate and commit evil in order to do “ good ” , but by that point , what good you have “ secured ” has been at great expense and effectively nullified .
All of this notwithstanding , you still do have to deal with the realities of the fact that people will not agree on everything , and eventually it will come down to the use of naked force in order to achieve the desired “ good ” .
And so , I ’ve demonstrated why it is impossible for “ good government ” to exist , soundly rejecting their claims to legitimacy using the more prevalent arguments .
Government , good readers , cannot be good .
The methodology by which it claims validity is inconsistent , and incomplete to a degree that it ca n’t be helped but to call it crippling .
I welcome comments and critiques , and beg forgiveness for anything I ’ve missed - but I ’ll still be happy to address any messages directed my way .

Once the weather starts becoming colder and the leaves start to fall , a few people think it is time to put away the gardening tools and wait for the following spring to start working on their garden again .
But this is not true .
Winter is a very important time to keep your garden 's health and ensure yourself a good harvest for the following year .
You may think that might take to long to organize your garden .
In fact it takes less than one day to set up your garden for the approaching wintertime .
As soon as the temperatures during night drop to below seven degrees Celsius for more than four days in a row , or frost is forecasted for your area , you know it is time to start preparing your garden .
You should start with evaluating your garden design , find out which plants did do well in the past season , and which plants did not do well .
Fall is a good time to make up your mind which plants will stay in you garden next year , and which ones should go .
It is also a good time to choose which new plants you want to grow to make your garden more colorful and healthy next year .
Be sure just to plant the sturdier plants during autumn , that will be able to resist the wintertime .
Some plants that will do good being planted in fall are : rudbeckia , Aster Novi- belgii , Anemone Japonica , panicle hyandea , endive , escarole , and Brussels sprouts .
You will be able to find all of these and more in horticulture magazines or in your local nursery .
Once done with it you should start with neatening your garden .
Begin by pulling out weeds that may have popped up and raking fallen leaves .
Weeds and rotten leaves can carry insects and diseases that might be harmful to your garden .
Also you should free your garden of passed annual plants and harvest your veggies and other plants that will not be able to resist the winter weather .
Now that the leaves will be off your trees , you will be able to see the rotten branches .
Cutting back the unwanted branches from your trees is n't essential to your gardens health , but it can assist afterwards by not falling branches on your plants as well as not blocking too much of the sun .
If you have more immature trees you should think about wrapping them and supporting them with posts to help them come through the winter wind and cold .
Arranging mulch over your garden for the wintertime can be a helpful way to protect plants from sudden temperature changes and heavy snow .
For mulch you can use about 10 centimeter of shredded bark , pine tree needles , or a variety of other materials .
But you have to be careful not to mulch too early as some insects can still be alive and they will be able to take shelter in it for the winter .
As soon as you are finished with your gardening tools you should clean them properly and store them in a safe place where they wo n't get rusty and you know where to find them in next year .
Also , before winter comes you should set out slug deterrent , as slugs are one of the worst bugs to have in your garden .
And if you have a pond in your garden , do n't forget to take out any fish that you have in them and bring them inside .
There is nothing worse than a fish frozen in a block of ice .
The U.S.S. Intrepid made it back up the Hudson to Pier 86 on the West Side today .
The aircraft carrier underwent a $ 120 million refurbishing over the past two years and is headed back to serve as the Intrepid Sea , Air , & Space Museum .
A little history from its press materials : " One of the most distinguished war ships in naval history , the USS Intrepid was first launched in 1943 during World War II , then aided in NASA spacecraft recovery and later served in Vietnam .
In 1976 , the USS Intrepid was decommissioned and established as a museum ship by Zachary Fisher and the Intrepid Museum Foundation .
The Intrepid Sea , Air & Space Museum officially opened in New York City in 1982 . "
The museum will be back open on November 8 .

About Death Magnetic :
" ... A Technical error in recording from the master ....
It will not sound like this on the album " - Benjamin on behalf of Mission Metallica after the release of poor quality versions of the first single , The Day That Never Comes .
Mission Metallica & Warner Brothers lied to the public to ensure that they did n't lose album pre-orders !
After the album was released , this same " technical error " became " An exciting sound that people are responding to " - Cliff Burnstein , Q - Prime , after the album release .
Death Magnetic is a fantastic effort from Metallica , however many of us are disappointed by the poor audio quality present on the album .

According to Fortune , the Copyright Royalty Board in Washington D.C. is expected to rule on Thursday about a request by the National Music Publishers '
Association to increase royalty rates for downloads from online music stores such as iTunes .
The request asks for an increase in rates from 9 cents to 15 cents a track .

Understandably , Apple is opposed to the rate increase and , in a statement submitted to the board , even suggested that Apple might close iTunes altogether :
" If the [ iTunes music store ] was forced to absorb any increase in the ... royalty rate , the result would be to significantly increase the likelihood of the store operating at a financial loss - which is no alternative at all , " Cue wrote .
" Apple has repeatedly made it clear that it is in this business to make money , and most likely would not continue to operate [ the iTunes music store ] if it were no longer possible to do so profitably . "
Apple claims that the market would not accept an increase in the per-track price and that overall sales would decrease .
The Fortune article writer doubts that Apple would take such drastic measures as closing the iTunes Store as Apple has used it to leverage hardware sales of iPods and now iPhones .
Why Are We Such Ready " Buyers " of Propaganda , Pandering and Posturing ?
( September 5 , 2008 )
Were we as a nation always such suckers for the 3
Ps of our current economy , Propaganda , Pandering and Posturing ?
That can not be answered definitively , but the case can certainly be made that we have sunk to practically demanding the 3
Ps over " inconvenient " reality .
For exhibit
One , let 's turn to our national medical / healthcare ( a.k.a. " sickcare " ) on which we spend some $ 2.6 trillion , or almost 20 % of our GDP : Chronic Disease Battle Requires Better Tools ( BENJAMIN BREWER , M.D. , wsj.com )
The lab results did n't look good .
My 57 - year - old patient 's blood sugar was high .
He was obese and already on cholesterol medication .
My diagnosis was metabolic syndrome , an assortment of risk factors that is often a precursor to heart disease and diabetes .
His was the third case I 'd come across that week .
The chronic disease epidemic is upon us .
Patients with health problems are younger and fatter .
I had to buy a heavy - duty scale last year to replace the one I started in practice with a decade ago .
I have more obese patients now and needed something accurate up to 400 lbs .
When I was growing up , nearly half the kids in this country walked or rode their bikes to school .
By the early part of this decade , the figure had dropped to about 15 % .
Meanwhile , the proportion of kids who are seriously overweight has climbed , with 16 % of kids in the 95th percentile or higher on a measure of body mass , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Certainly there is more we can do to help ourselves .
We can be active with our kids .
We can exercise more and eat less .
The biggest challenge in primary - care medicine is dealing with the complications of obesity , diabetes and hypertension .
The current financial disincentives to providing proper care for chronic disease are daunting , and the waste created by ignoring the problem is growing as the population ages .
Given the above conditions , you might expect a national outcry for a healthier lifestyle and calls for more funding of basic public health education .
But no , instead all you hear are excuses : people do n't exercise because they do n't want to .
( There 's some circular reasoning for you . )
Exhortations and campaigns do n't work , etc .
So what we have " works " ?
According to the standard Propaganda , " we have the finest medical care system in the world . "
Heh .
According to the standard Pandering , it 's not the responsibility of the patient / citizen to take an interest in their own health ; poor thing , you 're a couch potato because you 're addicted to sugar - water , and it 's somebody else 's " fault , " hence you 're a " victim . "
Since when did everyone who refuses to lift a finger on their own behalf become a victim ?
This reminds me of the welfare recipient ( pre-welfare reform days ) who said she could n't get a job because " I 'm not a morning person . "
Hmm .
Ever heard of the afternoon shift ?
The Standard Posturing is that our bloated sickcare system is horrendously expensive because of all those tests and drugs and stuff .
Somehow the financial system behind the sickcare never gets mentioned .
Correspondent Mark R. is a physician , and I asked for his input on non-profit managed care .
Here is his eye - opening response :
My perspective on this discussion as a provider is the same as it is as a consumer of healthcare .
Namely , the financiers in our system have cajoled their way into a position of ultimate control .
You 've heard the aphorism " he who owns the gold makes the rules , " and so we have it in spades with healthcare insurers .
The consumer is squeezed with spiraling cost and spiraling frustration ; and the private physician is frustrated with tighter managed - care rules and shrinking profitability .
( I know of physicians in varied specialties who have left healthcare because of challenging finances including malpractice insurance premiums that are sky high . )
Frankly , we are chained to a system that keeps corporate profits growing for the financing arm of healthcare , lest the entire system collapse .
Dollars are drained to keep insurance company profits growing , year after year .
It has to end sometime , and hopefully we are n't all shocked into accepting the next financing scheme that diverts dollars away from the product itself .
The power to make this right in the future will probably come from both consumers and regulators ( politicians ) that demand a shift in emphasis away from the profitability of insurers / bankers .
So while our national health deteriorates and we spend / waste ever - larger sums on " healthcare , " the collective response is to settle back into the sofa and carp about " costs " rather than to wake up , take responsibility for our own health and start asking who 's making all the money off the $ 2.6 trillion cash - cow that is U.S. sickcare .
Exhibit Two , the Machinist 's strike against Boeing .
Boeing has been minting money during this decade of debt - based prosperity , and I can certainly understand the line workers ' anger over what they perceive as a sly sales - job contract offer .
Here are two reports , one from the Seattle newspaper and the second from the IAM negotiating team 's website : Strike has big risks for Boeing , union Contract 2008 Web Site 80 % Reject Offer , 87 % Vote to Strike ( IAM website )
Paid time off was another area Boeing was not interested in improving .
Despite members working over 3.37 million hours of overtime last year , Boeing does not think you deserve even one more hour of paid time off .
If during record profits and record backlogs , we cannot get Boeing to make improvements on these issues this time , when will we get these long overdue improvements ?
Another reason to strike : Respect .
Have you been ordered to attend meetings to hear the Company pitch its contract negotiations spin ?
Have you been pressured by managers to vote against a strike ?
Does Boeing really think you can be bullied into a bad agreement ?
Vote to strike to show the Company that you are the Fighting Machinists .
You will not succumb to pressure tactics .
The Union has filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board challenging Boeings one - on - one interrogation of union members .
Boeings disrespect and pressure tactics show how much they underestimate your intelligence and courage .
Read the proposed contract and its fine print for yourselves .
Decide what you think of the offer .
Ask yourself whether we will ever have another chance to improve job security .
Are takeaways in medical insurance really justified ?
Your Negotiating Team unanimously recommends rejection .
But however you vote on the contract , stand up for your rights and vote to strike .
It will send a clear message to the Company :
 You wont be intimidated or disrespected .
 You will not tolerate Boeing violating the law , AND
 It gives your negotiators options to get you a better offer .
After tomorrow , the price goes up and Boeing will have to pay .
It s Our Time This Time !
While I can understand the anger and the cheerleading -- it is , after all , the union 's job to rally the members -- I do wonder where the death of tourism , business travel and the entire airline industry fits into the union members ' thinking and demands .
If there is any industrial sector more vulnerable to Peak Oil and global recession / depression than the aircraft industry , none comes to mind ( autos , construction equipment and farm machinery are close behind ) .
Yes , the remaining airlines will be seeking more fuel - efficient aircraft , but with China poised to enter the commercial aircraft space , one would imagine Airbus and Boeing are wondering just how many of those hundreds of aircraft orders from insolvent airlines will still be on the books in a year or two .
In case nobody noticed , large commercial aircraft cost $ 100 - $ 300 million each and thus their purchase is financed .
Anyone notice what 's happening in the grand world of global finance ?
Is money tightening up a wee bit , and is risk being priced in a wee bit more ?
How much will a lender be willing to risk on a billion - dollar loan to a shaky airline in a shaky industry ?
If I were a union employee of Boeing , I too would be trying to line up job security .
But on the other hand , where is the recognition in these negotiations that if global tourism and business travel decline precipitously -- both are utterly discretionary -- then how many workers will Boeing need to build the aircraft which can actually be paid for ?
Our
Thai friend reports that tourism is off about 60 % in Thailand , and no , not the part plagued by Muslim rebels , the " safe " resort islands and coast on the east .
Corporate travel is being slashed as needless expense , and even worse , is now picking up the reputation of being a planet - destroying environmental nightmare .
Given these realities , I would n't bet on overtime or profit holding up in the coming era .
Undoubtedly , much of the national preference for Propaganda , Pandering , Posturing flows from fear : fear that we can't repair our own health , that we no longer have the discipline , that without pandering giveaways our lifestyle will crumble , and without posturing and propaganda then we'd have to face painful sacrifices and ugly realities .
The preference for fantasy , magical thinking and simplistic solutions are certainly fundamental to the human race -- I am as prone to wishful thinking as the next bloke -- as is fear of reality ( hey , getting older and poorer is simply not fun ) .
But the consequences of acting on magical thinking , fantasy and simplistic solutions ( i.e. , just take this pill and you wo n't have to do anything about those " difficult " lifestyle issues , just roll your debts over into this new loan , just borrow another $ trillion from the oil exporters and Chinese central bank , etc. ) are daunting : the problems only get worse .
A key part of our national mythology is the rugged individual taking on the world .
An individual who welcomes , swallows whole or even actively seeks as cover denial , Propaganda , Pandering and Posturing is a frightened individual .
" Rugged " lies somewhere on the other end of the spectrum from lame excuses and turning a blind eye to reality .

An excerpt from For My Daughter I believe she stayed with me out of kindness , and my admiration for her grew .
For kindness is everything piety is not ; where piety is all appearance , a brittle play - acting well - loved by treachery , kindness is spontaneous and true .
Piety is easily falsified , so evil never tires of exalting it , while kindness cannot be feigned , and so evil rejects it .
Piety serves self - pride , while kindness serves another .

SKCUBRATS !!
Man Allegedly Poisoned Like A Rat @ Starbucks !!
" Rat Poison " Allegedly On The Menu At Starbucks ( Skcubrats ) Coffee by Tom Modern tom_modern@hotmail.com to be released to the press ................. 10-12-2015 effective immediately I am basically Lucky to still be alive .
Below I characterize and catalog an incident of poisoning that I experienced at a Starbucks location in Manhattan ( 370 , 7th Ave. ) on 3-3-2011 .
I believe the foreign substance to have been RAT POISON .
I was sickened and suffered extreme Chronic Fatigue for one year afterwards .
I have not done much as to publicizing this until now .
But after I was victimized routinely at another Starbucks location by their sadistic employees for years ( and abused further by their Legal Team ) , I decided Enough is Enough .
Its time for their just desserts .
Please help me against these Bullies by furthering this story !!!!!!!!!!!!!
* Recently I met a young Brooklyn woman who told me a story about how she contracted an illness brought on by being fed rat poison by a malicious person .
She asked me what my initial symptoms were and they were the same .
A " tingling " sensation and " dizziness . "
* Starbucks spelled backwards is " Skcubrats . "
I visited a Starbucks Coffee store at 370 7th Ave ( at W 31st St. ) Manhattan at approx .
4:15 to 4:30 PM on March 3rd , 2011 .
I ordered a ' Tall Coffee ' and proceeded to the milk bar where I noticed a fidgety , even ' jumpy ' Caucasian female next to me .
She quickly moved aside then walked away .
' She sure is odd ...'
I thought to myself and began to pour whole milk into my coffee .
I then noticed some sort of dark material floating in the milk as it entered my cup .
I was at first confused , but then shrugged it off as probably coffee grounds .
When I was finished , I noticed what appeared to be some sort of black resin in the bottom of my cup .
The next morning , I screamed in horror as I lifted my head off o the pillow .
The whole world was spinning .
I could not seem to get up .
And so I tried sleeping off whatever it was , and got up about 2 pm that day .
I was dizzy and my balance was all off .
If I bent over to pick something up , I 'd almost fall over .
These symptoms continued for weeks and I suffered extreme Chronic Fatigue for one year afterward .
After repeated attempts to retrace my steps , I continually came back to the foreign matter I saw in my coffee that day and the strange woman next to me .
Whatever the substance was , it had come from the whole milk container and was not in the coffee .
The material also seemed to be in a flake - like form , unlike coffee grounds .
I should not have drank it , but it was just one of those things .
The experience left me with chronic fatigue and disorientation .
I believe the substance was some sort of poison , perhaps Rat Poison .
And I am not sure what I could still develop in the future because of it .
It has caused me to be very wary of public - use condiments ever since then .
Anyone can put anything into those public - use milk bottles .
At first , Starbucks Corporate said they were conducting an investigation and promised to keep me abreast of any developments .
I never heard anything , so I had to contact the company again and again and again .
On 4 - 11 - 11 , Starbucks informed that the case had been closed and they claimed that no other customers have come forward -?!
I voiced my opinion that this was unacceptable , and so the investigation was at that time reopened .
I informed Starbucks Corporate that they had a moral and legal responsibility to allow me to view the store video .
That I could identify the perpetrator .
What if she continues to this day to do similar things ?
They replied that I had to be a Police Agency to request that .
And so , Starbucks , this supposed " humane " company , would not let me view the video to pick the woman out .
I also saved proof of my contacting : The FBI , NYPD , City of New York , Congressman Michael Grimm , Police Commissioner Ray Kelly .
All of these contacts proved futile except for City of New York Health Department , which called the poisoning an " Isolated Incident . "
I consulted with Lawyers who all told me it was n't a strong enough case to pursue litigation .
Yet I could have represented myself and won .
But now the Statute of Limitations on Personal Injury are expired ( 3 years ) .
I have not publicized this until now , due to the fact that I was victimized for years by sick , sadistic employees of a Starbucks at a different location ( and abused further by their legal team ) .
So now I am bringing the incident to light .
Remember : anyone can put anything into one of those Starbucks milk bottles .
And who knows if next time it is n't you , or it is n't something fatal like with cyanide ( see 1980s Tylenol poisonings ) .
I am still alive and well only by Faith .
Please assist me in repaying these Bullies by Furthering this Frightening Story !!!

A smelly rotten - egg gas in farts controls blood pressure in mice , a new study finds .
The unpleasant aroma of the gas , called hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) , can be a little too familiar , as it is expelled by bacteria living in the human colon and eventually makes its way , well , out .
The new research found that cells lining mice ’s blood vessels naturally make the gas and this action can help keep the rodents ’ blood pressure low by relaxing the blood vessels to prevent hypertension ( high blood pressure ) .
This gas is “ no doubt ” produced in cells lining human blood vessels too , the researchers said .
“ Now that we know hydrogen sulfide ’s role in regulating blood pressure , it may be possible to design drug therapies that enhance its formation as an alternative to the current methods of treatment for hypertension , ” said Johns Hopkins neuroscientist Solomon H. Snyder , M.D. , a co-author of the study detailed in the Oct. 24th issue of the journal Science .
Snyder and his colleagues compared normal mice to mice that were missing a gene for an enzyme known as CSE , long suspected as being responsible for making hydrogen sulfide .
As they measured hydrogen sulfide levels taken from tissues of the CSE - deficient mice , the scientists found that the gas was depleted in the cardiovascular systems of the altered mice .
By contrast , normal mice had higher levels of the gas , thereby showing that hydrogen sulfide is naturally made by mammalian tissues using CSE .
Next , the mice were subjected to higher blood pressures comparable to serious hypertension in humans .
Scientists had them respond to a chemical called methacholine that relaxes normal blood vessels .
The blood vessels of the CSE - lacking mice hardly relaxed , indicating that hydrogen sulfide is a huge contender for regulating blood pressure .
Hydrogen sulfide is the most recently discovered member of a family of gasotransmitters , small molecules inside our bodies with important physiological functions .
This study is the first to reveal that the CSE enzyme that triggers hydrogen sulfide is activated itself in the same way as other enzymes when they trigger their respective gasotransmitter , such as a nitric oxide - forming enzyme that also regulates blood pressure , Dr. Snyder said .
Because gasotransmitters are common in mammals all over the evolutionary tree , these findings on the importance of hydrogen sulfide are thought to have broad applications to human diseases , such as diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases .
The research was supported by grants from the U.S. Public Health Service and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research as well as a Research Scientist Award .
There is nothing , nothing on this planet more boring than a communique from an international meeting .
The phone book is more interesting — at least there ’s an occasional funny or odd name .
But communiques are carefully vetted to make sure that not a single word ruffles anyone ’s feathers ( way back when , I witnessed a harsh dispute over whether the phrase “ nurturing the economic recovery ” could be included — did it suggest that the recovery was somehow immature or unable to take care of itself ? )
But today , I ’m on tenterhooks waiting for the G7 communique .
The Italians have already said they would n’t sign the draft , because it was too weak .
The tone and , possibly , the specifics of today ’s statement will provide a major clue as to whether the world ’s top economic powers are prepared to deal with the financial crisis , or will continue to drift .
Let ’s hope for a favorable surprise .
Update :
And here it is .
My initial take : it ’s written in code — and that ’s a bad thing .
For example , that phrase about “ Ensure that our banks and other major financial intermediaries , as needed , can raise capital from public as well as private sources ” sounds to me as if there was some tense negotiation over language that two warring parties could live with — one ( presumably the Brits ) wanting a British - type recapitalization , the other ( Paulson ? ) still hoping that the Warren Buffetts and Saudi princes of the world will come in and save the day .
That ’s not at all a good sign — and anyway , will investors be able to crack the code , or will they just see that the G7 statement was vague , and panic further ?
I think the finance ministers just failed a test , or at best got a C minus .
Update update : Paulson says he ’ll move ahead on recapitalization , but also seek private capital .
So the communique represents the United States arguing with itself , as well as with others .
Listening to Paulson :
Where are the guarantees ?
It ’s only a half - Gordon : not the whole British plan .
And while I generally despise body language / tone of voice stuff , I have to say that Paulson sounds terrified .
Have you seen the polls ?
He should be talking more about the economy !
Why is n’t his campaign working harder ?
If the Obama brain trust seems relatively serene compared with its seething base , it ’s because they live in the Electoral College world , where the presidential race only takes place in a third of the country .
They do n’t care about national polls  a concept as quaint as measuring one ’s wealth by caribou pelts .
They worry about the undecided vote in Minnesota and Ohio and run their TV ads ( about the economy ) in places like Colorado and Michigan and Florida .
If you live in California or New York or Texas , you do n’t really have much of a feel for their level of effort because as far as they ’re concerned , you ’ve already voted .

I ’m beginning to think we should have gone with Hillary Clinton .
Hillary now lives in a golden alternative universe .
As soon as the Democrats had actually nominated Obama , they decided that Clinton was by far the better candidate and that they had destroyed their chances by not choosing her .
This is the nature of the party .
If she had not been in the race , the Democrats would probably be bemoaning the fact that they had n’t stuck with John Edwards and nailed down the critical swing - state philanderer vote .
Obama seems to be disappearing from the news compared with Sarah Palin !
One of the great things about this campaign is that both sides are convinced they ’re going to lose .
Remember how nuts all the Obama people went when Hillary refused to concede ?
How suicidal the Republicans were when Obama was knocking them dead in Europe while McCain was tooling around in a golf cart with the president ’s father ?
We still have nearly two months to go .
The people who have n’t decided who they want to vote for by now are n’t going to make up their minds until the last minute .
Just chill for a few weeks until the debates start and let the Sarah Palin thing play itself out .
It ’s Halloween — a time of year when " scariest movie " lists haunt the internet like so many kernels of uneaten candy corn .
But , you ’ve seen The Exorcist , The Shining , Halloween and Rosemary ’s Baby .
So , Wired.com is offering up a quick list of titles you might not have shivered through — though we admit the more die - hard cinema nuts amongst our readers are difficult to surprise .
1 ) Curse of the Demon : Entitled Night of the Demon in the United Kingdom , this 1957 British supernatural thriller holds up surprisingly well as its surreal mix of witchcraft and moody settings seem a likely enough patch for the devil to dwell .
Yes , the demon in question looks to be a denizen of puppet hell , but make sure no one passes you any rune parchments if you do n’t want to come face to maw with this maniacal muppet .
2 ) Session 9 : A simple setup has a team of asbestos removers ( including Peter Mullan , Stephen Gevedon — the movie ’s screenwriter — and a million miles from CSI - Miami David Caruso ) tearing apart an abandoned insane asylum .
As one team member discovers abandoned recordings of a patient ’s evil second personality ( Simon ) , the others begin turning on each other as if the history of the building is feeding on them .
The body count climbs without cheap , excessive gore , and the film ’s final images and words ( " I live in the weak and the wounded " ) will stick with you for days .
3 ) Something Wicked This Way Comes : Yes , you can have a scary movie connected to Disney .
In fact , there was a time when Disney scared folks ( especially kids ) better than anybody in Hollywood — but we digress .
More creepy than terrifying , this Ray Bradbury story of a devilish circus tempting the souls of small town Americana is beautified by a dazzling performance by a young Jonathan Pryce as Mr. Dark .
The States had n’t seen much of Pryce when this film hit , and the fact that he held the screen with the legendary Jason Robards speaks for itself .
4 ) Dog Soldiers : British soldiers trapped in a cabin out in the woods and under attack by werewolves .
What more do you need to know ?
This is the funniest movie on our short list , but it packs plenty of visceral scares — in some cases , literally .
Certainly the most action - packed of the movies here , it looks to the Aliens model of monster movie terror .
And keep a look out for Sean Pertwee , son of Doctor Who No. 3 , Jon .
5 ) The Woman in Black : First a novel by Susan Hill , then a very successful and long - running ( in fact , still running ) London stage production , The Woman in Black and its vengeful Mrs. Drablow should find a way to the big screen some day .
But , a modest 1989 British TV production was a surprising success .
While the West End stage version literally causes people to scream aloud in their seats , the TV adaption packs enough of the story ’s gloomy mystery and unavoidable tragedy to make you stay off the moors .

But in general , people deal with cognitive dissonance — the clashing of conflicting thoughts — by eliminating one of the thoughts .
The notion that the toaster is desirable conflicts with the knowledge that you just passed it up , so you banish the notion .
The cognitive dissonance is gone ; you are smug .
Of course , when you see others engaging in this sort of rationalization , it can look silly or pathological , as if they have a desperate need to justify themselves or are cynically telling lies they could n’t possibly believe themselves .
But you do n’t expect to see such high - level mental contortions in 4 - year - olds or monkeys .
As the Yale researchers write , these results indicate either that monkeys and children have “ richer motivational complexity ” than we realize , or our ways of dealing with cognitive dissonance are “ mechanistically simpler than previously thought . ”
Another psychologist , Matthew D. Lieberman of the University of California , Los Angeles , suggests it ’s the latter .
“ If little children and primates show pretty much the same pattern you see in adults , it calls into question just how deliberate these rationalization processes are , ” he says .
“ We tend to think people have an explicit agenda to rewrite history to make themselves look right , but that ’s an outsider ’s perspective .
This experiment shows that there is n’t always much conscious thought going on . ”
The new results jibe with those of a dissonance experiment that Dr. Lieberman and colleagues did with amnesiacs , people with impaired short - term memories , who were asked to rank an assortment of paintings .
Then they chose among selected ones and ranked the whole group again .
By the second time they ranked the paintings , they could n’t consciously recall their earlier rankings or their choices , so they presumably did n’t have a psychic need to rewrite history .
Yet they showed as much new disdain for the paintings they ’d rejected as did a control group with normal memories .
Apparently , the rejections registered in some unconscious way , so that the amnesiacs rationalized their decisions even though they could n’t remember them .
The compulsion to justify decisions may seem irrational , and maybe petty , too , like the fox in Aesop ’s fable who stopped trying for the grapes and promptly told himself they were sour anyway .
But perhaps
Aesop did n’t appreciate the evolutionary utility of this behavior for humans as well as animals .
If it seems like Sarah Palin Day , that ’s because the McCain campaign decided to do the bulk of its news dumping during the holiday .
On top of her husband ’s DUI , her unmarried teen daughter ’s pregnancy and her own state trooper issues , we now know about this bizarre nugget : Sarah Palin and her husband , according to the group ’s chair , were once members of the Alaskan Independence Party , a political party that seeks a vote on Alaska withdrawing from the union .
Country first , indeed .
Time ’s Mark Halperin says lawyers and journos are flocking to Alaska to probe this new national figure , who , it now seems , may have missed out on a full vetting .
And they said being an atheist has no perks …
I recently received an offer from a Christian couple ( husband and wife ) in their 30s who would like me to spend the summer with them :
We would like you to consider , at no cost to you , spending the summer with us .
There are no strings attached ( with the exception of the open mind you agreed to in you auction ) and , should you decide , you may leave at any time .
If you have stayed , at the end of the summer , we will give you $ 10,000 .
Maybe that sounds like a scam .
But they actually seem sincere about this :
As far as what you would do …
We just want you to get to know our family and what our lives are really like .
Spend time with us , fellowship with us , see us in many different situations .
For example , since moving here 3 years ago , we have had a 4th of July party for the church , neighborhood and work .
So far , we have had great attendence ( ~70 ) .
It is important to us to do that because it brings together our friends from church and the neighborhood , including : Muslims , Jews , agnostics , other Christian denominations , other cultures and ideals .
People have seemed to really enjoy themselves .
We want you to experience our lives through things such as that .
Your schedule is your own ; this is a three month opportunity to find Truth .
We are open to any questions or comments that you have .
We do n’t claim to have all the answers , either .
We do think that we could shed some light on several of the points you brought up in your book .
Think of it as an “ immersion ” experience .
One of the things that struck us when reading your book , is that it seems as if you got small glimpses ( think speed - dating ) of many different things , mostly of the “ religion ” of Christianity .
We want you to see people with a real relationship with Jesus Christ ( think exclusively dating ) .
Our church is small , but the people there are sincere , a rare quality inside or outside the religous world .
Their flaws , for that matter , our flaws , will surely be evident to you , but I believe that you will be able to see true Christianity .
We are not planning on telling people why you are here , so you can see them as they really are .
You , of course , can tell them if you wish .
I do n’t know if this is possible from my end ( * so * close to finishing grad school and my summer class would be my last one ) , so it could all be moot .
I suppose things could always be rearranged , though …
In any case , we ’ve exchanged a few emails and they seem to be really interested in this .
I ’m not sure if it would accomplish anything .
I have spent far more time with True Christians TM than I have inside a church — before and after the writing of the book .
And that has n’t changed my atheism in the least .
I do n’t think that being with a different group of True Christians TM will change that .
Though , this experiment does sound like something I ’d do …
I ’m not ready to say yes anytime soon .
( Lots of things would have to be worked out . )
What do you think ?

It ’s that time of year again .
College Halloween parties are coming up , and you will want to come up with an original costume idea .
Dressing up like an intoxicated Elvis ( or Britney Spears , for that matter ) is n’t funny anymore … if it ever was funny .
In order to be funny , costumes have to be original .
Originality comes from putting a lot of thought into the costume .
Sometimes , you can design your costume based on the people you will be attending parties with .
For example , you can dress up as one of your coworkers or as one of your fellow students ( in a respectful manner , of course ) , or as your boss or professor .
Also , some college parties ask you to wear costumes pertaining to a certain theme .
If not , here are some examples of funny costumes I found on the Web that are original , and in my opinion , hysterical :
A 1 Night Stand : Fabricate a night stand out of cardboard , paint some drawers on , apply handles , build a lamp to cover your head , and then paint the number " 1 " on the night stand .
Voila .
You are a one night stand .

Static Cling Costume : Dress in all black .
Tease your hair and apply hair spray so you get that 80 ’s ratted look ( like you stuck your finger in an electrical socket ) .
Attach socks , underwear and other clothing to your body with pins so it looks like you have a really bad case of static cling .

Cereal Killer : Build a cereal box out of a large cardboard box that you can place over most of your torso .
Then buy a large plastic knife , and paint some blood on your cereal box ( if you want ) .
This one will definitely make people think , but they ’ll laugh when they get it !

Piñata :
This is a costume that is not only funny , but allows your friends to have a bit of fun at your expense .
Dress up like a piñata by gluing or otherwise attaching colored strings , strips of colored paper and frilly fabrics to it .
My advice is to wear a lot of padding underneath your colorful suit .
Then , buy some foam bats and let your friends take a few swings .
You can even let candy fall out of your hands .

Construction Cone or Traffic Sign : A cone is probably easier to pull off .
Just fashion some heavy duty cardboard into a cone around you , and spray paint it orange .
Or , if you ’re really ambitious , create one of those obnoxious blinking traffic signs with some boards , paint , and lights that blink using batteries .
Paint " road closed " on the boards .
Then , at the party , you can place yourself wherever you ’d like in order to stop traffic !
If you want , partner up with a friend who dresses as a construction traffic director with a sign that says " STOP " on one side and " SLOW " on the other .

Gold Digger :
This is a good costume for someone who wants to dress up but still be funny .
Put on your slinkiest dress , paint your nails , overdo your makeup and hair , and wear really high heels .
The more gold colors and jewelry you wear , the better .
Then , carry a small shovel with a bucket of rocks ( or pieces of foam ) that you have spray painted gold .

Gang Green :
If there is a group of you going to the party together , here is a costume that is inexpensive and easy to do .
Everyone should dress in green , from head to toe .
Paint your faces green , and spray green color in your hair , if you want .
There you go : gangrene .

Jack - in - the - Box : Use a large cardboard box that you can fit inside .
Reinforce it with heavy - duty tape , and cut a hole in the top that is just big enough for you to jump out of .
Cut a hole in the bottom so you can walk .
On the top hole , place a piece of fabric that will cover you while you are inside the box .
Paint it as if it is a children ’s toy , and create a handle on the side that people can turn .
Then , dress up in a joker ’s costume .

Pin the Tail on the Donkey : Dress up all in brown , and if you can , design big hooves for shoes and gloves .
Wear big donkey ears .
Put a mane running from the top of your head down your back .
You can even put a fake saddle and bridle on .
Then , make a long tail out of yarn .
Go around and ask people if they would like to " pin the tail on the donkey . "
Make sure you have a good sense of humor for this one …more than likely one of your friends will call you some different names for " donkey . "

Dart Board :
Use large pieces of foam or cardboard to hang on the front and back of your torso .
Cover them with really strong Velcro .
Then paint dartboard rings and scoring numbers on the boards .
Hang them over you with some straps .
Darts should not be sharp !!!
Make darts using Velcro as well , so that when people throw them at you , the Velcro from the darts and the boards stick to each other .
I hope these ideas helped , or at least got your creative juices flowing .
If you have any more ideas , please add them below !
Good luck and happy Halloween !
Normally , the story of John McCain 's black family -- the ones who are planning to vote for Barack Obama -- might elicit some modest interest in terms of what it says about the complexity of race relations in America .
But what 's been even more interesting has been how John McCain has responded to the story ever since it surfaced .
Initially , back when he first was doing the " Maverick " schtick in the 2000 primaries , he actually denied that the aristocratic Southerners from whom he was descended were slaveholders .
But it really became impossible for McCain to deny their existence after a 2000 report in Salon in the course of which reporters showed him photographs and birth records in person and he had to concede to their existence .
One account ,
In the South Florida Times , describes how McCain has handled the connection publicly and privately :
White and black members of the McCain family have met on the plantation several times over the last 15 years , but one invited guest has been conspicuously absent : Sen. John Sidney McCain .
“ Why he has n’t come is anybody ’s guess , ” said Charles McCain Jr. , 60 , a distant cousin of John McCain who is black .
“ I think the best I can come up with , is that he does n’t have time , or he has just distanced himself , or it does n’t mean that much to him . ”
Other relatives are not as generous .
Lillie McCain , 56 , another distant cousin of John McCain who is black , said the Republican presidential nominee is trying to hide his past , and refuses to accept the family ’s history .
“ After hearing him in 2000 claim his family never owned slaves , I sent him an email , ” she recalled .
“ I told him no matter how much he denies it , it will not make it untrue , and he should accept this and embrace it . ”
She said the senator never responded to her email .
In her CNN interview with Kyra Phillips , Lillie McCain discusses this further :
PHILLIPS : Do you think it could make a difference with regard to diversity issues , issues of race , if John McCain did participate ?
L. MCCAIN : I think it probably could .
It would give him an opportunity to know us .
I e-mailed him back in 2000 to remind him of his ties to Tiak , Mississippi .
I heard him say on I believe it was " Meet the Press , " that his ancestors owned no slaves .
Well , I certainly have carried the name McCain from the beginning of my whole life , and I 've known of the ties to John McCain and tried to get him to communicate with me about that , but he has been unwilling , at least , to date .
PHILLIPS : Well he found out in 2000 , to be fair to the senator there , and he did come forward and gave this quote -- " How the Tiak descendants have served their community and , by extension , to their country , is a testament to the power of family , love , compassion , and the human spirit . "
And then he added in the statement , " an example for all citizens . "
That sure is a warm , fuzzy little sentimental quote from the senator , and the fact that it really says nothing in reality says everything we need to know about John McCain .
Since the advent of the Southern Strategy under Nixon , the Republican Party has embraced its role as the Party of White Privilege .
John McCain has made a modest career out of making rumbling noises toward some of the uglier aspects of this legacy within the GOP , and he 's hoping that those rumbles will be enough to persuade moderate voters to back him .
However , the cold realities of the history of race relations in America -- dating back to those dark eons when black women held in slavery were routinely raped and impregnated by their white owners -- still hover like a dark cloud over whites ' vision of Golden Age America , the very vision that John McCain and Sarah Palin like to sell to their flocks like so much Coca - Cola .
So it 's perhaps not a surprise that , given the chance to banish that cloud by doing the human thing , the right thing , and embracing the black side of the McCain family , the Straight Talking Senator From Arizona chose essentially to run from them and hide .
Because acknowledging them not only was too painful , but might prove too harmful to his chances of success in a political party predicated on white privilege .
Moreover , this also fits what we know about his reflexive predisposition on civil - rights matters .
This is , after all , the guy who voted against a Martin Luther King holiday back in 1984 .
Yes , as the wingnuts already note , Obama 's maternal ancestors likely owned slaves , too .
But then , it seems doubtful that Obama would hesitate to embrace the ancestors of those slaveowners , either .
Running away from black family ties is not exactly a problem for Barack Obama .
But it is for John McCain .
Scientists use many techniques to study natural habitats , but they rarely listen to nature .
To some biologists , sounds are more than an aural accompaniment to field trips :
They convey information that traditional field surveys are hard - pressed to uncover .
Now scientists are using sounds to tap into the pulse of ecosystems and monitor their health .
" The microphone is one of the most important biological sensors ever invented , " said Michigan State University ecologist Stuart Gage .
" It just has n’t been properly used for interpreting ecosystem dynamics . "
Scientists already study the sounds of individual animals , but such research focuses on particular species rather than entire ecosystems .
By analyzing recordings made by microphones arrayed throughout habitats , Gage and other bioacousticians are looking for new representations of species balances and relationships .
The techniques and methods are still being refined , but audio tools could make it possible to easily conduct otherwise - difficult long - term studies of biodiversity , animal behavior , human environmental impacts and the effects of climate change on nature .
" I want to interpret the quality and character of the ecosystem , " said
Gage .
" I ’m not particularly interested in species .
I ’m interested in the biodiversity , species timing , habitat disturbance and communications issues .
It ’s using sound as a metric to look at ecosystem dynamics . "
Gage started his career as an ornithologist trained to identify birdcalls .
Eventually he realized that bird song was only a part of nature ’s symphony .
" Acoustics were sending me a signal about the health of the environment and the type of ecosystem I was in , " he said .
Sometimes these signals are otherwise hidden .
In 1988 , Gage and bioacoustics pioneer Bernie Krause — father of the term " biophony " and originator of the niche hypothesis , according to which nature ’s audio spectrum is finely divided between species — recorded a patch of
Sierra forest scheduled to be selectively logged .
" We were told it would have no impact on organisms , " said Krause .
" To our eye and to the camera , it looks like it did n’t . "
But when they went back the next year and in 2003 , " the sound had changed .
It ’s depressing to hear how little there is now .
The diversity and density was gone , and it ’s still gone today . "
Gage and his students are now deploying solar - powered microphones in plots throughout the Muskegon
River watershed .
The results are sent wirelessly to a central computer , synchronized and analyzed .
" Rather than going into the field and using traditional , labor - intensive survey methods , you can deploy these in a fixed grid for a long time , " said Bryan Pijanowski , a Purdue University forestry professor and Gage ’s former student .
Gage and Pijanowski use the diversity of audio patterns as a surrogate for biodiversity , or the richness of life in an ecosystem — a vital indicator of environmental health , but difficult to measure , requiring meticulous and necessarily imperfect visual observations .
" We have very few long - term studies on these sorts of things , very little information , especially across large spatial scales , " said
Pijanowski .
" We ’ve missed this whole dimension that we could measure that makes it easier to look at and monitor biodiversity across landscapes and long periods of time . "
Even at smaller geographical and chronological scales , this is difficult .
Almo Farina , an ecologist at Italy ’s Urbino University , uses sound recordings to study birds ; traditional methods , he said , " are strongly biased by the human capacity to recognize birds , to maintain attention for a long time , and by human intrusion . "
Farina ’s own recordings — made by a grid of field sensors and a recorder trawled from a cable car across an Appenine mountainside — let him explore the relation between bird activities and the surrounding soundscape .
" I want to understand how acoustic activity in one site is connected with the song activity of another site , " he said .
" Some birds sing only after another species becomes silent , and vice versa .
When you find acoustic overlap , this means that the community could be affected by some habitat disturbance . "
Nature Conservancy ecologist Patrick Gonzalez said that bioacoustics sounds promising , though " it would require extensive field surveys to validate . "
" What we ’re talking about here is so new and out of the box that most ecologists look at me and say , ‘ Huh ? ’ " said Pijanowski .
Some ecologists want to construct a nationwide natural audio surveillance system , said Pijanowski .
He ’s already deployed sensors around his home in Tippecanoe County , Indiana .
" It ’s a canary in a cage tool , " he said .
" Those signal potential disturbances that might alert a natural resource manager .
They could monitor ecosystems in real - time . "

When questioned about the nuts and bolts of governing , Ms. Palin tended to avoid specifics and instead fell back on her core values : a broadly conservative philosophy and a can - do spirit .
“ My attitude and my approaches towards dealing with the complexities of health care issues , ” she said in an AARP debate in October 2006 , “ is a respectful and responsible approach , and it ’s a positive approach .
I do n’t believe that the sky is falling here in Alaska . ”
These patterns could help explain why the McCain campaign negotiated for less time for discussion in her debate Thursday with Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware than the presidential candidates had in their debate last week .
Ms. Palin was not always at her best when questioned by her opponents in the governor ’s race .
In the AARP debate , Mr. Knowles and Andrew Halcro , an independent , double - teamed her to press her about how she would pay for health care .
In response to Mr. Knowles , she mentioned “ certificates of need ” and said they had been inflexible , “ creating an environment where a lot of folks are lacking the receiving of their health care that is needed in some of the areas , especially in some of our larger markets . ”
She added , “ The State of Alaska needs to be looking specifically at that inflexibility that exists today in order to fill some of the market needs that are out there in Alaska in our larger markets . ”
She then added , “ I ca n’t tell you how much that will reduce monetarily our health care costs , but competition makes everyone better , it makes us work harder , it does allow reduction in costs , so addressing that is going to be a priority . ”
Mr. Knowles was nonplussed , saying that he did not understand her answer and that Ms. Palin had missed the point .
" At first they were just two bumps , but they started to grow quickly , and after a month there were two wings , " said one cat 's owner , who was only identified as Feng .
" We need this to be clean and to be quick , " Paulson said in an interview with the US ABC network .
He told Fox television America had been " humbled , humbled " by allowing its economy to slide into chaos .
Obama was campaigning in North Carolina after declaring a day earlier McCain was in a panic , realising he and his Republican party were philosophically responsible for the near meltdown of the US financial system .
The Arizona senator , a 26 - year veteran of Congress , shot back that his first - term Illinois Senate colleague was resorting to scare tactics .
But McCain faces the daunting task of trying to square his long history of advocating corporate and financial deregulation - the sort of loose controls many blame for the turmoil on Wall Street .
Obama seized on that during a campaign appearance at Bethune - Cookman University in Florida .
" There 's only one candidate who 's called himself ' fundamentally a deregulator ' when deregulation is part of the problem , " Obama said .
McCain now says more controls are needed to prevent a repeat of the turmoil that sent the stock market plunging , as he tries to recover from a series of gaffes this week , starting with his assessment on Monday that US economic fundamentals were strong .
National polls indicate McCain 's edge in the US presidential race has slipped since the market upheaval .
The latest Gallup Poll daily tracking survey also showed Obama ahead , with 50 per cent to McCain 's 44 per cent .
Last Sunday , a day before stocks took a dive on Wall Street , McCain and Obama were in a statistical dead heat , with McCain 's 47 per cent against Obama 's 45 per cent .
Both candidates are busy preparing for their first nationally televised debate on Friday at the University of Mississippi , which offers McCain a chance to reverse his recent slide in the polls .
Obama has put McCain on the defensive by targeting some states that have been easy wins for Republicans in recent presidential elections .
McCain 's political director said yesterday the Republican nominee is increasing staff levels in North Carolina to defend a state that has not gone Democratic for more than three decades .
Obama 's rise coincided not only with the financial meltdown but with his own more aggressive campaign stance .
" His solution was to blame me for it , " Obama said , referring to the economic crisis .
" I would say Senator McCain is a little panicked . "
The Democrat also criticised McCain 's ties to lobbyists and his support for partial privatisation of the Social Security pension system , and noted McCain wrote in a trade publication that opening the health insurance market to more vigorous competition nationwide , as was done with the banking industry , would provide more choices .
" So let me get this straight , " Obama said .
" He wants to run health care like they 've been running Wall Street .
Well , Senator , I know some folks on Main Street who are n't going to think that 's a good idea . "
But Obama 's characterisation was a politically charged oversimplification of McCain 's article for the American Academy of Actuaries .
In the article , McCain wrote that people should be allowed to buy health insurance across state lines .
Obama 's comments came as Bush defended a proposed multibillion - dollar financial bailout designed to rescue struggling markets .
The bailout will allow the government to buy $ US700 billion in toxic mortgages now held by financial institutions and would be the biggest government bailout since the Great Depression .
The White House had hoped for a deal with Congress by the time markets opened tomorrow , but Paulson 's remarks suggested it could take more time .
The market fell steeply last Monday in response to the bankruptcy of storied Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers , the decision of a second powerful investment house Merrill Lynch to sell itself at a fire - sale price , and the Federal Reserve 's intervention in insurance company American International Group Inc .
But Wall Street enjoyed a huge rally on Friday after the government said it was creating a plan to rescue troubled US banks from their souring debts .
If such a plan is put in place , it could help alleviate the uncertainty that has been sending the markets into tumult over the past week .
McCain had a campaign stop slated in Baltimore , Maryland , today , while Alaska governor Sarah Palin , his vice - presidential running mate , was to hold a rally in Florida .

Good news from the trail :
He just snatched the microphone out the hands of a woman who began her question with , " I 'm scared of Barack Obama ... he 's an Arab terrorist ... "
" No , no ma'am , " he interrupted .
" He 's a decent family man with whom I happen to have some disagreements . "
Congress just cut $ 130 million from Darpa 's budget for next year , citing " poor execution " of previous funded projects .
Some in charge of the purse strings say the Pentagon 's premiere research agency was n't spending the cash it was given .
The agency 's chief figures Darpa is being punished for holding its contractors accountable for their work .
Earlier in the week , House and Senate negotiators agreed to a defense budget for the upcoming fiscal year , which begins on October 1st .
As usual , they agreed to the vast majority of spending proposed by the Defense Department .
And the programs they tweaked , cut or increase funding for were altered without much comment .
For the most part .
But in the case of Darpa – the Defense Department 's cutting - edge science and technology division – Congress proclaimed " poor execution " a half - dozen times , as it trimmed more than $ 130 million from Darpa 's approximately $ 3 billion budget .
For months , Darpa chief Tony Tether has been in a nasty fight with Congress and the Pentagon brass over how he manages the agency .
The Defense Department 's money men complain that Darpa " underexecute[s ] " many of its high - tech programs – in other words , it does n't spend the money it was allotted .
Earlier in the year , Defense Department higher - ups took away another $ 130 million from Darpa 's 2008 kitty .
Tether says he wo n't pay for research projects that are n't hitting their ambitious goals .
" The
OSD [ Office of the Secretary of Defense ] comptroller apparently does not believe in accountability , " Tether told Danger Room in June .
" They seem to believe that contractors should be funded regardless of their performance , in order to make the obligations metrics look good .
At least , that is the way they act . "
These latest cuts – from space programs , biotech , " advanced warfighting technology " and other accounts – are seen as a continuation of that argument .
Congress has been dissatisfied with Darpa's " slow obligation and expenditure rates , " one Capitol Hill source says .
Darpa , I 'm told , is still convinced that its " go / no - go approach " is the right away to keep the agency 's researchers on track .

Sarah Palin has now become decidedly the most disliked person in the 2008 Presidential campaign .
From the Washington Post :
Palin is now a much less positive force :
Six in 10 voters see her as lacking the experience to be an effective president , and a third are now less likely to vote for McCain because of her .
It is the experience question that may prove her highest hurdle , particularly when paired with widespread public concern about McCain ’s age .
About half of all voters said they were uncomfortable with the idea of McCain taking office at age 72 , and 85 percent of those voters said Palin does not have the requisite experience to be president .
The 60 percent who now see Palin as insufficiently experienced to step into the presidency is steeply higher than in a Post - ABC poll after her nomination early last month .
Democrats and Republicans alike are now more apt to doubt her qualifications , but the biggest shift has come among independents .
In early September , independents offered a divided verdict on Palin ’s experience ; now they take the negative view by about 2 to 1 .
Nearly two - thirds of both independent men and women in the new poll said Palin has insufficient experience to run the White House .
In the new Post - ABC poll , Palin matches the Democratic vice presidential candidate , Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. , on empathy , one of McCain ’s clear deficits against Obama , while fewer than half of voters think she understands “ complex issues . ”
A third of independent voters now indicate they are less likely to support McCain because of Palin , compared with 20 percent who said so in an ABC poll a month ago .
Palin now repels more independents than she attracts to McCain .
The share of independent women less apt to support McCain because of the Palin pick has more than doubled to 34 percent , while the percentage more inclined to support him is down eight points .
People with migraines may also be more likely to develop blood clots in their veins , according to a study published in the September 16 , 2008 , issue of Neurology ® , the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology .
In the condition , called venous thrombosis or thromboembolism , blood clots form in a vein , which can limit blood flow and cause swelling and pain .
Those clots can then dislodge from the vein and travel to the heart and the lungs , which can be fatal .
For the study , 574 people in Italy age 55 and up were interviewed to determine whether they had a history of migraine or migraine at the time of the evaluation and their medical records were reviewed for cases of venous thrombosis .
The arteries in their necks and thighs were scanned with ultrasounds to check for atherosclerosis , or hardening of the arteries .
Of the participants , 111 people had migraine .
A total of 21 people with migraine also had one or more instances of venous thrombosis , or 19 percent .
In comparison , 35 people without migraine had the condition , or 8 percent .
Researchers do not know why migraine and venous thrombosis are linked .
One theory is that the blood of people with migraine may be more prone to clotting .
The study also found that people with migraine are not more likely to have hardening or narrowing of the arteries , which is contrary to a current theory .
" The thinking has been that because people with migraine are more likely to have strokes and other cardiovascular problems , that they would also have more severe and early atherosclerosis , " said study author Stefan Kiechl , MD , of Innsbruck Medical University in Austria .
" This study is the first to use high - resolution ultrasound to examine this theory , and it provides solid evidence to refute it . "
bluhhhhhhh holy god this one took forever to write for some reason
see you tomorrow

It 's becoming more and more obvious that Palin was not properly vetted .
Sarah Palin , to this day supports and spoke words of encouragement to the AIP political party at their 2008 Convention , a secessionist organization whose platform still includes secession by Alaska and whose founding member , Joe Vogler , refused to be considered an American citizen : " I 'm an Alaskan , not an American .
I 've got no use for America or her damned institutions . "
McCain has met with this woman personally for maybe an hour total and is just now sending campaign officials to Alaska to do a proper background check .
His campaign even tried to say the FBI had vetted her in their effort to cover up this fiasco .
This shows very poor judgment on McCain 's part , very poor judgment .

Commenter " Plunger " had a very interesting take on this as an off - topic ( OP ) comment following a completely unrelated BRAD BLOG story : ... HERE ’S MY TAKE : This entire Palin selection is a Rovian head fake .
It was designed by Rove to accomplish two goals .
First and foremost , to take ALL of the air out of the media that the Obama camp was destined to carry into the GOP convention .
It did that , in spades .
The echo just simply stopped .
The news cycle yesterday was absent of any analysis or follow - through on Obama 's speech ... itself a major coup for Rove .
It ’s as though the entire media machine stopped speaking of anything “ Democratic , ” in unison .
Secondly , the ( apparent ) selection of Palin throws a bone to the Puma 's and to women generally …one that McCain does n’t have to necessarily follow through with , but made for a nice ( disingenuous ) photo - op .
Third ; they 're just not that stupid not to have known about the controversy - and her familial requirements and responsibilities ( Downs Syndrome newborn to care for ) .
In short , their unbelievable choice is in fact , unbelievable ... " a straw - woman . "
By the time the convention occurs , news will come out that the GOP 's own investigators have determined that , while no proof of wrong doing exists , the mere investigation of it is a distraction that the GOP simply cannot afford so close to the election .
As such , the announcement that either Lieberman or Romney have become McCain ’s choice will come as a massive relief to the GOP base , and capture the entire news cycle for weeks to come .
If Rove thought it would be impossible for a McCain / Lieberman ticket to succeed without some form of trickery , he would have dreamed this up , making Lieberman look good by comparison .
All of the push - back will already be out of the system .
He ’s pulled these same stunts in the past – like putting Bernie Kerik ’s name into nomination only to pull him and install Chertoff as Homeland Security Dictator .
Remember when the name of Harriet Miers was put forward for a Supreme Court position ?
Remember ?
A fire storm of push back erupted , only to be followed by the swift and easy confirmation of Roberts , who looked like a breath of fresh air BY COMPARISON .
THEY ARE GAMING YOU !
I 've long suspected that McCain would not be the GOP candidate on the ticket come November .
I 've had various ideas about how the NeoCons might get rid of him , and I admit that this was n't one of the scenarios I imagined .
But now I do wonder if we 're seeing the beginning of a chain of events that will lead to my prediction coming true .

Even Rove will twist and spin his own words :
Rove singled out Virginia governor Tim Kaine , also a Face The Nation guest , as an example of a purely politically motivated pick .
" With all due respect again to Governor Kaine , he 's been a governor for three years , he 's been able but undistinguished , " Rove said .
" I do n't think people could really name a big , important thing that he 's done .
He was mayor of the 105th largest city in America . "
Rove continued : " So if he were to pick Governor Kaine , it would be an intensely political choice where he said , ` You know what ?
I 'm really not , first and foremost , concerned with , is this person capable of being president of the United States . " "
Imagine Obama had chosen a VP as ridiculous as Palin , who , apparently , has been only to Canada , outside the country .
Tucker Bounds makes a fool of himself trying to resist the obvious ..
How pathetic !
I look forward to the debate between Palin and Biden .

You know , Em , for the longest time I did n't believe they were going to nominate McCain .
I guess technically they have n't yet , and I 'd certainly want to fire his ass after this circus if I were a Republican , but ... well ... every time I try to content myself our politics can't get any stupider , it gets way stupider .
So I finally have come to accept that it's this stupid .
They are all completely inured to defending the inanity of their choices --- outright jaw - droppingly successfully so far --- and I think they 're going to run with it .

Yep the Pledge of Allegiance was a full blown Socialist pledge and up until Hitler in the 30s when people recited it they held their right arm out in front of them exactly like a Nazi Sieg Heil .
hand over heart came during WWII and " under god " was ILLEGALLY added in response to the utterly insane McCarthyism of the 50's .
Same with " in god we trust " on paper money , totally unconstitutional and illegal yet there it is .
Palin is just the usual ignorant Christian that has no clue what the hell she is talking about concerning with US history .
For that matter since she is also a " Creationist " she has no idea about the real world that surround her either .
I fail to see how McSame could have picked a worse candidate short of just strolling into an insane asylum and going eeni meeny miny moe .
But sadly it makes no difference because the MSM is already putting McSame FAR higher in the polls that he really is , there is no way in hell that McSame is within 10 points .
They are going to steal this election just they did 2000 & 04 ' .

I agree with Mark Crispin Miller that a 10 % spread is necessary to battle the shenanigans that GOP operatives will attempt to employ via faulty and vulnerable voting systems as well as classic voter suppression techniques .
So one more possibility is that Palin may help provide cover ( like the ' Bradley Effect ' and others ) for analysts who try to posthumously explain away an unnatural shift from polling to the official results .
Just trying to stay a step ahead - I imagine there are some hidden benefits to this selection that are n't immediately apparent .

The Obama DNC speech was very powerful , and I think he did what he needed to do in Denver .
That 's where it ends for people .
Rove and McCain 's move to break the game open and take the glory of the speech away from Obama is like making a chess move which gives up you 're queen for 5 pawns .
It 's dramatic , and you make people wonder " what is this ? " , but you have also just taken yourself out of the game over the long haul .
The only issue McCain had was to pound away at Obama 's inexperience , and he lost that with the choice of Palin .
It 's gonna get ugly for the Repub's , and I know they really do a good job of falling behind the leader , but this time the leader is in free fall !

ABOUT SARA PALIN : VERY INTERESTING !
PLS FWD :
I hope I am not using precious space onthis blog but i found this extremely eye opening and worth sharing .
" This is an email I received from a good friend in New York City .
She is a Bryn Mawr graduate , and is a physician currently engaged in cancer research .
This is an email she received from a Bryn Mawr classmate of hers who lives in Alaska .
Because you , like me , may never have heard of Sarah Palin until today , you may find this an interesting perspective from an Alaskan resident .
Dear classmates -
As an Alaskan , I am writing to give all of you some information on Sarah Palin , Senator McCain ’s choice for VP .
As an Alaska voter , I now more than most of you about her and , frankly , I am horrified that he picked her .
The most accurate description of her is red neck .
Her husband works in the oil fields of Prudhoe Bay and races snow mobiles .
She is a life time member of the NRA and has worked tirelessly to allow indiscriminate hunting of wildlife in Alaska , particularly wolves and bears .
She has spent millions of Alaska state dollars on aerial hunting of these predators from helicopters and airplanes , dollars that should have been spent , for example , on Alaska ’s failing school system .
We have the lowest rate of high school graduation in the country .
Not all of you may think aerial predator hunting is so bad , but how anyone ( other than Alaska wolf - haters , of which there are many , most without teeth ) , could think this use of funds is appropriate is beyond me .
If you want to know more about the aerial hunting travesty , let me know and I will send some links to informative web sites .

It is amazing how the Palin announcement about her daughter 's pregnancy threw the media off track of the real story - the day last April when her water broke while she was attending an " energy forum " in Texas , a closed - door meeting of 9 Republican governors and five energy industry CEOs .
Not only did she stay and give her 30 - minute speech after her water broke , she also refused to go to a Texas hospital , insisting on flying back to Alaska , then driving another 43 miles to the hospital of her choosing before at last giving birth to the child she soon admitted was a baby with Down Syndrome .
It was this story , along with her lack of " showing " - even at 7 months when she surprised everyone with the announcement of her own pregnancy , along with her daughter 's absence from school , that started rumors about whose baby Trig was .
Now , the Governor 's announcement about Bristol 's pregnancy in response to those rumours , followed by Obama 's compassionate statement telling the media to " back off " the kids , must have the Rovian consultants laughing about their very effective tactic .
In my article " Sarah Palin and the Closed - Door Energy Forum Where Her Water Broke " , I propose a shift in focus from the whole pregnancy / childbirth issue , TO THE MEETING .
I must admit , though , I 'd also like to know why the Governor handled the childbirth in this way , risking both a dangerous infection and full blown labor mid-air .
Would she have done the same if she had n't known the child had Down Syndrome ?
What was her thinking process ?
We have a right to question this .

Reliable sources close to Palin have recently said that her decision to influence voters to vote against a return to state protection of its salmon fishery and the largest industry contributing to the state ’s economy was in part due to her desire to take advantage of the willingness of mining interests to support her further political aspirations “ if you can give us what we need ” .
Namely the financial benefit of continued relaxed regulation against pollution of salmon spawning waters and potential drinking water in Alaska initiated by the Murkowski administration .
Governor Palin has been under consideration for some time as a potential candidate for Vice President on the Republican ticket , and mining money is interested in helping with the achievement of that goal , having little use for environmental regulation and protection and the related expense of compliance with such requirements .
Understandably , the potential of a highly placed and able political ally in the White House is extremely attractive , especially one indebted to them .
Her response was to “ take off her Governor ’s hat ” and utilize the media to encourage voters to vote against the repair of vital regulations for safeguarding salmon spawning and potential drinking water .
Governor Palin’s “ stand against corruption ” has been useful in producing other spinoffs which are potentially very beneficial to the mining industry , one of which has been enthusiastic and unhesitating cooperation in the corruption investigation of Senator Ted Stevens , who has been a very vocal opponent of the Pebble Project , and whose “ removal from the process ” would further pave the way for such projects in the future .
Coming forward was “ a requirement of conscience , especially in light of the Governor ’s apparent betrayal of her highly visible stand against corruption and desire to promote clean political practices ” these sources said , calling such actions “ at the very least unethical , and possibly illegal ” .
They went on to say that thousands of Alaskans economically dependent on the salmon fishery have expressed their concern and the belief that they have been “ betrayed ” and “ sold out ” .

The next time we see the TARDIS , the impossibly capacious time machine in the BBC's Doctor Who , it 'll once again be crammed to the rafters .
But this time , the crowd scene will be all actors who have played the Doctor , the show 's enigmatic alien time traveler .
The Telegraph and various other news sources are reporting that all of the surviving Doctors will return for a special mini-episode for the Children In Need charity night , along the lines of last year 's " Time Crash " featuring 1980s Doctor Peter Davison .
And meanwhile , news sources are reporting that star David Tennant will stay until 2011 , and an even more impressive guest star could be joining the series soon .
Who could be more impressive than Tom Baker ?
Try Prince Charles .
According to Reuters , a spokesperson says it 's possible that the Prince could put in an appearance on Doctor Who next year .
Outgoing showrunner Russell T. Davies had asked for the Prince to appear , but he originally turned down the offer , prompting RTD to call HRH " a miserable swine . "
But now a Palace official says the Prince never even saw the request , which was rejected by an underling along with thousands of others .
And if the BBC resubmits the request , the Prince 's staff would n't rule out his saying yes .
( But it 's probably a good idea to leave out the " miserable swine " stuff on the invite . )
Meanwhile , I have a few thoughts about the rumored multi-Doctor special : 1 ) First , it 's weird to think that Davison will be the only Doctor at this gathering who appeared in the last several - Doctors story , 1983 's " The Five Doctors . "
Davison 's predecessor , the manic Tom Baker , skipped " Five Doctors " and was only represented by some footage from an unaired episode .
The other Doctors from that story are sadly no longer with us .
Actually , I 've just realized this is n't true : the surviving Doctors all came back for another Children In Need special , the horrendous 1993 story " Dimensions In Time . "
2 ) Hopefully this means the return of old Doctors to the show will be confined to one - off charity night events like this one .
" Time Crash " was cute and charming , but the show in general has gotten a bit too self - referential .
From listening to new showrunner Steven Moffat at Comic - Con , I 'm mildly optimistic that he agrees with me .
He told the crowd at the Who panel that he wants to create tomorrow's fan favorite characters instead of bringing back old ones , and he thinks the return of a past Doctor can't really justify more than a few minutes of story in any case .
( He did leave in an escape clause , saying it was always possible he would think of a cool idea .
3 ) It still makes me sad that the past Doctors could n't have gotten back together properly in 1993 , when the BBC came close to making a special one - off story called " The Dark Dimension . "
The story sounded halfway interesting : it 's an alternate universe where Tom Baker 's Doctor failed to regenerate after his final story , " Logopolis , " which explains why he 's now so old - looking .
And because of this , all the Doctors who came after him are in danger of being erased or something .
Supposedly the story was killed by internecine warfare , plus the other Doctors were annoyed that Tom Baker got such a central role .
So we got " Dimensions In Time " instead .
( And yes , I know point 3 contradicts point 2 .
Now that the show 's actually back on the air and successful , I 'd rather not see it turn into a nostalgia - fest .
But the 1993 reunion special , if it had happened , could have been great , especially with the past Doctors closer to their primes . )

But relying on the market to discipline financial institutions is generally unacceptable .
It is too blunt a weapon for financial institutions , which are thinly capitalized and closely linked through myriads of transactions with other institutions .
Financial institutions are the holders and , therefore , the guardians of our savings and temporary funds , a unique public responsibility .
Truly letting the marketplace discipline the financial system would mean acquiescing in an avalanche of potential failures - including many salvageable financial institutions and many of their customers .
The excesses of financial entrepreneurship have been abetted by a kind of '' hollowing out ' ' of the financial regulatory system .
Because of piecemeal legislation , official supervision and regulation is highly fragmented .
That has meant heavy and inefficient overlapping authority in some areas and enormous regulatory gaps in other areas .
Specifically , the two agencies with responsibility for the securities industry , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board , hold opposite - and probably irreconcilable - theories of financial regulation and supervision .
In a nutshell , the Fed believes that the holding - company parent and all affiliates of a bank or securities firm ought to be supervised on a consolidated basis .
The S.E.C.'s legal authority is narrowly focused on the broker / dealer operation of a securities firm .
Thus , under the terms of its mandate from the S.E.C. , the New York Stock Exchange must concentrate its surveillance on the broker / dealer .
It has little authority to go into other affiliates of the broker / dealer 's parent , even if they are involved in financial activities .
This regulatory fragmentation , and the loopholes it provides , has not been lost on Wall Street .
The leading securities houses have all sought to increase their financial leverage by forming elaborate holding companies .
To this end , they use creative , though permissible , accounting techniques to hide from public view their gross asset and liability structures .

Set your clock for martial law Share This :
I blogged about
Am I saying that , on October 1st , federal troops will be patrolling the streets and enforcing martial law ?
Of course not .
And , so , on Wednesday morning it will appear to most people that nothing about their world has changed at all .
What will have changed is the far less visible context in which their civil liberties function .
As of October 1st , the army will be standing by to ' assist ' the the federal government in wide - ranging and vaguely - defined functions such as disaster relief and crowd control ; the mechanism for martial law will be in place .
It is a mechanism that the state intends to have constantly cocked to fire .
The Army Times reports , After 1st BCT finishes its dwell - time mission , expectations are that another , as yet unnamed , active - duty brigade will take over and that the mission will be a permanent one .
No media has taken notice of the jarring context shift in the U.S. military 's relationship to the U.S. citizen .
that task is left to bloggers and YouTube and discussion BBs .
It may seem benign reading through this , but once you understand the nature and danger of this illegal use of American military forces on civil setting , you can filter this information through that lens and know that we're
watching the launch of a new level of uniformed armed and armored security
forces ready to clamp down on organized dissent inside the United States ,
again , heretofore utterly unlawful .
As far we know , the use of the military in domestic or civil activities is prohibited by law , except the national guard unites which fall under the authority and aegis of the states .
The following story is told from the Pollyanna view of an Army Times reporter , not from an objective analyst's .
Inside these paragraphs are some frightening realities , among them the fact that multiple units of service branches are training to do what local police now do , except thatthe full weight of Defense Department deployment of military force will takeover our streets much the way the 3,700 - strong police force locked down St. Paul and the Target Center during the RNC .

verge on conspiracy theory when analyzing the establishment of a martial law context .
Based on the above statements , it appears the government is anticipating some extremely serious public outrage and protests - large enough to need the help of the Army and other branches of the military who have been called upon to help in this â€œmissionâ€ .
What is the Bush administration preparing itself for , and what action will trigger these protests they anticipate will require military intervention to quell ?
Another source speculates on whether the army is being put on stand - by to quell the surge of outrage when voting machines declare " McCain wins by a landslide ! "
Personally , I am not much of a conspiracy theorist ... but I do note the timing .
Almost everyone ( including me in the above - referenced
Crying out IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL !
will not make a whit of difference to whether or not there are military boots on American streets , military sons performing crowd control on those who dissent .
At first , there will be public protest but , soon , people will come to accept the American military being used against American citizens in much the same way they shrugged off military and mass - civilian deaths in Iraq , or looked the other way at the use of torture , or defended the rape of civil liberties by the Patriot Act .
America has gone too far down the road to totalitarianism for the process to reverse within the next several years .
Indeed , many Americans are proud of the Total State 's zero- tolerance .
I do not despair about the prospects of liberty -- there are a few very bright spots in the world right now -- but I no longer believe that freedom will grow in American soil for quite some time .

A reminder : this Wednesday , October 1st , the United States moves a huge step closer to being under martial law .
Like so many of the radical and statist changes to the structure of American society , the shift is happening under the radar ... unnoticed amid the circus of elections , the panic surrounding the economy .
I refer to a pilot program in the army called " dwell - time mission " through which the 3rd Infantry Divisionâ€™s 1st Brigade Combat Team ( 1st BCT ) has been trained in order to provide on - call response for the federal government within the US borders ; again , the program begins on October 1st -- this Wednesday ... just in time for the November election .
Last Monday
I blogged about a story in the Army Times which described the " dwell - time mission " and quite openly admitted that the 1st BCT has been trained to â€œhelp with civil unrest and crowd control.â€ 
In reference to " crowd and traffic control " , 1st BCT commander Col .
Roger Cloutier said his soldiers are learning how to use â€ œthe first ever nonlethal package that the Army has fielded .
â€ 
That 's non-lethal like tasers ?
( Click here for the latest taser - murder by cops . )
Yep .
The soldiers are being trained in the use of standard police weaponry such as bean - bag rifles , tasers , batons and shields ; or , as the Army Times describes them , " nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them " .
The 1st BCT will transition from using such weaponry in Iraq to using it on American citizens within American borders .

Am I saying that , on October 1st , federal troops will be patrolling the streets and enforcing martial law ?
Of course not .
And , so , on Wednesday morning it will appear to most people that nothing about their world has changed at all .
What will have changed is the far less visible context in which their civil liberties function .
As of October 1st , the army will be standing by to ' assist ' the the federal government in wide - ranging and vaguely - defined functions such as disaster relief and crowd control ; the mechanism for martial law will be in place .
It is a mechanism that the state intends to have constantly cocked to fire .
The Army Times reports , After 1st BCT finishes its dwell - time mission , expectations are that another , as yet unnamed , active - duty brigade will take over and that the mission will be a permanent one .
No media has taken notice of the jarring context shift in the U.S. military 's relationship to the U.S. citizen .
that task is left to bloggers and YouTube and discussion BBs .
With yesterday 's study linking bisphenol A — a chemical in hard plastics and the linings of food and beverage cans — to diabetes and heart disease , you may be wondering what you can do to minimize your exposure .
The Environmental Working Group last year conducted an analysis of BPA in various canned foods and found the amount varies widely depending on the food .
Condensed milk , for instance , has relatively little BPA , while infant formula has a lot more — about one fifth the safe dose limit set by the Food and Drug Administration .
Of course , the potential risk also depends on how much you consume .
Canned soda has less BPA per serving than some other foods , but if you 're having a six pack a day ...
Here are some good rules of thumb for reducing your intake of BPA .
1 . Buy your tomato sauce in glass jars .
Canned tomato sauce is likely to have higher levels of BPA because the high acidity of the tomatoes causes more of the chemical to leach from the lining of the can .
Think beyond plain tomato sauce to any canned pasta — like ravioli and those fun-looking kids ' meals .
2. Consume frozen or fresh fruits and vegetables instead of canned .
In addition to their BPA - free benefit , fresh and frozen produce usually have more nutrients , which often get lost in the process of canning .
Eden Foods does offer canned beans that are BPA - free .
3. Purchase beverages in plastic or glass bottles .
Canned soda and juice often contain some BPA .
You do n't need to worry , though , about disposable plastic water bottles .
Most do n't contain bisphenol A , and those that do are usually marked on the bottom with a number 7 recycling code .
4 . Use powdered infant formula instead of ready - to - serve liquid .
A separate assessment from the Environmental Working Group found that liquid formulas contain more BPA than powdered brands .

Swarms of fish have been filmed swimming in one of the world 's deepest ocean trenches , nearly five miles ( nearly eight kilometers ) below the surface of the Pacific Ocean .
The fish were caught on film in the Japan trench in the Northwest Pacific .
The film also marks the first time that video cameras have been sent this deep in the ocean .
" We got some absolutely amazing footage , " said project leader Alan Jamieson of the University of Aberdeen 's Oceanlab , on board the Japanese research ship the Hakuho Maru , " more fish than we or anyone in the world would ever have thought possible at these depths . "
The video also showed a spunkier fish than expected .
" We thought the deepest fishes would be motionless , solitary , fragile individuals eking out an existence in a food - sparse environment , " said Monty Priede , director of Oceanlab .
Rather than loners , the fish that the researchers found , called hadal snailfish , were sociable and active , feeding on little shrimp and showing signs of possible family groups in this extreme environment .
Hadal snailfish reside exclusively in deep trenches in the Pacific Ocean , at depths below four miles ( nearly seven km ) .
There , they contend with total darkness , near freezing temperatures and water pressures equivalent to 1,600 elephants standing on the roof of a small car .
The fish feed on the thousands of tiny shrimp - like creatures that scavenge the carcasses of dead fish and other debris reaching the ocean floor .
These snailfish are found in trenches off of western South America , in the Kermadec and Tonga trenches between Samoa and New Zealand in the South Pacific , and in trenches of the Northwest Pacific , including the Japan trench , which Priede 's team is currently studying .
These deep trenches are created when the heavier oceanic tectonic plate collides with and plunges beneath the lighter continental plates .
In these subduction zones , the depth can plummet very steeply to about six miles ( nearly 10 km ) .
The snailfish video and related research are part of Oceanlab 's HADEEP project , a collaborative research program with the University of Tokyo devised to investigate life in the ocean 's deepest trenches or hadal regions .
These are regions that are at least 3.7 miles ( six km ) deep .
The current expedition , which was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the Nippon Foundation in Japan , started on Sept. 24 and ended on Monday .
In a separate discovery announced this week , scientists found 274 species of fish , corals , crustaceans and other creatures in very deep waters off the coast of Australia .
The newly identified species were found in water more than a mile deep in regions rife with underground volcanoes and dramatic canyons .

Best of all , the new sounds are available for ALL users , regardless of using the hardware or not !
As state election officials scurry to prepare for projected record turnout rates in November , two reports issued this week suggest that efforts to modernize the American election system since the notoriously fraught presidential vote in 2000 are falling short .
Coming up short , too late to fix
A report issued by the Government Accountability Office Tuesday summarized the findings of a year - long performance audit of the Election Assistance Commission , established by the Help America Vote Act of 2000 to aid states in upgrading their voting systems .
The Commission is supposed to act both as an information clearinghouse and as a certification and oversight body for voting machine manufacturers .
On both counts , the report found significant problems with the agency 's efforts to date .
The EAC is supposed to provide a federal - level certification process for voting systems , and though it currently has 12 certifications pending , it has yet to complete any — meaning states must rely on their own procedures .
One reason for this , GAO found , is that EAC had failed to " define its approach for testing and certifying electronic voting systems in sufficient detail to ensure that its certification activities are performed thoroughly and consistently . "
The need to reconcile differing interpretations of the commission 's vague guidelines had " contributed to delays in certifying systems that several states were planning on using in the 2008 elections ... forcing states to either not require EAC certification or rely on an alternative system . "
This problem of vague criteria and procedures appears to plague EAC in a number of areas .
EAC is responsible for responding to any problems or defects discovered after the fact in systems it certifies .
Unfortunately , " it has yet to specify how this broadly defined approach will be executed , including what steps will be followed , what criteria will be used to reach decisions , how it will know if system problems have been corrected , and how it will use the information to improve its testing and certification program . "
The agency is empowered to conduct periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities to ensure that the production process is up to snuff , but there do n't appear to be any concrete guidelines specifying who is to conduct these inspections or what criteria they are to use in making their assessments .
The EAC manual " does not include procedures or criteria for determining the credibility of reported defects , or any other aspect of the inquiry or investigation , such as how EAC will gain access to systems once they are purchased and fielded by states and local jurisdictions . "
Moreover , the commission " has not established an effective and efficient repository for certified versions of voting system software , or related procedures and tools , for states and local jurisdictions to use in verifying that their acquired voting systems are identical to what EAC has certified . "
There does n't appear to be any long - term plan to remedy this problem , but the commission 's interim solution is distinctly low - tech : it told GAO that it will " maintain copies of certified versions in file cabinets and mail copies of these versions upon their request by states and local jurisdictions . "
There is no mention of whether anyone has introduced officials at EAC to the concept of a " hash . "
The problem of ensuring that certified software is the same as that installed on the machines used on election day is not a hypothetical one .
In numerous cases , voting machine manufacturers have shipped out systems with software different from the version certified for use in state elections .
Last year , for example , Election Systems & Software was found to have sold almost 1,000 uncertified machines to five California counties .
EAC blames most of its shortfalls on lack of resources .
The commission told investigators that the testing and certification program had only three staff , all of whom had other responsibilities , and all of whom were expert consultants limited to working half the year at most .
Any solution the commission did implement to fix these problems would not come in time to affect the election in November , GAO concluded .
Lag : it 's not just a problem for video games
A second study issued Monday by the Century Foundation and the advocacy group , Common Cause , examined a broad range of potential electoral problems in 10 key swing states : Colorado , Florida , Georgia , Michigan , Missouri , New Mexico , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Wisconsin .
Much of that report focused on longstanding , low - tech problems , such as poor poll worker training , the use of deceptive practices by partisan activists , insufficient allocation of voting machines or ballots to polling places , and restrictive voter ID requirements .
But technological changes have presented new difficulties — often going beyond the familiar security and reliability concerns with electronic voting systems , on which Ars has frequently reported .
In an electoral dry - run conducted in Colorado earlier this year , for example , officials discovered " on-going problems with lag and connectivity " in the centralized voter registration system used to " check in " voters at their local polling station .
While the problems did not rise to the level of " disasters , " officials were moved to make backup plans in the event of a crash or excessive delays .
Even when machines function properly , the Common Cause study found that user confusion with new electronic systems could create a problem if states have not taken adequate steps to familiarize voters with the new machines .
For example , some systems implement a " straight ticket " option , which automatically selects all the candidates from a voter 's self - declared party at the outset of the voting process .
A voter who then clicks on a specific candidate of that party may inadvertently deselect the candidate — and higher rates of " under - voting " ( failure to select any candidate for one or more races ) in counties with this option suggest that at least some voters do make this error .
Florida , whose electoral fiasco in 2000 prompted the drive to modernize state voting systems , was ranked " unsatisfactory " on 11 of 24 dimensions that the report evaluated .
Here are some questions that ask the same thing in different ways .
How can McCain / Palin even stand a chance in this election , given the state of the country ?
Why has n't " conservative " become a dirty word , given the results of the last 8 ( or is it 30 ) years of conservative rule ?
How come the Republicans get away with lies , dirty tricks , thievery and gross hypocrisy , over and over again ?
Why are congressional Democrats so spineless , so deferential around Republicans ?
I think the answer is that conservatives and Republicans are more attuned to the American people and to the roots of American culture .
I cringe to say this , but somehow deep in our values , hopes and dreams we are primed to be conservative .
And the Democrats , being politicians , can sense it ; they know it in their heart of hearts .
To begin with , America has been soaked in poisonous homegrown racism for three hundred years .
It affects every American child .
Yet even aside from that elephant - in - the - room , we have to fight our native culture to maintain a leftist perspective .
Citizens of other countries can draw on their own revered cultural icons to promote rebellion or revolution , or the notion of a social community .
In 2004 Canadians voted for " The Greatest Canadian . "
Tommy Douglas , a socialist and reformer known as Canada 's ' father of Medicare , ' won the honor .
The English have Robert Owen , the French have Emile Zola , the Germans Karl Marx , among many others .
What about the USA , home of revolutionary democracy ?
Who do we have ?
Franklin Roosevelt ?
Joe Hill and Eugene Debs ?
Martin Luther King ?
The freedom riders ?
Elizabeth Staunton and Susan B. Anthony ?
Mario Savio ?
Malcolm X? John Brown ?
Tom Paine ?
Emma Goldman ?
With the exception of King and FDR we remember these people only vaguely , if at all .
Our founding father heroes have been stripped of their revolutionary content , to emerge in our times as staunch Christian conservatives .
Whether Thomas Jefferson was actually an agnostic social revolutionary is not the point ; he is perceived as something else .
We love stories about poor boys making it big .
Who of us has not dreamt of being a millionaire ?
We admire and love Bill Gates and Henry Ford by making their lives into stories of good men working hard and earning their wealth and freedom , and by excising anything negative from their stories .
Our high school students know that Henry Ford built the first mass - produced automobiles , and that he offered a living wage to his workers .
We do n't recall , though , that Ford advocated for Hitler and published anti-Semitic crap in his Dearborn Independent .
On TV and radio we are deluged by endless get - rich - quick commercials ; one salesman after another hawking his easier , faster way to make " life - changing " money .
Or we peek into millionaire mansions , the " cribs " of the rich and famous , the garages full of Ferraris and Rollses .
Or we watch the parade of new luxury products .
Is greed really good , we wonder ?
Have n't too many Americans come to believe that making money in itself is a goal worthy of a lifetime 's pursuit ?
In Thailand they talk of " suspiciously wealthy " individuals -- people so rich one should be suspicious of how they got it .
We have no similar concept .
Who can count the American heroes dispensing justice from their fists or from the barrel of a gun ?
From John Wayne to Charles Bronson , Dirty Harry to Rambo and the young Vito Corleone , we thrill to our heroes walking tall , carrying a big stick ( but preferably a gun , which is much more practical ) to right the wrongs of society .
They do it pretty much alone .
No social action to achieve social justice here .
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat .
Get our best delivered to your inbox .
Rambo invades Vietnam to free American prisoners .
Bronson 's character fights and kills the evil inner city gangs .
They both avoid the incompetent government and corrupt police force .
A despicable judicial bureaucracy wrongly stops Dirty Harry from dispensing real justice .
Here we have a righteous vigilante who fights for freedom , and also , of course , his beloved family .
The young Michael Corleone does what is necessary to " protect his family . "
We want to forget he is a gangster and murderer .
We want to forget Bronson 's character is killing , because he is right to fight evil in any way he can .
In all this there is a strong flavor of the virtuous ends justifying the means .
If you have to lie , cheat and kill to achieve the Kingdom of God on earth ( the true America ) , so be it .
Sound familiar ?
When Rambo blows up a hundred Vietnamese to rescue American prisoners , we know he 's only killing bad guys .
Bronson 's character kills and the bad guys ' blood runs in the streets .
No innocent victims here !
We can't cheer Rambo in the real world , but we can swear our undying love for our soldiers , somehow forgetting that their messy job involves killing innocents .
And when our fighters come up with slogans straight from Rambo , like " killing is our business , and business is good , " we shrug .
Americans do n't vote for eggheads .
I remember Adlai Stevenson running against Eisenhower .
Stevenson did n't stand a chance , not least because he was pegged as too intellectual to be President .
We prefer our leaders to be plain spoken , practical men who do n't think or read too much .
A cowboy , maybe .
It is hard to think of an American icon , fictional or real , who is an intellectual .
Who comes closest ?
Albert Einstein , Benjamin Franklin , Mark Twain ?
I bet John Wayne would be a strong supporter of the Bush administration .
He would cheer us on to " victory " in Iraq and Afghanistan .
We 'd have to respect the opinion of such an American hero .
But then we forget that John Wayne was born Marion Morrison , and it is documented that he was a draft dodger during World War II .
In this post , I have prepared a few graphs to supplement this week 's TWIP .
We know that Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike had a huge impact on refineries , and that these production shortfalls are now slowly making their way through pipelines .
It is my view that because Texas refineries have been fairly slow to get back online , and because of the built - in lag due to the slow travel of refined products through pipelines , the present gasoline shortages are likely to get worse in the next two to three weeks .
Gasoline shortages are starting to become a problem in the Southern US in areas such as Nashville and Atlanta .
This week 's " This Week in Petroleum " ( TWIP ) ( included in its entirety under the fold ) did indeed show a big drop in gasoline inventory as we expected , but we are still digesting the impact , keeping in mind that these are averaged numbers over four weeks -- which of course begs the question of whether or not the full impact of the refinery outages we have seen are in these numbers or not .
Figure 1 . Approximate Gulf of Mexico refinery shortfall , due to impact of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike
The Department of Energy puts out daily reports on the combined impact of Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike , found as this site .
Usually , they contain information by refinery as to which ones are shut down , starting up , or operating at reduced rates .
The graph shown in Figure 1 has been prepared with the following assumptions :
(1) We lose 100 % of refinery capacity if a refinery is reported as shut down .
(2) When refineries are reported as starting up , 80 % of their production is off line .
(3) When refineries are reported as operating at reduced rates , their production is low by one - third .
The amount of refined products lost because of the refinery shortfalls will hopefully be less than this amount because
(1) These refineries would not have been operating at full capacity , even if they were open , and
(2) Some refinery utilization can perhaps be shifted to utilization elsewhere .
One could make other adjustments as well .
We do n't know how accurate the 80 % and 1/3 are adjustment factors selected above are .
Also , if the real problem is a crude shortfall , there might be refineries elsewhere that are operating with reduced runs that are not near the Gulf of Mexico , so are not counted in the calculation .
Separate Louisiana and Texas Refinery Outage Information
Since the refinery information is published by refinery , it is possible to look at Louisiana ( primarily Hurricane Gustav ) and Texas ( primarily Hurricane Ike ) refinery shortfalls separately .
Figure 2 . Approximate Louisiana refinery shortfall , due to impact of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike
Figure 3 . Approximate Texas refinery shortfall , due to impact of Hurricanes Gustav and Ike
From these graphs , we can see that 23 days after Hurricane Gustav , Louisiana production is still not completely back on line , although it is close .
Some of the recent reduced runs may be because of a lack of crude to refine , rather than because of a problem with the refineries per se .
Comparing the two graphs , we can see that Texas production seems to getting back on line more slowly after Hurricane Ike than Louisiana got back on line after Hurricane Gustav .
It is now 10 days after Hurricane Ike , and there are still refineries shut down .
The DOE report of September 23 reports that six refineries in the Texas City and Port Arthur areas with a total of 1.6 million barrels a day of refinery capacity have not yet been able to restart .
The same report also indicates that 995,684 barrels a day of crude oil production is still shut in .
This amounts to 76.6 % of normal Gulf of Mexico production .
There are still shipping disturbances , which presumably affect our ability to import crude oil .
The September 23 DOE report regarding hurricane impacts indicates :
As of 8:00 AM EDT September 23 , vessels with drafts over 34 feet are limited to daylight transit only from Sims Bayou to the Houston ship channel turning basin .
The Sabine and Neches Channel going into the Port Arthur area is now open to vessels to project depth for daylight transit and limited to drafts of 33 feet at night .
Part of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway ( GIWW ) in TX has re-opened , but it is still closed from mile marker 350 to 319 and has some closures in LA as well .
The Calcasieu Channel into Lake Charles , LA is open to vessels with a draft of 38 ' or less .
Shortfalls of product
Even before TWIP has come out , there are reports of shortages of refined products .
The September 23 DOE report regarding the impact of the hurricanes indicates that a large number of pipelines shipping refined product are operating at reduced rates , presumably because of lack of product to ship .
One of these pipelines is Colonial Pipeline , running from Texas to New Jersey .
Shortages of gasoline have been reported in Atlanta and Nashville , because of shortfalls of products from this pipeline ( and its spur to Nashville ) .
Products move through these pipelines at only 3 to 5 miles per hour , with the average time to transport oil from Texas to New Jersey 18.5 days .
Because of this slow transit ( and the fact that the pipelines are not 100 % full ) , the shortages now being felt in areas such as Atlanta and Nashville reflect shortfalls in refining occurring a week or more ago .
Given the amount of refinery shortfalls shown in Figure 1 , and the relatively slow rate at which they are declining , it is likely that the shortfalls in gasoline available for sale will continue for at least another two to three weeks .
Figure 4 . Gasoline Inventory Graph from last week 's TWIP ( Sept. 17 )
My post on the impact of the hurricanes from a few days ago has a few additional graphs .
A major reason the hurricanes are having such a significant impact on gasoline supplies is the fact that inventories were very low at the time the hurricanes hit .
Crude oil inventories may also be disturbed because of shut in Gulf of Mexico wells and difficulty in delivering overseas crude to the area .
Crude shortfalls are less likely to be an issue than gasoline shortfalls , because with refineries closed , they are less able to use the inventory .
Also , crude can be released from the SPR , if needed .
This week 's TWIP report
Summary of Weekly Petroleum Data for the Week Ending September 19 , 2008
U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 11.5 million barrels per day during the week ending September 19 , down more than 1.7 million barrels per day from the previous week 's average .
Refineries operated at 66.7 percent of their operable capacity last week .
Gasoline production fell last week , averaging about 8.0 million barrels per day .
Distillate fuel production decreased last week , averaging nearly 3.3 million barrels per day .
U.S. crude oil imports averaged 7.1 million barrels per day last week , down nearly 1.4 million barrels per day from the previous week .
Over the last four weeks , crude oil imports have averaged 8.5 million barrels per day , about 1.8 million barrels per day below the same four - week period last year .
Total motor gasoline imports ( including both finished gasoline and gasoline blending components ) last week averaged 1.2 million barrels per day .
Distillate fuel imports averaged 199 thousand barrels per day last week .
U.S. commercial crude oil inventories ( excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ) decreased by 1.5 million barrels from the previous week .
At 290.2 million barrels , U.S. crude oil inventories are in the lower half of the average range for this time of year .
Total motor gasoline inventories decreased by 5.9 million barrels last week , and are below the lower boundary of the average range .
Both finished gasoline inventories and gasoline blending components inventories decreased last week .
Distillate fuel inventories fell by 4.2 million barrels , and are in the lower half of the average range for this time of year .
Propane / propylene inventories increased by 0.1 million barrels last week but remain below the lower limit of the average range .
Total commercial petroleum inventories decreased by 17.9 million barrels last week , and are below the lower boundary of the average range for this time of year .
( Thanks to GS for bringing these to the comments ... )
Note
I am writing this post in advance , because I will be traveling from Sacramento back to Atlanta today .
( Great choice of destinations from a gasoline point of view ! )
Perhaps Leanan or one of TOD readers can post the latest report when it comes out .
One interesting calculation is the implied daily drawdown of gasoline inventories , calculated as the change in inventory divided by seven .
If this is very high now ( say 1,000,000 barrels a day ) , it is of concern , because it is unlikely to get much better in the near term , unless people in some areas are forced to go without gasoline for lack of product .

Located just one island over from Hawai ’i Volcanoes National Park on the island of Maui , Haleakala is Hawaii ’s second national park .
Haleakala is a dormant volcano which reaches over 10,023 ft ( 3,055 m ) above sea level .
What makes it more impressive is that the base of the volcano ….is at sea level .
It is one of the few places in the world where you can drive from the beach to 10,000 ft ( 3,000 m ) in about an hour .
One thing you will notice if you visit Haleakala is a greenish - white plant called a Silversword .
It is extremely rare as it is only found on Haleakala and only above 2,100 m ( 6,900 ft ) .
It was near extinction until conservations efforts stopped its destruction and stabilized the population .
As with Mauna Kea on the Big Island , Haleakala is a home to several world - class astronomical telescopes at the summit .
Its location above the clouds in the Pacific makes it an excellent location for astronomy .
One of the popular pastimes at Haleakala is to rent a bike near the summit and coast 10,000 feet down to the bottom .
I have n’t done it , but it is on my to do list for my next visit to the park .
In addition to coasting , hiking in the caldera is also popular .
I saw dozens of hikers and backpackers in the caldera during my two visits .
The park is open year round and is subject to normal National Parks Service entrance fees .
Sunset Viewing in Haleakala National Park
Tourists who wish to enjoy sunset viewing at Haleakala National Park are now required to reserve in advance .
This update was effective February 2017 .
This reservation is not part of the entrance fee to the park .
The rate is $ 1.50 per car .
Those who do not reserve in advance can still enjoy sunset viewing ; however , there will be no guarantee that parking spaces will become available .
It will be catered on a first - come , first - serve basis .
Reservations can be done up to 60 days prior to the sunset viewing date .

The Crash of Western Capitalist Civilization ?
“ Train - wreck ” does n't even begin to describe what is starting to happen to the U.S. today with the financial crisis , an onrushing depression , and the failure of George W. Bush 's war policy as he is faced down by Iran and the Russian bear .
But in an even broader sense , the West , as a civilization , after a century of world war and the utter failure of global finance capitalism , may have reached its limits .
Those with a vested interest in the status quo dismiss any suggestion that something is wrong .
This includes Donald Luskin , author of an article in the Washington Post on Sunday , September 14 , titled : “ A Nation of Exaggerators : Quit Doling Out That Bad Economy Line . ”
Luskin writes ,
“ The relentless drumbeat of pessimism in the media and on the campaign trail ” is “ a virus . ”
He continues : “ Sure , there are trouble spots in the economy , as the government takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and jitters about Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers , amply demonstrate .
And unemployment figures are up a bit , too .
None of this , however , is cause for depression -- or exaggerated Depression comparisons . ”
Continue reading , and you find out who Luskin is : a campaign adviser to John McCain .
We know that “ where you stand depends on where you sit ” — and who pays you for advice .
So is a catastrophic meltdown coming ?
If so , probably a majority of the people in the world are thinking : “ Serves them right . ”
For the last 500 years , the West has been striding across the globe , armed to the teeth with firearms , warships , bombers , and — more recently — depleted uranium , enforcing the “ white man 's burden ” by enslaving nations and peoples and confiscating everything of value — ranging from art objects to gold to oil — that can be carried away .
The financiers behind it all have also used the diabolically clever practice of creating money “ out of thin air ” to put the natives everywhere into debt , and , when that has proven insufficient , of doing the same to their own populations .
All this is rationalized by various brands of racism , cultural superiority , social Darwinism , historical determinism , “ dominion of the Elect , ” “ God 's chosen people , ” etc .
Or , simply , “ might makes right . ”
Some call it “ The New World Order . ”
So today , we Americans , denizens of the “ land of the free and the home of the brave , ” victors in two world wars , bearers of “ democracy ” to Afghanistan and Iraq , allies of the brave Israelis who hold high the banner of Judeo - Christian values among the ungrateful Palestinians — well , we Americans owe our own bankers almost $ 70 trillion at most recent count .
With the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , we owe holders of bad housing loans , including the governments of China , Korea , and Japan , another few trillion .
The bluster of Kissinger , Brzezinski , the Kristols , the Christian fundamentalists , and their paid - off politicians and media millionaires notwithstanding , America — indeed , the entire West — has been found out , perhaps even checkmated on the world stage .
The Bush / Cheney wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have blackened America 's name forever .
Iran has called our bluff .
In Israel the gap between rich and poor is increasing as much as in the U.S. According to an article by Ian S. Lustick , the Palestinians have stood up to the Israelis to the point where more Jews are emigrating from that country than are moving in , and where those who remain are increasingly huddling around Tel Aviv as a safe haven .
( Ian S. Lustick , “ Abandoning the Iron Wall : ‘ Israel and the Middle Eastern Muck ' , ” Middle East Policy , Vo. XV , No. 3 , Fall 2008 . )
In the 1990s , the European bankers used U.S. and NATO forces to dismember Yugoslavia so George Soros and the Rothschilds could gobble up Balkan resources .
But that strategy is failing in the Caucasus , where the Russians fought back against the genocidal attack by Dick Cheney 's poodle , Mikheil Saakashvili , the New York - trained attorney the CIA got elected as the president of Georgia .
And now the people of Ukraine , the “ Little Russians , ” realizing what the West has in store for them , are rushing back into the Slavic fold and may be only a year or so away from reuniting with their “ Great Russian ” cousins across the border .
What is telling is to watch the Western financier press , chiefly the Washington Post and the New York Times , fume about Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin and his “ authoritarian ” manner .
An example is the article by Times correspondent Ellen Barry on Putin 's September 11 press conference in Moscow .
She wrote , “ In three - and - a - half hours , in tones that were alternatively pugilistic and needy , Vladimir V. Putin tried to explain himself . ”
I 'm sorry , Ms. Barry .
You and your editors may think your writing is cute , but Vladimir Putin is the foremost figure on the world stage today .
He will remain so after George W. Bush leaves the White House disgraced .
Putin is heir to an epochal movement of patriots who began in the 1970s to take back Russia from within .
It started with a base of operations within the KGB and the Orthodox Church , led to Gorbachev 's glasnost in the 1980s , and culminated in the Second Russian Revolution of 1991 .
At that point , the Western financiers gleefully rushed in to support an assault from the Russian “ oligarchs ” who were looting Russia of everything it owned .
The oligarchs were the shock troops of a financier assault that had already begun to overlap in the West with the Russian Mafia .
Cheered on by the Washington Post and aided by academic advisors from places like Harvard , this international syndicate nearly destroyed Russia during the 1990s .
But when Putin was appointed interim president by Boris Yelstin in 1999 , and after winning the presidential election of 2000 in his own right , he began to fight back .
From the mid-1970s to today , thousands of Russian gangsters , along with many hard - line Bolsheviks / Stalinists , were allowed to emigrate .
Many settled in the U.S. and are here today , and many more settled in Israel .
In fact , one reason the price of condos in New York , Miami , Tel Aviv , and elsewhere has inflated so much reportedly is the flood of cash from racketeering .
The crooks have allied themselves with the Colombian drug cartels and have heavily infiltrated the world 's financial systems , even setting up their own banks for laundering money and speculating in the commodities markets .
Today , Putin is cleaning out the remaining gangster class .
His efforts reached a milestone in January with the arrest in Moscow of Semion Mogilevich , called “ the world 's most dangerous man . ”
Putin has declared that the world will not be governed in a “ unipolar ” manner ; i.e. by the U.S. military as the police force for the global financiers .
This does not mean Russia has to be our enemy .
In fact the world would be much better off , and much safer , if we joined with Russia as allies in keeping the peace .
But to do that our system would have to change , because finance capitalism is far too unstable to coexist with other nations as equals .
It must either grow or die , because it always needs new victims to pay the interest on its usury practices and to finance its speculative balloons .
As a last resort , it needs the kind of financial institution bailouts being engineered by Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson , where the only remaining stopgap is borrowing from public funds and adding to the national debt .
Once economic growth stops , as has now happened , and all the bubbles to restart it have blown up , as has also happened , the end really is nigh .
Especially if the host — the U.S. — is bankrupt .
What is coming at us today is n't just another downturn .
If people like McCain adviser Donald Luskin doubt it , maybe , instead of writing campaign propaganda , they should ask the fired CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the stockholders of Lehman Brothers , whose shares have dropped ninety percent in less than a year , and the millions who are losing their homes .
Presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain are calling for “ change . ”
Well , if I were standing on a beach with a 100 - foot tsunami roaring in my direction , I would call for change too .
Except I would not be standing around arguing about the meaning of the words “ lipstick on a pig . ”

Barbara Honegger
OpEd News
September 26 , 2008
The author is a Senior Military Affairs Journalist , and former White House Policy Analyst and Special Assistant to the Assistant to the President in the first Reagan Administration .
Ms. Honegger is the author of the 9/11 expose “ The Pentagon Attack Papers ” http://physics911.net/pdf/honegger.pdf and October Surprise ( Tudor , 1989 ) , the first book to reveal the true origins of the Iran side of the Iran / Contra scandal .
By insisting that Bruce Ivins , a biowarfare scientist then with the Army ’s Ft. Detrick laboratory , was behind the anthrax attacks , the Bush Administration has officially acknowledged that those attacks were perpetrated by a U.S. Government insider — and not by bin Laden or by Iraq .
Likewise , compelling evidence ( 1 ) has demonstrated that the mass murders of 9/11 themselves were perpetrated or enabled by U.S. Government insiders .
And while it is well known that President Bush has admitted Iraq was not behind Sept. 11 , it is less widely known that bin Laden has never been wanted by the FBI for 9/11 on the agency ’s ‘ Most Wanted Terrorists ’ web page .
FBI Director Mueller and his chief investigative spokesman , Rex Tomb , have publicly stated that the reason bin Laden is n’t officially wanted for 9/11 is because there is “ no hard evidence ” linking him to the Sept. 11 plot . ( 2 )
Because the Administration has thus admitted the anthrax attacks were perpetrated by a U.S. government insider — and Sheila Casey and Barry Kissin have shown in the Sept. 2008 issue of The Rock Creek Free Press that they were a true inside job by the CIA ( and DIA ) and its contractor Battelle Memorial Institute , not a ‘ lone nut ’ rogue ( 3 ) — if significant evidence links the insider anthrax attacks to 9/11 , we can reasonably infer that the same government / military insiders were behind both mass crimes .
So what is the evidence linking anthrax to Sept. 11 ?
1 ) Whatever insiders wrote the letters mailed with the anthrax wanted you to believe they were linked to 9/11 .
As is well known , the date hand written on the anthrax letters is Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Though the official story — that the first letter , to Florida photo journalist Bob Stevens , was n’t mailed until after 9/11 and so anthrax was n’t part of the actual 9/11 plot — it ’s clear that whoever wrote and dated the letters and added the super - weaponized ( 3 ) U.S. military anthrax wanted you to believe there is a direct connection , and that Islamic foreigners were responsible for both .
2 ) Superweaponizing anthrax was one of Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld ’s top priorities .
Two days before 9/11 , on Sept. 9 , the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) held a rare press conference in which it revealed that on his first day as Secretary of Defense , Rumsfeld ordered the DIA to take Project Jefferson , a secret and illegal anthrax weaponization program ( probably using the Ames strain contained in the anthrax letters ) to the next level of lethality and that it had achieved ‘ success ’ earlier that month in a classified field test .
The mainstream press reported this event on Sept. 10 , the day before 9/11 .
3 ) Mayor Rudolph Giuliani ’s Office of Emergency Management ( OEM ) preplanned a bio / chem - terrorism exercise likely involving an anthrax scenario for which personnel were in New York City on 9/11 , and Giuliani ’s just - recent OEM director urged White House staff to go on anti-anthrax Cipro on Sept. 11 . Giuliani testified to the 9/11 Commission that his Office of Emergency Management ( OEM ) had scheduled a bio / chem - terrorism response exercise , called TRIPOD II , to begin the day after 9/11 , Sept. 12 .
But personnel who were to take part in the exercise were already in New York City on Sept.
10th and OEM personnel were cleared out of their WTC7 offices on Sept. 11 and moved to the exercise command center on a New York pier and thus conveniently out of the building when it was brought down by military - grade thermate explosives on 9/11 — controlled demolition charges that required weeks to pre-place , the very weeks the exercise was being planned .
New Jersey ’s Ft. Monmouth , an Army base just across the water from the Twin Towers , also held a ‘ II ’ exercise , called TIMELY ALERT II , on 9/11 ( 4 ) , almost certainly coordinated with Giuliani ’s TRIPOD II , further evidence that the latter was also scheduled to begin on Sept. 11 .
The then recent director of Mayor Giuliani ’s Office of Emergency Management , Jerome “ Jerry ” Hauer — a bio - warfare expert and one of the signers of the pre-9/11 Project for a New American Century manifesto calling for “ a new Pearl Harbor ” ( such as 9/11 ) who had been a central player in scripting the TRIPOD II bio-chem attack scenario exercise — was an expert in the response to building collapses ( 5 ) and managing director of Kroll Associates before and on 9/11 , the company that managed the WTC7 OEM ‘ bunker ’ and provided ‘ security ’ for the World Trade Center , including all three buildings brought down by controlled demolition that morning .
He thus oversaw personnel with the complete access needed to pre-place explosive charges .
It was Hauer who had advocated , despite the 1993 terrorist attack on WTC1 , that Giuliani locate his OEM , from which a response to an expected follow up attack on the WTC would need to be orchestrated , next door in WTC7 ( 6 ) .
The new OEM opened on the 23rd floor of WTC7 in June 1999 , where Hauer , its director , had his office .
Hauer became a National Security Adviser to the National Institutes of Health on Sept. 10 , the very day TRIPOD II personnel arrived in New York City , from which new NIH post he managed the Bush Administration ’s ‘ response ’ to the imminent anthrax attacks , which falsely pointed the finger at Iraq and diverted attention from the true insider anthrax killers .
Indeed , it was Hauer who zealously pushed the ‘ bin Laden did it and just planes - and - fires brought down the Towers ’ official story on CBS News on 9/11 in the immediate aftermath of the attacks before anyone not on the inside could have possibly determined the actual cause of the collapses , taking pains to insist that explosives were not involved , when they were .
And according to mainstream press reports and a lawsuit by the conservative government watchdog group Judicial Watch , it was Hauer who personally advised the White House to take anti-anthrax Cipro antibiotics on 9/11 ( 7 ) .
[ Other reports state White House personnel were put on Cipro nearly a month before the attacks ( 8 ) .
Did Hauer recommend that White House personnel be put on an anti-anthrax antibiotics on 9/11 because he had reason to believe the 9/11 attacks would also involve anthrax and / or because he had advance knowledge there would be subsequent imminent anthrax attacks ?
4 ) The FBI had been told the 9/11 attacks would involve anthrax .
On Sept. 11 , Janette MacKinlay lived in a fourth floor apartment overlooking what was soon to become ‘ the pit ’ of the World Trade Center .
Her neighbor and close friend Bruno told her later that day or early the next morning that he had been pulled off the street into a bank lobby next to the WTC towers by an FBI agent on the morning of Sept. 11 to protect them from the dust cloud from the collapsing tower , and was told by the agent that “ We were told this was going to happen and that it would involve anthrax . ”
Another FBI agent told a woman about to enter the NBC Bldg. that she should leave immediately because “ there are explosives in the building as well as in the WTC . ”
Clearly , the FBI had been pre-alerted because their own offices were in the WTC — in WTC7 — which , like WTC1 and WTC2 , was pre-wired for a controlled demolition take down that day .
MacKinlay had the presence of mind to collect the dust from the cloud that poured into her apartment overlooking the ‘ pit ’ , and it is this dust that physicist Prof .
Steven Jones has analyzed and in which he found military - grade thermate as well as other high explosives , proving the presence of pre-placed charges throughout the towers to which ‘ Al Qaeda ’ could not have had access to set .
Though no anthrax has been reported in the dust — though it may not have yet been tested for — if TRIPOD II were at least in part on an anthrax attack scenario , it would n’t have used actual anthrax , but an anthrax simulant — an anthrax - like powder that would disperse through the air in a way similar to the real thing .
Experts should be consulted for the chemical composition of anthrax simulants and the dust from the WTC collapses tested for these simulants .
5 ) In the minds of the insider scriptwriters for the Sept. 2001 New York City TRIPOD II emergency response exercise , an attack on the World Trade Center was already associated with bio / chem terrorism .
According to respected New York Times science writer William Broad , the plan for the 1993 attack on WTC1 , for which alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheihk Mohammed ’s nephew Ramzi Yousef is in prison for life , involved a plot to push cyanide into New York City .
This is reported in Germs , Broad ’s book co-authored with Judith Miller .
Though the latter ’s credibility has been compromised , Broad remains a respected journalist .
6 ) Rudolph Giuliani bought the Florida - building crime scene of the first anthrax attack .
Anthrax was found throughout the American Media , Inc. ( AMI ) building in Boca Raton , Florida where the first anthrax letter victim , Robert Stevens , worked — as confirmed by AMI employees whose desks were near Stevens ’ whom I have interviewed .
A ‘ do n’t cross ’ line was put around the building by the FBI , which had been “ told 9/11 was coming and that it would involve anthrax . ”
AMI was forced to move to another location and put the building up for sale .
According to The New York Times , this first anthrax attack crime scene with evidence still in place was then bought ( at an anthrax sale price ) by former NYC Mayor Giuliani , overseer of the Sept .
11/12 TRIPOD
II bio / chem - terrorism probable - anthrax - scenario exercise , who formed a partnership with a decontamination expert qualified to decontaminate the building .
Giuliani thus controlled and oversaw the destruction of evidence at both the New York crime scene of the 9/11 attacks , the WTC , ordering the steel containing traces of controlled demolition explosives to be removed , and the crime scene of the first anthrax attack , America Media , Inc , in Florida .
The FBI had already joined the conspiracy to obstruct its own investigation of the anthrax attacks by “ agreeing to the request ” of Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine in Ames , Iowa to destroy its ‘ library ’ of over 100 vials of the Ames strain gathered since 1928 necessary for a definitive match against the anthrax in the mailed letters , which library was destroyed on Oct. 12 , 2001 , one week after Bob Stevens became the first victim . ( 9 )
This Florida anthrax is critical because , according to press reports on Ivins ’ alleged involvement , the anthrax in the mailed letters — but not the ‘ first ’ anthrax sent to Stevens ( the FBI claims no letter was found in connection with the anthrax recovered from Stevens ’ computer keyboard but assumes a ‘ missing ’ letter ) was traced back to a flask in Ivins ’ laboratory .
The Stevens anthrax is thus key to proving that Ivins , if he was involved at all , did not act alone , as it does not trace back to his flask , and because it ’s the closest in time to 9/11 and so most likely to be directly linked to Sept. 11 .
Based on the above , a reasonable case can be made that Giuliani ’s Sept. 11/12 TRIPOD II bio/chem .
terrorism response exercise was at least in part on an anthrax scenario , using an anthrax simulant ; that the letters mailed slightly later with real anthrax may have been written or the text drafted for that exercise ; and that Giuliani ’s former Office of Emergency Management director and close friend Jerome Hauer advised White House staff to take anti-anthrax Cipro on 9/11 because he was afraid the anthrax attack exercise scenario might be about to ‘ go live ’ just as both the NORAD hijacked - plane ‘ exercise ’ and the NRO plane - crashing - into - tower ‘ exercise ’ had already just ‘ gone live ’ earlier the morning of Sept. 11 as parts of their ‘ game ’ scenarios suddenly turned horribly real .
If the Florida anthrax does n’t link back to Ivins ’ Ft. Detrick flask and Ivins , who worked on vaccines ( bio- defense ) and not its weaponization ( bio- offense ) was n’t behind the attacks — and neither , the government now claims , was Steven Hatfill whom the Bush Administration just agreed to pay millions of dollars to settle his case — then who was ?
As detailed in the September issue by Casey and Kissin , the key suspects are CIA / DIA contractor Battelle Memorial Institute ( BMI ) ; and , individually , William Patrick and Ken Alibek .
Battelle , a bio - defense contractor located in West Jefferson , Ohio , has exclusive control of the Ames strain contained in the mailed anthrax letters ( 10 ) and , in partnership with the CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency , ran Project Jefferson , the government ’s covert bio -weapons program whose goal was to develop hyper - weaponized anthrax like that contained in the mailed letters ( 11 ) and which Rumsfeld ordered developed to the next level of lethality on his first day as Secretary of Defense .
William Patrick , a former top bio-scientist at Ft. Detrick and close colleague of former Giuliani OEM Director Jerry Hauer , was the mentor of initial FBI ‘ person of interest ’ in the anthrax attacks Steven Hatfill .
Patrick holds five classified patents and trade secrets , including on how to hyper - weaponize anthrax to the 1 trillion spores per gram contained in the letters mailed to Democratic Congressional leaders Senators Daschle and Leahy ( 12 ) .
After leaving Ft. Detrick , he was contracted by Battelle to research and write a report on howmailed letterscould be used as the vector for dispersing weaponized anthrax .
( 13 ) On Sept. 9 , two days before 9/11 , Battelle contractor DIA announced the ‘ success ’ of Project Jefferson ’s anthrax hyper - weaponization program .
Following the Sept./ Oct. 2001 letter mailings , some of which were reported to contain anthrax at 1 trillion spores per gram , a footnote in Patrick ’s report stating that “ We have now arrived at the point where we can purify [ anthrax ] to the extent of 1 trillion spores in a gram ” was removed from publicly available copies . ( 13 )
William Patrick worked with his close colleague and friend , former Soviet bio-weapons expert Ken Alibek , at Battelle , which also ran Project Clear Vision , a secret CIA program to reverse engineer dry - powder anthrax bombs produced by the former Soviet Union .
Patrick and Alibek were the FBI ’s first suspects in the anthrax attacks , but the initial FBI investigative team was taken off that focus and replaced by a new team that diverted attention to Hatfill .
Director Mueller himself assured a Senator that the FBI “ was not investigating , nor intending to investigate , anyone with , or formerly with , BMI [ Battelle ] . "
( 14 ) Battelle is also a contractual partner with BioPort and Scientific Applications International Corporation ( SAIC ) , and directs the anthrax production and experimentation program at the Army ’s Dugway Proving Ground in Utah , the second ‘ home ’ in addition to Ft. Detrick of the Ames strain contained in the letters .
Hauer and Hatfill worked together at SAIC . ( 15 )
The inside job anthrax attacks were then used as a pretext for the illegal secret domestic wiretap program and assault on the Constitution .
Given the timing , it is now almost certain that the U.S. government insider anthrax attacks were used as the pretext for President Bush ’s illegal warrantless domestic wiretap program for which he signed the first ‘ authorization ’ on Oct. 23 , 2001 – right in the middle of the anthrax terror ( 16 ) .
Senator John McCain had just gone on ABC TV , on Oct. 18 , to push the disinformation that a nonexistent bentonite additive , purportedly marking the anthrax as coming from Iraq , meant that Saddam Hussein was behind the attacks .
To this day , the White House still refuses to provide Congress with this Oct. 23 , 2001 presidential authorization for its warrantless inside - the - U.S. surveillance program , and for obvious reason .
This is the alleged authorization that we now know , from a footnote referring to it in another now - released document , contains Bush ’s shocking claim that the Constitution ’s Fourth Amendment ’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures do not apply to U.S. military operations conducted inside the United States .
The fact that the Administration continued its secret and illegal domestic spying program long after its was publicly known that the anthrax attacks were the work of one of its own inside military facilities is strong evidence the perpetrators were the same high level officials who used the attacks to justify their illegal surveillance program – the White House itself .
Exposing the inside job anthrax mailings as the false pretext for the illegal warrantless domestic wiretap program is thus critical to bringing President Bush and his administration to account for its Reichtag Fire - like attack on Congressional Democratic leaders Daschle and Leahy then pushing for an investigation of the 9/11 attacks and resisting the president ’s railroading of the Patriot Act — the analog to Hitler ’s Enabling Act passed in the wake of the Reichtag Fire — through Congress , as well as for the mass murders of Sept. 11 .
We have seen the Terrorists , and They are U.S.
It ’s time for under oath pre-impeachment hearings — and pre-court martial hearings — to interrogate these suspects , and all others who worked with them , to expose who wears The Scarlet A .

11 The FBI recently held a ‘ science ’ briefing for reporters on the Ivins evidence in which it made a 180 - degree reversal from the results of lab analyses of the anthrax reported by Ft. Detrick and other scientists and officials in the first year following the attacks .
Those early analyses showed the spores in the letters to Senators Leahy and Daschle to be super - weaponized : they were found to be highly uniform , extremely small in size , extremely concentrated at 1 trillion per gram , electrically charged , and with a silica coating .
At its ‘ science ’ briefing , the FBI absurdly claimed that mail processing machines caused the additional powderizing and electrical charge found in the samples — both coincidentally common results of weaponization .

Against Jingoism and Hypocrisy
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
DIGG THIS
Statement before the US House of Representatives , July 30 , 2008 , on H. RES .
1370 , Calling on the Government of the People ’s Republic of China to immediately end abuses of the human rights of its citizens
Madam Speaker , I rise in opposition to this resolution , which is yet another meaningless but provocative condemnation of China .
It is this kind of jingoism that has led to such a low opinion of the United States abroad .
Certainly I do not condone human rights abuses , wherever they may occur , but as Members of the US House of Representatives we have no authority over the Chinese government .
It is our Constitutional responsibility to deal with abuses in our own country or those created abroad by our own foreign policies .
Yet we are not debating a bill to close Guantanamo , where abuses have been documented .
We are not debating a bill to withdraw from Iraq , where scores of innocents have been killed , injured , and abused due to our unprovoked attack on that country .
We are not debating a bill to reverse the odious FISA bill passed recently which will result in extreme abuses of Americans by gutting the Fourth Amendment .
Instead of addressing these and scores of other pressing issues over which we do have authority , we prefer to spend our time criticizing a foreign government over which we have no authority and foreign domestic problems about which we have very little accurate information .
I do find it ironic that this resolution calls on the Government of the People ’s Republic of China to begin earnest negotiations , without preconditions , directly with His Holiness the Dalai Lama or his representatives .
For years US policy has been that no meeting or negotiation could take place with Iran until certain preconditions are met by Iran .
Among these is a demand that Iran cease uranium enrichment , which Iran has the right to do under the terms of the Non-Proliferation Treaty .
It is little wonder why some claim that resolutions like this are hypocritical .
Instead of lecturing China , where I have no doubt there are problems as there are everywhere , I would suggest that we turn our attention to the very real threats in a United States where our civil liberties and human rights are being eroded on a steady basis .
The Bible cautions against pointing out the speck in a neighbor ’s eye while ignoring the log in one ’s own .
I suggest we contemplate this sound advice before bringing up such ill - conceived resolutions in the future .

A metal border fence stretches across a valley separating the US and Mexico , near Campo , California on March 17 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Fred Greaves
( Reuters ) - The U.S. Customs and Border Protection is putting off plans for a “ virtual fence ” being built by Boeing Co along the Mexico border and instead will focus on getting a physical fence in place , the Wall Street Journal said .
The highest priority is to put out a system of physical fences and barriers that will keep people and vehicles from illegally crossing the U.S. - Mexico border , Jayson Ahern , U.S. Customs and Border Protection deputy commissioner , told the Journal .
The physical fence is over budget and needs $ 400 million more than is budgeted , people familiar with the situation told the paper .
Boeing has struggled to overcome technical problems on its high - tech virtual fence , part of a contract called SBInet that also includes physical fences .
No one was available at Boeing or Customs and Border Protection for comments .
Re : " Big step : Cut back on babies " Denver Post / August 31 , 2008 / Laurie Goering " Shhh !
This scares both parties " by Froma Harrop blogging at the DNC , Denver , CO 8/25,26 , 27 , 28 , 2008 In a brilliant expose ' of America 's accelerating immigration crisis , Ms. Froma Harrop of the Providence Journal smashed the ' silent assertion ' nightmare hushed - up by the main stream media .
In her Auguast 28 , 2008 piece , " Shhh !
This scares both parties " , she thrilled me by writing about what I 've exposed for the past 20 years !
As a six continent world bicycle traveler , I can state emphatically that , " Overpopulation will become THE single greatest issue facing America and the world in the 21st century . "
Additionally , as you saw in the DNC and most likely will at the RNC , it proves the MOST important and the MOST ignored issue in the United States .
Harrop said , " There 's a BURNING concern in the American West - almost an obsession - that Democrats do not dare touch in their convention here .
Nor will Republicans in St. Paul .
It is the U.S. population explosion .
The West is feeling the brunt of it , as rolling lava of housing developments and big - box cruds - capes claim its cherished open spaces - and increasingly scarce water supplies . "
In the West , we suffer the driest summer in the last 100 years .
We 're nostril - deep in water problems , but the developers build , build and keep building without the common sense God gave a lemming !
Dam the Poudre River , dam every stream , dam common sense , dam rational thinking , dam critical thinking , dam reasonable actions , and dam us into an unsustainable civilization !
Harrop said , " The U.S. Census Bureau now expects America 's population to top 400 million by 2039 , far earlier than previously forecast .
The 300 - million mark was hit only two years ago , so if this prediction is correct , ( it 's worse as the PEW report projected 100 million added by 2035 or 28 years from now ! ) , the headcount will have soared by 100 million people in 33 short years .
" America 's fastest growing region has been and will continue to be the Intermountain West .
Its megalopolises - centered on Denver , Phoenix , Las Vegas and Salt Lake City ­­ are set to add 13 million people by 2040 , according to a Brookings Institution study .
This would be a doubling of their population . "
In Denver , Phoenix , LA , San Francisco , Atlanta , Chicago , Dallas and Houston - we 're SO gridlocked in 2008 that we drive through a wet - cement parking lot to work or play .
Sheer misery , danger and frustration face every driver in every city .
Yet , we build , grow and build some more !
Harrop said , " Hyper - growth still brings out happy talk in some circles .
The Brookings report looks at the population forecasts for the urban corridor on the eastern face of the Rockies , spreading from Colorado into Wyoming , and enthuses , " Such projections point to a huge opportunity for the Front Range to improve on the current level of prosperity . "
There are challenges , it says , but they can be met - and you can almost hear local hearts breaking - by new roads , bigger airports , more office parks . "
The people who wrote the Brookings report illustrate their own idiocy , moronic stupidity and lack of critical thinking .
To keep growing population beyond carrying capacity shows our nation 's leaders fail to possess an ounce of common sense .
Former presidential candidate Michael Dukakis spoke on a PBS documentary that " Growth is inevitable ! "
Yes , for lemmings , growth leads to overpopulation and they go crazy and run over a cliff and swim out to sea !
But , humans may choose to stabilize their populations for a viable future !
Lemmings cannot help themselves , but we can !
Growth is not inevitable for humans !
" And where oh where are they going to find water ? "
Harrop said .
" Every county in Colorado was declared a federal drought - disaster area in 2002 , when the population stood at 4.5 million .
It is expected to approach 8 million by 2035 .
" As former Colorado Gov. Dick Lamm notes , the region is so dry that you can still see the wagon - wheel trails laid down in the 1840s .
" This is an area that plans to add 13 million people ? "
Lamm said to me .
" Crazy . "
Notice both McCain and Obama avoid this issue .
They both voted for amnesty of 20 - 30 million , chain migration and more anchor babies .
Both candidates voted to DOUBLE legal immigration as if they did n't have a brain cell in their heads !
All the while , the world population grows by 77 million annually .
Additionally , I receive letters from well meaning Americans who think we should keep immigrating Mexicans while they do not understand Mexico 's unending population escalation will triple from its current population of 108 million to 300 million in this century !
How ignorant is Mexico ?
Ask Calderon and the Pope !
How dumb are we ?
Ask yourself !
Answer : dumb as lemmings !
" Why is n't the population boom being discussed at the party conventions ? "
Harrop said .
" Because its main driver is immigration - both the number of newcomers and their high birth rates .
The region is also trying to accommodate people relocating from other parts of the country , many of them trying to escape the congestion in California .
" Promoters of open borders like to drag race into any discussion of immigration , so that even those who focus on numbers , not skin color , fear to speak .
The Sierra Club has gone into total hiding on the matter .
Even when you limit the subject to illegal immigration , they 're under the bed .
" In 2004 , Lamm and two other environmentalists wanting to address population pressures ran for the Sierra Club 's board .
They all lost after the club 's executive director , Carl Pope , announced that " they are clearly being supported by racists . "
( One of them , Frank Morris , had been director of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation . )
" The full story can be found at a Web site , www.susps.org.
SUSPS used to call itself Sierrans for U.S. Population Stabilization .
Fred Elbel , a former director and Denver resident , describes himself as liberal Democrat who left the party in frustration over its failure to confront the demographic realities of immigration . "
" It 's called the third rail , " Elbel told Harrop .
" But immigration and urban population growth will be the defining issue for our country in this century . "
" The parties do talk about immigration , he adds , but never its environmental implications , " Harrop said .
" For sure , the two national parties will be jabbering on about the nation 's groaning infrastructure , global warming and , in deference to the West ( and South ) , the water crisis .
But you can bet that they wo n't go near the thing that makes all these problems worse - America 's exploding population . "

I will keep sending overpopulation packets to journalists until they write about what we face .
I 've sent one to David Harsanyi ( lead lemming ) and to Karen Greene and much of the Denver Post and Rocky Mountain News staffs .
As of this date , they together pave the tracks toward our own lemming cliff !
Bob Woodruff of ABC asked input from all citizens concerning the future of our planet .
Go to < http://www.earth2100.tv/>www.earth2100.tv for a sobering reality check as to what we face and to what I have been writing about for the past 20 years .
Our ' window ' to change to a balanced population and non-polluting energy diminishes every day we listen to irresponsible media and thus ignore the blatant symptoms manifesting all over America and the planet .
I was a bit surprised to read the blog titled Is PHP a good first language ?
The author of the blog haved bashed C ( instead of Java , which is a common trait in PHP fans ) .
However , the author ’s argument was not the fact that C is incapable , but the fact that it is too difficult to learn for a newbie programmer .
Contrary to the author ’s opinion , my idea of a good first programming language is as follows :
It should encourage you to do problem - solving
It should enable you to think logically
It should teach you to approach the solution in a structured way
Firstly this is not a PHP bashing article .
I am a PHP developer myself and I like my job .
But there are reasons for which I believe PHP should not be the first language when you begin to learn programming .
It might be a good second one .
I should also make it clear that I am not suggesting C to be the first one , the choice is entirely yours .
I am just going to mention C as an example in the rest of my article .
PHP is a specialized language
PHP was created to solve the Web problem .
It was and still remains the most popular language to build web applications .
No one expects you to write a web application in C .
It will be like building a console calculator in machine language .
But if you are someone absolutely new to programming , you should start with language that is generic in nature , and structured .
After you have gained sufficient knowledge and skill in that language , moving into a specialized arena , be that web or system programming , wo n’t be much of a challenge for you .
If you ask a C programmer to learn PHP , he ’ll need little or no time get himself acquainted with it .
And he ’ll most likely love it .
But If a PHP guy ( which is his first language ) wants to learn C , it is less likely that he ’ll enjoy it .
Eventually he ’ll hate the very language that implements PHP itself !
PHP is a loosely typed language
Despite what some theoreticians say , I am quite fond of the loose typing feature of PHP .
It provides much flexibility and ease of coding .
0 compares equal to ‘ 0 ’ without the need of explicit type casting .
But this feature is not without its disadvantages , and if you are not careful enough it may lead you into programming pitfalls .
What will be the reaction of newbie programmer when ( 0 == ' test ' ) will return true in PHP ?
It ’ll scare him off PHP , if not programming .
Dynamic variables in PHP
Variables are ( kind of ) the heart of a code .
To understand programming , you have to really understand what a variable really is , what is its lifetime , what is its scope , what part of the code are going to see it , and how are they going to see it .
In PHP variables are created on the fly .
This is a great ease for development , but not so good for debugging ; readability may also take a hit if the coder is not careful .
If you start programming with a structural language as C , you would be forced to use variables properly i.e. you will have to declare it first .
You have to specify what type it is .
Than depending on how you declare it , it will be visible to some code , and hidden from others .
You have to understand these things properly and correctly if you want your skill in the language to grow .
After that moving to PHP , or any other dynamic language , will be painless for you .
Built - in library functions
My fifth - grader cousin could not figure out how much is 42 times 25 with a pen and pencil , He had to be provided with a calculator .
My point is , built - in library functions will make your life really easy .
But to be a better programmer you should have an insight of how things work .
I am not saying that you must know how each of the function works ; or avoid using functions and do things yourself .
But if you really like programming , you should know things , like how does a certain sorting algorithm works , what sort of data structures are there , pointers are really P - I - T - A , but they still give you an insight on memory manipulation .
Having a sound conception on topics like these makes you better at problem - solving .
The world of software development is diverse and ever changing .
Knowing one or two programming languages wo n’t help you much if you want to progress .
Selecting an easy language may benefit you at the beginning .
But it ’ll make you pay when you need to switch to some other sophisticated technology .
So choose the first language wisely .
And if PHP is your second language , you ’re gonna enjoy working with it .
Researchers insist they can tell someone 's politlcal affiliation by looking at the condition of their offices and bedrooms .
Messy ?
You 're a lefty .
A neatnik ?
Welcome to the Right .
According to a controversial new study , set to be published in The Journal of Political Psychology , the bedrooms and offices of liberals , who are generally thought of as open , tend to be colorful and awash in books about travel , ethnicity , feminism and music , along with music CDs covering folk , classic and modern rock , as well as art supplies , movie tickets and travel memorabilia .
Conservatives , on the other hand , tend to surround themselves with calendars , postage stamps , laundry baskets , irons and sewing materials in their personal spaces , according to the study .
Their bedrooms and offices are well - lighted and decorated with sports paraphernalia and flags — especially American ones .
" This is different from putting up an Obama– Biden sticker on your bulletin board , " says Sam Gosling , who co-authored the study that included surveys and room inspections of 76 college students and 94 professionals ranging fromrealtors to architects .
These room cues are " behavioral residue , " says Gosling , an associate professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin .
The idea is that distinct cognitive inclinations of liberals towards ambiguity and intellectualism , and conservatives toward order , " drive the way one leads one 's life and displays one 's life in their living and work spaces , " says Gosling 's co-author Dana Carney , an assistant professor of management at Columbia University 's Business School in New York City .
Those cognitive styles turn up in a personality test called the Big Five , which assesses people for openness , conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness and neuroticism ; only the first two have been strongly linked to political tendencies , says New York University ( N.Y.U. ) social psychologist John Jost , another author on the study .
" It 's pleasurable for liberals to think more .
They gravitate toward art , to things that are not as concrete , " says Carney .
" Conservatives have a need for order , for there not to be ambiguity .
There you see that expressed by being more orderly , having more cleaning supplies , needing to have everything lined up and organized so that one feels one 's environment is predictable and therefore safe . "
The findings are just the latest in a burst of recent attempts to unearth politics in personality , the brain and DNA .
Brain scans using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) and even genetic tests are turning up possible clues to our political origins and behaviors .
Positive personality traits associated with liberalism ( self - reliant , resilient , dominating and energetic ) and negative ones attributed to conservatism ( easily victimized or offended , indecisive , fearful and rigid ) appear as young as nursery school–age kids — and correlate with those children 's political beliefs in adulthood , according to a 20 - year study published in 2006 in the Journal of Research in Personality .
More recently , scientists linked the strength of a person 's startle response to their political leanings : conservatives tended to scare easier , blinking harder than liberals when they heard a loud noise .
Needless to say , not all experts are on board with the subtext of these conclusions .
Political scientist Evan Charney dismisses links made by the studies between personality and ideology .
" There 's a lot of bad science here , " says Charney , a fellow at the Institute for Genome Sciences & Policy at Duke University .
" Confirmation bias has flooded into this [ area of ] study .
I 'm a liberal but I do n’t believe liberals are superior people or that there 's an obvious correlation between personality and political ideology , " he says .
The studies " take the most value - laden language and treat it as if you 're talking about a left - spinning or right - spinning neutron .
They are invariably going to reflect the value assumptions of a society — in this case , academic liberals . "
Other supposed explanations for political behavior also are controversial .
Circuits of cells called mirror neurons that fire or send out signals when we see someone act in a way that 's familiar may have played a role in a 20 - point , post–Republican Convention swing in allegiances among white , female Obama supporters to the GOP ticket , says Marco Iacoboni , author of the book Mirroring People : The Science of How We Connect with Others .
Pundits credited John McCain 's pick of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate for the shift , but Iacoboni says there 's reason to believe biology played a role .
At the most basic level , mirror neurons — in the form of empathy with Palin — may have temporarily dazzled swing female voters , says neuropsychiatrist Louann Brizendine , author of the 2006 book The Female Brain , which explores hormonal and other influences on the brains of women and girls .
" The mirror neurons in your brain are going , ' ding , ding , ding — this person is just like me , ' " Brizendine says .
Those mirror neurons are working with the insula , a section of the limbic system involved with emotions and gut feelings , she says .
Both operate at a subcortical , or nonthinking , level dubbed the " sub - Blink level " after New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell 's best - selling 2005 book Blink about gut instincts .
" It carries a really big wallop to the thinking part of the brain , which has to argue for or against it , " Brizendine says .
" The part of the brain sending off messages of gut feelings that ' she [ Palin ] gets it ' influences the other part of your brain .
It does n't mean it will trump it in the voting booth , but it 's enough to switch the numbers " in polling immediately after being introduced to her .
Neuroscientist Elizabeth Phelps cautions that " neuropolitics " is too nascent an area of research from which to draw strong conclusions .
" There 's not a one - to - one correspondence between brain regions and behavior , " Phelps , director of the Phelps Lab at N.Y.U.'s Center for Neuroeconomics , said during a recent panel discussion on the issue .
" Brain science has n't yet informed political decisions . "
The most surprising research may involve the role of genetics in politics .
Researchers from the University of California , San Diego , and the University of Southern California in Los Angeles found that 72 percent of the variation in voter turnout is genetic , according to a study in July 's American Political Science Review ( APSR ) .
Another study they published that month in the Journal of Politics showed that people with variants of the MAOA and 5HTT genes were 10 percent more likely to vote in the 2000 presidential election than people with less efficient versions of the genes .
Those genes affect the neurotransmitter serotonin , which regulates social interaction as well as trust and fear .
A 2006 analysis of 4,500 pairs of twins in APSR found that as much as half of the variation in their beliefs about social organizing principles such as leadership , outsiders , defense spending and traditional values could be attributed to genetics .
Charney says that conclusion is too simplistic : it assumes a person 's personality is genetically determined and that those character traits are correlated with their political ideologies .
" The problem with this is that it assumes people develop personalities and at a certain point , choose an ideology to match their personality .
That 's just not the way it works , " he says .
" Personality is developed in conjunction with the moral and political beliefs in one 's environment .
They believe the ideologies they do because of the way in which they were raised . "
Indeed , there is a caveat to the twin study : whereas genetics exerted an influence on their value systems , heritability had far less to do with how the twins affiliated with a political party .
" A lot of things can get in the way of these deep - seated dispositions , which are probably related to politics but are far from determinative , " says John Hibbing , a professor of political science at University of Nebraska–Lincoln who co-authored the study .
" There 's not a gene for being a Democrat or Republican , or for Obama or McCain .
But genes for how we think about the social or political world might have an impact on how we conceive of a lot of things these days . "

Advertisement A growing number of pubs are selling electronic cigarettes to get around the smoking ban , Newsbeat has discovered .
The new gadget is claimed to taste and feel just like the real thing , but it is legal to smoke indoors .
If you 're one of thousands of smokers made to shiver outside when you want a fag , it seems help is on its way .
More and more pub landlords are stocking up on electronic cigarettes to try to win back punters unhappy about having to go outside to light up .
The metal tubes look a bit like a cross between a cigarette and a pen .
They contain liquid nicotine and when you inhale on them the end lights up .
That gives you a hit of liquid nicotine and then you breath out water vapour , which looks like smoke .
Pub alternative The Butlers Arms in Birmingham is one of the first pubs to start selling them .
Richard 's a regular and is fed up with the smoking ban .
He said : " I can't believe how annoying it is .
You know you keep going outside , winter 's coming and it 's getting colder .
I 'd prefer to say inside and smoke . "
The Electronic Cigarette is a device which imitates a regular cigarette
We asked him to give the electronic cigarette a go .
He said : " It 's certainly not like smoking a fag .
It feels as if you 're getting a hit of nicotine but no smoke . "
Landlord Chris decided to start selling electronic cigarettes as an alternative for his customers who smoke .
He said : " I saw this thing advertised , and what with winter coming , it seemed like a good idea .
" The front bit 's the battery .
The middle bit 's the electronic gubbins and the bit that you stick in your mouth is the bit that contains the nicotine .
" We 've sold a few .
I think about 10 . "
Health worries
It costs £ 35 pounds to buy a starter park and £ 4 for refills after that .
But there are worries about the health impact of smoking electronic cigarettes .
The World Health Organisation say they do n't think enough tests have been done on them and they 're worried using them could be bad for your health .
But retailers argue they 're much safer than smoking tobacco .
Jason Cropper is from The Electronic Cigarette Company .
He said : " People still feel that they 're smoking .
" It 's not perfectly healthy but they 're doing it in a much healthier way .
It 's a new generation of smoking . "

ENGLEWOOD , Colorado ( CNN ) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin on Saturday slammed Sen. Barack Obama 's political relationship with a former anti-war radical , accusing him of associating " with terrorists who targeted their own country . "
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin lashed out at Sen. Barack Obama 's ties to controversial figure William Ayers .
Palin's attack delivered on the McCain campaign 's announcement that it would step up attacks on the Democratic presidential candidate with just a month left before the November general election .
" We see America as the greatest force for good in this world , " Palin said at a fund - raising event in Colorado , adding , " Our opponent though , is someone who sees America , it seems , as being so imperfect that he 's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country . "
Palin made similar comments later at a rally in Carson , California .
CNN Fact Check
Obama 's Chicago , Illinois , home is in the same neighborhood as Bill Ayers , a founder of the radical Weather Underground , which was involved in several bombings in the early 1970s , including the Pentagon and the Capitol , and the two have met several times since Obama 's 1995 campaign for a state Senate seat .
Palin cited an article in Saturday 's New York Times about Obama 's relationship with Ayers , now 63 .
But that article concluded that " the two men do not appear to have been close .
Nor has Mr. Obama ever expressed sympathy for the radical views and actions of Mr. Ayers , whom he has called ' somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago , when I was 8 . ' "
Riot and bomb conspiracy charges against Ayers were dropped in 1974 , and he is now a professor of education at the University of Illinois in Chicago .
Obama campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan called Palin 's comments " offensive " and " not surprising given the McCain campaign 's statement this morning that they would be launching Swift Boat - like attacks in hopes of deflecting attention from the nation 's economic ills . "
With Obama rising in polls while the country struggles in the grip of a financial crisis , Sen .
John McCain 's presidential campaign decided to shift attention away from the troubled economy and onto issues of his opponent 's character , judgment and personal associations , the Washington Post reported .
" We 're going to get a little tougher , " a senior Republican operative said , requesting anonymity because he was n't authorized to discuss strategy .
" We 've got to question this guy 's associations .
Very soon .
There 's no question that we have to change the subject here . "
McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers told CNN , " We are coming up on 30 days until the election , and there are a lot of unanswered questions about Sen.
Obama 's judgment .
" The Obama campaign has been calling Sen. McCain a liar and distorting his record on immigration , stem cells , health care .
We 're going to fight back , " he said .
The Obama camp said the tactic would n't work .
" What 's clear is that John McCain and Sarah Palin would rather spend their time tearing down Barack Obama than laying out a plan to build up our economy , " Sevugan said .
Obama and Ayers attended a meeting for a school reform project in 1995 and met again later that year when Ayers held a campaign event for Obama when then - Illinois state Sen .
Alice Palmer , who planned to run for Congress , introduced the young community organizer as her chosen successor , campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said .
Both men also served on a charitable board together , he said .
Labolt also said the two have not spoken by phone or exchanged e-mail messages since Obama came to the U.S. Senate in 2005 and last met more than a year ago when they encountered each other on the street in their Hyde Park neighborhood .
Obama and McCain will meet for their second debate Tuesday night and will take questions directly from voters in a town hall - style format .

As the US presidential election nears , the shamans of Peru have been displaying their own methods for ensuring the success of their chosen candidate .

Congress Talks , Markets Soar On Monday , the Dow Jones index plunged 778 points but yesterday it soared 485 points even though nothing changed .
One of the fundamental concepts of economic theory is that markets accurately reflect the actual value of the item being traded .
But it is hard to believe that the true value of companies as solid as Boeing , Disney , Pfizer , and Wal - Mart can change by nearly 10 % in a few hours .
The Senate is likely to vote on a revised bailout bill today .
It will probably have sweeteners for various groups , such as an expanded FDIC limit to protect depositors and make them less likely to cause a run on a bank .
Such a bill , however , may draw new opposition in the House .
Did n't Abraham Lincoln say something like : " You can please some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time but you can't please all of the people all of the time " ?
This bill is definitely not going to please all of the people .
It is being microscopically crafted to please 51 senators ( or 50 senators plus Dick Cheney ) and 218 representatives .
But other plans are being circulated .
For example , billionaire George Soros is floating a plan in which the treasury would recapitalize the failing banks by having them issue new stock that the government would buy at the market price .
This scheme means that the stockholders of failing banks would have their stock watered down but the stockholders in banks that do n't need assistance would be unaffected .
Various alternative plans are also being suggested and opposition to it is still strong among conservatives .
Why Democrats Opposed the Bailout
The bailout bill was defeated in the House Monday primarily because 2/3 of the Republicans opposed it , despite John McCain 's appearance on Capitol Hill to tell them to vote for it .
Nevertheless , about 40 % of the Democrats voted against it , too .
Why ?
The leader of the antibailout Democrats is Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - CA ) .
Here is the memo he wrote describing why the bill should be killed .
Memo or no memo , all it would take to pass it on the second try is to get 13 representatives who opposed it to sign on .
The simplest way would be to simply give each one $ 1 billion in earmarks for his or her district .
The cost of that is clear : $ 13 billion .
Chances are the administration will be less direct however , and incorporate a few meaningless " improvements " to get the 13 votes .
This time they will count better since a second defeat would be devastating .
Detailed Reactions to the Debate , Minute by Minute Polls after the debate showed that Obama won .
But what is it that he said that people liked ?
To get a better idea of what the high and low points were for each candidate , the Nielsen Company gave a group of 44 undecided Nevada voters a device with a knob that could be set to any number from 0 to 100 .
During the debate , these voters sat there furiously knobbing their reactions into a computer .
Here are the minute - by - minute results .
The best lines of the debate were Obama 's discussion of oil independence and health care .
Veeps Prepping for Tomorrow's Debate
The two Vice - Presidential candidates , Joe Biden and Sarah Palin are busy practicing for tomorrow 's debate at Washington University in St. Louis , MO , just like college students cramming for an exam .
Biden has to make sure he is not condescending to Palin , but he already knows all the material very well .
After Palin 's interview with Katie Couric , it is clear she has a lot to learn .
Conservative columnist George Will said Palin is not qualified to be President .
The editors of Foreign Policy do n't think cramming will help .
The Republicans have been bad - mouthing her for days now to lower expectations so that if she manages to put both a subject and verb in 50 % of her sentences they can say she beat expectations .
In truth , although she is not experienced in national affairs , she is not stupid .
You can't be elected governor with an IQ of 90 .
She is unlikely to make many gaffes .
The real fear is that she will make one humdinger of a gaffe -- like if the moderator asks whether she thinks part of the bailout should involve the issuing of warrants and she interprets this to mean the bank CEOs should be arrested ( as opposed to the issuing of warrants for the treasury to buy their stock later ) .
One piece of bad luck for Palin is that the moderator is a woman , Gwen Ifill , so it will be difficult for spinners to say afterwards that the moderator was not fair to her and asked her hard questions .
If they try that , Ifill will be insulted and say : " Women are just as capable of answering difficult questions as men .
Did you want me to ask for her favorite cookie recipe ? "
On the other hand , Ifill is black , so the spinners will say she was pro-Obama from the start and tried to help Biden .
Race , gender , identity , and experience are going to be mixed in strange ways tomorrow .
Election Day is Here Voting has already started in a dozen states .
It began in Ohio yesterday with students camped out the night before to be able to vote in the morning .
Ohio has a 1 - week window when you can register and vote the same day and both campaigns are targeting it .
Democrats are trying to get students to register and vote all at once .
Republicans are trying to get elderly rural voters to do the same .
Democrats are also trying to get the homeless to vote .
You do n't have to have a home to vote .
However , there are fights in some states to make sure people who have been foreclosed are still considered state residents and can vote .
National Polls Favor Obama
All the national polls favor Obama as follows : Diageo ( Obama +6 ) , Gallup ( Obama +6 ) , Rasmussen ( Obama +6 ) , Research 2000 ( Obama +10 ) , and Washington Post ( Obama + 4 ) .
The mean is an Obama lead of 6.4 % .
A win of 6 % in the popular vote will translate into winning all the swing states and an electoral college landslide .
Intrade Predicts an Obama Landslide Today 's electoral map from www.intrade.com predicts a landslide for Obama .
The bettors think he will sweep all the states Kerry won plus the swing states of Florida , Ohio , Virginia , Colorado , New Mexico , and Nevada .
The only swing state bettors think McCain will take is Missouri , which ironically is the best bellwether since 1900 .
If this map ends up being the final one , Obama wins 339 electoral votes to McCain 's 200 .
Here it is .
Today 's Polls
We have 13 presidential polls today .
What they are saying is that Nevada , Ohio , and Virginia will be close , as expected .
However , Indiana and North Carolina might also be surprisingly close , although McCain is favored in both of them .
Still , two consecutive polls in North Carolina have said it is a statistical tie .
It bears watching .

The fossilized trail of an aquatic creature suggests that animals walked using legs at least 30 million years earlier than had been thought .
The tracks , two parallel rows of small dots , each about 2 millimeters in diameter , date back some 570 million years , to the Ediacaran period .
The Ediacaran preceded the Cambrian period , the time when most major groups of animals first evolved .
Scientists once thought that it was primarily microbes and simple multicellular animals that existed prior to the Cambrian , but that notion is changing , explained Loren Babcock , professor of earth sciences at Ohio State University .
" We keep talking about the possibility of more complex animals in the Ediacaran -- soft corals , some arthropods , and flatworms -- but the evidence has not been totally convincing , " he said .
" But if you find evidence , like we did , of an animal with legs -- an animal walking around -- then that makes the possibility much more likely . "
The trackway of one of the earliest animals , a multilegged creature that walked over the bed of an ancient sea once covering Nevada .
The animal left behind a pair of parallel impressions -- small , round dots in the silt that later became rock .

Ahn , a doctoral student at Ohio State , presented the discovery in a poster session at the Geological Society of America meeting Sunday in Houston .
Coauthors included Margaret Rees of the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , and J. Stewart Hollingsworth of the Institute for Cambrian Studies .
Babcock was surveying rocks in the mountains near Goldfield , Nevada , with Hollingsworth in 2000 when he found the tracks .
" This was truly an accidental discovery .
We came on an outcrop that looked like it crossed the Precambrian - Cambrian boundary , so we stopped to take a look at it .
We just sat down and started flipping rocks over .
We were there less than an hour when I saw it . "
The creature must have stepped lightly onto the soft marine sediment , because its legs only pressed shallow pinpoints into that long - ago sea bed .
But when Babcock flipped over the rock containing those tracks , the low - angle sunlight cast the dots in crisp shadow .
He immediately suspected that the tracks were made by an arthropod , such as one resembling a centipede or millipede , or by a leg - bearing worm .
He could n't be certain of the length of the creature , or the number of legs it had .
But judging from the tracks , he guessed that it carried its centimeter - wide body on many spindly legs .
In 2002 , other researchers reported a similar fossil trail from Canada that dated back to the middle of the Cambrian period , about 520 million years ago .
Another set of tracks found in South China date back to 540 million years ago .
At approximately 570 million years old , this new fossil not only provides the earliest suggestion of animals walking on legs , but it also shows that complex animals were alive on earth before the Cambrian .
Not many macroscopic fossils exist from that time because soft - bodied creatures are not normally preserved .
Babcock is an expert in " exceptional preservation " -- the special chemical , physical and biologic conditions that enabled some soft - bodied creatures to fossilize .
By knowing where to look in the geologic record , he has uncovered a menagerie of unusual fossils , from unusual echinoderms in Nevada to sulfur - eating bacteria in Antarctica .
The shallow sea covering western Nevada 570 million years ago would have been a good site for exceptional preservation .
The sediment surface was probably bound together by a microbial mat -- a cohesive carpet of bacteria and sediment grains .
A creature 's tracks could have been readily preserved when the animal pressed its legs into the sediment .
Babcock says that he is " reasonably certain -- not 100 percent " that the fossil was made by a centipede - like arthropod or a leg - bearing worm .
A fossil of the animal itself would be more definitive .
He is going to continue looking in the same region of Nevada , but that is not the only potential site .
Similar fossils might be found in the White Sea area of Russia , South Australia , Newfoundland or Namibia , where body fossils of Ediacaran organisms have been found .
" I expect that there will be a lot of skepticism , " he said about the discovery .
" There should be .
But I think it will cause some excitement .
And it will probably cause some people to look harder at the rocks they already have .
Sometimes it 's just a matter of thinking differently about the same specimen . "

It ’s been a busy few days for the Phoenix Mars lander rumour - mill .
On Friday , an article was published in Aviation Week reporting an undisclosed source from the NASA team analysing results from the Microscopy , Electrochemistry , and Conductivity Analyzer ( MECA ) had come forward saying Phoenix scientists were in communication with the White House .
Apparently there had been new , “ provocative ” results to come from the MECA , possibly a bigger discovery than last Thursday ’s announcement about the scientific proof of water in the Martian regolith .
Naturally , the blogosphere went crazy in response to this news .
Yesterday , the Phoenix team issued a press release focussing on conflicting results from the MECA and Thermal and Evolved - Gas Analyzer ( TEGA ) instruments .
A MECA sample was found to contain a toxic substance known as perchlorate , usually an oxidizing by - product from industrial processes here on Earth .
However , a recently analysed sample from the TEGA turned up no supporting evidence for perchlorate .
The study is ongoing .
Today , the Phoenix team organized a press conference to discuss a more positive view on the possible discovery of perchlorate , and fired back at recent allegations that science was being withheld from the public …
The Phoenix mission has had an outstanding record of transparency and communicating its science into the public domain .
So , one can understand the frustration mission scientists felt when “ outrageous ” stories ( according to Peter Smith , Phoenix principal investigator ) were circulated by Aviation Week alleging secrecy about Phoenix findings , strongly indicating that something huge had been discovered and the White House had to be notified .
“ We want to set the record straight … we ’re not with - holding anything ” NASA spokesman Dwayne Brown declared at the special press briefing today .
The Phoenix team went on to say that the sketchy details in the Aviation Week article led to the huge amount of “ speculation ” that was thrown around in follow - up stories .
Indeed , there was a significant finding in the works , but the scientists needed more time to analyse the results before issuing a press release on finding perchlorate in the MECA sample .
Although the Aviation Week article did specifically say Phoenix was not capable of discovering life , it did n’t stop a number of reports indicating that life had been discovered on the Red Planet ( hence the need to communicate the discovery with the President ’s Science Advisor first ) .
These speculative claims reached fever - pitch , prompting Phoenix ’s Twitter feed to state “ Heard about the recent news reports implying I may have found Martian life .
Those reports are incorrect . ”
The speed at which these rumours spread was startling and probably took NASA completely off - guard .
This is probably why the perchlorate discovery was announced before a complete and rigorous study could be carried out .
So is perchlorate the death - nail for the possibility of finding suitable conditions for life to be seeded ?
According to Phoenix scientists , oxidizing chemicals are not always ‘ bad news ’ for life .
“ It does not preclude life on Mars .
In fact it is a potential energy source , ” said William Boynton of the University of Arizona .
Indeed , perchlorates have been found in Chile ’s highly arid Atacama Desert , a location often used as an analogue for the Martian landscape .
Organics in nitrate deposits associated with perchlorates have been found in these harsh conditions , possibly indicating life may form in similar circumstances on Mars .
Although the Phoenix scientists are fairly upbeat about this new finding , other scientists not associated with the mission are cautious .
At first glance , perchlorate “ is a reactive compound .
It ’s not usually considered an ingredient for life , ” said Brown University geologist John Mustard .
Regardless , we will have to wait until all the results are in , especially from the follow - up TEGA sample .
Jumping to conclusions are obviously not very helpful to the Phoenix team currently trying to decipher what they are seeing from experiments being carried out by a robot , 400 million miles away .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Jewish voters nationwide have grown increasingly comfortable with voting for Barack Obama for president since the Illinois senator secured the Democratic nomination in June .
They now favor Obama over John McCain by more than 3 to 1 , 74 % to 22 % .
This is based on monthly averages of Gallup Poll Daily tracking results , including interviews with more than 500 Jewish registered voters each month .
Support for Obama among all registered voters was fairly stable from June through September , but then rose sharply in October -- in apparent reaction to the U.S. economic crisis .
By contrast , support for Obama among Jewish voters has expanded more gradually , from the low 60 % range in June and July to 66 % in August , 69 % in September , and 74 % today .
The current proportion of U.S. Jews backing Obama is identical to the level of support the Democratic ticket of John Kerry and John Edwards received in the 2004 presidential election ( 74 % ) .
It is only slightly lower than what Al Gore and Joe Lieberman received in 2000 ( 80 % ) -- when the first Jewish American appeared on the presidential ticket of a major party .
Recent support for Obama is a bit higher among older Jews than among Jews younger than 55 .
According to combined Gallup Poll Daily tracking data from Sept. 1 through Oct. 21 , an average of 74 % of Jews aged 55 and older supported Obama for president across this period , compared with about two - thirds of younger Jews .
The slightly more pro-McCain orientation of the youngest category of Jewish voters ( those 18 to 34 ) could be related to the fact that they are more apt than older Jewish voters to consider themselves political conservatives ( 29 % vs. 16 % ) .
However , ideology does not appear to explain the gap between middle - aged and older Jewish voters .
Whereas those 35 to 54 are more likely to support McCain , they are no more likely than older Jewish voters to describe their political views as conservative .
There is little difference among Jewish voters by age in their basic party identification .
Between 55 % and 57 % of all three age groups are Democratic , 28 % to 30 % are independent , and only 13 % to 17 % are Republican .
Bottom Line
The Obama / Biden ticket is poised to perform about on par with other recent Democratic presidential tickets when it comes to support from American Jewish voters .
Survey Methods
The monthly averages of Gallup Poll Daily tracking reported here span from June 1 , 2008 , through Oct. 21 , 2008 .
Monthly results based on all registered voters are generally based on more than 23,000 interviews conducted in each full month , and 19,400 interviews conducted in the partial month of October .
For results based on samples of this size , the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage points .
The monthly results of Jewish registered voters are generally based on more than 650 interviews conducted in each full month , and 564 interviews conducted in the partial month of October .
The exact sample sizes and associated margins of sampling error for each month 's results are detailed in the accompanying table .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
In PC industry , one of the major challenges is how the manufacturers are able to come out with something unique so that they can distinguish themselves from the rest of competitors ’ products .
One of the good examples here is the PC system released by Shuttle that packages together with an embedded 7 - inch touch screen monitor .
Known as Shuttle D10 , it is a next generation PC product targeted especially for space constraint office or home environment .
Besides suitable to be used as a conventional PC , Shuttle D10 can be fitted well as a central media server that sits in digital home .
Thanks to its compact design and touch screen capability .
With its X86 open architecture , users can run almost any application software on it with preinstalled Windows based OS such as XP or even Vista .
Only one drawback , the touch screen monitor resolution is only 800 X 480 , which is pretty basic and may not suitable for graphics intensive display .
Shuttle D10 is going to be released in Japan market by this week .
Priced below $ 500 , it is quite a good deal , considering a powerful Core 2 Duo E4000 series , 2GB DDR2 memory and common legacy interfaces as well as embedded touch screen module that contribute quite a bit to the total system cost .
The reason children tear open their Christmas presents in a frenzy of dawn excitement while grandparents leave theirs until after lunch comes down to how the ageing brain handles rewards .
Scientists have discovered that a chemical in the brain governing the delivery and feeling of reward is altered physically as a person grows old , which explains why opening presents becomes less exciting .
When young people are involved in receiving prizes their brains become highly activated before and after being given them .
This contrasts with the chemical activation in the brains of older people , said researchers at the US National Institute for Mental Health .
" Knowing how key brain circuits change as we get older may help us to rise to the public health challenge of ageing successfully , " said Karen Berman , whose study is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

You think about all the space in your garage that kayak 's taking up and just start to count how many jars of salsa you could fit on that shelf .
You remember last Cinco de Mayo when you showed up to the big party sans sombrero .
Someone threw a bell pepper at your head .
Do n't you think it 's about time you traded in that kayak for a nice comfortable sombrero ?
Okay .
How about I also throw in a pinata with 300 dollars worth of loose change ?
Think about it ... If you no longer need that 10 - 12 foot sit on top kayak , I have a sombrero that ---- and I 'm not even lying ----- would look stunning on you .
You think you look good in that poncho of yours , you just wait until the ladies get a load of you in that sombrero .
Meow , indeed .
Call [ DELETED ] to talk details about what 's been missing in your life ( my sombrero ) .
Radley Balko makes the libertarian case for Obama as the lesser of two evils .
It 's a must - read for any center - right libertarian - inclined voter :
The Republican Party has exiled its Goldwater - Reagan wing and given up all pretense of any allegiance to limited government .
In the last eight years , the GOP has given us a monstrous new federal bureaucracy in the Department of Homeland Security .
In the prescription drug benefit , it 's given us the largest new federal entitlement since the Johnson administration .
Federal spendingeven on items not related to war or national securityhas soared .
And we now get to watch as the party that 's supposed to be " free market " nationalizes huge chunks of the economy 's financial sector ...
While I 'm not thrilled at the prospect of an Obama administration ( especially with a friendly Congress ) , the Republicans still need to get their clocks cleaned in two weeks , for a couple of reasons .
First , they had their shot at holding power , and they failed .
They 've failed in staying true to their principles of limited government and free markets .
They 've failed in preventing elected leaders of their party from becoming corrupted by the trappings of power , and they 've failed to hold those leaders accountable after the fact .
Congressional Republicans failed to rein in the Bush administration 's naked bid to vastly expand the power of the presidency ( a failure they 're going to come to regret should Obama take office in January ) .
They failed to apply due scrutiny and skepticism to the administration 's claims before undertaking Congress ' most solemn tasksending the nation to war .
I could go on .
As for the Bush administration , the only consistent principle we 've seen from the White House over the last eight years is that of elevating the American president ( and , I guess , the vice president ) to that of an elected dictator .
That is n't hyperbole .
This administration believes that on any issue that can remotely be tied to foreign policy or national security ( and on quite a few other issues as well ) , the president has boundless , limitless , unchecked power to do anything he wants .
They believe that on these matters , neither Congress nor the courts can restrain him .
That 's the second reason the GOP needs to lose .
American voters need to send a clear , convincing repudiation of these dangerous ideas .

Twitter is nothing short of a phenomenon .
At the very least , it connects people to each other through a rich and active exchange of ideas , thoughts , observations , and vision in one , highly conducive ecosystem ( known as the Twitterverse ) .
The social fibers that weave together this unique micromedia network is strengthened by the expertise , respect , trust , admiration , and commonalities .
These fabrics bind the people who breathe life and personality into the global community as well as fueling the disparate micro communities that ultimately extend across the Long Tail .
Of all of the social tools and services that are pervasive throughout our digital society , only a select few communities can boast the pseudo fanatical conviction that Twitter ‘s users unanimously possess .
Twitter is quickly gaining momentum , support and market inertia and is on direct path to mainstream awareness .
Compete.com numbers show that roughly 2.5 million people visit Twitter.com each month , growing at about 250,000 – 500,000 users per month and up over 440 % since this time last year .
Just as a comparison Facebook receives about 41 million unique visitors per month .
Twitter is not only embraced and cherished by the people who rely on it for expression , insight , news , and communication , it is also the darling of the developer community .
Almost every single day , a passionate developer , b2 b or b2c application company , or tech enthusiast will develop a new tool , service , or solution to make Twitter a more personalized , professional , streamlined , effective , and / or fun experience .
If you live in the world of socialized marketing , communications , relationships , communities , research , service , digital anthropology , fundraising , publicity , product development , publishing , events , online reputation management ( ORM ) or simply seeking to increase your proficiency and efficiency on Twitter , there is surely no shortage of tools and applications that can help you .
I created this snapshot guide to help you extend the reach and the efficacy of Twitter for your personal brand as well as the brand you represent .
This is the first part of a multi-part series .
If you ’d like me to review and include additional tools and services , please share them in the comments and I ’ll integrate into the next rev .

More to come …
by Michael Tracey
Several incidents in particular focused my attention not on the murder but on how we seemed to be dealing with it as a culture .
In March 1997 the CU branch of the Society of Professional Journalists organized a forum on cheque book journalism , particularly as it related to the Ramsey case .
The panel consisted of two reporters from the National Enquirer , a reporter for the cable tabloid programme Hard Copy and Chuck Green of the Denver Post .
Green , a strangely bitter , cynical man was known to be hyper-critical of the investigation , and of the role of the DA ’s office in pursuing the case and in what Green took to be the protection of the Ramseys .
“ …it ’s not an important story , but it ’s entertaining ”
One of the many myths that would come to cling to the case like leeches on skin was that John Ramsey was plugged into a Boulder power and cultural elite , one which had circled the wagons to protect their own .
It was not true but its mythic potency served a useful purpose of constructing the sense of guilt and responsibility which so many seemed to crave .
The composition of the panel on a bleak , cold evening struck me as grotesque , but the room was packed with students ready to sit at the feet of these towering examples of the Fourth Estate .
Here were paraded tales of unlimited expenses , traveling hither and thither across the country , picking away at the scabs of society .
It was altogether an appalling experience , particularly given that while clearly many of the students in attendance were not taken in others had eyes that grew ever wider .
I was sitting on the front row , feeling angry and despondent at the proceedings .
At one point I asked Green a question : “ I know this is a big story because you , the media , made it a big story , but do you think it is an important story ? ”
He paused for barely a moment and then uttered a comment that while certainly honest was as appalling as it was revealing : “ no , it ’s not an important story , but it ’s entertaining … ”
There it was in all its grotesque shabbiness , a cynical truth that spoke volumes not just about Green , or the case , or the media but about the essential nature of the society at the end of the century .
The torture and murder of a six year old child was now a form of entertainment .
As I pondered the comment in all its horror and listened to the drivel that spewed from the mouths of the other panelists it seemed clear as could be that the Barbarians had indeed crossed the Tiber .
A couple of months later I was asked to talk to the monthly luncheon of the Boulder Democratic Party Women ’s group .
The other speaker was Mimi Wesson , a law professor at CU .
My role was to comment on the media coverage , hers on the legal issues that the case had thrown up .
At one point a lady of extended years stood up to ask a question .
She wore a nice floral dress , and looked every bit the image of everyone ’s favourite grandma .
She then asked Mimi , in a voice as shrill as the early morning call of a shrike , “ why do n’t the cops just go in there and grab the Ramseys and take them down to the police station and get a confession out of them … ”
Applause swept round the room .
Mimi responded bravely “ err , because they have constitutional rights , we do n’t live in a police state etc etc … ”
What caught my attention however was not just the exchange but the fact that everyone ’s grandma was literally frothing at the mouth .
It was a terrible sight , troubling and frightening in what it meant for some of the most essential guiding principles of any civilized society – fairness , compassion , rationality , impartiality , the presumption of innocence , understanding based on evidence .
I came to think of these kinds of judgments as the problem of ‘ the face , ’ the extraordinary way in which people would look at the faces of John and Patsy Ramsey and see guilt .
One e-mail posted on the internet from Theresa16@aol.com . , said – and I reproduce it here exactly as she wrote it – “ I think PATRICIA RAMSEY killed JonBenet .
I must confess that each & every time I see patsy on television I get a COLD CHILL UP MY SPINE … patricia ramsey is EVIL … i am not trying to be cruel / nasty .
but …WHY does patricia ramsey CONTINUOUSLY have that “ GUILTY SMILE ” ??? … ”
Serious Juju and Lactate Fed Omniscience
There was another occasion when David and I were showing clips from the documentary at the Denver Press Club , a rather dowdy place with sodden hacks at the bar and a genial barman .
At the end of the evening , after much discussion which revolved around the question of whether the Ramsey ’s were complicit in their daughter ’s death , a female journalist suddenly said “ I think John Ramsey is a pedophile , he has a twitch . ”
This was the sort of statement that all one can do in response is stare in blank amazement .
But here we had a member of the fourth estate deciding , like some 19th century quack , that she could divine character from the physiology of appearance .
And the assertion that there was a relationship between a twitch and pedophilia was up there with all those stereotypical child molesters who are fat and squat and slavering .
The other slight problem with her analysis was that , after spending endless hours in an editing suite staring at John Ramsey ’s face , I never did see a twitch .
Her sight of this affliction seemed to suggest that the eye does indeed see what the heart desires , because it is quite clear that she wanted to see the pedophile in him .
It came as no surprise when , in conversation , she hinted that there had been sexual abuse in her own life , not that this is sufficient excuse to accuse someone of abuse , willy - nilly .
I remember another occasion , one that I pick from innumerable possible examples , that was similar .
I was being driven to Denver to do the Larry King programme .
They had sent me a car , it was August and I was heading down I - 36 in a Lincoln Town Car .
The driver was Steve , a soft spoken man , as broad as he was tall , with a wispy beard and shaved head .
He would not have looked out of place at a leather bar in the Village .
In reality he was married with three children , whom he obviously adored , along with what he called “ 200 close relatives ” in the Denver area , about whom he clearly cared .
We chatted and he asked me about the King show and so it was that it emerged that we were to discuss the Ramsey case .
He paused and then said “ what ’s always puzzled me is why they look so guilty , especially her , Patsy looks guilty . ”
What I wondered , and not for the first time , does guilt look like ?
And why did such an obviously decent man utter such dangerous bigotry ?
There is one other , powerful example worth recalling , of this tendency to hate but not know .
It was the annual Christmas party of the SJMC , in 1998 – our documentary on the media coverage of the case had gone out on A&E in the Fall .
Colleagues , friends and enemies , milling around , making small talk and trying to be pleasant .
In several such conversations the Ramsey case emerged .
In one I was talking to a well known , senior professor .
She looked sharp , in the sense of flinty rather then be-suited , her skin was pale and taught .
She suddenly muttered , “ I think they are despicable . ”
“ Who ? ” I asked , somewhat dumbly .
“ The Ramseys . ” “ Why ? ” I asked somewhat stupidly .
“ Because they abused and killed their daughter . ” I replied : “ Tell me why you think that ? ” “ Because , ” said this senior professor , in a major research university “ I ’m a mother of two , I know … ” I remember thinking , this mothering thing is serious juju , lactate fed omniscience .
I also had an overwhelming desire for an extremely stiff drink as I contemplated this perfect coming together of vile bigotry and voodoo stupidity .
The Illusion of Knowledge
And yet I had heard something similar so many times in the weeks and months after the murder , a deep belief among so many people in the guilt of the Ramseys , a belief that could not possibly rest on anything of any substance since there clearly was absolutely nothing that was publicly known that could justify that belief .
There was one thing , however , that could not be avoided , and that was the story which had been told by the media , a story drenched with theory , innuendo , allegation , rumour , a story that took as given the likely involvement of the parents .
It was a situation that reminded one of similar statements by two very different people : Josh Billings ’ comment that “ ignorance ai n’t so much a matter of not knowing , but knowing so many things wot ai n’t so ” and Daniel Boorstein ’s that “ the problem is not ignorance but the illusion of knowledge . ”
If ever there was a case were ignorance masqueraded as knowledge it is the public and the media and the presumed guilt of John and Patsy Ramsey .
Initially the media focus was on John , who was publicly and repeatedly called a child molester and a killer .
Then the focus moved inexorably to Patsy .
There would be those who would argue that Burke was involved , and even JonBenet ’s half - brother John Andrew .
The fact that there was video footage of him taking money from an ATM in Atlanta on Christmas night did not necessarily deter some from this theory .
One especially nasty tactic adopted by the tabloids would be to get someone to goad him into a reaction , with a photographer ready to photo this “ aggressive ” young man , lending force to the idea that he could be a killer .
To this day , over a decade later , I still hear comments from even apparently sane and reasonable people , unaware of their ignorance as to the most basic facts , who say they just “ assume , ” that the mother “ did it . ”
End of story .
No reflection .
No sense of the appalling injustice of making such judgments on the basis of a feeling .
There was , and is , an almost religious fervor to those who believed , and believe , in the Ramsey ’s guilt , the fervor in fact , of the true believer , and anyone who questioned that ‘ truth ’ became a heretic .
I understand that underlying much of this is the child herself .
In some photos a natural beauty shines through .
In others there was the coquettish child of the pageants .
In fact it was clear that much of the issue of the apparent loathing of the Ramseys by strangers begins and in a sense ends with JonBenet herself , with her looks and with her name and most of all with the photos and videos of her in those pageants .
There is certainly something about the pageant world that comes over as so kitsch , cheapened culture , “ bread soaked in perfume ” to use Robert Essler ’s bitter comment .
In a remarkable outburst on Larry King Live , Janet McReynolds ( wife of Bill McReynolds , who played Santa at a number of Ramsey Christmas parties and who would become in some eyes a serious suspect ) captured this quite brilliantly – some might say too , and disturbingly , brilliantly .
She said :
“ I feel that …. the media is ( sic ) saying to this collective community … in some way she deserved to die .
That , at least , is a message that I am getting :
She deserved to die , she was too beautiful .
She deserved to die because she was from an affluent family .
She deserved to die because she lived in an upscale community .
She deserved to die because her family taught her gestures which might be interpreted as sexually suggestive .
She deserved to die because she was in beauty pageants …..
And to me , that is a crucifixion of an innocent victim . ”
These are strong words .
In the bizarre Alice in Wonderland aspect of the case it is worth mentioning that Janet McReynolds ’ daughter and a friend had , twenty years earlier , been abducted and assaulted .
The date was the 26th December .
Janet also wrote a play , Hey Rube , years before about the torture and murder of a young girl whose body is found in a basement .
Bill himself had a harp .
On the wooden frame were written the names of dead children .
Janet McReynolds ’ observation to King had , however , at least to me , a certain insight .
There was a deep , pervasive feeling it seemed that no child should have been dressed as JonBenet was .
No child should have worn mini-adult clothing , prancing and preening and singing .
It was this more than anything that surely lay behind the rush to judgment about the parents , that fed the fires of speculation , that so readily and for so many led to the conclusion that this was all about sex , abuse and therefore death .
The fact that there are enormous numbers of children , pretty babies one and all , engaged in pageants seemed irrelevant , even though it is not unreasonable to argue that if there was a relationship between the pageant business and child murder there would be a lot more dead babies in our land .
Over time I came to feel , in the words of Rene Girard in a different time and place , that public opinion had become “ overexcited and ready to accept the most absurd rumours … ”
It did show , however , that the mesalliance between a few members of law enforcement and the media had worked a dark , mendacious magic , and that what happened in Boulder in the days and months and years that followed was perilously close to a conspiracy .
A conspiracy to have executed – because if ever was a capital crime , a homicidal act of unusual viciousness , this was it– two people who were innocent .
It was a spectacle that one should never see in mature democracy , with respect for the rule of law and the rights of citizens to be presumed innocent .
It was not only perilously close to conspiracy , malevolent and dark , it was all so very sleazy .
Real sleaze , not the run of the mill , pathetic thieving of a few bucks here , a few more there ; not the wasted curb crawler , the pimp on the corner , the hooker in his sight ; the dime - bag drug addict .
That ’s not sleaze , that ’s wreckage .
True sleaze is the absence of a guiding morality , an approach to life that is not conditioned by an ethic , by any fundamental sense of right and wrong , an amoral place in which ends justify any means , even if that involves lying – repeatedly .
Trotsky once said that “ the end may justify the means , so long as there is something that justifies the end . ”
There was n’t .
For many of those in the media and law enforcement , who connived in the witch - hunt , the chickens would eventually come home to roost accompanied , in the immortal words of Hunter S. Thompson , by several enormous black condors .
The problem was and is that the assault on reason , the trashing of their rights and the shredding of their character almost worked , as evidenced by the overwhelming disbelief that it did n’t .
October 13 , 1999 ; the Justice Center , Boulder Colorado
A short , paunchy man walks out to the lawn in front of the Center to make an announcement .
District Attorney Alex Hunter , has been in office for decades but he knows that his reputation is basically in tatters , that the events of the previous 34 months , the hysteria , the mistakes , the mendacity , the conflicts had damaged him , and so many others , in a way that was utterly beyond redemption .
Hunter is there to announce to the whole world the results of the months long investigation by a grand jury into the murder of JonBenet .
Surrounded by a throng of journalists , gawkers , cops , microphones , cameras Hunter announces : “ … we do not have sufficient evidence to justify filing charges against anyone who has been investigated at this time … ”
One could sense in Boulder , across the state , across the whole nation and beyond bewilderment , fury , disbelief and , for a small few , unimaginable relief .
At an undisclosed location in east Boulder , John and Patsy Ramsey , who had returned from Atlanta so that their arrest would be out of sight of their son , Burke , and their other family , were gathered with their attorneys , Bryan Morgan , who was representing John Ramsey , Pat Burke , for Patsy Ramsey and Hal Haddon , the eminence grise of the whole defence team .
A few close friends were also there to share the agony .
Patsy and John knelt in front of the television , holding hands .
In her other hand Patsy clutched what had been JonBenet ’s favourite toy , a small porcelain kitten .
In deep agony she moaned that she knew she was going to prison .
As they heard Hunter ’s words they screamed and hugged each other .
A great wave of relief washed over all those in the room .
They knew that if there was no indictment now , there almost certainly never would be .
They had expected the worst .
Bryan Morgan left the room , went outside , sat on rock and wept .
John Ramsey followed and placed a comforting arm around his shoulder .
In Colorado Springs , retired detective Lou Smit had been driving his truck as the announcement was about to be made .
Smit had been hired by Alex Hunter to act as an investigator for the DA ’s office back in the spring of 1997 .
He was hired because of his extraordinary reputation as a detective who had conducted 250 homicide investigations and had never lost a case in court .
When he arrived in Boulder , in that spring of 1997 , he had assumed , because he had been following the story in the media , that the Ramseys were probably involved , and that proving this would be a “ slam dunk . ”
These many months later , as he pulled over to the side of the road to listen to Hunter ’s statement , he knew more than anyone that the case may have been many things , but slam dunk it was not .
Smit had come to author what became known as “ the Intruder theory , ” his utter conviction that a high - risk , deeply violent , sexually sadistic pedophile had entered the Ramsey home , taken JonBenet from her room , asphyxiated her as an act of torture , sexually assaulted her and finished her off with a blow to the head .
He resigned from the case in September of 1999 , just ahead of the conclusion of the grand jury , because he refused to go along with what he assumed would be the indictment and , in his eyes , the railroading of two innocent people .
As he waited , that Fall day , sitting in his truck by the side of his road , he was gripped with a deep fear that what he would hear was that the Ramseys had been indicted , the first step on their painful and inevitable walk to the gas chamber .
As he heard Hunter ’s words , that their would be no indictment , a crushing sense of relief washed over him and , like those others in Boulder gathered around the Ramseys , he started to sob .
In all of their minds they knew that despite everything , despite the fact that their had been what was in effect a conspiracy by law enforcement to have the Ramseys convicted , despite public hysteria and a malevolent media , despite all that , a certain kind of justice had prevailed and a profound injustice avoided .
A Devastating Critique
Elsewhere , everywhere , in homes and offices across America , disbelief .
Since the beginning of January 1997 , when the media first began to really cover the case , the American pubic had lived within a narrative for which there could be only one ending : indictment , trial , conviction , execution – certainly of Patsy and possibly of John as an accomplice .
That this was n’t going to happen beggared belief because , of course , we all “ knew ” they were guilty .
It is vitally important to remember just how certain almost everyone was that there would indeed be a trial and conviction .
The lawyers had already discussed with law enforcement the way in which the Ramseys would be handed over , and had arranged with a bank the monies that would be needed for any bail .
That there was n’t going to be a trial one suspects , though this has never been made clear , was because Hunter did not ask the grand jury to vote .
Had he done so they may well have indicted , and Hunter was smart enough to know the difficulty he would have at trial .
That he felt this way was almost certainly because he understood two things : he would be up against a superb defence team ; and he knew the power of the case that Smit had developed , one which had the backing of America ’s premier crime profiler , John Douglas and the extremely bright assistant DA Trip DeMuth .
DeMeuth had been asked by his boss , Pete Hofstrom , to “ defence ” the case – that is , to look at the evidence in the way that the defence attorneys would .
On 12 May 1998 he presented his report to the police and members of the DAs .
I have read the report .
He picked away at the investigation , its intellectual and conceptual flaws , its clear biases , the brute truths it had refused to face , like a buzzard devouring dead carrion .
It is a devastating critique .
The police case was inherently flawed and weak .
We can see this now .
Then was a different story .
On Saturday September 25 1999 David Mills and I had lunch with Bryan Morgan at Turley ’s Restaurant in Boulder .
I had originally suggested the Regal Harvest House but Bryan demurred at that saying that there were too many paparazzi there .
This was only a short time before the grand jury would report its findings .
Boulder was once more crawling with journalists and camera crews , and Bryan was in no mood to be caught on camera talking to the two of us .
His mood was also sombre , his mind utterly convinced that the Ramseys were going to be indicted .
His reasoning seemed strong , resting on the received truth that grand juries will always go with the prosecution – the clichéd phrase is that any prosecutor can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich .
He felt that Alex Hunter , the DA , had lost control of events and that Michael Kane , an assistant DA who was leading the grand jury inquiry was determined to indict .
I tried to argue , somewhat precociously since Bryan had vast legal experience , that the mistake he was making was two - fold .
Hunter did not seem to me to be out of the loop – I knew this because of a request I had from him for some information about another suspect , a request which could only be interpreted to mean that he and his office were looking at other people as possible suspects , even as the grand jury was drawing to a close .
The nature of the request , and its timing , made it clear to me that he was far from convinced that the Ramseys would , or should , be indicted .
It also seemed clear to me that this was not like all the other cases which fed that conventional wisdom about the malleability of grand jurors .
Morgan , though , thought differently .
We had met to discuss our plans for a second documentary , that would investigate the investigation .
For that we would need the cooperation of his clients .
He told us that this would depend upon the results of the grand jury , that this would , however , be our last conversation until things were resolved and that he was now “ going into trial mode . ”
We shook hands at the end of lunch with the clear sense that we would not be speaking with him for a long time , until in fact the trial was over .
In the first documentary that David and I made about the case , we drew heavily on the media accounts , the story that was told about the death , the alleged role of the family , particularly of JonBenet ’s parents .
David knew little about the case , but we had both long shared a growing concern as to how the media in general , and the news media in particular , were evolving as we both saw on the far horizon the growing , dark cloud of market forces .
We had first met after the publication of my biography of Sir Hugh Greene , Director General of the BBC from 1960 to 1969 .
Hugh was not just a great public service broadcaster , he was a great and brave man with a passionate belief in certain fundamental rights .
I had met him when I wrote a chapter of my doctoral thesis about the manner in which he was forced to retire from the BBC – he was , to the government of the day too independent , a troublesome priest who had to go .
When I got my doctorate in 1975 I had the temerity ( since I had at that time published hardly anything ) to ask him if I could write his biography , to which he immediately said yes , an answer which would prove to be even more life - changing than entering the world of a murdered child in Boulder .

McCaskill 's edge
I mentioned a few days ago that Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill 's mild affect masks a bit of a killer , and that she 's perhaps the Obama campaign 's deftest surrogate on the attack .
But I was still kind of amused by her brief interaction with Mitt Romney in the press file just now .
McCaskill was stepping out of her chair at the end of an MSNBC interview , and Romney was up next .
She and a staffer unplugged her various wires , and she handed Romney the earpiece the guests use to hear the host .
" I spit on this before I put it in , " she said to Romney , with a sweet smile .
UPDATE : Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom emails : " You should have seen what she did to the chair . "
UPDATE : McCaskill spokeswoman Maria Speiser says the exchange began when Romney said , " You do n't have an ear infection , do you ? " and that McCaskill was joking back in response .

If you are planning a trip to Italy , you will find that low cost holidays in the Mediterranean country will offer a wide range of things for you to see and do .
Regardless of your interests , whether it ’s fashion , sport , culture or food , you are sure to find a break in Italy will give you the chance to take part in fascinating activities and see some wonderful sights .
And this could particularly prove to be the case if you book Sardinia holidays .
The island is the second largest in the Mediterranean region , so you are bound to find low cost Sardinia holidays provide you with the chance to lie back on the beach and take things easy .
Its location in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea makes Sardinia a perfect place for pursuits such as kitesurfing and sailing , while you can also visit a number of archaeological sites including the Ruins of Nora .
But Sardinia is by no means the only place worth visiting while on a low cost holiday to Italy .
Rome – the nation ’s capital – can make a fantastic destination for a city break and is home to ancient attractions including the Colosseum , which was built almost 2,000 years ago , the Pantheon and the Roman Forum .
If you want to find out more about the city ’s historic past , you may also want to visit its catacombs and Piazza del Campidoglio , although if you are seeking something more modern you might want to take a trip to the National Gallery of Modern Art .
The Vatican City can also be found in Rome and while it is technically a separate country from Italy it can be a great place to visit while enjoying a break in the Italian capital .
As well as being the official residence of the Pope , it is home to St Peter ’s Basilica – the world ’s largest church .
Milan can also be a great place to visit on a city break , with the Leonardo da Vinci National Science and Technology Museum and its gothic cathedral – which is the largest in the world – among its numerous attractions .
Twice a year Milan hosts an international fashion week , drawing in designers , models and celebrities from across the globe .
A visit to the Milan Aquarium is great , meanwhile , if you want to get back to nature – more than 100 species of marine life can be seen here .
Football fans , however , may wish to visit the San Siro ground to watch either of the city ’s teams – AC Milan and Internazionale – play .
Venice ’s world - famous network of canals can also make for the perfect setting for a short break .
Why not hire a gondola and take in the city ’s breathtaking architecture from the water ?
You can also head to the Piazza San Marco – or St Mark ’s Square as it translates in English – for a spot of people - watching .
As you enter the square , make sure you keep an eye out for the clock tower on the top of the Procuratie Vecchie .
This ornate structure was built in 1496 .
Venice can also be a great destination for film lovers .
Not only has it been the setting for numerous productions , but it is also home to the world ’s oldest cinema festival .
Alternatively , you might want to check out the churches and historic monuments that can be found around Lake Como in Lombardy , before getting back to nature and looking for the local wildlife .
The Leaning Tower of Pisa and Royal Palace of Turin are just two of Italy ’s many other attractions , so no matter where you go you can be sure there will be plenty of things for you to see and do .

Paul Slocum is an artist and musician from Texas who combines art and digital culture with a supremely punk attitude .
His newest work is on display at Dunn and Brown Contemporary in Dallas and is made up of a vintage ( euphemism for “ garage sale ” ) amplifier hooked up to a laptop running software of his own creation .
This software is called the “ Pi House Generator ” , and randomly generates house music using the number PI .
Much like the number itself , the music stream never repeats and constantly continues to evolve .
The software progressively calculates the sequence of digits in pi , starting at 3.14 and progressing towards infinity .
As the program calculates the digits , it feeds the results into an algorithmic music generator containing my structural criteria for house music .
The resulting piece of house music is infinitely long and static and never repeats itself .
The number of processor cycles required to calculate pi increase with the number of digits it is calculated to .
After months or years of playing the song , any fixed computer hardware will be unable to calculate the digits fast enough for the song to play continuously .
The rate that the number of processor cycles increase per pi-digits is bound by the formula Z*log ( N ) ; however based on Moore ’s Law , processor power per dollar increases at an exponential rate – doubling every two years .
BY upgrading computers regularly with market trends , the song can be played indefinitely .

There is something inherently beautiful about combining mathematics with music , especially when the result does n’t sound like it is actually a product of math – too many pop songs fall into this category !
Because I ’m both a math freak AND a music freak , I spoke with Paul a little bit more about how the software works , and he told me :
New pi digits are calculated every minute or so , and they are used to choose sample points , sample arrangement , drum samples , and drum patterns .
I also use the pi digits to seed a pseudo - random number generator so that I can generate as many random numbers as I need from a pi digit set .
Also , some elements are cyclic , like the samples sets used and general arrangement limitations .

Spectator Sports Spending in 2007 Spectator spending rose 4.8 % to a record $ 32.00 billion , according to David Broughton , research director of Street & Smith 's Sports Business Journal .
The total has risen every year since he began tracking in 1991 , primarily due to the addition of premium seating and luxury boxes .

Sports also paying a price amid struggling economy Count Kent Haines out when it comes to buying Boston Red Sox or New England Patriots tickets for the foreseeable future .
Those clubs have the highest average ticket prices in Major League Baseball and the National Football League .
And because of the economic crisis , the Haines family of North Kingstown , R.I. , is cutting spending .
" In this sky - is - falling economy , attending a pro sporting event is last on my list , " says Haines , recalling that in May he dropped $ 250 for tickets , parking , food and a souvenir for himself and his 10 - year - old son , Zach , at Fenway Park .
" When you combine the cost of the tickets with the effort it takes to get our fannies in the seats , watching on TV with my wife and kids sounds pretty good right now . "
Haines ' story is echoed by a rising number of fans across the USA , a reflection of how the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression is stretching and even severing the bond between fans and sports teams .

FAN REACTION : How economy impacts them
At a time when many professional and college sports teams are expanding stadiums , adding expensive luxury suites and raising ticket prices to increase revenue , the economic crisis is exacerbating a disconnect between the teams and fans who are being priced out of live sports .
The sports industry remains relatively healthy : Fans shelled out a record $ 32.06 billion on tickets , parking , concessions , premium seats and on - site merchandise sales in 2007 , a 4.8 % increase from the year before , says David Broughton , research director at Street & Smith 's SportsBusiness Journal .
Average ticket prices for the NFL , MLB and NHL all rose 5 % to 10 % this year , according to Jon Greenberg , executive editor of Team Marketing Report , which tracks ticket prices .
But even as wealthy teams such as the NFL's Dallas Cowboys , New York Giants and New York Jets are asking season ticketholders to pay thousands of dollars — or even hundreds of thousands — for seats in luxurious new stadiums , there are signs of economic stress throughout sports .
Cash - strapped fans nationwide tell USA TODAY they 're buying fewer tickets to sporting events or trying to unload those they have to family , friends and strangers .
Some are opting for cheaper seats and spending less on food , drinks and souvenirs .
Others are giving up live sports for their high - definition TVs .
Meanwhile , after prosperous years in which teams routinely jacked up prices , some leagues and clubs are signaling to fans that they feel their pain .
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced Thursday a price cut on some Super Bowl tickets .
But 25 % of the seats will be priced at an all - time - high $ 1,000 , league spokesman Brian McCarthy said .
Teams in other sports are cutting prices , offering goodies and retail gimmicks such as " buy now , pay later " to get ticketholders to keep buying .
The specter of empty seats , unsold luxury boxes and bankrupt or vanishing sponsors is striking fear into industry players large and small .
Leagues and teams are laying off staffers and taking a hard look at expenses : • Anticipation of a slowing U.S. economy has led the NBA to lay off 80 employees , or 9 % of its domestic work force , Commissioner David Stern said this week .
The Charlotte Bobcats laid off about 35 staff members Sept. 26 .
Bobcats President Fred Whitfield said the team must become " more efficient as a business in the current economic climate . "
" Six months ago , we were saying sports was recession - resistant rather than recession - proof .
But I do n't think anything is recession - resistant , " NBA Deputy Commissioner Adam Silver says .
• The NFL's Goodell said Tuesday that the nation 's richest professional sports league — one that receives $ 3.7 billion a year from TV networks alone — faces " some significant belt tightening . "
Ticket prices " may be an issue we deal with coming into next season , " Goodell added .
• Attendance at NASCAR races this season is down " in the single digits " percentage - wise , spokesman Andrew Giangola says .
Several tracks are trimming ticket prices for 2009 races .
Michigan International Speedway is reducing prices on 23 % of its seats for its two Sprint Cup races next year , spokeswoman Sammie Lukaskiewicz says .
" People are struggling , but they still want to see NASCAR racing , " she says .
• After suffering a 13.4 % attendance drop this season , baseball 's Oakland Athletics will reduce average ticket prices by 5 % for the 2009 season .
" The economy 's hurting everyone 's budget .
We have to keep our product affordable , " Athletics vice president Jim Leahey says .
• Other teams are stepping up " buy now , pay later " campaigns to try to make season - ticket packages more attractive .
The NBA 's New Jersey Nets chief executive officer , Brett Yormark , is pushing a full season - ticket package that allows buyers to attend games this fall — but not pay in full until January .
More than 100 customers have signed up , the team says .
In the NHL , the Los Angeles Kings allowed full - season - ticket buyers to stretch payments over an eight - month period ending in January , says Mike Altieri , vice president of broadcasting .
In another twist , the St. Louis Blues took a cue from Priceline.com and invited fans to " name your price " for tickets .
• To urge season ticketholders to renew early , the NBA 's Miami Heat offered prizes including $ 5,000 for property taxes and $ 4,000 for utility bills , spokeswoman Lorrie - Ann Diaz says .
" We at the league and our teams do n't want to see our season ticketholders lose their location because of a short - term economic issue , " Silver says .
' Priced … out of the market '
Fans have complained for years that rising ticket prices — and new stadiums that emphasize boosting revenue through luxury suites and club seats — have been driving the middle class out of stadiums .
Many " old - time fans who are n't so well - to - do have been priced right out of the market , " says Raymond Sauer , professor of economics at Clemson University and founder of The Sports Economist blog .
" They 've created a set of disgruntled fans who used to go to games but now watch on TV , " Sauer says .
" They 've ( been replaced by ) richer , corporate fans . "
The anger of " real sports fans " was building before the economy turned sour , says Brian Blight , a Detroit Lions fan from Peoria , Ill .
He says that for fans increasingly weary of rising ticket prices , $ 7 beers and $ 20 parking fees , the downturn has a silver lining .
" Sports has it coming , " Blight says .
" It 's just been greed , greed , greed . "
Blight vows not to spend another nickel on the Lions until they cut ticket prices and start winning .
He says rising gas costs caused him and his wife , Edith , to eliminate several planned trips to Chicago , St. Louis and other Midwest cities to see games involving baseball 's Detroit Tigers and St. Louis Cardinals .
Blight says he hopes the economic downturn transforms sports , as it did with real estate , from a seller 's to a buyer 's market — and gives fans the power to demand lower prices .
" Fans need to stand up — and speak out , " he says .
Sports economist Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College in Northhampton , Mass. , predicts the economic shakeout will drive down ticket prices , flatten spiraling player salaries in pro sports and force the sale of struggling franchises .
A tight credit market , he adds , could delay some stadium construction projects .
Suite deals going sour ?
The economic crisis coincides with a nationwide building boom in stadiums stuffed with pricey luxury suites .
Such boxes can run from $ 200,000 to $ 1 million per year .
Food and booze are extra .
The Dallas Cowboys and New York Yankees , Mets , Giants and Jets are getting top dollar for suites in their new buildings .
The Giants and Jets will share a venue .
But Bill Dorsey , executive director of the Association for Luxury Suite Directors , says teams across all sports in Seattle and Atlanta are struggling to fill boxes in their existing facilities .
The economic crunch has put a focus on personal seat license fees , or PSLs .
These are one - time charges , often running thousands of dollars , that give fans the right to buy season tickets for an extended period of time .
The Cowboys , Giants and Jets are using PSLs to help finance their new stadiums opening in 2009 and 2010 .
The teams report their PSL sales are strong , but some of their fans are increasingly anxious about the cost .
Steve Thurman of Dallas says he has " buyer 's remorse " after forking over $ 8,000 to the Cowboys this year for the right to buy two upper - deck seats in the team 's new stadium for the next 30 years .
He still has to shell out another $ 2,330 for his 2009 tickets and a parking pass .
" With the way the economy 's going , I would not have made that deal , " Thurman says .
" I might be at the corner of Texas Stadium with a tin cup before this is all over . "
The economy 's downturn also has created havoc in what had been a lucrative arena for sports teams : naming rights .
During the boom years , many companies paid millions of dollars to plaster their corporate monikers across stadiums and golf and tennis tournaments .
But the recent frenzy of bankruptcies and mergers on Wall Street has put some deals in limbo .
Take Philadelphia's Wachovia Center , home of the NBA 's 76ers and the NHL's Flyers .
The arena is poised for its fourth name change in 12 years because of Wells Fargo 's proposed takeover of Wachovia .
Julia Tunis Bernard , a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo , says " it 's too early to tell " whether the company will rename the arena or the PGA Tour 's Wachovia Championship .
With Wall Street reeling , the Giants and Jets are still searching for a company to buy naming rights to the $ 1.6 billion stadium the teams will share starting in 2010 .
Negotiations with the German firm Allianz fell apart after fans and Jewish groups criticized the insurance company 's historical ties to Nazi Germany .
Teams that sell naming rights to unstable companies can get left holding the bag .
Just ask the Houston Astros .
In 1999 , Enron agreed to pay $ 100 million over 30 years to put its name on the new Enron Field .
Within two years , Enron filed for bankruptcy .
The team paid $ 2.1 million to buy back the rights .
In 2002 , Minute Maid stepped in with a 28 - year , $ 100 million deal to rename the stadium Minute Maid Park .
The good news ?
The NFL , MLB , NBA , NHL and NASCAR are protected by multiyear TV and sponsorships deals , says Bill Daly , deputy commissioner of the NHL .
He says " 60 % to 70 % of our revenue is contractually committed already .
It does provide a layer of security . "
' People want entertainment '
For some fans , the rising cost of attending games is still worth the experience .
Rick Sanderson , a University of Tennessee graduate , says he 'll pay whatever it costs to attend Volunteers football games .
" People want entertainment .
College football is entertainment , " he says .
Mark Franklin of North Scottsdale , Ariz. , says his season tickets to the NHL's Phoenix Coyotes " are the only positive thing " in his life right now .
" The economy 's going to hell in a handbasket , " he says .
" I want to enjoy the game and take my mind off the financial pressure that 's out there . "

NASA has announced the development of an energy generator for the moon based on nuclear power .
The new power system should have sufficient power to service astronauts ’ research needs .
Although still in its initial stages , several companies are already working with NASA to complete it in time for the planned return to the moon late the next decade .
Since NASA astronauts will need power sources upon their return to the moon to establish a lunar outpost , engineers have explored the possibility of nuclear fission as a power source for the planed lunar colony .
Furthermore , NASA has taken initial steps towards a non-nuclear technology demonstration of this type of system .
A fission surface power system on the moon has the potential to generate a steady 40 kilowatts of electric power , enough for about eight houses on earth .
By splitting uranium atoms in a reactor , heat is generated ; this heat can be converted into electric power .
The fission surface power system is capable of producing large amounts of power in harsh environments , like those on the surface of the moon or Mars , because it does not rely on sunlight .
The primary components of fission surface power systems are a heat source , power conversion , heat rejection and power conditioning and distribution .
Although one of the primary objectives in the project is achieving a working nuclear fission , other manners of power generation have been researched as well .
Lee Mason , principal investigator for the test at NASA ’s Glenn Center in Cleveland , said : “ Our goal is to build a technology demonstration unit with all the major components of a fission surface power system and conduct non-nuclear , integrated system testing in a ground - based space simulation facility .
Our long - term goal is to demonstrate technical readiness early in the next decade , when NASA is expected to decide on the type of power system to be used on the lunar surface . ”
Glenn recently contracted for the design and analysis of two different types of advanced power conversion units as an early step in the development of a full system - level technology demonstration .
These power conversion units are necessary to process the heat produced by the nuclear reactor and efficiently convert it to electrical power .
In order to bring the idea to realization , two sub-contractors were hired .
The first design concept by Sunpower Inc. , of Athens , Ohio , use two opposing piston engines coupled to alternators that produce 6 kilowatts each , or a total of 12 kilowatts , of power .
The second contract with Barber Nichols Inc. of Arvada , Colorado , is for development of a closed Brayton cycle engine that uses a high speed turbine and compressor coupled to a rotary alternator that also generates 12 kilowatts of power .
“ Development and testing of the power conversion unit will be a key factor in demonstrating the readiness of fission surface power technology and provide NASA with viable and cost - effective options for nuclear power on the moon and Mars , ” said Don Palac , manager of Glenn ’s Fission Surface Power Project .
After a one year design and analysis phase , a single contractor will be selected to build and test a prototype power conversion unit .
When complete , the power conversion unit will be integrated with the other technology demonstration unit ’s major components .
Glenn will develop the heat rejection system and provide the space simulation facility .
Moreover , Glenn will also work in conjunction with the Department of Energy and NASA ’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Alabama .
Marshall ’s part is developing and providing a non-nuclear reactor simulator with liquid metal coolant as the heat source unit for the technology demonstration .
A nuclear reactor used in space is much different than earth - based systems .
There are no large concrete cooling towers and the reactor is about the size of an office trash can .
The energy produced from a space reactor also is much smaller but more than adequate for the projected power needs of a lunar outpost .
Testing of the non-nuclear system is expected to take place at Glenn in 2012 or 2013 .
These tests will help verify system performance projections .
In addition , the tests would improve the development of safe and reliable control methods , as the process of gaining valuable operating experience could help reduce technology and programmatic risks for the planned return to the moon currently scheduled for around 2018 .
TFOT has also covered the Americium power source , a new battery - like device which includes a core of americium 242 which generates a very efficient fission reaction , and the development of a technology for converting sunlight into laser beams intended to stand in the center of JAXA ’s Space Solar Power Systems ( SSPS ) Project .
Other related TFOT stories include the evidence of water in the moon ’s interior , as reported by a team from Brown University , the testing of a lunar habitat made by NASA in January of 2008 , and the moon GPS system which could help future astronauts find their way around the Moon .
For more information on the future project for energy on the moon , see NASA ’s website .
Here it is , as simply as I can put it :
In the course of any year , there must be relatively few countries on this planet on which U.S. soldiers do not set foot , whether with guns blazing , humanitarian aid in hand , or just for a friendly visit .
In startling numbers of countries , our soldiers not only arrive , but stay interminably , if not indefinitely .
Sometimes they live on military bases built to the tune of billions of dollars that amount to sizeable American towns ( with accompanying amenities ) , sometimes on stripped down forward operating bases that may not even have showers .
When those troops do n’t stay , often American equipment does  carefully stored for further use at tiny “ cooperative security locations , ” known informally as “ lily pads ” ( from which U.S. troops , like so many frogs , could assumedly leap quickly into a region in crisis ) .
At the height of the Roman Empire , the Romans had an estimated 37 major military bases scattered around their dominions .
At the height of the British Empire , the British had 36 of them planetwide .
Depending on just who you listen to and how you count , we have hundreds of bases .
According to Pentagon records , in fact , there are 761 active military “ sites ” abroad .
The fact is :
We garrison the planet north to south , east to west , and even on the seven seas , thanks to our various fleets and our massive aircraft carriers which , with 5,000 - 6,000 personnel aboard  that is , the population of an American town  are functionally floating bases .
And here ’s the other half of that simple truth :
We do n’t care to know about it .
We , the American people , aided and abetted by our politicians , the Pentagon , and the mainstream media , are knee - deep in base denial .
Now , that ’s the gist of it .
If , like most Americans , that ’s more than you care to know , stop here .
Where the Sun Never Sets
Let ’s face it , we ’re on an imperial bender and it ’s been a long , long night .
Even now , in the wee hours , the Pentagon continues its massive expansion of recent years ; we spend militarily as if there were no tomorrow ; we ’re still building bases as if the world were our oyster ; and we ’re still in denial .
Someone should phone the imperial equivalent of Alcoholics Anonymous .
But let ’s start in a sunnier time , less than two decades ago , when it seemed that there would be many tomorrows , all painted red , white , and blue .
Remember the 1990s when the U.S. was hailed  or perhaps more accurately , Washington hailed itself  not just as the planet ’s “ sole superpower ” or even its unique “ hyperpower , ” but as its “ global policeman , ” the only cop on the block ?
As it happened , our leaders took that label seriously and our central police headquarters , that famed five - sided building in Washington D.C , promptly began dropping police stations  aka military bases  in or near the oil heartlands of the planet ( Kosovo , Saudi Arabia , Qatar , Kuwait ) after successful wars in the former Yugoslavia and the Persian Gulf .
As those bases multiplied , it seemed that we were embarking on a new , post - Soviet version of “ containment . ”
With the USSR gone , however , what we were containing grew a lot vaguer and , before 9/11 , no one spoke its name .
Nonetheless , it was , in essence , Muslims who happened to live on so many of the key oil lands of the planet .
Yes , for a while we also kept intact our old bases from our triumphant mega- war against Japan and Germany , and then the stalemated “ police action ” in South Korea ( 1950 - 1953 )  vast structures which added up to something like an all - military American version of the old British Raj .
According to the Pentagon , we still have a total of 124 bases in Japan , up to 38 on the small island of Okinawa , and 87 in South Korea .
( Of course , there were setbacks .
The giant bases we built in South Vietnam were lost in 1975 , and we were peaceably ejected from our major bases in the Philippines in 1992 . )
But imagine the hubris involved in the idea of being “ global policeman ” or “ sheriff ” and marching into a Dodge City that was nothing less than Planet Earth itself .
Naturally , with a whole passel of bad guys out there , a global “ swamp ” to be “ drained , ” as key Bush administration officials loved to describe it post - 9/11 , we armed ourselves to kill , not stun .
And the police stations
Well , they were often something to behold  and they still are .
Let ’s start with the basics : Almost 70 years after World War II , the sun is still incapable of setting on the American “ empire of bases ”  in Chalmers Johnson ’s phrase  which at this moment stretches from Australia to Italy , Japan to Qatar , Iraq to Colombia , Greenland to the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia , Romania to Okinawa .
And new bases of various kinds are going up all the time ( always with rumors of more to come ) .
For instance , an American missile system is slated to go into Poland and a radar system into Israel .
That will mean Americans stationed in both countries and , undoubtedly , modest bases of one sort or another to go with them .
( The Israeli one  “ the first American base on Israeli territory ”  reports Aluf Benn of Haaretz , will be in the Negev desert . )
There are 194 countries on the planet ( more or less ) , and officially 39 of them have American “ facilities , ” large and / or small .
But those are only the bases the Pentagon officially acknowledges .
Others simply are n’t counted , either because , as in the case of Jordan , a country finds it politically preferable not to acknowledge such bases ; because , as in the case of Pakistan , the American military shares bases that are officially Pakistani ; or because bases in war zones , no matter how elaborate , somehow do n’t count .
In other words , that 39 figure does n’t even include Iraq or Afghanistan .
By 2005 , according to the Washington Post , there were 106 American bases in Iraq , ranging from tiny outposts to mega - bases like Balad Air Base and the ill - named Camp Victory that house tens of thousands of troops , private contractors , Defense Department civilians , have bus routes , traffic lights , PXes , big name fast - food restaurants , and so on .
Some of these bases are , in effect , “ American towns ” on foreign soil .
In Afghanistan , Bagram Air Base , previously used by the Soviets in their occupation of the country , is the largest and best known .
There are , however , many more , large and small , including Kandahar Air Base , located in what was once the unofficial capital of the Taliban , which even has a full - scale hockey rink ( evidently for its Canadian contingent of troops ) .
You would think that all of this would be genuine news , that the establishment of new bases would regularly generate significant news stories , that books by the score would pour out on America ’s version of imperial control .
But here ’s the strange thing :
We garrison the globe in ways that really are  not to put too fine a point on it  unprecedented , and yet , if you happen to live in the United States , you basically would n’t know it ; or , thought about another way , you would n’t have to know it .
In Washington , our garrisoning of the world is so taken for granted that no one seems to blink when billions go into a new base in some exotic , embattled , war - torn land .
There ’s no discussion , no debate at all .
News about bases abroad , and Pentagon basing strategy , is , at best , inside - the - fold stuff , meant for policy wonks and news jockeys .
There may be no subject more taken for granted in Washington , less seriously attended to , or more deserving of coverage .
Missing Bases
Americans have , of course , always prided themselves on exporting “ democracy , ” not empire .
So empire - talk has n’t generally been an American staple and , perhaps for that reason , all those bases prove an awkward subject to bring up or focus too closely on .
When it came to empire - talk in general , there was a brief period after 9/11 when the neoconservatives , in full - throated triumph , began to compare us to Rome and Britain at their imperial height ( though we were believed to be incomparably , uniquely more powerful ) .
It was , in the phrase of the time , a “ unipolar moment . ”
Even liberal war hawks started talking about taking up “ the burden ” of empire or , in the phrase of Michael Ignatieff , now a Canadian politician but , in that period , still at Harvard and considered a significant American intellectual , “ empire lite . ”
On the whole , however , those in Washington and in the media have n’t considered it germane to remind Americans of just exactly how we have attempted to “ police ” and control the world these last years .
I ’ve had two modest encounters with base denial myself :
In the spring of 2004 , a journalism student I was working with emailed me a clip , dated October 20 , 2003  less than seven months after American troops entered Baghdad  from a prestigious engineering magazine .
It quoted Lt. Col. David Holt , the Army engineer “ tasked with facilities development ” in Iraq , speaking proudly of the several billion dollars ( “ the numbers are staggering ” ) that had already been sunk into base construction in that country .
Well , I was staggered anyway .
American journalists , however , hardly noticed , even though significant sums were already pouring into a series of mega - bases that were clearly meant to be permanent fixtures on the Iraqi landscape .
( The Bush administration carefully avoided using the word “ permanent ” in any context whatsoever , and these bases were first dubbed “ enduring camps . ” )
Within two years , according to the Washington Post ( in a piece that , typically , appeared on page A27 of the paper ) , the U.S. had those 106 bases in Iraq at a cost that , while unknown , must have been staggering indeed .
Just stop for a moment and consider that number : 106 .
It boggles the mind , but not , it seems , American newspaper or TV journalism .
TomDispatch.com has covered this subject regularly ever since , in part because these massive “ facts on the ground , ” these modern Ziggurats , were clearly evidence of the Bush administration ’s long - term plans and intentions in that country .
Not surprisingly , this year , U.S. negotiators finally offered the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki its terms for a so - called status of forces agreement , evidently initially demanding the right to occupy into the distant future 58 of the bases it has built .
It has always been obvious  to me , at least  that any discussion of Iraq policy in this country , of timelines or “ time horizons , ” drawdowns or withdrawals , made little sense if those giant facts on the ground were n’t taken into account .
And yet you have to search the U.S. press carefully to find any reporting on the subject , nor have bases played any real role in debates in Washington or the nation over Iraq policy .
I could go further : I can think of two intrepid American journalists , Thomas Ricks of the Washington Post and Guy Raz of NPR , who actually visited a single U.S. mega- base , Balad Air Base , which reputedly has a level of air traffic similar to Chicago ’s O’Hare International or London ’s Heathrow , and offered substantial reports on it .
But , as far as I know , they , like the cheese of children ’s song , stand alone .
I doubt that in the last five years Americans tuning in to their television news have ever been able to see a single report from Iraq that gave a view of what the bases we have built there look like or cost .
Although reporters visit them often enough and , for instance , have regularly offered reports from Camp Victory in Baghdad on what ’s going on in the rest of Iraq , the cameras never pan away from the reporters to show us the gigantic base itself .
More than five years after ground was broken for the first major American base in Iraq , this is , it seems to me , a remarkable record of media denial .
American bases in Afghanistan have generally experienced a similar fate .
My second encounter with base denial came in my other life .
When not running TomDispatch.com , I ’m a book editor ; to be more specific , I ’m Chalmers Johnson ’s editor .
I worked on the prophetic Blowback : The Costs and Consequences of American Empire , which was published back in 2000 to a singular lack of attention  until , of course , the attacks of 9/11 , after which it became a bestseller , adding both “ blowback ” and the phrase “ unintended consequences ” to the American lexicon .
By the time The Sorrows of Empire : Militarism , Secrecy , and the End of the Republic , the second volume in his Blowback Trilogy , came out in 2004 , reviewers , critics , and commentators were all paying attention .
The heart of that book focused on how the U.S. garrisons the planet , laying out Pentagon basing policies and discussing specific bases in remarkable detail .
This represented serious research and breakthrough work , and the book indeed received much attention here , including major , generally positive reviews .
Startlingly , however , not a single mainstream review , no matter how positive , paid any attention , or even really acknowledged , his chapters on the bases , or bothered to discuss the U.S. as a global garrison state .
Only three years later did a major reviewer pay the subject serious attention .
When Jonathan Freedland reviewed Nemesis , the final book in the Trilogy , in the New York Review of Books , he noticed the obvious and , in a discussion of U.S. basing policy , wrote , for instance :
“ Johnson is in deadly earnest when he draws a parallel with Rome .
He swats aside the conventional objection that , in contrast with both Romans and Britons , Americans have never constructed colonies abroad .
Oh , but they have , he says ; it ’s just that Americans are blind to them .
America is an ’empire of bases , ’ he writes , with a network of vast , hardened military encampments across the earth , each one a match for any Roman or Raj outpost . ”
Not surprisingly , Freedland is not an American journalist , but a British one who works for the Guardian .
In the U.S. , military bases really only matter , and so make headlines , when the Pentagon attempts to close some of the vast numbers of them scattered across this country .
Then , the fear of lost jobs and lost income in local communities leads to headlines and hubbub .
Of course , millions of Americans know about our bases abroad firsthand .
In this sense , they may be the least well kept secrets on the planet .
American troops , private contractors , and Defense Department civilian employees all have spent extended periods of time on at least one U.S. base abroad .
And yet no one seems to notice the near news blackout on our global bases or consider it the least bit strange .
The Foreshortened American Century
In a nutshell , occupying the planet , base by base , normally simply is n’t news .
Americans may pay no attention and yet , of course , they do pay .
It turns out to be a staggeringly expensive process for U.S. taxpayers .
Writing of a major 2004 Pentagon global base overhaul ( largely aimed at relocating many of them closer to the oil heartlands of the planet ) , Mike Mechanic of Mother Jones magazine online points out the following : “ An expert panel convened by Congress to assess the overseas basing realignment put the cost at $ 20 billion , counting indirect expenses overlooked by the Pentagon , which had initially budgeted one - fifth that amount . ”
And that ’s only the most obvious way Americans pay .
It ’s hard for us even to begin to grasp just how military ( and punitive ) is the face that the U.S. has presented to the world , especially during George W. Bush ’s two terms in office .
( Increasingly , that same face is also presented to Americans .
For instance , as Paul Krugman indicated recently , the civilian Federal Emergency Management Agency [ FEMA ] has been so thoroughly wrecked these last years that significant planning for the response to Hurricane Gustav fell on the shoulders of the military ’s Bush - created U.S. Northern Command . )
In purely practical terms , though , Americans are unlikely to be able to shoulder forever the massive global role the Pentagon and successive administrations have laid out for us .
Sooner or later , cutbacks will come and the sun will slowly begin to set on our base - world abroad .
In the Cold War era , there were , of course , two “ superpowers , ” the lesser of which disappeared in 1991 after a lifespan of 74 years .
Looking at what seemed to be a power vacuum across the Bering Straits , the leaders of the other power prematurely declared themselves triumphant in what had been an epic struggle for global hegemony .
It now seems that , rather than victory , the second superpower was just heading for the exit far more slowly .
As of now , “ the American Century , ” birthed by Time / Life publisher Henry Luce in 1941 , has lasted but 67 years .
Today , you have to be in full - scale denial not to know that the twenty - first century  whether it proves to be the Century of Multipolarity , the Century of China , the Century of Energy , or the Century of Chaos  will not be an American one .
The unipolar moment is already so over and , sooner or later , those mega - bases and lily pads alike will wash up on the shores of history , evidence of a remarkable fantasy of a global Pax Americana .
Not that you ’re likely to hear much about this in the run-up to November 4th in the U.S.
Here , fantasy reigns in both parties where a relatively upbeat view of our globally dominant future is a given , and will remain so , no matter who enters the White House in January 2009 .
After all , who ’s going to run for president not on the idea that “ it ’s morning again in America , ” but on the recognition that it ’s the wee small hours of the morning , the bender is ending , and the hangover Well , it ’s going to be a doozy .
Better take some B vitamins and get a little sleep .
The world ’s probably not going to look so great by the dawn ’s early light .

It ’s rare indeed that the U.S. empire of bases gets anything like the attention it deserves , so , when it does , praise is in order .

Toni Bentley has written a memoir about her three - year experience of sexual awakening via anal intercourse with a man .
Like most sexual memoirists , Bentley claims our attention with the more or less tacit premise that she has transgressed custom , morality , or received opinion — in her case , by finding liberation in being in a “ demeaning ” submissive role in her sadomasochistic recreational affair .
In order to find Bentley ’s story compelling , the reader ( whether neocon , ur - feminist , or third - waver ) must grant that such an arrangement is somehow shocking .
Given that the most likely audience for Bentley ’s book veers to the left , the intended surprising counterintuition is that her “ subjugation ” through anal sex was satisfying for her .
She did not turn the tables of paternalism with a large purple strap - on .
But is there any way — scientifically , we mean — to prove that anal sex is unfair to women ?
We speak of equal opportunity .
Let us examine a woman ’s opportunities for penetration .
For the purposes of this chart , “ woman ” and “ man ” are defined chromosomally and developmentally , i.e. , XX - chromosomed postpubescent Homo sapiens and XY - chromosomed postpubescent Homo sapiens respectively .
“ Unmediated ” shall be understood to mean via one ’s own body parts , without the aid of an instrument or substance topical , inserted , or ingested .
“ Possible ” shall be construed as “ achievable within the conceivable limits of bilaterally symmetrical physiques typical of each of the two sex categories ” ( some hearsay considered ) .
“ Fair - “ ness , QED , shall be constituted in an equal number of penetrative opportunities for all .

Keeping It Unreal
" And can you elaborate when you said you fought for equal rights for your entire life , what specifically you 've done focusing on improving the lives of African Americans ? "
His answer :
" I am proud of that record , from fighting for the recognition of Dr. Martin Luther King ’s birthday in my state . . . "
Check out John McCain trying to wiggle his way out of the fact that he voted against MLK day back in 1983 .
John McCain was born in 1936 .
He was how old , how old — hmmmm — let ’s see …maybe 47 years old I think .
He was almost 50 years old and he voted against MLK day !
You see he needed just a few more years to figure out the impact MLK had on our society .
He certainly can’t say in this statement that he was young and inexperienced .
Nope , he has to give the impression that he was young and inexperienced since it was his first year in Congress — so he studied and learned and studied and learned until it dawned on him .
And then he suddenly realized he made a big mistake .
McCain : I voted in my first , I think it was my first year in congress against then …
I began to learn and I studied and people talked to me and I not supported it but I fought very hard in my home state of Arizona for recognition against a Governor who was against my own party .
And what else did he say ?
“ I had not been involved in the issue .
I had come from being in the military to running for Congress in a state that did not have a very large African American population and it had not been in issue .
It just simply had not been . ”
In a February 2000 interview with ABC News , McCain said his initial opposition to a holiday was based on his belief that “ it was not necessary to have another federal holiday , that it cost too much money , that other presidents were not recognized . ”
Tomorrow Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , will honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. by speaking in Memphis on the 40th anniversary of King 's assassination .
He will no doubt sound a bit different than he did in April 1987 , when McCain was interviewed by USA Today about his five and a half years as a P.O.W .
Could you keep up with what was going on in the world ?
He was asked .
" They never gave us any meaningful news , " McCain said .
" They told us the day that Martin Luther King was shot , they told us the day that Bobby Kennedy was shot , but they never bothered to tell us about the moon shot .
So it was certainly selected news . "
Surely the John McCain of 2008 would not hold that the assassinations of King and Kennedy were not " meaningful . "
* FACT : McCain Supported Gov. Evan Mecham ’s Decision In 1987 To Rescind Martin Luther King Jr. Day .
As reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer , “ In a vote likely to haunt him for the rest of his public career , McCain voted against 1983 legislation establishing the third Monday in January as the federal holiday marking King ’s birthday .
Back home in Arizona , he supported Gov. Evan Mecham ’s decision in 1987 to rescind an executive order creating a state holiday for King , but later reversed his position . ”
[ Philadelphia Inquirer , 6/16/08 ]
1990 !
McCain , in response to a question , said affirmative action was " in the eye of the beholder . "
He did not mention that he supports an anti-affirmative action referendum on the ballot in Arizona .
* Note : No one should construe this as a criticism of McCain 's heroic service in Vietnam or infer that he is n't entirely color blind and above any kind of racial bias .
Neither should this be seen as any kind of attack on him for his age or an accusation that he is n't always a straight talker of unwavering principles .
He has a heroic and unimpeachable character and I would never imply otherwise .
Of all the shortcomings of the establishment press today , none is more central to the corruption of the profession than the decision to prioritize balance over accuracy .
That corruption is visibly on display in the current coverage of the McCain campaign ’s policy of deliberate lies .
And you wo n’t find a better example than Cathleen Decker ’s piece in yesterday ’s LA Times .
Read into the article and you ’ll see numerous instances of McCain ’s repeated use of false claims and lies and one instance Decker is able to dig up of an Obama campaign claim that arguably leaves out some information .
But the conclusion and packaging of the article is that both candidates deceive equally and that they do so because it works .
( There was another example , though not quite as egregious , by Jonathan Weismann last week in the Post . )
We hear a lot about the steep and perhaps terminal decline of the business model underlying daily print newspapers .
But this corruption in the basic conception of the craft — which is actually related to the economic decline — gets discussed much less .
This is what gives liars a clear strategic advantage over non-liars .
And it ’s an open question whether McCain ’s level of dishonesty turns out to be so great that it overwhelms reporters ’ unwillingness to report accurately on it .
Obama : McCain riles crowds ' stoking anger and division '
RAW STORY
Published : Friday October 10 , 2008

The increasingly rabid crowds that are frequenting John McCain 's campaign stops to shout death threats and hurl other invectives at Barack Obama have caught the Democratic candidate 's attention .
Obama told voters in Ohio Friday that he wo n't be distracted by McCain 's attempt to " turn the page " away from discussion of the economy and toward negative attacks .
" I think that folks are looking for something different .
It s easy to rile up a crowd by stoking anger and division .
But that s not what we need right now in the United States , " Obama told the crowd in Chillicothe , according to his prepared remarks .
" The times are too serious .
The challenges are too great .
The American people arent looking for someone who can divide this country  they re looking for someone who will lead it . "
McCain 's campaign , which has struggled to connect with voters in the face of a deepening economic crisis , has spent the last two weeks making increasingly desperate attempts to paint Obama as an unacceptable choice for president .
The GOP candidate and his allies are rehashing Obama 's past association with William Ayers , a former ' 60s anti-war radical , and the attacks are stoking substantial anger within the Republican base .
Supporters of McCain and running mate Sarah Palin have been heard yelling " terrorist " and " kill him " at the candidates ' rallies in response to their attacks on Obama .

Remarks of Senator Barack Obamaas prepared for delivery
Chillicothe , Ohio
Friday , October 10 , 2008
We meet at a moment of great uncertainty for America .
In recent weeks , weve seen a growing financial crisis that s threatening not only banks and businesses , but your economic security , as well .
It s getting harder and harder to get a loan for that new car or that startup - business or that college youve dreamed of attending .
And yesterday , millions of Americans lost more of their investments and hard - earned retirement savings as the stock market took another significant plunge .
We need action now .
The Treasury Department must move as quickly as possible to implement the rescue plan that passed Congress so we can ease this credit crisis that s preventing businesses and consumers from getting loans .
And we also must recognize that this is not just an American problem .
In this global economy , financial markets have no boundaries .
So the current crisis demands a global response .
This weekend , finance ministers from the worlds major economies will meet in Washington .
They must take coordinated steps to restore confidence and to maintain our financial markets and institutions .
There are many causes of this crisis , and its very important that we respond using all the tools that we have .
It s encouraging that Treasury is considering dramatic steps to provide more capital to our financial institutions so they have money to lend .
This is not a time for ideology  its a time for common sense and a politics of pragmatism .
The test of an idea must not be whether it is liberal or conservative  the test should be whether it works for the American people .
Thats what we should all be focused on in the days and weeks ahead .
I know these are difficult times .
I know folks are worried .
But I believe that we can steer ourselves out of this crisis because I believe in this country .
Because this is the United States of America .
This is a nation that has faced down war and depression ; great challenges and great threats .
And at each and every moment , we have risen to meet these challenges  not as Democrats , not as Republicans , but as Americans .
With resolve .
With courage .
We have seen our share of hard times .
The American story has never been about things coming easy  its been about rising to the moment when the moment is hard ; about rejecting panicked division for purposeful unity ; about seeing a mountaintop from the deepest valley .
Thats why we remember that some of the most famous words ever spoken by an American came from a President who took office in a time of turmoil 
 The only thing we have to fear is fear itself . 
Now is not the time for fear .
Now is not the time for panic .
Now is the time for resolve and steady leadership .
We can meet this moment .
We can come together to restore confidence in the American economy .
We can renew that fundamental belief  that in America , our destiny is not written for us , but by us .
Thats who we are , and thats the country we need to be right now .
America still has the most talented , most productive workers of any country on Earth .
You know this , Ohio .
Were home to the workers who have built the largest middle class in history .
We re home to workers who work two jobs or three jobs and take the last bus home at night because they want something more for their children .
We re home to innovation and technology , colleges and universities that are the envy of the world .
Some of the biggest ideas in history have come from our small businesses and our research facilities .
It wont be easy , but theres no reason we cant make this century another American century .
Yes we can .
But I also know this .
It will take a new direction .
It will take new leadership in Washington .
It will take a real change in the policies and politics of the last eight years .
And thats why Im running for President of the United States of America .
Even as we face the most serious economic crisis of our time ; even as you are worried about keeping your jobs or paying your bills or staying in your homes , my opponents campaign announced last week that they plan to turn the page on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead .
Senator McCains campaign actually said , and I quote , if we keep talking about the economy , were going to lose . 
So in the last couple of days , weve seen a barrage of nasty insinuations and attacks , and I m sure well see much more over the next 25 days .
We know whats coming .
We know what they re going to do .
But heres the thing , Ohio .
They can try to turn the page on the economy and deny the record of the last eight years .
They can run misleading ads and pursue the politics of anything goes .
But it s not going to work .
Not this time .
I think that folks are looking for something different .
It s easy to rile up a crowd by stoking anger and division .
But that s not what we need right now in the United States .
The times are too serious .
The challenges are too great .
The American people arent looking for someone who can divide this country  they re looking for someone who will lead it .
We re in a serious crisis - now , more than ever , it is time to put country ahead of politics .
Now , more than ever , it is time to bring change to Washington so that it works for the people of this country that we love .
I know my opponent is worried about his campaign .
But that s not what I m concerned about .
Im thinking about the Americans losing their jobs , and their homes , and their life savings .
We cant afford four more years of the economic theory that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else .
We cant afford four more years of less regulation so that no one in Washington is watching anyone on Wall Street .
Weve seen where that s led us and were not going back .
It is time to turn the page on eight years of economic policies that put Wall Street before Main Street but ended up hurting both .
We need policies that grow our economy from the bottom - up , so that every American , everywhere has the chance to get ahead .
Not just corporate CEOs , but their secretaries too .
Not just the person who owns the factory , but the men and women who work on its floor .
Because if weve learned anything from this economic crisis , its that were all connected ; were all in this together ; and we will rise or fall as one nation  as one people .
My opponent has a fundamentally different view .
Recently , he proposed a plan that would hand over $ 300 billion to underwrite the kind of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street that got us into this mess .
It punishes taxpayers , rewards banks , and wont solve our housing crisis .
At first , he said this spending would come from the rescue package that already passed .
But the rescue package included taxpayer protections that prevent exactly this kind of scheme .
We are not going to solve the immediate crisis by going back and changing the law we passed last week to push forward a plan that would take months to implement .
So I have a different view from Senator McCain .
Yes , we need to help innocent homebuyers .
Thats why I insisted that the rescue package give the Treasury authority to buy and rework mortgages .
We have given Treasury a broad menu of options that should be pursued .
But we should not put taxpayer money at unnecessary risk .
Taxpayers should not have all the downside without any of the upside .
That s a principle that Ive fought for , that s a principle that Ill maintain , and that s a principle that Ill stand up for as President .
That s the choice in this election .
I repeat : we must do more to help innocent homebuyers .
Ive worked on a series of proposals over the past two years to do that .
But we need to do it in a responsible way .
That means making sure that were not overpaying for these mortgages and rewarding the very lenders whose recklessness helped cause this crisis .
It means giving taxpayers a share of the benefit when our housing market recovers .
And it means cracking down on predatory lenders by treating mortgage fraud like the crime that it is .
We also have to make sure that if the Treasury moves forward with its plan to put more money into struggling banks , taxpayers will be able to get their money back and the CEOs who contributed to this crisis wont get rich at our expense .
Now lets be clear Ohio : the rescue plan that passed Congress last week is nt the end of what we need to do to strengthen this economy .
It s only the beginning .
Now we need to pass a rescue plan for the middle - class that will provide every family immediate relief to cope with rising food and gas prices , save one million jobs by rebuilding our schools and roads , and help states and cities avoid budget cuts and tax increases .
And we should extend expiring unemployment benefits to those Americans whove lost their jobs and cant find new ones .
Ive been fighting for this plan for months .
My opponent has said nothing .
And that is the choice in this election .
If were going to rebuild this economy from the bottom up , it has to start with our small businesses on Main Street  not just the big banks on Wall Street .
Small businesses employ half of the workers in the private sector in this country , and account for the majority of the job growth .
But we also know that a credit crunch has dried up capital and put these jobs at risk  shops cant finance their inventories , and small firms cant make payroll ; its harder to get an idea off the ground , or to provide health care for your employees .
If we dont act , well be looking at scaled back operations , shuttered shops , and laid off workers .
That s why we need a Small Business Rescue Plan  so that were extending our hand to the shops and restaurants ; the start - ups and small firms that create jobs and make our economy grow .
Main Street needs relief and you need it now .
We wont grow government  well work within the Small Business Administration to keep folks afloat , while providing tax cuts to lift the tide .
It s what we did after 9/11 , and we were able to get low cost loans out to tens of thousands of small businesses .
That s one of the many steps we can and should take to help stop job losses and turn this economy around .
It starts with a nation - wide program to provide affordable , fixed - rate loans to small businesses across the country .
We can run this through the SBAs Disaster Loan Program , which provides loans to small business owners get the help they need to maintain their inventory and meet their payroll .
Well also make it easier for private lenders to make small business loans by expanding the SBAs loan guarantee program .
By temporarily eliminating fees for borrowers and lenders , we can unlock the credit that small firms need to move forward , pay their workers , and grow their business .
Just as we make lending more available , we need to relieve the tax burden on small businesses to help create jobs .
Thats why Ive proposed eliminating all capital gains taxes on investments in small businesses and start - ups .
And today , I m proposing an additional temporary business tax incentive through next year to encourage new investments .
Because its time to protect the jobs we have and to create the jobs of tomorrow by unlocking the drive , and ingenuity , and innovation of the American people .
That s what Ill do as President of the United States .
Bottom - up growth also depends on a tax code that doesnt just work for the folks at the top .
Youve heard a lot about taxes in this campaign .
Well , heres the truth  my opponent and I are both offering tax cuts .
The difference is , he wants to give $ 200 billion in tax cuts to the biggest corporations in America , and he wants to give the average Fortune 500 CEO a $ 700,000 tax cut .
But he gives nothing at all to over 100 million Americans .
I have a different set of priorities .
Ill give a middle - class tax cut to 95 % of all workers .
And if you make less than $ 250,000 a year  which includes 98 percent of small business owners  you wont see your taxes increase one single dime .
Not your payroll taxes , not your income taxes , not your capital gains taxes  nothing .
Because in an economy like this , the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle - class .
We know that its time to create the good - paying jobs of tomorrow .
Ohio is hurting .
12,000 jobs have been lost this year .
Youve got 7.4 percent unemployment .
Wages are flat - lining .
But it doesnt have to be this way .
Thats why I m going to stop giving tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas , and start rebuilding the middle class by helping companies create jobs here in Ohio .
I will be a President who puts you first , Ohio .
Because I believe in the American people and what we can do together .
And if we want to turn this economy around and lead the world in the 21st century , we have to create the high - wage jobs of tomorrow right here in America .
If I am President , I will invest $ 15 billion a year in renewable sources of energy to create five million new , green jobs over the next decade  jobs that pay well and cant be outsourced ; jobs building solar panels and wind turbines and fuel - efficient cars ; jobs that will help us end our dependence on oil from Middle East dictators .
Ill also put two million more Americans to work rebuilding our crumbling roads , schools , and bridges  because it is time to build an American infrastructure for the 21st century .
We will work with the Building Trades to expand apprenticeship programs so young workers can develop their skills .
And if people ask how were going to pay for this , you tell them that if we can spend $ 10 billion a month in Iraq , we can spend some money to rebuild America .
If I am President , I will finally fix our broken health care system .
This issue is personal for me .
My mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of 53 , and Ill never forget how she spent the final months of her life lying in a hospital bed , fighting with her insurance company because they claimed that her cancer was a pre-existing condition and didnt want to pay for treatment .
If I am President , I will make sure those insurance companies can never do that again .
My health care plan will make sure insurance companies cant discriminate against those who are sick and need care most .
If you have health insurance , the only thing that will change under my plan is that we will lower premiums .
And if you dont have health insurance , youll be able to get the same kind of health insurance that Members of Congress get for themselves .
Well invest in preventative care and new technology to finally lower the cost of health care for families , businesses , and the entire economy .
That s the change we need .
And well give every child , everywhere the skills and the knowledge they need to compete with any worker , anywhere in the world .
I will not allow countries to out - teach us today so they can out - compete us tomorrow .
It is time to provide every American with a world - class education .
That means investing in early childhood education .
That means recruiting an army of new teachers , and paying them better , and giving them more support in exchange for higher standards and more accountability .
And it means making a deal with every American who has the drive and the will but not the money to go to college : if you commit to serving your country after you graduate , we will make sure you can afford your tuition .
You invest in America , America will invest in you , and together , we will move this country forward .
Finally , I will take on the corruption in Washington and on Wall Street to make sure a crisis like this can never , ever happen again .
Ill put in place the common - sense regulations and rules of the road Ive been calling for since March  rules that will keep our market free , fair , and honest ; rules that will restore accountability and responsibility in our corporate boardrooms .
And just as we demand accountability on Wall Street , I will also demand it in Washington .
That s why Im not going to stand here and simply tell you what I m going to spend , I m going to tell you how were going to save when I am President .
Ill do what you do in your own family budgets and make sure were spending money wisely .
I will go through the entire federal budget , page by page , line by line , and eliminate programs that dont work and arent needed .
Well start by ending a war in Iraq that s costing $ 10 billion a month while the Iraqi government sits on tens of billions of dollars in surplus .
And well save billions more by cutting waste , improving management , and strengthening oversight .
These are the changes and reforms we need .
A new era of responsibility and accountability on Wall Street and in Washington .
Common - sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again .
Investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the 21st century .
Bottom - up growth that gives every American a fair shot at the American dream .
And above all confidence  confidence in America , confidence in our economy , and confidence in ourselves .
I wont pretend this will be easy or come without cost .
We will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever , we are all in this together .
This country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we havent seen in nearly a century .
And future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test .
Will they say that this was a time when America lost its way and its purpose ?
When we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession ?
Or will they say that this was another one of those moments when America overcame ?
When we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each others success ?
This is one of those moments .
I realize you re cynical and fed up with politics .
I understand that you re disappointed and even angry with your leaders .
You have every right to be .
But despite all of this , I ask of you whats been asked of the American people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history .
I ask you to believe  to believe in yourselves , in each other , and in the future we can build together .
Together , we can not fail .
Not now .
Not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save .
Not when there are so many Americans without jobs and without homes .
Not when there are families who cant afford to see a doctor , or send their child to college , or pay their bills at the end of the month .
Not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves .
We can do this .
Americans have done this before .
Some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe I can't go to college but my child can ; maybe I can't have my own business but my child can .
I may have to rent , but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own .
I may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for Senate .
I might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the United States of America .
Now it falls to us .
Together , we can not fail .
Together , we can overcome the broken policies and divided politics of the last eight years .
Together , we can renew an economy that rewards work and rebuilds the middle class .
Together , we can create millions of new jobs , and deliver on the promise of health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete .
We can do this if we come together ; if we have confidence in ourselves and each other ; if we look beyond the darkness of the day to the bright light of hope that lies ahead .
Together , we can change this country and change this world .
Thank you ,
God bless you , and may God bless America .

The Mother of All Bailouts plan gives the Treasury not only authority to buy and sell Mortgage Backed Securities , but allows it to deal in any financial instruments including leveraged derivatives .
This evolved over the various versions .
The original Paulson proposal said :
Sec. 2 . Purchases of Mortgage - Related Assets .
( a ) Authority to Purchase . –
The Secretary is authorized to purchase , and to make and fund commitments to purchase , on such terms and conditions as determined by the Secretary , mortgage - related assets from any financial institution having its headquarters in the United States .
…
Sec. 12 . Definitions .
( 1 ) Mortgage - Related Assets .
–The term “ mortgage - related assets ” means residential or commercial mortgages and any securities , obligations , or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages , that in each case was originated or issued on or before September 17 , 2008 .
All media reports and blogs I have read about this assume that the Treasury under this plan would only buy Mortgage Backed Securities , i.e. bonds backed my mortgage payments .
But the above language also includes Credit Default Swaps .
Insurance contracts or derivatives , that guarantee the recoverability of MBS and change their value in relation to an MBS ’ value .
The language in the Treasury Fact Sheed on the proposal is even wider :
Treasury will have authority to issue up to $ 700 billion of Treasury securities to finance the purchase of troubled assets .
The purchases are intended to be residential and commercial mortgage - related assets , which may include mortgage - backed securities and whole loans .
The Secretary will have the discretion , in consultation with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve , to purchase other assets , as deemed necessary to effectively stabilize financial markets .
It seems like the fact sheed exceeds the breadth of the released proposal .
Oh , you say , the Democrats in Congress will prevent the Treasury from morphing into a investment bank backed by $ 700 billion of taxpayer capital ?
Here is Senator Dodd ’s expanded proposal of the Paulson plan .
The language is even worse than in the original :
SEC .
2 . AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE TROUBLED ASSETS .
( a ) OFFICES ; AUTHORITY .—
( 1 ) AUTHORITY .
— The Secretary is authorized to establish a program to purchase , and to make and fund commitments to purchase troubled assets from any financial institution , on such terms and conditions as are determined by the Secretary , and in accordance with policies and procedures developed by the Secretary .
…
SEC . 21 . DEFINITIONS . ( 7 ) TROUBLED ASSETS .
— The term ‘‘ troubled assets ’’ means — ( A ) residential or commercial mortgages , and any securities , obligations , or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages , that in each case were originated or issued on or before March 14 , 2008 ; and ( B ) upon the determination of the Secretary , in consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , any other financial instrument , as the Secretary determines necessary to promote financial market stability .
The Dodd version gets lauded by Krugman , DeLong and other ‘ liberal ’ luminaries .
This while the bailout language morphed from " mortgage related assets " to " any financial instrument . "
The Dodd version added some nice little extras for a homeowners in distress and some oversight provision .
But it also extended the scope of the Paulson plan far beyond housing and mortgages towards an all encompassing bailout for any financial issue .
Since 2003
Dodd collected over $ 4 million in contributions from Securities and Investment companies .
His top five doners include Citibank , SAC Capital Partners and Royal Bank of Scotland .
That may well be the reason why he does not want to keep the bill restricted to mortgage related assets but wants to include any financial instrument .
If this becomes law , Paulson and whoever replaces him in January will have the authority to buy Asset Backed Securities from car loans and credit card loans .
He will be able to buy and sell derivatives based on ABS that have build in leverage effects .
The Treasury may even deal in synthetic Collateral Debt Obligations and derivatives base on those .
It can buy and sell shares of public dealt companies , precious metals , future contracts on these and it can speculate on interest moves of Russian government bonds .
Are there any big long future positions on the Canadian dollar the U.S. president does not like ?
Just get the Treasury buy them up .
Congress is giving it the right to do so .
With a capital of $ 700 billion and the authority to buy and sell any highly leveraged financial instruments , the Treasury will become one gigantic hedge fund that can and may well act to move multi-trillions .
If such an entity makes one wrong move , it can bankrupt its owners within a few hours .
The Treasury is too knowledgeable to make such mistakes ?
So were two Nobel Price winners at LTCM .

Another localisation oriented idea that gets less press attention is the concept of local currencies ( or " locabucks " as I 'm now dubbing them ) , an idea which has its roots in the Great Depression as a mechanism for escaping the liquidity trap - and thus might be relevant again in the not - too distant future if present trends continue .
Locavores , locastores and locavolts have caught my attention lately - 3 strands of the " relocalisation " idea that tends to get a lot of attention in peak oil circles .
The most frequently cited examples of local currency were issued in the Bavarian town of Schwanenkirchen and the Austrian community of Wörgl , described in this article on " Laboratory readings : Wörgl 's Stamp Scrip – The Threat of a Good Example ? " :
On July 5th 1932 , in the middle of the Great Depression , the Austrian town of Wörgl made economic history by introducing a remarkable complimentary currency .
Wörgl was in trouble , and was prepared to try anything .
Of its population of 4,500 , a total of 1,500 people were without a job , and 200 families were penniless .
The mayor , Michael Unterguggenberger , had a long list of projects he wanted to accomplish , but there was hardly any money with which to carry them out .
These included repaving the roads , streetlighting , extending water distribution across the whole town , and planting trees along the streets .
Rather than spending the 40,000 Austrian schillings in the town ’s coffers to start these projects off , he deposited them in a local savings bank as a guarantee to back the issue of a type of complimentary currency known as ' stamp scrip ' .
This requires a monthly stamp to be stuck on all the circulating notes for them to remain valid , and in Wörgl , the stamp amounted 1 % of the each note ’s value .
The money raised was used to run a soup kitchen that fed 220 families .
Because nobody wanted to pay what was effectively a hoarding fee [ technically known as ' demurrage ' and often referred to as " negative interest " ] , everyone receiving the notes would spend them as fast as possible .
The 40,000 schilling deposit allowed anyone to exchange scrip for 98 per cent of its value in schillings .
This offer was rarely taken up though .
Of all the business in town , only the railway station and the post office refused to accept the local money .
When people ran out of spending ideas , they would pay their taxes early using scrip , resulting in a huge increase in town revenues .
Over the 13 - month period the project ran , the council not only carried out all the intended works projects , but also built new houses , a reservoir , a ski jump , and a bridge .
The people also used scrip to replant forests , in anticipation of the future cashflow they would receive from the trees .
The key to its success was the fast circulation of scrip within the local economy , 14 times higher than the schilling .
This in turn increased trade , creating extra employment .
At the time of the project , Wörgl was the only Austrian town to achieve full employment .
Six neighbouring villages copied the system successfully .
The French Prime Minister , Eduoard Dalladier , made a special visit to see the ' miracle of Wörgl ' .
In January 1933 , the project was replicated in the neighbouring city of Kirchbuhl , and in June 1933 , Unterguggenburger addressed a meeting with representatives from 170 different towns and villages .
Two hundred Austrian townships were interested in adopting the idea .
Unterguggenberger was opposed to both communism and fascism , championing instead what he referred to as ' economic freedom ' .
Therefore , it was deeply ironic that the Wörgl experiment was first branded ' craziness ' by the monetary authorities , then a Communist idea , and some years later as a fascist one .
The Wörgl experiment was watched by John Maynard Keynes and Irving Fisher , who saw a fast - depreciating currency as a possible answer to the 1930s " liquidity trap " and documented the subsequent use of " scrip " in the United States ( Fisher is also infamous for predicting , a few days before the Stock Market Crash of 1929 , " Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau . " ) .
Wörgl 's venture into local currencies ended when its scrip was declared illegal by Austria 's central bank in 1933 , after a further 200 other communities commenced launching copycat currencies , threatening the monopoly of currency issuance by the state .
The town went back to 30 % unemployment .
In 1934 , social unrest exploded across Austria .
The Schwanenkirchen effort had a similar outcome - in November 1931 , the German Government passed an emergency law ending the circulation of the " Wara " .
Local Currencies Today
Local currencies are still alive in central Europe today , with something like 65 regional currencies competing with the Euro , according to Ambrose Evans - Pritchard .
The most frequently cited example is the Chiemgauer - a local currency ( also called schwundgeld , scrip or specie ) accepted by 550 restaurants , bakeries , hairdressers , co-operative banks and a network of supermarkets in the Bavarian region of Chiemgau ( though petrol stations remain a glaring exception , other than some biofuel outlets ) .
Notes are used like legal tender and can even be accessed by debit card .
The Chiemgauer was issued in January 2003 at a rate of 1:1 against the euro , and is designed to lose 2 pc of its value every quarter .
Usage is reportedly expanding by 70 pc a year , though monthly turnover was a meagre € 135,000 when Evans - Pritchard wrote his article .
Evans - Pritchard says the Chiemgauer is one of 16 regional currencies that have emerged across Germany , Austria and northern Italy since the launch of the euro five years ago , with another 49 regions in the pipeline .
They are mostly issued by activists , farmers , eco-enthusiasts , anti-globalists , and citizen committees .
The actual turnover of these currencies remains miniscule , so the Eurozone authorities are relaxed about competition for the time being .
The Bundesbank is keeping an eye on them however , publishing a report titled " Regional Currencies in Germany , Local Competition for the Euro ? " .
Local currencies are n't restricted to the Germanic world - there are some examples alive and well in the Anglosphere as well , including Ithaca HOURS , Berkshares ( which have gathered some mainstream media attention ) and the Totnes Pound .
Dutch organisation STRO is also implementing pilot projects in Brazil , Central - America , Asia and the Netherlands .
John Robb thinks local currencies are a useful tool for building resilient communities , but notes that they remain " a lifestyle choice " at present .
Robb believes that the Worgl experience in the 1930's indicate that scrip " adoption , velocity and robustness " could be accelerated by :
* Allowing community members to use it to pay all or part of their tax liabilities to local governments .
This instantly establishes a market for the currency .
Also , pay local government employees a portion of their wages in scrip .
* Deflating [ devaluing ] the value of the scrip ( optimally , one percent per month ) to promote immediate use rather than hoarding .
*
To the extent possible , connecting scrip to local production rather than retail .
Locally produced food ( farmer 's markets ) , energy ( via local microgrids ) , products ( personal fabs ) , and labor / services .
Further , work with local banks to establish checking accounts for scrip and to enable conversions hard currencies ( at a slight discount ) .
Local Currencies And The Environment
Another reason for interest in local currencies has sprung from ecological concerns , outlined by Bernard Lietaer as follows :
The most recent reason for interest in stamp scrip and similar alternative monetary systems in the West or in Japan [ Otani 1981 ; Henderson , 1981 ; Kennedy , 1988 ; Suhr , 1989 ] results from environmental concerns .
" The higher the money - rate of interest , the higher is the pressure on entrepreneurs to avoid internal costs , that is , to externalize into the environment as much as the cost as is possible .
Thus under neutral money , when interest goes to zero , this additional burden on resources will cease " [ Suhr , 1988 , page 112 ] .
When it pays more to cut a tree , sell the wood and let the proceeds earn interest than simply let the tree grow , it is predictable that " economic pressures " will be felt to cut more trees than is optimal from an ecological viewpoint .
Stamp Scrip would reverse that process .
It is interesting to notice that this point was also demonstrated in practice : indeed during the experiment with stamp scrip in Austria during the Depression of the 1930's , the incentive for not hoarding was such that people preferred to invest in replanting trees .
As ecological concerns are gradually creeping to the top of political agendas worldwide , this aspect alone justifies the experimentation suggested in this note .
These three objectives : spontaneous creation of employment , inflation control , and ecologically conscious growth are the three results that eonomists can predict from the introduction of stamp scrip .
However , even more persuasive than any theoretical discussion is compelling evidence from case histories : such systems have indeed been used in the past in a variety of cultures , sometimes for centuries , and have always had a significant positive impact .
Conclusion
Local currencies can be an effective tool for enabling communities to escape from a liquidity trap , however they appear likely to remain in common use only as long as liquidity is in short supply or inter-regional trade is heavily restricted ( or , perhaps , biased ) .
Retaining convertibility into other stores of value ( a hard currency , or a commodity such as gold ) is important to avoid pitfalls like the " company store " phenomenon , where the people being paid in scrip have no way of redeeming it for goods outside a very restricted set of businesses .
Ensuring that scrip is devalued at a well understood rate is also important to keep the velocity of money high .
Postscript - Silvio Gesell and " The Ascent of The West "
The idea of local currencies was first described by Silvio Gesell , in his book " The Natural Economic Order " .
Only money that goes out of date like a newspaper , rots like potatoes , rusts like iron , evaporates like ether , is capable of standing the test as an instrument for the exchange of potatoes , newspapers , iron and ether .
Gesell also wrote an essay entitled " The Ascent of the West " , which was written to challenge the cultural pessimism of Oswald Spengler 's " The Decline of the West " .
Gesell hoped that humanity would gradually be able to regenerate itself under a reformed economic order and experience a new cultural renaissance .
Its worth noting that local currencies did exist prior to the ( literal ) Renaissance before they were replaced with centralised currencies .
Centralized currency -- invented during the Renaissance , really -- favors the kinds of business practices and centralization of power that actually works against good , honest , local commerce .
In short , it favors Wal - Mart over , say , Community Supported Agriculture .
There are other kinds of money – and they were in existence until they were outlawed by kings and queens looking to centralize authority .
Money that is lent into existence by a central bank will tend towards scarcity and competition .
Money that is earned into existence by people in a specific place has very different properties , and works on a model of abundance .
Gesell was a German theoretical economist who grew up in Europe , before moving to Argentina in 1887 .
A depression stuck Argentina shortly thereafter , which caused him to study the structural problems caused by the monetary system , before moving back to Europe in 1911 .
His experiences during an economic crisis at that time in Argentina led Gesell to a viewpoint substantially at odds with the Marxist analysis of the social question : the exploitation of human labour does not have its origins in the private ownership of the means of production , but rather occurs primarily in the sphere of distribution due to structural defects in the monetary system .
Like the ancient Greek philosopher Aristoteles , Gesell recognised money 's contradictory dual role as a medium of exchange for facilitating economic activity on the one hand and as an instrument of power capable of dominating the market on the other hand .
The starting point for Gesell 's investigations was the following question :
How could money 's characteristics as a usurious instrument of power be overcome , without eliminating its positive qualities as a neutral medium of exchange ?
He attributed this market - dominating power to two fundamental characteristics of conventional money : Firstly , money as a medium of demand is capable of being hoarded in contrast to human labor or goods and services on the supply side of the economic equation .
It can be temporarily withheld from the market for speculative purposes without its holder being exposed to significant losses .
Secondly , money enjoys the advantage of superior liquidity to goods and services .
In other words , it can be put into use at almost any time or place and so enjoys a flexibility of deployment similar to that of a joker in a card game .
These two characteristics of money give its holders a privileged position over the suppliers of goods and services .
This is especially true for those who hold or control large amounts of money .
They can disrupt the dynamic flow of economic activity , of purchases and sales , savings and investment .
This power enables the holders of money to demand the payment of interest as a reward for agreeing to refrain from speculative hoarding thereby allowing money to circulate in the economy .
This intrinsic power of money is not dependent on its actual hoarding , but rather on its potential to disrupt economic activity which enables it to extract a tribute in the form of interest in return for allowing the " metabolic exchange " of goods and services in the " social organism " .
The " return on capital " is accorded priority over broader economic considerations and production becomes attuned more to the monetary interest rate than to the real needs of human beings .
Long - term positive interest rates of interest disturb the balance of profit and loss necessary for the decentralized self - regulation of markets .
Gesell was of the opinion that this led to a dysfunction of the social system exhibiting very complex symptoms : the non-neutrality of interest - bearing money results in an inequitable distribution of income which no longer reflects actual differences in productivity .
This in turn leads to a concentration of monetary as well as of non-monetary capital and therefore to the predominance of monopolistic structures in the economy .
Since it is the holders of money who ultimately decide whether it circulates or stands still , money can't flow " automatically " like blood in the human body .
The circulation and the correct dosage of the monetary supply can't be brought under effective public control ; deflationary and inflationary fluctuations of the general price level are inevitable .
In the course of the business cycle when declining interest rates cause large amounts of money to be withheld from the market until the outlook for profitable investments improves , the result is economic stagnation and unemployment .
... to a Neutral Servant of Economic Activity
In order to deprive money of its power , Gesell did not advocate recourse to measures aimed at outlawing the taking of interest such as the canonical prohibition of medieval .
On the contrary , he envisaged structural changes in the monetary system involving the imposition of carrying costs on the medium of exchange , thereby counteracting the tendency to hoard and neutralising the liquidity advantage of conventional money .
The imposition of such carrying costs on liquid monetary assets - comparable to a demurrage fee for freight containers in the field of transport economics - would deprive money of its power to dominate the market while allowing it to fulfil its designated function as a medium of exchange facilitating economic activity .
Counteracting disruptions in the circulation of the medium of exchange due to speculative hoarding would allow the quantity and velocity of the monetary supply to be periodically adjusted to match the volume of production and the overall level of economic activity in such a way that the purchasing power of the monetary unit could be made to possess the same long - term stability as other weights and measures .
In his earliest works Gesell referred in particular to " rusting bank notes " as a method for implementing an " organic reform " of the monetary system .
Money which had hitherto been " dead foreign matter " with respect to both the social system and the natural world , would thus be integrated into the eternal cycle of life and death , becoming transitory and losing its characteristic of limitless self - multiplication by means of simple and compound interest .
Such a reform of the monetary system would constitute a regulative holistic therapy ; by removing the cause of disruptions in monetary circulation Gesell envisaged that the self - healing powers of the dysfunctional social " organism " would gradually increase allowing it to recover from the diverse economic and structural symptoms of crisis , ultimately reaching a state of equilibrium , in harmony with the rest of the natural order .
In his main work , Die Natürliche Wirtschaftsordnung durch Freiland und Freigeld ( The Natural Economic Order through Free and and Free Money ) , published in Berlin and Bern in 1916 , Gesell explained in detail how the supply and demand of capital would be balanced in the case of uninterrupted currency circulation so that a reduction of the real rate of interest below the presently existing barrier of around 3 - 4 % would become possible .
Gesell used the term " basic interest " ( Urzins ) to denote this pure monetary interest rate of around 3 - 4 % which is found to vary little historically .
It represents the tribute of the working people to the power of money and gives rise to levels of unearned income far in excess of that suggested by its magnitude .
Gesell predicted that his proposed currency reform would gradually cause the " basic interest " component to disappear from the monetary loan rate leaving only a risk premium and an administrative charge to allow lending institutions to cover their costs .
Fluctuations of the market rate of interest around a new equilibrium point close to zero would allow a more effectively decentralised channeling of savings into appropriate investments .
Free Money ( Freigeld ) , a medium of exchange liberated from the historical tribute of " basic interest " , would be neutral in its impact on distribution and could no longer influence the nature and extent of production to the disadvantage of producers and consumers .
Gesell envisaged that access to the complete proceeds of labour brought about by the elimination of " basic interest " would enable large sections of the population to give up wage - and salary - oriented employment and to work in a more autonomous manner in private and cooperative business organisations .
In 1919 , Gesell was appointed " People 's Representative for Finances " in the short - lived Bavarian Soviet Republic and immediately wrote a law for the creation of Freigeld .
His term of office lasted only 7 days , and he was fortunate to escape a charge of treason after the overthrow of the Soviet Republic and its integration back into Germany .
Gesell 's ideas spawned a political movement in Germany called " Freiwirtschaft " ( Free Economy ) party , which contested the 1932 elections without success .
After the Nazi Party 's seizure of power in 1933 , many Free Economy supporters supported the new regime in the hope that Hitler might act on the earlier rhetoric of Gottfried Feder concerning " the smashing of interest - slavery " .
This proved to be a false hope and in the spring of 1934 the various Free Economy organisations which had not already voluntarily disbanded were finally outlawed .
Given the final destination of the pre-war Free Economy movement , I figured it was worth checking to see if Gesell held some of the more unpalatable views common to the time , such the " blood and soil " beliefs held by some of the greens that joined the Nazi " rogue coalition " .
It seems from this account that Gesell was no nationalist though , and explicitly rejected this line of thought .
Towards the end of the last century Gesell extended his vision of socio-economic reform to include reform of the system of land tenure .
He derived inspiration in this respect from the work of the North - American land reformer Henry George ( 1839 - 1897 ) , author of Progress and Poverty , whose ideas about a Single Tax on the rental value of land became known in Germany through the activity of land reformers like Michael Flurscheim ( 1844-1912 ) and Adolf Damaschke ( 1865-1935 ) .
In contrast to Damaschke , who only advocated taxing the increase in values for the benefit of the community while retaining the principle of private ownership of land , Gesell 's reform proposals followed those of Flurscheim who called for the transfer of land into public ownership , compensating the former owners and thereafter leasing the land for private use to the highest bidder .
Gesell argued that as long as land remains a tradeable commodity and an object of speculative profit , the organic connection of human beings with the earth is disturbed .
In contrast to the proponents of nationalist or racially - oriented Blut und Boden ideologies , Gesell rejected the association of " blood " with " land " .
As a widely travelled citizen of the world he viewed the whole earth as an integral organ of every individual .
All people should be free to travel over the surface of the earth without hinderance and settle anywhere regardless of their place of birth , color or religion .
...
From his earliest writings onwards Gesell distanced himself from racist ideologies , aiming to develop an objective critique of structural defects in the economic order free from the subjective racial prejudice of anti-Semitic demagogues whose diatribes against so - called " Jewish " usurers he criticised as a " colossal injustice " .
Like many of his contemporaries he was greatly influenced by Darwin's Theory of Evolution and viewed his program of reform as a means for encouraging a more healthy evolution of human society .
However , Gesell should not be classified as a " Social Darwinist " because he believed that extremes of wealth and poverty reflect structural defects in the economic order rather than real differences in aptitude and productivity .
Opposed to ultra-nationalist triumphalism he advocated the promotion of mutual understanding between Germany and its eastern and western neighbours .
He called for the abandonment of expansionist politics and the formation of a voluntary confederation of European states to promote international cooperation .
Gesell also drew up proposals for an international post - capitalist monetary order , advocating an open world market without capitalist monopolies , customs frontiers , trade protectionism and colonial conquest .
In contrast to subsequently established institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank , which act on behalf of the powerful within the existing framework of unjust structures , or the present preparations for European Monetary Union , Gesell called for the establishment of an International Valuta Association , which would issue and manage a neutral international monetary unit freely convertible into the national currency units of the member states , operating in such a way that equitable international economic relations could be established on the basis of global free trade .
Gesell 's political leanings seem to be best described as " individualist - mutualist " .
I like Robert Anton Wilson 's explanation of individualist - mutualist theory , so I 'll let him outline the idea and a few alternatives to Gesell 's ideas regarding money .
From " Left and Right : A Non-Euclidean Perspective " :
In the late ' 50s , I began to read widely in economic " science " ( or speculation ) again , a subject that had bored the bejesus out of me since I overthrew the Marxist Machine in my brain ten years earlier .
I became fascinated with a number of alternatives - or " excluded middles " - that transcend the hackneyed debate between monopoly Capitalism and totalitarian Socialism .
My favorite among these alternatives was , and to some extent still is , the individualist - mutualist anarchism of Proudhon , Jossiah Warren , S.P. Andrews , Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker .
I do not have a real Faith that this system would work out as well in practice as it sounds in theory , but as theory it still seems to me one of the best ideas I ever encountered .
This form of anarchism is called " individualist " because it regards the absolute liberty of the individual as a supreme goal to be attained ; it is called " mutualist " because it believes such liberty can only be attained by a system of mutual consent , based on contracts that are to the advantage of all .
In this Utopia , free competition and free cooperation are both encouraged ; it is assumed persons and groups will decide to compete or to cooperate based on the concrete specifics of each case .
( This appeals to my " existentialism " again , you see . )
Land monopolies are discouraged in individualist - mutualist anarchism by abolishing State laws granting ownership to those who neither occupy nor use the land ; " ownership , " it is predicted , will then only be contractually recognized where the " owner " actually occupies and used the land , but not where he charges " rent " to occupy or use it .
The monopoly on currency , granted by the State , is also abolished , and any commune , group , syndicate , etc. , can issue its own competing currency ; it is claimed that this will drive interest down to approsximately zero .
With rent at zero and interest near zero , it is argued that the alleged goal of socialism ( abolition of exploitation ) will be achieved by free contract , without coercion or totalitarian Statism .
That is , the individualist - mutualist model argues that the land and money monopolies are the " bugger factors " that prevent Free Enterprise from producing the marvelous results expected by Adam Smith .
With land and money monopolies abolished , it is predicted that competition ( where there is no existential motive for cooperation ) and cooperation ( where this is recognized as being to the advantage of all ) will prevent other monopolies from arising .
Since monopolized police forces are notoriously graft - ridden and underlie the power of the state to bully and coerce , competing protection systems will be available in an individualist - mutualist system , You wo n't have to pay " taxes " to support a Protection Racket that is actually oppressing rather than protecting you .
You will only pay dues , where you think it prudent , to protection agencies that actual perform a service you want and need .
In general , every commune or syndicate will make its own rules of the game , but the mutualist - individualist tradition holds that , by experience , most communes will choose the systems that maximize liberty and minimize coercion .
Being wary of Correct Answer Machines , I also studied and have given much serious consideration to other " Utopian " socio-economic theories .
I am still fond of the system of Henry George ( in which no rent is allowed , but free enterprise is otherwise preserved ) ; but I also like the ideas of Silvio Gesell ( who would also abolish rent and all taxes but one - - a demmurage tax on currency , which should theoretically abolish interest by a different gimmick than the competing currencies of the mutualists . )
I also see possible merit in the economics of C.H. Douglas , who invented the National Dividend - - lately re-emergent , somewhat mutated , as Theobold 's Guaranteed Annual Wage and / or Friedman 's Negative Income Tax .
And I am intrigued by the proposal of Pope Leo XIII that workers should own the majority of stock in their companies .
Most interesting of recent Utopias to me is that of Buckminster Fuller in which money is abolished , and computers manage the economy , programmed with a prime directive to _advantage_ all without _disadvantaging_ any -- the same goal sought by the mutualist system of basing society entirely on negotiated contract .

The formal white tie affair is a fundraiser for Catholic Charities .
Last years event amassed $ 3.8 million .
The candidates poked fun at themselves and each other with self deprecating humor .
It was a break from political attacks and talk of the bad economy .
Instead of political punches , the pair exchanged punchlines .
McCain rented a helicopter for the evening in order to get from Philadelphia , totally socked in with bad weather , to an early evening ' must attend ' date with late night host David Letterman prior to the Al Smith dinner .

Chinese Company XJ to Manufacture AMSC Proprietary Wind Turbines for the Chinese Market
October 17th , 2008 by Amiel Blajchman
Responding to Chinese plans to increase their wind power generating capacity , companies are beginning to rush in to take advantage of the opportunities .
American Superconductor ( AMSC ) has licensed a proprietary 2 megawatt wind turbine design to China ’s XJ Group Corporation .
Under the terms of the contract , AMSC will provide the XJ Group with designs for its WT2000df , a 2 megawatt ( MW ) doubly fed induction wind turbine .
AMSC will also provide core electrical components for the 2 MW wind turbines manufactured by XJ Group .
According to Li Fusheng , President of the XJ Group :
The wind power market in China and around the world continues to expand at a dramatic rate .
We selected AMSC Windtec because of its proven turbine designs , its ability to help us localize our supply chain and its high - performance wind turbine electrical systems .
In addition to utilizing standard AMSC Windtec designs for the WT2000df , AMSC Windtec and XJ Group will jointly adapt the turbine for specific environmental and wind conditions , such as the low average wind speeds , low air density and severe climates encountered in certain regions of China . ”
XJ Group plans to have its first prototypes installed and commissioned by the end of 2009 and expects to begin shipping wind turbines to customers in 2010 .

The American oil industry is facing a doomsday scenario .

Many folks these days are blaming our current financial woes on a lack of regulation .
They seem to think that an abstract term like “ regulation ” somehow gives government amazing powers to ensure that bad things wo n’t happen .
Which is why this interview with Warren Buffett ( c/ o Coyote Blog ) is telling :
QUICK : If you imagine where things will go with Fannie and Freddie , and you think about the regulators , where were the regulators for what was happening , and can something like this be prevented from happening again ?
Mr. BUFFETT : Well , it ’s really an incredible case study in regulation because something called OFHEO was set up in 1992 by Congress , and the sole job of OFHEO was to watch over Fannie and Freddie , someone to watch over them .
And they were there to evaluate the soundness and the accounting and all of that .
Two companies were all they had to regulate .
OFHEO has over 200 employees now .
They have a budget now that ’s $ 65 million a year , and all they have to do is look at two companies .
I mean , you know , I look at more than two companies .
QUICK : Mm-hmm .
Mr. BUFFETT : And they sat there , made reports to the Congress , you can get them on the Internet , every year .
And , in fact , they reported to Sarbanes and Oxley every year .
And they went –wrote 100 page reports , and they said , ‘ We ’ve looked at these people and their standards are fine and their directors are fine and everything was fine . ’
And then all of a sudden you had two of the greatest accounting misstatements in history .
You had all kinds of management malfeasance , and it all came out .
And , of course , the classic thing was that after it all came out , OFHEO wrote a 350 –340 page report examining what went wrong , and they blamed the management , they blamed the directors , they blamed the audit committee .
They did n’t have a word in there about themselves , and they ’re the ones that 200 people were going to work every day with just two companies to think about .
It just shows the problems of regulation .
After falling for more than a decade , the U.S. suicide rate has climbed steadily since 1999 , driven by an alarming increase among middle - age adults , researchers said Monday .
A new six - year analysis in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that the U.S. suicide rate rose to 11 per 100,000 people in 2005 , from 10.5 per 100,000 in 1999 , an increase of just under 5 % .
The report found that virtually all of the increase was attributable to a nearly 16 % jump in suicides among people ages 40 to 64 , a group not commonly seen as high - risk .
The rate for that age group rose to 15.6 per 100,000 in 2005 , from 13.5 per 100,000 in 1999 .
Susan P. Baker , an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health and an author of the study , said she was baffled by the findings .
Sociological studies have found that middle age is generally a time of relative security and emotional well - being , she said .

“ We really do n’t know what is causing this , ” said Dr. Paula Clayton , research director of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention , who was not involved in the study .
“ All we have is speculation . ”
One possibility , she said , is that the increase in suicides might be tied to a concurrent increase in abuse of prescription pain pills , such as OxyContin .
Studies have shown that people who abuse drugs are at greater risk for suicide , she noted .
Another possible explanation , she said , was the drop in hormone replacement therapy after it was linked to health risks in 2002 .
Women who gave up the drugs or decided not to take them might have been more susceptible to depression and potentially suicide , she said .
Dr. Ian Cook , an associate professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA ’s David Geffen School of Medicine , who was not involved in the study , said stresses of modern life , particularly worries in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , might have a role .

Untreated depression is the leading cause of suicide , he said .
“ The bottom line is while we ca n’t infer a lot of things about what is causing the trend , I think it cries out for better depression screening and treatment , ” he said .
Suicide rates declined 18 % from 1986 to 1999 , helped in part by a focus on prevention among teenagers and the elderly .
In the current study , researchers found little or no change in the suicide rates for three other age groups : 10 to 19 , 20 to 29 , and over 65 .
Advertisement
Suicides for whites ages 40 to 64 rose 17 % from 1999 to 2005 , researchers said .
For middle - age white men , the rate rose 16 % to 26.9 per 100,000 in 2005 , from 23.1 per 100,000 in 1999 .
For white women in that age group , the rate rose 19 % to 8.2 per 100,000 from 6.9 per 100,000 .
The suicide rate among middle - age African Americans rose 7 % from 1999 to 2005 , but it was not enough to drive up the overall suicide rate among blacks .
For black men ages 40 to 64 , the rate rose 5 % to 10.4 per 100,000 from 9.9 per 100,000 , and for black women in that age group , the rate rose 14 % to 2.5 per 100,000 from 2.2 per 100,000 .
Baker said she had no idea why the increases among whites were higher .

Ron Paul comments on World Bank and Poverty .
“ Forgive and Forget ” Wo n’t Fix Third World Debt
When the World Bank and International Monetary Fund spring meetings open in Washington , D.C. , on April 29 , 2001 , officials will point proudly to the roughly $ 20 billion in debt that they have promised to cancel since their heavily - protested meetings last year .
These promises take a step in the right direction , concludes a new report from the Worldwatch Institute , a Washington - based research organization .
But even full cancellation would only be a Band - Aid for a broken system .
“ Before officials congratulate themselves they need to pay attention to a wider problem - how to prevent this debt crisis from happening again , ” said David Malin Roodman , author of Still Waiting for the Jubilee : Pragmatic Solutions for the Third World Debt Crisis .
“ Hundreds of billions of dollars in unpayable loans still need to be written off .
And creditors have done little to change the lending practices that created the debt problem in the first place . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ For example , initiatives to cut debt in Tanzania from $ 5.7 billion to about $ 1.8 billion are welcome , but unless things change , the country will probably borrow enough to lift its debt back to $ 6 billion by 2018 .
It ’s not enough to clean up past mistakes .
We also need to learn from them .
‘ Forgive and forget ’ is a recipe for more debt troubles . ”
Roodman calls for major reforms to prevent poorer countries from sinking back into debt .
On the borrower side , these include making governments less corrupt and more accountable .
On the creditor side , the reforms include : ?
“ Unfortunately , many official lenders seem trapped in a fortress mentality , so fearful of admitting their mistakes by openly canceling failed loans that they are prolonging the debt crisis , ” said Roodman .
“ In a sort of money merry - go - round , rich governments , the IMF , the World Bank , and other official lenders are granting poor countries new loans to repay old ones .
For every dollar they lend to low - income nations they get 83 cents right back in principal and interest payments .
This makes bad loans look good and hides the full extent of failure . ”
Through the enhanced Debt Initiative for Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC initiative ) , announced at the 1999 G - 7 summit in Cologne , official creditors took a step toward ending the debt crisis in 41 of the poorest nations , offering to cancel far more debt than they had before .

I get the sense that maybe the subject is so charged that people do n’t want to bring it up .
But I ’m wondering if Charlie Gibson might be able to raise the matter during the Barbara Walters style interview he ’s doing today with Gov. Palin up in Alaska .
While Gov. Palin was Mayor of Wasilla , Alaska in the late 1990s , the city ’s policy was to charge rape victims for the cost of the ‘ rape kits ’ used to collect forensic evidence to help prosecute the rapists .
Eventually the state had to step in and pass a law banning the practice .
And according to former Gov. Tony Knowles , the law was passed specifically in response to Wasila ’s policy .
“ There was one town in Alaska that was charging victims for this , and that was Wasilla , ” says Knowles .
So Wasila was either the only or one of the only towns in the state to follow this practice .
And the state legislature had to intervene to put an end to it .
There ’s no controversy about this .
So this part is clear .
But it appears this is another case whether Sarah Palin is lying or in this case deputizing press aides to lie on her behalf .
In this case spokeswoman Maria Comella , when asked , told USAToday that “ does not believe , nor has she ever believed , that rape victims should have to pay for an evidence - gathering test .
Gov. Palin ’s position could not be more clear .
To suggest otherwise is a deliberate misrepresentation of her commitment to supporting victims and bringing violent criminals to justice . ”
Well , this just appears to be a confident statement of another lie .
She does not and has never believed this , only it was her policy when she ran the city in question which was either the only or the most prominent in the state that held to this practice .
Charlie , can you help on this ?

Tiffany Shepherd : Fired Bikini Teacher Still Looking For Work
made national headlines earlier this year when she was fired from her teaching position in the St. Lucie County School District in Florida for engaging in a part time pursuit that involved fishing charter excursions and bikinis .
That was in April and she is still unable to get another teaching position .
The Science teacher was reported to school officials , likely by a disgruntled co-worker , for her weekend job as a bikini mate with a charter fishing boat operation .
Shepherd , a single mother of three young children , took on the part time job to help make ends meet and get a little sunshine as part of the bargain .
She appeared on The Tyra Banks Show earlier this week and received a good deal of sympathy from the supermodel .
Tyra
Banks questioned her about why the school district thought it was so bad to wear a bikini .
Shepherd acknowledged that there were allegations of her photos appearing on porn websites .
She denies that she was involved in those activities .
Early on it was reported that she was considering a lawsuit against St. Lucie County School District .
It is unclear whether she still plans to move forward .
Check out one of the bikini poses that led to Shepherd 's dismal below .

German police commandos seized two terrorist suspects Friday from a Dutch airliner just before it was due to leave Cologne for Amsterdam , media reports said .
Police said a 23 - year - old Somali national and a 24 - year - old German citizen born in the Somali capital of Mogadishu , were overpowered on the KLM flight 1804 at 6:55 am ( 0455 GMT ) local time .
A KLM spokeswoman said police boarded the plane when it was at its " point of departure , " and seized the two suspects .
She said everyone was then forced to disembark and there was a baggage inspection to see who the bags belonged to .
Police said " farewell " letters had been found from the men that led them to suspect they were intending to carry out terror attacks .
It was not revealed where the letters were found or how long the two suspects had been under observation .
Some reports said the two had been under observation for months , and a suicide note was found in their apartment saying that they wanted to die for the " jihad " or " Muslim holy war " .

“ Libertarian , ” in the modern American context , describes a range of political views .
It includes hard core libertarians who would like to reduce the size and scope of government to something between a minimal state and no state at all .
It also includes the much larger number of Americans–polls suggest ten to fifteen percent of the electorate –who favor substantial , but not radical , reductions in government involvement in both economic and social matters .
A libertarian in the second sense is probably in favor of legalizing medical marijuana , might well be in favor of decriminalizing marijuana use , is probably not in favor of complete drug legalization .
He is likely to view education vouchers favorably , is probably opposed to national health insurance and may support some privatization of social security , but is unlikely to take seriously proposals for a fully private system of schools , health care , or old age insurance .
The Libertarian Party is mostly made up of hard core libertarians .
Its campaign strategy has been to spread their views , to appeal to those who share them , while hoping for some votes from soft core libertarians who see voting for it as a way of pressuring the major parties to shift in a libertarian direction .
This year is going to be different .
Bob Barr , the LP ’s presidential candidate , is an ex-Republican congressman whose past ( and , arguably , present ) views are no more than moderately libertarian .
He supports the legalization of medical marijuana but allows interviewers to assume without contradiction that he opposes more general marijuana legalization .
He limits his opposition to the War on Drugs to opposing federal involvement –which , given that the War on Drugs is mostly conducted on the state and local level , is very nearly an irrelevancy masquerading as policy .
Judging by what I have seen of him , his version of libertarianism will correspond , at best , to the views of the libertarian wing of the Republican party .
An optimistic view of this year ’s strategy is that it will finally get the LP a significant number of votes .
Currently Barr is polling at about 6 % , roughly twelve times the best electoral outcome the party has ever achieved in a presidential election .
Some of those are doubtless Republicans , both libertarians and fiscal conservatives , who feel this year that their party has abandoned them .
But many others may be Republicans , Democrats and Independents who are libertarian in the moderate sense and have in the past been repelled by the LP ’s more extreme version .
If Barr actually ends up with five to ten percent of the votes that will put pressure on both major parties to modify their positions at least a little in a libertarian direction , which is surely a good thing .
A pessimistic view of the current strategy is , first , that it wo n’t work –that the vote totals will not match the polling totals–and second that , to the extent it does work , it will send the wrong message .
The positions that Barr is likely to push , after all , are already held by quite a lot of people in the major parties .
A few years ago , I suggested to a local Democratic congresswoman that one way in which her party could pull libertarian voters out of the Republican party was by coming out in favor of a federal policy of respecting state medical marijuana laws .
She replied that she and some colleagues had already introduced such a bill .
Seen from this standpoint , Barr ’s candidacy seems chiefly designed to push the Republican party back towards something more like its pre-Bush position as a coalition containing , but not dominated by , libertarian elements .
It may also strengthen the position of the more libertarian elements in the Democratic party .
But it is unlikely either to spread libertarian ideas in any strong sense or to encourage the major parties to consider more than minor adjustments in their policy positions .
The poster child for the more radical strategy is the Socialist Party of the first half of the 20th century .
It won almost no elections , in part because it supported extreme positions .
But most of those positions were eventually adopted , and implemented , by the major parties .
I have no confidence in my abilities as a political prophet , so am reluctant to predict which strategy will work better .
As an individual voter , however , knowing that a single vote has no appreciable effect on the outcome of a national election , I regard voting as a symbolic act .
Being myself a hard core libertarian , I am disinclined to vote for a Libertarian candidate who is , so far as I can see , no more libertarian than the better Republicans .
It looks as though I get to sit out this election .

Report fears potential ' partisan manipulation ' in voter purges David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday October 1 , 2008
Print This Email This
It is normal for states to periodically review lists of voters and remove any who have moved , died , or been convicted of felonies .
However , with no national standards to control this process , it has become " chaotic , " " riddled with inaccuracies , " and " vulnerable to manipulation " for partisan purposes .
Those are the conclusions of a new report from the Brennan Center for Justice obtained by CBS News .
Brennan Center Executive Director Michael Waldman told CBS , " Officials are making tons of errors , and it's all happening in secret , without public accountability . "
One problem that has previously been noted is that some voters are being improperly removed from the rolls because of clerical errors or small mismatches in names or addresses and may not even find out until they show up and attempt to vote .
However , in addition to accidental errors , there is also a possibility of voter purges being used selectively to target minorities or other groups for partisan purposes .
" We do n't know all the problems , but we know that there 's a huge potential for partisan mischief , " Waldman stated .
Although exact figures are difficult to obtain , the report notes that one election official in Mississippi was recently found to have purged 10,000 voters " from her home computer . "
Another 21,000 voters have been purged in Louisiana .
Increasing the concerns , another study cited by CBS has found that " nineteen states are ignoring a federal law banning systematic purges within 90 days of a federal election . "
Blogger Brad Friedman comments , " So CBS News has noticed .
Where the hell are the Democrats , and why are n't they raising holy hell about all of this stuff everywhere .
...
In the meantime , the Republicans are out with phony ' reports ' and lawsuits damned near every day --- and not just on Fox ' News ' --- declaring ' evidence ' of completely non-existant ' voter fraud ' by " Democrats " .
Yet , in the meantime , the Dems continue to bring a knife to a gunfight , and , as we 've noted many times of late ... seem to have no clue that they are in a War on Democracy being waged by their GOP opponenents . "

In a move likely to reduce the number of Cubans reaching U.S. soil , Mexico agreed Monday to deport Cubans smuggled into the country on their way to the United States .
The agreement between Mexico and Cuba reflects concern among Mexican officials over the growing number of Cubans being brought into this country by traffickers evading beefed - up U.S. patrols in the waters between Cuba and Florida .
The pact , signed during a visit by Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque , is the latest sign of improved relations between Mexico and Cuba after a chill during the administration of former Mexican President Vicente Fox .
Mexican authorities have arrested about 2,000 undocumented Cubans this year , more than triple the total last year , according to figures cited in the Mexican media .
Four years ago , Mexican immigration officers detained fewer than 200 Cubans .

More than 11,000 Cubans made it to the United States through Mexico last year .
The U.S. crackdown near Florida has sent smugglers in search of new routes for delivering Cuban migrants to American soil , where they are entitled to legal residency under a provision of the “ wet foot , dry foot ” policy that allows only those who reach land to stay .
Seeking to evade U.S. sea patrols , smugglers shuttle the migrants by boat to the Yucatan peninsula and neighboring islands , such as Isla Mujeres .
The Yucatan is about 150 miles from Cuba ’s western tip .
Others sneak into Mexico from Central America .
Cubans are just one group using Mexico to reach the United States .
It is also the primary route for Central American migrants , thousands of whom cross Mexico ’s southern border illegally on their way north each year .

Relatively few Cubans who reached Mexico without papers have been arrested but are rarely sent home .
Many obtain permits enabling them to travel by land to the northern border .
Once on U.S. soil , Cubans are usually held only a few days .
Mexican officials have watched the surge from Cuba with growing dismay .
Sophisticated migrant - smuggling networks , which receive up to $ 15,000 for each Cuban client , reportedly have joined hands with Mexican drug traffickers .
Smugglers have stolen fast boats and airplanes to ply their trade , authorities say .
The pact will be a “ decisive tool for preventing and confronting illegal immigration , human trafficking and other related crimes , ” Perez Roque said during the signing ceremony Monday .
In one publicized incident in June , gunmen seized 33 Cubans being taken by bus to a detention center after they were detained by Mexican authorities .
Officials blamed Miami - based smugglers .

Within days , most of the migrants had made their way by land to the Texas border to apply for U.S. residency .
In a joint declaration , Mexican and Cuban officials Monday blamed U.S. immigration policies for spurring smuggling .
Traditionally warm ties between the nations frayed under Fox , a pro-U.S. conservative who angered then - President Fidel Castro by supporting a United Nations measure condemning Cuba ’s human rights record .

Forbes.com originally reported that the site would shut down but that is not the case , as explained in the memo we ’re posting after the jump .
Vivian Schiller , SVP and GM of NYTimes.com told us today that the idea is to have one big global brand under one roof but stressed that IHT.com will be co-branded and will feature IHT content .
Users will be able to choose between a US and a Global edition , something NYTimes.com currently does n’t offer .
The sales staff already was combined “ so this makes their message a lot clearer . ”
There will be staff changes but an editorial team remains in Paris while the production will be handled from New York , since the two will share a single platform .
The IHT , owned by New York Times ( NYSE : NYT ) Media Group , is published in 180 countries but has struggled to keep up with the web operations of its more illustrious sister title .
While NYTimes.com attracted 19.4 million unique monthly users in August , Paris - based IHT.com got just 2.5 million , according to Comscore .
This has been under consideration for a while now , and some previous details came out in June .
The IHT site is already accessible through http://iht.nytimes.com/.
Recently , IHT changed its logo and added a tagline : The Global Edition of New York Times .
As Forbes puts it , “ The IHT site has long been an anachronism in an age where the flagship NYTimes.com was available anywhere in the world “ .
NYTimes.com general manager Vivian Schiller told Forbes that “ it ’s absolutely , positively not about cost savings ” and would give the Times more opportunities to monetize its foreign web traffic , which makes up between 18 and 20 percent of its total audience , as well as increasing inventory .
— IHT.com has experimented with content syndication deals to increase its audience and in December last year hooked up with Reuters to create the Business With Reuters section in the a print and web partnership .
This and other schemes clearly did not generate enough traffic and revenue to justify a standalone site .
Just last month NYTimes.com and IHT.com announced a syndication deal with financial analysis site Breaking Views .
Memo from IHT Publisher Stephen Dunbar - Johnson and NYTimes.com SVP / GM Vivian Schiller
To Our Colleagues ,
We are pleased to announce that our vision to become a global powerhouse news
Web site is soon to become a reality .
Next spring , NYTimes.com and IHT.com will combine forces to form a joint international presence that can deliver the scale , the user engagement and the resources we need to compete for readers and advertisers .
The advantages are manifest : the digital expertise and resources of NYTimes.com , the international experience and voice of the IHT and the joint power of both newsrooms .
So what does this mean ?
Come launch , NYTimes.com will feature a Dynamic new co-branded global edition home page that will feature stories selected for international users .
Regular NYTimes.com users will be able to opt -in to that new home page ; the IHT.com url will also redirect there .
We will also feature six new global section fronts , again chosen for international readers : business , travel , culture , sports , style and opinion .
Those will be found alongside the standard NYTimes.com section fronts and also featured on the global edition homepage .
All IHT content will now be published on the integrated site as well as archived and searchable on NYTimes.com
There is much work to be done in the coming days and weeks .
Members of the IHT - NYT Web project team — Victoria Shannon , Charlotte Gordon , Jen Hanks , Hayley Nelson and Dominique Piteux , and Jim Roberts — will be in contact with many of you in the newsroom , in advertising sales , in marketing and in finance and IT for your help in shaping , finalizing and delivering this creative and innovative new global edition to the online marketplace .
We want and need our best minds grappling with the issues and refining the
details as the project moves from the planning stage into development and implementation .
There is no doubt that this integration project is a large and complex endeavour and it has forced some hard decisions about jobs at the IHT .
IHT HR and others are working closely with New York colleagues to reassign and in some instances relocate individuals in Paris and Hong Kong whose positions will be affected next year .
Good progress is being made .
When this project is completed , we will have an amazing international news site that showcases the IHT

CUSHING is a small town and a trading hub in Oklahoma , home to about 8,400 people and a latticework of oil pipelines .
On Monday August 4th , someone agreed to deliver 1,000 barrels of light , sweet crude at Cushing next month for less than $ 120 a barrel .
Only last month , the same deal was made for over $ 147 .
This steep drop in the oil price will raise many people 's hopes for the world economy .
But , inasmuch as the falling price of oil ( and that of other commodities ) is a symptom of worsening economic troubles in America and beyond , it may be merely a confirmation of their fears .
Optimists will argue that the extortionate oil prices of July were an aberration , the result of unwholesome speculation divorced from the reality of supply and demand .
Traders , after all , now hold over 286,000 contracts for delivery of oil next month in Cushing , but only a tiny fraction of them , about 2 % , have any intention of getting their hands on any crude .
Most would struggle to locate Cushing on a map .
The aim of many of them is simply to sell their contract , before it expires , at a higher price than they paid for it .
Those looking on the bright side will also hope that a fall in the oil price will untie the hands of central bankers , allowing them to postpone the rate rises they may be contemplating to fight inflation .
In his testimony to Congress last month , the Federal Reserve 's chairman , Ben Bernanke , said it was the central bank 's “ critical responsibility ” to stop high energy costs triggering a ruinous race between prices and wages .
Similar warnings were voiced by the president of the European Central Bank when it raised interest rates in July .
But the problem with the optimists ' case is that these two arguments are in tension with each other .
If speculation is to blame for the high oil price , then higher interest rates , not lower ones , may be warranted , at least in the medium term .
Cheap money , after all , results in expensive assets , as the bubble in stocks then houses showed .
In a research note published last month , Marco Annunziata of UniCredit argued that once the current crisis is over , central banks may return to the “ unfinished job ” of restoring interest rates to a less bubble - blowing level .
That the oil price may be so high because interest rates are so low is also an argument long pursued by Jeffrey Frankel of Harvard University .
He points out that rates now fail to compensate savers for inflation : real interest rates are negative .
As a result , the return to pumping a barrel of oil , selling it and investing the proceeds is often less than can be gained by leaving the oil in the ground and waiting for its price to rise further .
Although there is no sign that producers are actually sitting on their hands , the theory suggests that they might do so until the oil price is so high — so far above its long - run value — that they begin to suspect it might fall .
Then , and only then , will they feel motivated to pump , preventing the price rising any further .
Rather than paving the way for lower interest rates , the oil price may have dropped in anticipation of higher ones .
The same day as the price breached $ 120 a barrel , America 's Department of Commerce showed that inflation , as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures , rose by 4.1 % in the year to June and by 0.8 % compared with just a month ago .
Only in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina have prices jumped so much in a single month .
These price pressures may prevent the Federal Reserve doing much more to stimulate the slowing American economy .
And it is that slowdown , echoed in the euro area , that surely underlies the fall in the price of oil in recent weeks .
According to one recent study a 10 % increase in the price of oil reduces American demand for the stuff by only about 0.3 - 0.8 % .
But a decline in American income has a bigger effect .
The United States will guzzle 430,000 fewer barrels a day this year , according to analysts at Lehman Brothers .
Signs of this new temperance are already visible .
Luxury pick - up trucks and SUVs now account for 12 - 13 % of car sales ( seasonally adjusted ) compared with 18 % last year , they point out .
And on July 28th , the Department of Transportation reported that Americans drove 9.6 billion fewer miles ( 15.5 billion km ) in May than they had a year before .
Speculation does not drive the oil price .
Driving does .

Email this Page U.S. Middle East Policy Emanuel 's War Plan for Democrats
The Book of Rahm John Walsh
CounterPunch
October 24 , 2006
Last week in CounterPunch1 , I wrote that the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) , Congressman Rahm Emanuel , had worked hard to guarantee that Democratic candidates in key toss - up House races were pro-war .
In this he was largely successful , because of the money he commands and the celebrity politicians who reliably respond to his call , ensuring that 20 of the 22 Democratic candidates in these districts are pro-war .
So the fix is in for the coming elections .
In 2006 , no matter which party controls the House , a majority will be committed to pursuing the war on Iraq - - despite the fact that the Democratic rank and file and the general voting public oppose the war by large margins .
( I hasten to add that this state of affairs can be reversed even after the sham election between the two War Parties . )
What are Emanuel 's views on war and peace ?
Emanuel has just supplied the answer in the form of a scrawny book co-authored with Bruce Reed , modestly entitled : The Plan : Big Ideas for America .
The authors obligingly boil each of the eight parts of " The Plan " down to a single paragraph .
The section which embraces all of foreign policy is entitled " A New Strategy to End the War on Terror , " a heading revealing in itself since " war on terror " is the way the neocons and the Israeli Lobby currently like to frame the discussion of foreign policy .
Here is the book 's summary paragraph with my comments in parentheses : " A New Strategy to Win the War on Terror "
( " War on Terror , " as George Soros points out , is a false metaphor used by those who would drag us into military adventures not in our interest or that of humanity . )
" We need to use all the roots of American power to make our country safe .
( He begins by playing on fear . )
America must lead the world 's fight against the spread of evil and totalitarianism , but we must stop trying to win that battle on our own .
( Messianic imperialism . )
We should reform and strengthen multilateral institutions for the twenty - first century , not walk away from them .
We need to fortify the military 's " thin green line " around the world by adding to the U.S. Special Forces and the Marines , and by expanding the U.S. army by 100,000 more troops .
( An even bigger military for the world 's most powerful armed forces , a very militaristic view of the way to handle the conflicts among nations .
What uses does Emanuel have in mind for those troops ? )
We should give our troops a new GI Bill to come home to .
( More material incentives to induce the financially strapped to sign up as cannon fodder . )
Finally we must protect our homeland and civil liberties by creating a new domestic counterterrorism force like Britain 's MI5 .
( A new domestic spying operation is an obvious threat to our civil liberties ; MI5 holds secret files on one in 160 adults in Britain along with files on 53,000 organizations . )
There it is straight from the horse 's mouth .
2
How does Emanuel , the man who has screened and chosen the 2006 Democratic candidates for Congress , feel specifically about the war on Iraq , the number one issue on voters ' minds .
Emanuel and Reed do not so much as mention Iraq in their book except in terms of the " war on terror . "
Nor does Emanuel mention Iraq on his web site as among the important issues facing us , quite amazing omission and one shared by Chuck Schumer who is his equivalent of the Senate side , chairing the DSCC ( Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ) .
However a very recent profile in Fortune ( 9/25/2006 ) , " Rahm Emanuel , Pitbull Politician , " by Washington Bureau chief Nina Easton notes : " On Iraq , Emanuel has steered clear of the withdraw - now crowd , preferring to criticize Bush for military failures since the 2003 invasion .
' The war never had to turn out this way , ' he told me at one of his campaign stops .
In January 2005 , when asked by Meet the Press 's Tim Russert whether he would have voted to authorize the war -' knowing that there are no weapons of mass destruction ' - Emanuel answered yes .
( He did n't take office until after the vote . )
' I still believe that getting rid of Saddam Hussein was the right thing to do , okay ? ' he added . " 3
When Jack Murtha made his proposal for withdrawal from Iraq , Emanuel quickly declared that " Jack Murtha went out and spoke for Jack Murtha . "
As for Iraq policy , Emanuel added : " At the right time , we will have a position . "
That was November , 2005 .
In June , 2006 , it was obviously time , and Emanuel finally revealed his policy in a statement on the floor of the House during debate over Iraq , thus : " The debate today is about whether the American people want to stay the course with an administration and a Congress that has walked away from its obligations or pursue a real strategy for success in the war on terror .
We cannot achieve the end of victory and continue to sit and watch , stand pat , stay put , status quo and that is the Republican policy .
Democrats are determined to take the fight to the enemy . "
The refrain is familiar ; more troops are the means and victory in Iraq is the goal .
The war on Iraq benefited Israel by laying waste a country seen to be one of its major adversaries .
Emanuel 's commitment to Israel 4 and his Congressional service to it are not in doubt .
The most recent evidence was his attack on the U.S. puppet Prime Minister of Iraq , Nouri al Maliki , because Maliki had labeled Israel 's attack on Lebanon as an act of " aggression . "
Emanuel called on Maliki to cancel his address to Congress ; and he was joined by his close friend and DSCC counterpart , Sen. Chuck Schumer , who asked ; " Which side is he ( Maliki ) on when it comes to the war on terror ? "
In terms of retired Senator Fritz Holling 's statement that Congress is Israeli occupied territory , Rahm Emanuel must be considered one of the occupying troops .
And he certainly is a major cog in the Israel Lobby as defined by Mearsheimer and Walt .
Nor is the idea that the Lobby exists and has tremendous influence on Middle East policy any longer a taboo in the minds of the general populace .
According to a poll just carried out by Zogby International for CNI 5 , 39 % of the American public " agree " or " somewhat agree " that " the work of the Israel lobby on Congress and the Bush administration has been a key factor for going to war in Iraq and now confronting Iran . "
A similar number , 40 % , " strongly disagreed " or " somewhat disagreed " with this position .
Some 20 % of the public were not sure .
But in some respects , Emanuel is a mysterious fellow , as evidenced by his biography , which is readily available on Wikipedia and in the piece in Fortune ( 3 ) .
But there are a few things missing or not fully explained .
First , as is often pointed out , Emanuel 's physician father was an Israeli èmigrè ; but , according to Leon Hadar , he also worked during the 1940s with the notorious Irgun , which was labeled as a terrorist organization by the British authorities .
6
Perhaps Rahm 's current interest in terrorism was first kindled at his father 's Irgun knee .
Second , during the 1991 Gulf War , Emanuel was a civilian volunteer in Israel , " rust - proofing brakes on an army base in northern Israel . "
( Wikipedia , New Republic ) .
This is peculiar on two counts .
Here the U.S. goes to war with Iraq , but Emanuel , a U.S. citizen , volunteers not for his country , but for Israel .
Moreover , here is a well - connected Illinois political figure with a father who had been in the Irgun , but he is assigned to " rust - proof brakes " on " an army base . "
Maybe .
Third , immediately upon his return from his desert sojourn , Emanuel at once became a major figure in the Clinton campaign " who wowed the team from the start , opening a spigot on needed campaign funds .
"
( 3 ) How did he do that after being isolated overseas , and with no experience in national politics ?
Fourth , after leaving the Clinton White House , he decided that he needed some accumulated wealth and " security " if he were to stay in politics .
So he went to work for Bruce Wasserstein , a major Democratic donor and Wall Street financier .
According to Easton , " Over a 2 1/ 2 - year period he helped broker deals - often using political connections - for Wasserstein Perella .
According to congressional financial disclosures , he earned more than $ 18 million during that period .
His deals included Unicom 's merger with Peco Energy and venture fund GTCR Golder Rauner 's purchase of SBC subsidiary SecurityLink .
But friends say his compensation also benefited from two sales of the Wasserstein firm itself , first to Dresdner Bank and then to Allianz AG . "
Again for a newcomer to haul in $ 18 million in two years is almost miraculous .
How did he do it ?
Next Emanuel won a seat in Congress in 2002 , and by 2006 he was chair of the DCCC .
Another near miraculous rise .
But Emanuel and his fellow hawks may yet fail to get their way .
Major figures among the rulers of U.S. empire , and their well - compensated advisors , from James Baker to Jimmy Carter to Zbigniew Brzezinski to Mearsheimer and Walt , see disaster looming unless the neocons of both War Parties with their dual loyalties to the U.S. and Israel are brought to heel .
Second and more important , the people are fed up with the war on Iraq and wary of other wars the hawks like Emanuel have planned for us .
The politicians who win office , whether Rove 's Republicans or Emanuel 's Democrats , will have to deal with this rising tide of anger or risk losing their sinecures .
That risk is offset by the machinations of Emanuel and others to guarantee that there is no genuine opposition party or movement .
And that lack of a real opposition is a problem we must solve .

Two quantum channels that have zero capacity when used individually ( orange and yellow figures ) can enable communication when used together ( green figure ) .
Image credit : Graeme Smith and Jon Yard .
© 2008 Science .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Physicists have discovered a strange characteristic of quantum communication channels .
If two quantum channels each have a transmission capacity of zero , they may still have a nonzero capacity when used together .
This effect , which has no classical counterpart , reveals a new complexity in the fundamental nature of quantum communication .
The coauthors of the study , Graeme Smith of the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights , New York , and Jon Yard of Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos , New Mexico , have published their research in a recent issue of Science .
Smith and Yard explain that one of the most important challenges in designing communication networks of any kind is taking steps to correct for noise .
By decreasing noise levels in communication channels , developers can increase channel capacity , which is defined as the number of bits ( or qubits , in quantum channels ) that one channel can transmit .
For a channel with zero capacity , no bits are transmitted .
For several decades , scientists have used a well - known formula developed by Claude Shannon in 1948 for developing error - correction techniques in classical communication channels .
This formula guides the design of modern communication schemes used in cell phones , the Internet , and deep - space communication .
In this classical formula , capacity is additive : when two channels are used simultaneously to transmit data , the capacities of the channels are added to obtain the total capacity .
But even today , physicists do n’t understand quantum communication nearly as well as the classical kind .
In the current study , Smith and Yard show that some pairs of zero- capacity channels can have a positive quantum capacity when used together .
As the physicists explain , that would be like two cut telephone cables being able to transmit data when used together .
Their finding shows two things : that quantum capacity is not additive like classical capacity , and that the quantum capacity of a single channel does not completely specify its capability for transmitting quantum information .
“ To me , the strange thing is that you have these two things that you would have thought were useless – I mean , you 'd usually think that a zero - capacity channel was good for nothing – and when you put them together , somehow there 's a kind of synergy and they develop a very quantifiable value , ” Smith told PhysOrg.com .
“ This does n't happen when you work with classical channels , and since my intuition was based on that case , I was really surprised when it happened here . ”
The scientists account for this “ superactivation ” property by explaining that quantum channels have two different kinds of capacity .
“ Private capacity ” is the rate at which a channel can send secure classical data .
“ Assisted capacity ” is the transmission rate in which multiple symmetric channels can assist a given channel in sending quantum data .
As the physicists demonstrated , a channel ’s assisted capacity is always at least half as large as its private capacity .
As an example of superactivation , the scientists showed that combining a private “ Horodecki ” channel and a symmetric channel ( each with zero capacity ) can give a quantum capacity of more than 0.01 qubits per channel .
It ’s as if each channel has the potential to activate the other , canceling the other ’s reason for having zero capacity .
“ The effect has something to do with the existence of something called ‘ private Horodecki channels , ’ ” Smith said .
“ These channels have the weird property that , even though they 're too noisy to allow quantum communication , somehow they still allow you to send classical messages that are completely private .
Roughly speaking , we figured out that there 's this second kind of channel – a symmetric channel – that also can't send any quantum messages on its own , but can be used to transform the private classical communication of the Horodecki channel into noiseless quantum communication . ”
Superactivation raises some interesting questions about the nature of communication .
For instance , you would think that the question “ can this communication link transmit any information ? ” would have a straightforward answer .
However , with quantum data , the answer may be that it depends on the context .
If identifying a quantum channel ’s capacity is not as straightforward as previously thought , then new ideas will be needed for designing error - correction techniques in quantum channels .
These results lead to other questions , such as what the effect of combing three channels might be .
The overall complexity of quantum channel capacity will keep the researchers investigating the fundamental characteristics of communication in the physical world .
“ First , I 'd like to understand the role of privacy in this whole thing , and whether it 's necessary to achieve a superactivation , ” Smith said .
“ In the longer term , I 'd like to see if we can turn the improved understanding of quantum error correction that comes out of this into some practical ways to reduce noise in prototypes for quantum computers . ”

Iranian President , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , has made a remarkable announcement .
He 's admitted that Iran might agree to the existence of the state of Israel .
Ahmadinejad was asked : " If the Palestinian leaders agree to a two - state solution , could Iran live with an Israeli state ? "
This was his astonishing reply :
If they [ the Palestinians ] want to keep the Zionists , they can stay ...
Whatever the people decide , we will respect it .
I mean , it 's very much in correspondence with our proposal to allow Palestinian people to decide through free referendums .
Since most Palestinians are willing to accept a two - state solution , the Iranian president is , in effect , agreeing to Israel 's right to exist and opening the door to a peace deal that Iran will endorse .
Ahmadinejad made this apparently extraordinary shift in policy during an
interview last week when he was in New York to address the UN general assembly .
He was interviewed on September 24 by reporters Juan Gonzalez , writing for the New York Daily News , and Amy Goodman for the current affairs TV programme , Democracy Now .
You can watch the full interview and read the full text on the Democracy Now website .
Surprisingly , Ahmadinejad 's sensational softening of his long - standing , point - blank anti-Israeli stance was not even headlined by the two reporters .
Perhaps this was a decision by their editors ?
Did they not want to admit that Ahmadinejad may have , for once , said something vaguely progressive ?
Equally odd , the story was n't picked up by the world 's media .
For many years , the Iranian president has been vilified , usually justifiably .
Now , when he says something positive and helpful , the media ignores it .
Is this because of some anti-Iran or pro-Israel agenda ?
Why ignore a statement that is , from any political and journalistic perspective , a radical departure from Ahmadinejad 's previous unyielding anti-Israel tirades ?
Only a week earlier in Tehran he was saying that the Israeli state would not survive .
Confused ?
Are n't we all .
Will the real Mahmoud Ahmadinejad please stand up ?
Is he a deceiver and an unprincipled opportunist who will say anything to further Iran 's political agenda ?
Or could it be that beneath his often demagogic public rhetoric against Israel he is , in fact , open to options more moderate than his reported remarks about wiping the Israeli state off the map ?
I am not defending or endorsing Ahmadinejad in any way , shape or form .
Indeed , I am on record as being one of Ahmadinejad 's harshest critics .
I 've protested dozens of times outside the Iranian Embassy in London and written scores of articles exposing his regime 's persecution of trade unionists , students , journalists , human rights defenders , women 's equality campaigners , gay people , Sunni Muslims and ethnic minorities such as the Arabs , Kurds , Azeris and Balochis .
You can watch my Talking with Tatchell online TV programmes on the Iranian regime 's anti-Arab racism here , and on the rising popular resistance to its police state methods here .
But I also hope I am open - minded and fair .
Even I can see that Ahmadinejad appears to have moderated his position and is now apparently willing , with Palestinian agreement , to accept the co-existence of two states : Israel and Palestine .
Many Israelis and their allies will no doubt say Ahmadinejad can't be trusted ; that his comments were part of a manipulative charm offensive during his visit to the UN in New York .
They may be right .
But even if he is being disingenuous , that fact that he 's made this public concession on Israel at all is a softening of sorts .
News of what he said will filter back to Tehran and he 'll have to account for his words to his government , including the hardline anti-Israel ayatollahs and revolutionary guards .
I wonder what they think ?
Call me naive , but in my view Ahmadinejad 's words were of major significance .
He ought be pressed by world leaders , and Israel , to repeat them and to clarify them .
His statement might , and I emphasise might , be evidence that Iran is open to some negotiation on the future of the Israeli state .
If Israel 's leaders had any sense , they would ignore past provocations by Iran and seize this moment to have dialogue with the Palestinian and Iranian leaders on a two - state solution .
What Ahmadinejad has said could be an opening to diffuse the stand - off between Iran and Israel .
I am not relenting one inch in my condemnation of Ahmadinejad 's regime , with its grisly torture chambers , execution of juvenile offenders and neocolonial subjugation of national minorities .
But I do find myself in considerable agreement with the Iranian president 's analysis of why the Middle East peace process has stalled .
He told Gonzales and Goodman :
The first reason is that none of the solutions have actually addressed the root cause of the problem .
The root cause is the presence of an illegitimate government regime that has usurped and imposed itself on , meaning they have brought people from other parts of the world , replaced them with people who had existed in the territory and then forced the exit of the old people out , the people who lived there , out of the country or the territories .
So there have been two simultaneous displacements .
The indigenous people were forced out and displaced , and a group of other people scattered around the globe were gathered and placed in a new place ...
A second reason is that none of those peace plans offered so far have given attention to the right to self - determination of the Palestinians .
If a group of people are forced out of their country , that does n't mean their rights are gone , even with the passage of 60 years .
Can you ignore the rights of those displaced ?
How is it possible for people to arrive from far - off lands and have the right to self - determination , whereas the indigenous people of the territory are denied that right ?
Much as I loathe his regime , Ahmadinejad is basically right .
The key to peace in the Middle East is concessions from the occupying power .
As the stronger , wealthier and conquering partner , Israel should take the initiative and help kick - start the peace process by withdrawing unilaterally and totally from the territories it has occupied illegally ( according to international law ) since the 1967 war .
This means pulling out from all of the West Bank and dismantling all the illegal Israeli settlements .
The West Bank , plus Gaza , should become the independent , sovereign state of Palestine , backed with international aid and investment to create the infrastructure for economic development and for social provision ( new houses , schools , hospitals , transport links and sports facilities ) .
Jobs and prosperity in Palestine will undercut and isolate the men of violence .
They will lose support and become marginalised in a self - governing state where ordinary Palestinians experience the tangible benefits of peace .
This is so damn obvious .
When will Israel 's leaders wake up and realise that peace with justice is the only way to give their people lasting security ?
Edited to add :
The comments to this post have been amazing incredible .
My sincerest thanks to all of you ; knowing that everyone has my back makes this a lot easier .
I have a big announcement to make : James Randi has offered me the position of President of the James Randi Educational Foundation .
I am extraordinarily honored , and I have accepted this duty .
Wow .
Just writing that seems incredible to me .
If you want the official news , you can read our press release .
That tells you the facts .
It gives you a taste of all this , but I want you to get the flavor .
You see , James " The Amazing " Randi has always been a hero of mine .
I 'm not alone there , of course .
At every one of Randi 's conferences , I see people approach him rather sheepishly , or in awe , or just , well , amazed .
And they say these great things : Randi changed their lives .
Randi taught them how to think .
Randi showed them what the world is really like .
I feel the same way .
I 've told this story a million times : when I was in high school , I had a little portable black and white TV that sat on the corner of my desk .
I 'd stay up late watching Carson ( Johnny , not Daly ) .
One night , Carson had this guy on , a little dude with a fantastic white beard , and he got a volunteer from the audience to lie down on a table .
Then , explaining the whole time that it's a fake , he starts pulling tissue out of this guy " psychically " just using sleight of hand ( you can watch a piece of the clip on YouTube ) .
I was in hysterics , laughing my butt off .
But at that time in my life , I was prey to a lot of pseudoscience : UFOs , the Bermuda Triangle , all sorts of garbage .
Watching Randi on The Tonight Show showed me that this stuff can be easily faked , or people easily misled ( willfully or not ) .
I started being more skeptical , and became more of a critical thinker as time went on .
It was already inside me to be this way , but it was Randi who showed it to me .
In 1996 , Randi started the JREF , a foundation to help him help others like the teenaged me .
He has been working tirelessly for years to promote critical thinking and skepticism , and to de-fraud the fraudulent .
He 's been an inspiration .
In 2002 I sent him a copy of my first book , asking him to write a " blurb " for the back cover .
He did ( it was great ! ) , and shortly thereafter asked me if I would come talk at the first skeptical conference the JREF was holding in Florida .
I agreed , and gave my Planet X talk -- just a few hours after Columbia disintegrated over Texas .
That was a hard talk to give , to be cheerful and support NASA against slander from conspiracy theorists just a short time after losing those astronauts .
But I muddled through , and Randi was very supportive , saying I would be a regular at those meetings .
He was right .
I was very proud to give him an award of sorts at the most recent meeting in June , a cup filled with hundreds of notes from audience members , each saying how Randi has changed their lives for the better .
So we go back a bit , he and I .
But it was still a shock when he pulled me aside not too long ago and asked if I would like to carry on with his work .
What can you say to that ?
He 's Randi .
There 's only one answer .
I accepted .
There is no way I can replace Randi , or fill his shoes , or even be moderately Amazing .
I wo n't even try .
Happily , I do n't need to : he will continue to work with the JREF , guiding the Foundation as the Chairman of the Board of Directors .
There is a lot of Randi in the JREF , and of the JREF in Randi , and I would n't have it any other way .
So what I will do is try to continue on with the JREF 's mission : educate the public .
Take on the psychics , the antiscientists , those who would do harm to our collective intellect .
Promote real science .
That I can do , that I will do , and that is a promise .
I also promise to continue this blog .
As much as Randi and the JREF are intertwined , so am I with speaking my mind here on the blog .
I 've been doing this a long time , and I 'm not about to stop now .
I want to thank everyone who supported me in this journey , and warn them that we 've only just started .
There is a very long road ahead , and I 'm grateful that Randi was and still is there to break the trail .
Big oil has been spending big money in Washington , but it may surprise you that gas and oil companies spend more money on corporate lobbying than individual campaign contributions .
Why chose lobbying over campaign contributions ?
Lobbying is more effective at crushing energy bills , as we have seen this year .
As Ralph Nader explains , “ The corporate lobby in Washington is basically designed to stifle all legislative activity on behalf of consumers . ”
It ’s no coincidence that recently the Senate blocked the extension renewable energy tax credits .
Thus far in 2008 , oil and gas companies have spent $ 55,339,015 million on lobbying in an effort to convince lawmakers to vote in the industry ’s favor and against renewables .
Not surprisingly , the top spender is Exxon - Mobil .
At the current rate of spending , the industry is set to break last year ’s record of $ 83 million .
Big
Oil defends this increased spending in response to more energy bills being on the “ menu ” and denies it is responsible for the failure of these bills ; however , lobbying dollars speak for themselves .
According to CNN :
The oil industry may have not gotten its drilling wish list just yet , but so far they have been able to avoid higher taxes .
Meanwhile , the renewable energy folks have n’t seen a big increase in funding .
Looking at the dollars spent lobbying Congress , that may not be surprising .
The renewable industry and their allies in the environmental movement have spent a combined $ 19 million lobbying Congress this year – half what the oil industry has spent .
Another reason Big Oil favors lobbying is that direct campaign contributions are restricted to individuals , whereas corporations may fund lobbying .
Even so , oil industry employees have contributed $ 1.4 million to John McCain ’s campaign in 2007 - 2008 , more than any other politician in history and three times more than Obama has received !
6 of the world ’s 10 biggest corporations are oil companies , and there is a lot at stake in the presidential election .
In defense of corporate lobbying , lassiez - faire economist Thomas Sowell believes that it is an example of a group having better knowledge of their interests than individual citizens .
I find this thought insulting and simplistic , especially when I look at the top industries funding lobbying .
The oil and gas industry may have spent over $ 55 million this year , but that is less than half the money spent by the pharmaceutical industry .
Somehow , I do n’t trust these corporations have my best interest at heart when so much money is at stake .
To quote Nader again , “ The use of solar energy has not been opened up because the oil industry does not own the sun . ”
Too bad the sun ca n’t hire lobbyests .

We have cops and prison guards getting into drug war trouble from coast to coast this week , from San Diego to Chicago and from Florida to Maryland .
Let 's get to it :
In San Diego , a San Diego police officer was arrested September 2 for allegedly tipping off drug dealers about an ongoing investigation .
Officer Juan Hurtado Tapia , whom traffickers allegedly called " El Corrupto , " was charged in federal court with obstruction , fraud and making false statements .
A federal complaint said Tapia ran criminal history checks on a police computer for members of a drug trafficking ring and warned at least one suspect not to try to cross the border from Mexico on a particular night .
Tapia is now on unpaid leave .
In Hagerstown , Maryland , a rookie prison guard was arrested September 4 for smuggling pot and cigarettes into the Roxbury Correctional Institution .
Rookie Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services Officer Krista Blank is charged with possessing marijuana and contraband , and with possessing the materials with the intent to distribute them inside a place of confinement .
That is four separate charges -- two each for the pot and the cigs -- for which she faces up to 10 years in prison .
In Lakeland , Florida , a Polk County detention deputy was arrested September 4 for selling Oxycontin tablets to undercover detectives .
Deputy Shawn Thomas Lucas , 30 , was arrested after detectives received information he was selling pain pills and set up a buy , where he sold them six whole Oxycontin tablets and nine half - tablets , for a total of 4.4 grams , or about $ 200 worth .
During a post - arrest search of his vehicle , detectives recovered a load . 45 - caliber handgun .
Now , he is charged with armed drug trafficking .
Lucas told detectives the pills had been prescribed to his deceased father and he was peddling them because he and his family were having financial difficulties .
Lucas has now resigned from the sheriff 's office .
In Jacksboro , Tennessee , two Campbell County law enforcement officers were arrested September 5 for allegedly stealing drugs from the Jacksboro Police Department and trading them for prescription drugs .
Jacksboro Police Officer Ancil Parker , 30 , and Campbell County jail guard Tonya Robinson , 34 , are both charged with delivery of a schedule II controlled substance and official misconduct .
Robinson also was charged with one count of theft under $ 500 .
The pair are being held responsible for marijuana and cocaine that went missing from the police department last year .
In Chicago , a Chicago police officer and another man were arrested Monday for plotting to set up the man 's estranged wife on drug and firearms charges .
Bogdan Mazur , 47 , tried to set up his wife by scheming to deliver 44 grams of cocaine , 62 grams of marijuana and a gun with a defaced serial number to his wife , and enlisted Officer Slawomir Plewa , 30 , to help him out .
Mazur allegedly arranged with Plewa to have him detain and arrest his wife even though both knew the charges were false .
The woman was acquitted of the gun and drug charges in January .
Now Plewa is charged with official misconduct , perjury , obstruction of justice , unlawful restraint and false reporting .
Mazur faces charges of filing a false police report , obstruction of justice , conspiracy to manufacture or deliver cocaine and cannabis , and unlawful possession of a firearm , according to police reports .

Researchers Find Reverse Bradley Effect in Primaries
The Bradley effect -- a black politician doing well in the polls but badly in the actual election -- has been much discussed but there is little data on how it would work this year .
Now a team of researchers from the University of Washington has analyzed the data from the 32 Democratic primaries this year and come to a surprising conclusion .
The effect existed in California , New Hampshire , and Rhode Island , but a reverse effect existed in 12 other states , largely in the Southeast .
Obama did better in the elections there than in the polls leading up to them .
Researchers speculate that some people may tend to give pollsters the " socially correct " answer and in the Southeast , supporting the white person is socially correct .
But this is just one study .
Do n't take it too seriously .
McCain in Trouble with Latinos McCain 's relationship with the Latino community has been poisoned by the anti-immigrant Tancredo wing of the Republican party , but also by McCain himself .
When he coauthored the McCain - Kennedy immigration bill , which would have provided a path to citizenship for 12 million illegal immigrants , many of them Latinos , he was cheered by the Latino community .
For a while it looked like he could have gotten more than the 40 % of the Latino vote that Bush got in 2004 .
But when he rejected his own bill and said he would veto it if Congress passed it , the Latinos bailed on him .
Four key swing states -- Florida , Colorado , Nevada , and New Mexico - - have large Latino populations and he has developed a profound weakness there that is probably too late to repair .
Earlier this year when McCain was forced to make a choice -- between the Tancredos and the Latinos - - he chose the Tancredos and he has now discovered that you reap what you sow .
Politifact Debunks Obama - Ayers Connection
The McCain campaign and the RNC are still using ads ( e.g. , like this one that link Obama and 1960s radical William Ayers .
Now Polifact has examined the ads closely and concluded that the claim that Obama and Ayers ran a radical education foundation together is a " pants - on - fire " lie .
While it is true that Obama was the nominal head of the foundation in question , Ayers never had a paid position on the foundation 's staff , never was on the board , and never had a vote on anything .
His connection to Obama was attending some board meetings that were open to the public , and this 20 years after his radical days , by which time he had reformed enough to get a Ph.D. in education from Columbia University and was able to win Chicago 's " Citizen of the Year " award in 1997 for his work for nonprofit organizations .
In short , while Ayers was a despicable person in his youth , the McCain campaign 's relentless harping on the close relationship between Obama and Ayers is very misleading .
They were n't close at all .
The Man Behind the " Obama Is a Muslim " Campaign Is Exposed " E-mails have been circulating this year saying that Obama is a Muslim or is not a U.S. citizen , and similar things that are not true .
Polls show that 10 - 15 % of the population believe them .
Ever wonder how these things get started ?
They are not seeded by spores from meteorites that landed on the earth 50 million years ago .
They are very intentional , carefully crafted campaigns and one of the people responsible , Andy Martin , appeared on Fox News last week .
The NY Times has a story on Martin .
He has run for public office numerous times ( once so he could " exterminate Jew power " ) and lost them all and has filed so many frivolous lawsuits that a federal judge once forbade him from filing any more without advance permission .
Opening Shot in the Battle for the Soul of the Republican Party If John McCain wins the presidency , he will probably have enough power to force recalcitrant Republicans to grudgingly follow him on most issues .
However , House Republicans are already beginning to at least consider how they would regroup under an Obama presidency .
About 110 of the 199 are members of the Republican Study Committee , which thinks the party should get back to its conservative roots .
Although many of them held their noses and voted for the Patriot Act and No Child Left Behind , in principle they oppose these laws , both of which vastly expanded the role of the federal government .
Most of them voted against the Wall St. bailout act until so much pork was thrown in that they smelled the bacon and could n't resist .
The bailout bill might later prove to be the opening shot in the war for the soul of the Republican Party .

Today 's Polls
We have three presidential polls today .
One of them is either astounding or wrong .
Minnesota State University Moorhead ran a poll in North Dakota and found Barack Obama ahead of John McCain 45 % to 43 % .
Now that is just a statistical tie , but a statistical tie in a state Bush won by 27 points in 2004 and 28 points in 2000 is not good news for McCain .
He really does n't have the time , energy , and resources to fight for states like North Dakota .
Maybe this is just a fluke though .
Nevada is also a near tie , but that is expected .

[ Congressional Record : July 31 , 2008 ( Senate ) ] [ Page S7955 - S7956 ] STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS By Mr. FEINGOLD ( for himself and Mr. Whitehouse ) : S. 3405 .
A bill to prohibit secret modifications and revocations of the law , and for other purposes ; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs .
Mr. FEINGOLD .
Mr. President , today , the junior Senator from Rhode Island , Senator Whitehouse , and I will introduce the Executive Order Integrity Act of 2008 .
The bill prevents secret changes to published Executive Orders by requiring the President to place a notice in the Federal Register when he has modified or revoked a published Order .
Through this simple measure , the bill takes an important step toward stemming the growth of secret law in the executive branch .
The principle behind this bill is straightforward .
It is a basic tenet of democracy that the people have a right to know the law .
Indeed , the notion of ``secret law ' ' has been described in court opinions and law treatises as ``repugnant '' and ``an abomination . ''
That is why the laws passed by Congress have historically been matters of public record .
But the law that applies in this country includes more than just statutes .
It includes regulations , the controlling legal interpretations of courts and the executive branch , and certain Presidential directives .
As we learned at a hearing of the Judiciary Committee 's Constitution Subcommittee that I chaired in April , some of this body of executive and judicial law is increasingly being kept secret from the public , and too often from Congress as well .
The Bush administration has concealed Department of Justice legal opinions , interpretations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , and even the agency rule that requires Americans to show identification at airports .
The shroud of secrecy extends to Executive Orders and other Presidential directives that carry the force of law .
The Federal Register Act requires the President to publish any Executive Orders that have general applicability and legal effect .
But through the diligent efforts of my colleague Senator Whitehouse , we learned last December that the Department of Justice has taken the position that a President can ``waive ' ' or ``modify '' any Executive Order without any notice to the public or Congress - - simply by not following it .
In other words , even in cases where the President is required to make the law public , the President can change the law in secret .
The Office of Legal Counsel memorandum that contains this position is still classified , but Senator Whitehouse convinced the Department of Justice to declassify certain statements in the memorandum .
The Senator from Rhode Island spoke on the floor last December , and many times since then , about these statements .
They include the statement that ``[w ] henever [ the President ] wishes to depart from the terms of a previous executive order , '' he may do so , because ``an executive order cannot limit a President . ''
And he does n't have to change the executive order , or give notice that he 's violating it , because by ``depart[ing ] from the executive order , '' the President ``has instead modified or waived it . ''
Now , no one disputes that a President can withdraw or revise an Executive Order at any time ; that is every President 's prerogative .
But abrogating a published Executive order without any public notice works a secret change in the law .
Worse , because the published Order stays on the books , it actively misleads Congress and the public as to what the law is .
This is not just a hypothetical problem dreamed up by the Office of Legal Counsel .
It has happened , and it could happen again .
To list just one example , the administration 's warrantless wiretapping program not only violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ; it was inconsistent with several provisions of Executive Order 12333 , the longstanding executive order governing electronic surveillance and other intelligence activities .
Apparently , the administration believed its actions constituted a tacit amendment of that Executive Order .
And who knows how many other Executive Orders have been secretly revoked or amended by the conduct of this Administration .
The bill that Senator Whitehouse and I will introduce provides a simple solution to this problem .
If the President revokes , modifies , waives , or suspends a published Executive Order or similar directive , notice of this change in the law must be placed in the Federal Register within 30 days .
The notice must specify the Order or the provision that has been affected ; whether the change is a revocation , a modification , a waiver , or a suspension ; and the nature and circumstances of the change .
If information about the nature and circumstances of the change is classified , it is exempt from the publication requirement , but the information still must be provided to Congress so that we , as legislators , know how the law has been changed .
That is what our bill does ; now let me talk briefly about what our bill does not do .
First , it does not expand the existing legal requirements , under the Federal Register Act , that determine which Executive Orders must be published .
To the extent the Federal Register Act permits a certain amount of ``secret law '' in the form of unpublished Executive Orders , our bill leaves that framework in place .
Second , our bill does not require public notice when the President revokes or modifies an unpublished Executive Order -- even if the substance of the unpublished order is well - known to Congress and even the American people .
This bill is narrowly aimed at the situation in which the American people have been given official notice of one version of the law , but a different version is being implemented .
Third , the bill does not require the President to adhere to the terms of an Executive Order .
Many scholars have argued that a President must adhere to a formally promulgated Executive Order unless or until the Order is formally withdrawn or amended , just as the head of an agency must adhere to the agency 's regulations .
I happen to agree .
But this bill does not take a position on OLC 's assertion that any deviation from the Executive Order by the President is a permissible amendment of that Order .
It simply requires public notice that the amendment has occurred .
Fourth , the bill does not require the publication of classified information about intelligence sources and methods or similar information .
The basic fact that the published law is no longer in effect , however , can not be classified .
On rare occasions , national security can justify elected officials keeping some information secret , but it can never justify lying to the American people about what the law is .
Maintaining two different sets of laws , one public and one secret , is just that -- deceiving the American people about what law applies to the government 's conduct .
I commend Senator Whitehouse for his tireless work to bring this issue to light , and I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to support this modest effort to ensure the integrity of our published laws .
Mr. President , I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be placed in the Record .
There being no objection , the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record , as follows : S. 3405
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled , SECTION 1 .
SHORT TITLE .
This Act may be cited as the ``Executive Order Integrity Act of 2008 ' ' . [ [ Page S7956 ] ]

( CNN ) -- Muslim - Americans say they are more interested than ever before in the political process , in part because their religion has been reduced to a talking point in the presidential campaign .
Fatema Biviji , in white by sign , poses with members of the grassroots organization she founded in Texas .
Like many other Americans , the estimated 2.3 million Muslims living in the U.S. have been hurt by a limping economy , a problematic healthcare system and an unclear immigration policy .
And the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have also hit close to home .
Fatema Biviji , 32 , had never given much thought to politics until she received an e-mail earlier this year that said -- falsely -- that Sen. Barack Obama is a Muslim .
The Internet hoax , its origin unknown , was apparently intended to tie Obama to terrorism and swing support to his opponent , Republican Sen. John McCain .
" I was so mad , " Biviji said .
" The premise of that e-mail is that a person 's religion should decide a person 's character .
" We 're America , the melting pot , the land of diversity , and that Americans would be buying into that psychology [ of the e-mails ] was upsetting , " said the New Jersey - born Muslim , whose parents are from India .
" The e-mail offended my American ideals . "
Obama has stated repeatedly that he is a Christian and emphatically pledged his patriotism .
Biviji began to research Obama and could relate to his international background , his years in Indonesia as a young man , and his father 's Kenyan roots .
And his views on the issues aligned with hers .
So she began chatting with members of her community in Irving , Texas , encouraging people to register to vote and become more active .
She began blogging about the presidential election and formed a grass - roots organization with about 100 members who have helped register dozens of people to vote , she said .
Her blog is featured on Obama 's campaign Web site .
But Biviji said it has n't always been easy for Muslim - Americans to support candidates who do n't usually seem to support them .
" Neither candidate has visited a mosque , " said Ahmed Rehab , the executive director of the Chicago chapter of the Council on American - Islamic Relations , a civil liberties and advocacy group .
" It might not be a gesture that 's the politically right thing to do , but it 's the morally right thing , " Rehab said .
CAIR has registered thousands of Muslim voters across the country .
He said he was approached by one of the major parties to run for office this year .
But he decided against it .
" If you have one guy [ Obama ] who has a Muslim father that he really never knew and who is n't a Muslim being hounded , then imagine a guy like me who works so publicly in support of rights for Muslims , " said Rehab .
" I 'm not sure I want to go through that . "
But Asma Hasan , a 34 - year - old from Colorado who writes the blog " Glamocracy " for Glamour magazine , said she thinks Muslims are more likely to jump into the political fray .
" I think people tend to be more open to different points of view now than they were before , " she said .
" It 's not a perfect environment , but it 's getting better . "
Her brother Mohammad Ali Hasan , 28 , is Muslim and Republican .
He is running for a Colorado state Senate seat .
" If I do n't win , it 's not because I 'm a Muslim , " he said , laughing .
" It will likely be because I 'm a Republican . "
Asma Hasan said it can be a challenge sometimes to reconcile being a Republican and being a Muslim .
" A lot of this election is about the Iraq war , the GOP 's support for the war and ultimately how we handle that war now , " she said .
Several younger voters have e-mailed her about her blog items filed from the campaign trail with thoughtful , substantive political comments and questions .
They are excited about the election and they plan to vote , she said .
" But that 's the beauty of politics because it does n't matter what your religion is or your cultural background or who your family is , " she said .
" You make decisions on who to vote for based on a lot of different factors -- not just one .
And I think people are interested this year .
There are definitely a lot of younger people , and a lot of younger Muslims , who are going to vote . "
Asma Hasan echoed Rehab 's frustration about the occasional fumbles of the candidates toward the Muslim community .
She pointed to a June incident at an Obama rally .
Two women were told not to sit behind Obama because they were wearing head scarves .
Campaign volunteers thought it would would look bad if the women were seen behind the candidate in a photo or on television .
The Obama campaign quickly apologized , and a campaign spokeswoman said that the incident was not reflective of Obama 's message , according to the New York Times .
More recently , a woman at a McCain rally in Minnesota stood up and faced the candidate .
She said she does n't support Obama because " He is an Arab . "
McCain shook his head and replied , " No ma'am , no ma'am . "
Former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell , a Republican , endorsed Obama for president on Sunday , praising Obama as a candidate who is " inclusive . "
Powell said he had heard members of his own party suggest that Obama is a Muslim .
" What if he is ?
Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country ? "
Powell said .
" No , that 's not America .
Is there something wrong with some 7 - year - old Muslim kid believing that he or she can be president ? "
Powell made the endorsement on NBC's " Meet the Press " and went on to say that he was disturbed by recent attacks the McCain camp had lobbed at Obama .
" It troubled me .
We have two wars .
We have economic problems .
We have health problems .
We have education problems .
We have infrastructure problems .
We have problems around the world with our allies .
So those are the problems the American people wanted to hear about , not about [ 1960s radical William ]
Ayers , not about who is a Muslim or who 's not a Muslim , " Powell told reporters after the endorsement .
" Those kinds of images going out on Al - Jazeera are killing us around the world , " Powell continued .
" And we have got to say to the world , it does n't make any difference who you are or what you are .
If you 're an American , you 're an American . "
" That was over the top .
It was beyond just good political fighting back and forth , " he said .
" And to sort of throw in this little Muslim connection , you know , ' He 's a Muslim and , my goodness , he 's a terrorist ' -- it was taking root .
And we can't judge our people and we can't hold our elections on that kind of basis . "
After Powell 's announcement , McCain told Fox News he considered Powell and himself " longtime friends " and that he respected him .
Powell also referred to a photo essay from a magazine featuring a photo of a mother resting her head on the tombstone of her son at Arlington National Cemetery .
The tombstone lists the soldier 's awards , including a Purple Heart , that were earned in Iraq .
The solider was Kareem Khan , a 20 - year - old Muslim from New Jersey .
The soldier 's father , Feroze Khan , said he wants to personally thank Powell for his statement .
" All my son wanted to do was serve his country , " he told CNN .
" Since he was a boy , he wanted to be in the Army .
That was his dream .
That 's the only thing he ever wanted . "
" It was not about how he was Muslim , it was about who he was and what he stood for , " Feroze Khan said .
" He told me , ' I am going to fight for my faith , not against it . ' "
Feroze Khan does n't want to talk about politics .
What the candidates say about his religion is of little importance to him .
His son defined what he believes in .

KTM Producing Off - Road Electric Motorcycle
October 22nd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
While this week ’s news of an upcoming self - balancing electric unicycle was certainly exciting ( and strange ) , KTM ’s announcement today about its electric off - road motorcycle may be even better .
The company claims that it has produced a quiet motorcycle prototype with up to 35 horsepower and the ability to run for 40 minutes on a lithium ion battery without recharging .
While many details about the motorcycle are under wraps , KTM does say that the bike produces 29.5 foot - pounds of torque .
The battery and motor weigh 37.5 pounds combined , but the weight of the actual bike is not yet available .
Since off - roaders typically travel short distances , all - terrain electric bikes make a lot of sense .
We ’ll see if riders take to the idea in two years when KTM releases its motorcycle .

The Sarah Palin " boom " that has so traumatized Democrats and intimidated the press will have little if any impact on the presidential election .
People do n't vote for vice presidents , they vote for presidents .
This race is about John McCain and Barack Obama not Annie Oakley from Wasilla , Alaska .
It is also about turnout numbers and the electoral demographics in 2008 which overwhelm any impact Sarah Palin might have on the election outcome .
First the Palin " boom " .
It is the product of surprise ( a short lived but powerful force in politics ) , an emotional outlet for the GOP Right , and post convention polls .
In the intense coverage of politics by the ever expanding number of outlets for political information , what is new and surprising quickly becomes over exposed resulting in a short shelf life .
The freshness goes away quickly .
So it will be shortly for Ms. Palin .
She has had the best week in this campaign she will have and the only direction now is down .
The large turnouts at McCain / Palin events this week are a result of an energized Right ( which will vote Republican anyway ) and say as much about the lack of enthusiasm on the Right for McCain before he picked Palin as it does about any shift in the electorate .
As for post convention polls ; they are the least predictive of the eventual outcome as any polls in a presidential election .
Of course there was a " bounce " after 3 days of what amounted to an infomercial for McCain and a negative ad campaign against Obama .
It will not last .
Despite the best efforts of the McCain campaign to control press access to Palin , they can hold back the press tide only so long .
It is simply too big and prolific .
McCain 's campaign manager Rick Davis said on Fox News Sunday they will continue to limit press access until the media shows some " deference " to Palin .
Deference is for dictators and monarchs not for junior governors of sparsely populated states like Alaska who expect to be second in line to the leader of the world 's oldest Democracy .
When the press tide breaks over Palin what has been given little coverage will be widely disseminated :
* Instead of being a reform governor who hates federal " pork " it will become common knowledge that she has lobbied for and gotten $ 770 million dollars in pork projects making Alaska among the top three states per capita receiving government largess .
* Far from opposing the infamous " Bridge to Nowhere " pork project , she supported it wholeheartedly only to oppose it when the project became a political bombshell ( She kept the bridge money anyway for other Alaskan boondoggles ) .
* Palin is a right winger .
She opposes abortion even in the case of rape , incest AND even if the health of the mother is in jeopardy .
She favors shooting wolves from airplanes and has addressed her husband 's Alaska Independence Movement affiliation which calls for a vote on Alaska separating from the United States .
And this is only what we know so far .
As Barack Obama rightly said stories about Palin 's family should be off limits .
Besides a sense of propriety , raising her family issues only gives the McCain campaign more ammunition for press bashing .
There is plenty of information on Palin unrelated to her family to drive the gender gap back to the Democrats and to ignite the Democratic base .
Now to numbers and demographics ( those things that , unlike Palin , really matter in this election year ) .
It has been widely reported that Democrats have a decided advantage over Republicans in voter self identification ( from the low double digits to a 20 % spread ) .
What has received less attention is the number of newly registered voters in 2008 .
According to USA Today in the 28 states that register voters by party affiliation the Democrats have added 2 million new voters in 2008 while Republicans have lost 344,000 .
Among the states with the largest number of new registrants are Ohio and Pennsylvania , two hotly contested states between Obama and Clinton ( yet another reason to debunk the notion that a protracted nominating season hurt Obama ) .
Add to this the vastly superior ongoing voter registration efforts by the Obama campaign which should result in an even greater Democrat to Republican registration advantage by November 4th .
Given voter self identification numbers , even if Republicans get organized there are far fewer Republicans to register in 2008 .
Demographics also favor the Democrats big time in 2008 .
It is generally conceded that Obama will win the youth vote by a healthy margin , and if primaries are indicators of fall turnout ( historically they are ) the youth vote will increase substantially over 2004 .
Millions of new voters have reached 18 since 2004 .
Some examples according to the US Census Bureau :
* In Ohio ( which John Kerry lost by only 120,000 votes in 2004 ) , 750,000 eligible voters between 18 and 22 who could not vote in 2004 can vote in 2008 .
* In Colorado ( Kerry lost by 99,000 ) 293,000 between 18 and 22 have become eligible to vote in 2008 .
* In New Mexico ( Kerry lost by 6000 votes ) 145,000 kids have reached voting age .
* In Michigan 690,000 have become eligible .
* In Virginia 465,000 ( Kerry lost by 260,000 ) .
* In Florida alone over 1 million young people have reached voting age since 2004 .
Then there are black voters .
According to the Census Bureau there are 24 million eligible black voters in America of which 16 million ( 64 % ) are registered .
In 2004 blacks cast 14 million votes or only 56 % of the eligible black population .
Blacks are registering to vote at historic rates in 2008 and turnout will soar above 2004 levels .
Some examples :
* In Colorado there are 110000 eligible black voters .
Only 50,000 voted in 2004 .
* In Ohio there are 860,000 eligible black voters .
Only 380,000 voted in 2004 .
( Remember Kerry lost by only 120,000 votes ) .
* In Virginia , 945,000 eligible black voters , 465,000 voted in 2004 .
* Florida ; 1,750,000 eligible blacks , 770,000 voted in 2004 .
Not to get morbid but there is another statistic that is working against the Republicans .
The Center for Disease Control estimates there have been , on average , 2.5 million deaths in America each year since 2005 , the overwhelming number of whom were 65 years and older .
Since it is generally conceded that John McCain will win the over 65 vote the actuarial tables present a problem .
But you say millions have turned 65 since 2004 .
Correct , but among the people who were 61 - 64 in 2004 the vote split evenly between Kerry and Bush .
Put it all together and the conclusions are fairly obvious .
Sarah Palin may help turnout marginally on the Right but mostly in states that will vote Republican like Alaska .
In battleground states , voter registration , newly eligible young voters , eligible nonvoting blacks , and even death rates all favor Obama .
Excuse the pun but Palin 's impact on the 2008 election pales in comparison to the Democrats ' demographic advantages .
In the end all the Palin " boom " you hear today will be a whimper come Election Day .
This is a maxim from Fred Brooks ’
The Mythical Man-Month .
These days I ’m thinking it ’s the single most important lesson there is about software .
It ’s been brought rudely home to me by my recent work on mod_atom , whose design is terribly simple ; but I still got the first cut wrong in important ways .
What I Got Wrong · mod_atom is about as simple as an AtomPub server can be ; all the entries and feeds and collections are backed one - for - one by ordinary flat files , with entries scattered across a YYYY / MM / DD tree , just like here at ongoing .
I had two URI / filesystem hierarchies , rooted at atom / and pub / , to separate the resources that exist for AtomPub , like Service Documents and Media Link Entries , from those that are there to be read , like feeds and HTML pages ; the goal was to make access control easy .
How could that be wrong ?
What happened was , I went back , after a few months of ignoring mod_atom , to build in Meta - pubs , so you can do CRUD on whole publications , not just individual entries and media files .
This ended up touching most pieces of the system , and I realized that a couple of the core ideas were leading me into all sorts of tangled - code complexity ; in particular the double directory structure .
So I rewrote it with one filesystem tree routed at pub / , backing two URI spaces which were identical except for being rooted at pub / and atom / .
The mod_atom code forces all PUT and POST and DELETE requests to go through the atom / subtree .
This allowed me to slash literally hundreds of lines of code .
There was another design error , just as obvious in retrospect ; its cleanup also allowed subtracting severe gnarl and great big chunks of code .
Programmers experience soaring joy when they can rip through code deleting functions and declarations , screens - full into the bit bucket , with the steady drumbeat of tests - fail - then - pass .
So maybe I did n’t build one to throw away , but I built one that needed major amputations out of the box .
And Your Point Is ? ·
This is by most standards a simple system ; at the moment , excluding various XML - and HTML - munging libraries , less than six thousand lines of code .
I ’m an experienced programmer , have written hundreds of thousands of lines of C code , know the internals of httpd pretty well , and understand AtomPub as well as anyone in the world .
I ’m not a truly great developer ( I know this is true because I ’ve worked with some ) but I ’m not a moron either ( worked with some of them too ) so if I ’m going to make this kind of misstep , a whole lot of other people will too .
And let me make a strong statement : I ’m not sure there ’s anyone living , including your five favorite programming heroes , who could tell you , without writing the code , whether one or two directory trees were going to work out better for this problem .
Given that , what hope is there for waterfall development ?
Or for any approach that does n’t leave space for going back and building things right once you ’ve learned what “ right ” is by building things once ?
Well , none .
But You Already Knew That · Probably true .
But you know what , how about we all agree , all of us who write about writing software , to write about this once every year or so .
Because there ’s this terrible glaring conflict between what sensible managers want and what sensible programmers know .
Managers , good managers , want a plan ; they want to lock in design constraints so that work can be dealt out and progress tracked and promises kept .
Programmers , good programmers , know that they ’re not smart enough to get the core design choices right until they ’ve built something that works .
The various techniques and disciplines gathered around the banner of “ agile ” are on balance more honest at facing up to this unavoidable tension .
But there ’s still lots more work to be done .
And the most important thing is , we all have to remind ourselves , all the time , that we ’re not smart enough to get anything important right the first time .
Exceptions ? · Yes , of course .
If you ’ve just written three driver - scheduling systems or foreign - exchange systems in a row , you ’ll probably go into the fourth with a pretty good grasp of what ’s important .
And those kinds of systems matter .
But the interesting software is by definition the stuff that is n’t the fourth iteration of anything .
Perhaps it ’s best to close with Brooks ’ quote in full :
China introduced the new rules ahead of the Olympics China has extended some of the rules that gave foreign reporters greater freedom during the Beijing Olympics .
State news agency Xinhua said the temporary arrangement for the games , due to expire on Friday , would become standard practice .
It means journalists can continue to conduct interviews without applying to the authorities for permission .
The move has been welcomed by the main organisation representing overseas media in China .
" If properly implemented , we believe this will mark a step forward in the opening of China 's media environment , " said Jonathan Watts , president of the Foreign Correspondents ' Club of China .
The club called on the authorities to make sure police and local officials respected the freedoms .
Correspondents say the move to extend the more liberal rules has been eagerly awaited and is a sign of China 's commitment to allow foreign journalists more freedom to report on a permanent basis .
But it is not clear whether other measures will remain in place , such as those which allowed journalists to travel freely around the country without the supervision of a foreign ministry official .
Restrictions remain
How free are reporters in China ?
Despite repeated questions from foreign journalists about the issue , China had not until now said what would happen after the rules expire .
They were introduced in January last year and covered foreign journalists who wanted to report on Olympic - related issues .
The rules allow correspondents to travel around China without first getting permission from the authorities - as they had to do previously .
" To interview organisations or individuals in China , foreign journalists need only to obtain their prior consent , " the regulations state .
HAVE YOUR SAY I do not think any of us will be holding our collective breath to see if Chinese officials will be less restrictive Shelia Bumgarner , United States
In practice foreign reporters have had more freedom to do their work , but have not been completely left alone by the authorities , says the BBC's Michael Bristow in Beijing .
Certain sensitive areas , such as Tibet , were off limits , and correspondents have continued to be detained by the authorities .
There have been hundreds of reports of foreign journalists being intimidated or harassed by officials who were either not aware of the rules or chose to ignore them .
The BBC's China Editor , Shirong Chen , says China 's leaders are aware that they need foreign journalists in order to communicate with the international community but that ensuring real freedoms on the ground will remain a challenge .
Significantly , the regulations do not apply to Chinese journalists , who will continue to face a high degree of control and censorship by the Chinese government .

During the LinuxWorld Expo in San Francisco , I met with Bob Sutor , IBM 's vice president of open source and standards .
We discussed document standards and the implications of ISO 's controversial decision to grant fast - track approval to Microsoft 's Office Open XML ( OOXML ) format .
Allegations of procedural irregularities in the OOXML approval process have raised serious questions about the integrity of ISO .
Some national standards bodies complained that their views were disregarded or ignored during the OOXML ballot resolution meeting because of unreasonable time constraints .
Some critics fear that the problems that arose during the ISO evaluation of OOXML will contribute to disillusionment and apathy towards open standards .
I asked Sutor if he thinks that the murky OOXML process will lead to uncertainty about standards in general .
He does n't accept that possibility and argued instead that the widespread public scrutiny received by OOXML is a sign that people are beginning to care deeply about open standards .
He says that the extensive mainstream press coverage and public discussion about the OOXML decision helped to boost the visibility of ODF and increase awareness of standards - based technology .
Although he does n't believe that the OOXML controversy will slow down adoption of open standards , he suspects that ISO will lose some credibility .
The national bodies that were not permitted to present their proposals during the review process clearly feel that they were marginalized by blanket voting and other procedural shortcuts .
This has led them to question the inclusiveness of ISO .
The organization 's dismissive response to the allegations has seriously exacerbated the issue and is reinforcing the perception of exclusivity .
ISO asserts that the approval of OOXML inherently validates the process .
It also argues that the procedural shortcuts that blemished the OOXML process were permissible because they were instituted by the will of the majority .
The ISO standardization model clearly favors consensus over technical validity , which means that it can provide no substantive guarantees that the standards it produces are actually sound .
Sutor says that this revelation will compel some to question whether ISO is really a suitable venue for technical standards .
In practice , the consensus - driven approach may be well suited for standardizing things like paper sizes , but not document formats .
If ISO declines to acknowledge the problems with its standardization model and pursue needed reforms , then it could face irrelevance , Sutor said .
He pointed out that ISO has no inherent authority beyond the trust vested in it by national standards bodies and implementors of standards .
He argued that anyone can create a standards organization and that other organizations will emerge to displace ISO if it loses public trust .
I asked him if he thinks that ISO approval of OOXML will drive implementors and adopters away from ODF .
He has seen no evidence of such a trend and argued that uptake of OOXML has been slow .
He claimed that the complexity of the standard has deterred acceptance and said that Microsoft 's next - generation office suite has n't significantly accelerated usage of OOXML in the wild .
The vast majority of existing documents are already in the old binary formats and he contends that many users of Office 2007 still save new documents in the binary formats to accommodate compatibility with the older version .
He thinks that implementors want to tap into that massive legacy document base and do n't see much value yet in supporting OOXML in their software .
He is convinced that the industry will regard OOXML as a dead end , and that will force Microsoft to accept ODF .
We have already seen some evidence of this in Microsoft 's recent decision to support ODF in Office — a change of heart that was precipitated by pressure from ODF adopters .
Sutor suspects that this trend will continue and that Microsoft will eventually fully embrace ODF .
Sutor acknowledges that ODF lacks support for some of Office 's functionality , but he is convinced that the gaps can be filled if Microsoft is willing to collaborate with OASIS and propose improvements to the format .
His chief concern is that suspicion and distrust of Microsoft could undermine any collaboration , so he strongly encourages ODF advocates to keep an open mind and give Microsoft the benefit of the doubt if the company makes a bona fide effort to participate in the evolution of the standard .
If Microsoft is n't given the opportunity to participate in shaping the future of ODF or chooses not to , he says we will likely see the company embrace and extend the format with its own non-standard extensions .
He hopes that the ODF community can collectively work with Microsoft to prevent the format from suffering that kind of fragmentation .
The road ahead for ODF is filled with both challenges and opportunities .
Sutor sees a very promising future for open standards and is convinced that companies and governments are now capable of recognizing the value of interoperability .
Ms Moskalenko represents the family of Anna Politskovskaya French police have opened an inquiry into allegations that a prominent Russian human rights lawyer may have been poisoned in Strasbourg on Monday .
Karina Moskalenko , who represents some of the Kremlin 's best known critics , fell ill after finding a substance similar to mercury inside her car .
She and members of her family were later treated for nausea and headaches .
Prosecutors said there had not been enough of the substance to endanger life , but that more tests were needed .
Ms Moskalenko's clients include the jailed former Russian oil tycoon , Mikhail Khodorkovsky , and the family of the murdered journalist , Anna Politkovskaya .
The lawyer said on Tuesday that her illness had meant she was unable to travel to Moscow on Wednesday for a preliminary hearing at the trial of three men charged with Ms Politkovskaya 's murder .
Was it a demonstration , which I only noticed too late , or on the contrary , did I notice it too soon , and the plan was that it should travel with us for longer ?
Karina Moskalenko
" People do not put mercury in your car to improve your health , " she told Russia 's Ekho Moskvy radio station .
" I am very concerned because there were children in that car . "
" The question that preoccupies me now is : was it a demonstration , which I only noticed too late , or on the contrary , did I notice it too soon , and the plan was that it should travel with us for longer ? "
One of Ms Moskalenko's colleagues , Anna Stavitskaya , also said the incident appeared to be " an attempt at intimidation " linked to the trial , and that she would ask for the hearing to be postponed .
Symptoms of mercury poisoning can include memory loss , mood instability , headaches and visual and hearing problems .
It can also damage the immune system and kidneys .
An assistant prosecutor in Strasbourg said an investigation had been opened into the incident .
He also said Ms Moskalenko and her family had been invited to undergo a medical examination to check if they had been contaminated .
" The circumstances as well as her background are such that she is concerned , " Claude Palpacuer told the Reuters news agency .
A former Russian agent , Alexander Litvinenko , who was a fierce critic of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin , died from polonium poisoning in London in 2006 .
UK investigators suspect former KGB agent Andrei Lugovoi of the murder , but he has always denied any involvement .

We 've had a lot of posts about newer movies here on GeekDad , but everyone knows it 's important to read classic novels in order to properly appreciate modern ones , and , likewise , it 's important to watch classic movies .
Now , many classic movies are too complicated or too intense for kids , so it seems appropriate to start the discussion with comedies .
Here are ten comedies that are essential viewing for every geek :
1. Duck Soup -
It 's hard to pick just one Marx Brothers movie , but this is probably the easiest one for kids to appreciate .
The songs in Duck Soup are all silly ones , unlike in most of their movies .
And there 's tons of slapstick , like the scene with Harpo , Chico , and the lemonade vendor , and of course the famous mirror scene .
The political satire will go right over most kids ' heads , but teenagers will love it .
The only thing to watch out for is a then - acceptable , now - racist line from Groucho : " The Headstrongs married the Armstrongs and that 's why darkies were born . "
2 . The Court Jester - Danny Kaye was a comic genius , and this is one of his best movies .
It 's accessible to kids because of the Robin Hood - era setting , and the story is , while not uncomplicated , mostly unnecessary to enjoy the funniest bits .
Plus , it 's got Basil Rathbone parodying himself , and Angela Lansbury as a self - absorbed princess .
You can't miss .
3. Sons of the Desert - Laurel and Hardy 's best , with all the lines delivered with their trademark comic precision .
While they made at least three other movies with essentially the same plot as this one , it 's probably the best introduction to the pair .
4 . The General - Probably Buster Keaton 's best movie , with some of the most amazing stunts ever performed on film .
The movie simply never stops moving start to finish , and has enough slapstick and other visual humor that most kids probably wo n't care that it 's a silent film .
5. Safety Last ! -
Another silent , this is the Harold Lloyd film where he famously hangs from the face of a clock .
It 's short , very funny , and amazing to watch the stunts .
Plus , if you take our advice and show your geeklings Back to the Future , they 'll recognize the homage in the clock - hanging scene in that movie–and you can tell them about the Harold / Christopher Lloyd connection , too ( though they 're not related ) .
( More after the jump . )
6. Buck Privates
- Show your kids " Who 's on First , " of course , but that 's only four minutes long .
As their movies went , Abbott and Costello did n't get much better than they were in their first big movie .
It 's funny throughout , but is worth it just for the scene where Costello explains to Abbott that 28 divided by 7 is 13 , which may possibly not be good for kids still learning early math skills ( kidding ! ) .
7. Bringing Up Baby - Cary Grant .
Katherine Hepburn .
A leopard .
One of the best screwball comedies ever made .
What more could you possibly want ?
8. Modern Times -
More slapstick , with its master Charlie Chaplin .
Most kids wo n't get the social commentary , but the Little Tramp is bound to appeal .
Worth it just for Chaplin 's famous trip through the machinery .
9 . The Great Race -
The most recent movie on the list ( 1965 ) , this Jack Lemmon / Tony Curtis film is n't as great as Some Like It Hot , but is much more accessible to kids .
It 's ostensibly about a car race around the world , but it 's really about as much slapstick as Blake
Edwards could fit into a movie with a whole bunch of great actors .
10 . It Happened One Night
- The original screwball comedy , with Clark Gable at his most charming .
You can even teach the kids a bit about the time period , mentioning the possibility ( unconfirmed ) that sales of men's undershirts may have fallen drastically after the scene where Gable takes off his shirt to show his bare chest .
As usual , please add your own suggestions in the comments .
In the 1800s , Samuel Augustus Maverick went to Texas and became known for not branding his cattle .
He was more interested in keeping track of the land he owned than the livestock on it , Ms. Maverick said ; unbranded cattle , then , were called “ Maverick’s . ”
The name came to mean anyone who did n’t bear another ’s brand .
Image BRAND Samuel Augustus Maverick
Sam Maverick ’s grandson , Fontaine Maury Maverick , was a two - term congressman and a mayor of San Antonio who lost his mayoral re-election bid when conservatives labeled him a Communist .
He served in the Roosevelt administration on the Smaller War Plants Corporation and is best known for another coinage .
He came up with the term “ gobbledygook ” in frustration at the convoluted language of bureaucrats .
This Maverick ’s son , Maury Jr. , was a firebrand civil libertarian and lawyer who defended draft resisters , atheists and others scorned by society .
He served in the Texas Legislature during the McCarthy era and wrote fiery columns for The San Antonio Express - News .
His final column , published on Feb. 2 , 2003 , just after he died at 82 , was an attack on the coming war in Iraq .
Terrellita Maverick , sister of Maury Jr. , is a member emeritus of the board of the San Antonio chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas .
Considering the family ’s long history of association with liberalism and progressive ideals , it should come as no surprise that Ms. Maverick insists that John McCain , who has voted so often with his party , “ is in no way a maverick , in uppercase or lowercase . ”

Some folks around here think the economic sky is falling and state lawmakers in Sacramento and Salem are ignoring their constituents in the hinterlands .
Guess the time is ripe to create a whole new state .
That 's the thinking up here along the border between California and Oregon , where 12 sparsely populated , thickly forested counties in both states want to break away and generate the 51st star on the nation 's flag - the state of Jefferson .
You can see the signs of discontent from Klamath Falls to Dunsmuir , where green double - X " Jefferson State " flags hang in scores of businesses .
You can hear the talk of revolution at lunch counters and grocery lines , where people grumble that politicians to the north and south do n't care .
You can even hear the dissent on the radio , where 21 area FM stations broadcast from Oregon into California under the banner of " Jefferson Public Radio . "
" We have nothing in common with you people down south .
Nothing , " said Randy Bashaw , manager of the Jefferson State Forest Products lumber mill in the Trinity County hamlet of Hayfork .
" The sooner we 're done with all you people , the better . "
Talking about secession has been a quasi - joking conversational saw since 1941 , when five counties in the area started things by actually declaring themselves - briefly - to be the state of Jefferson .
But now , with the economy in trouble and unemployment soaring , the idea of greater independence is getting its most serious consideration since World War II .
Locals complain that federal and state regulators have hampered the fishing and timber industries to protect forestlands and endangered species such as sucker fish and the spotted owl .
Jobs are so scarce that the median income in the area is only two - thirds that of the rest of the state .
Most water from the rainy Shasta region is shipped south , with little economic benefit to the area .
Even the California sales tax draws sneers .
If they ran their own state , the reasoning goes , folks in Siskiyou , Modoc and the other potential Jefferson counties could whack the red tape from both federal and state officials and get rid of the sales tax .
Seeking signatures
The Grange Hall of Yreka , a farm - based service organization , is activating 51 of its brethren halls in the area to collect 1 million signatures to have a statehood advisory measure put on the California ballot .
Tony Intiso , a runoff candidate in the Nov. 4 election for Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors , has pledged to force the issue and is running campaign ads calling for regional freedom .
The number of registered users of a decade - old Web site advocating partition has suddenly shot from dozens to more than 900 .
" Heck yeah , it 's a darn good idea , " said Richard Mitchell , manager of the Cooley & Pollard Hardware Store on Miner Street , the main drag in the blink - and - you - miss - it town of Yreka .
" Those liberal people down south do n't understand us at all , and if there was a vote today to form a new state , it would pass in a heartbeat .
" I would bet on it . "
The window of Mitchell 's store , where he tends the register in worn work boots and a camouflage hunting cap , displays T - shirts and flags sporting the state " seal " of Jefferson :
Two X's denoting the double - crossing the area supposedly gets from the capitols of California and Oregon .
Movement began in 1941
Mitchell also posts a copy of the original declaration of Jefferson independence , drafted in 1941 by the angry miners and loggers who pushed for secession over the appalling condition of roads .
That movement - the coverage of which earned Chronicle reporter Stanton Delaplane a Pulitzer Prize - lasted just two weeks before the Pearl Harbor attack , when the movement dissolved in the name of national unity .
But it was never forgotten .
" It started out as a big joke back then , but then some folks got real serious and before long they had elected a governor and all that , " said Frances Wacker , 95 , whose husband , the late George Wacker , was one of the 1941 Jefferson movement leaders .
" I think some folks have become serious again and think they have something going . "
Sixty - seven years ago , Wacker recalled , locals were frustrated because they were ignored when they complained to lawmakers that they could n't easily ship copper and timber south to ports and markets on the axle - cracking roads .
The roads have improved since then - the same trip now takes four hours , not the eight of 1941 - but the unhappiness has not .
" It 's not rocket science to see why it makes sense , and how we could do it , " said Brian Petersen , a landscaper who runs the main online forum advocating statehood , www.jeffersonstate.com.
" The capitols of California and Oregon ignore us .
We want out .
" All we have to do is get an initiative on the ballot and vote to get things going . "
Peterson has run his Web site for 10 years .
For most of the time since , the site had a mailing list of about 100 .
In the past year , though , as the Grange began its petition drive and unemployment throughout the region rose to about 10 percent - almost three points above the California average - the mailing list grew nearly 10 times in size .
" If you want any chance of fixing things , sometimes you have to break the system , " said Leo Bergeron , master of Yreka 's Greenhorn Grange Hall and past master of the statewide , agriculturally oriented Grange service club .
" Now , we have to break the system . "
For years , he said , locals have proudly claimed Jefferson is a " state of mind " born of living in an expanse of forestlands and hamlets that is roughly the size of Wales and has about the same population as San Francisco .
Redding , with a population of 80,000 , is the closest thing to a metropolis .
And with 60,000 cattle , Siskiyou County has 15,000 more bovines than it does people .
Along the way , tourist - minded locals have come up with the flags , an official state cow ( " Moo-dona , " a huge sculpture alongside Interstate 5 ) and an official beer ( microbrewed in Etna ) .
The legend of Big Foot is also big around here .
But Bergeron 's not playing around .
" If you do it seriously , some people will think you 're a kook , " said Bergeron , who spearheads the Grange effort .
" But 9 out of 10 people have an interest in this - and we need to reach the ones who are really serious . "
Working toward '09 measure
Bergeron 's first goal is to gather 1,200 signatures in Siskiyou County to put an advisory secession initiative on the county ballot in 2009 .
At the same time , he is urging the 51 Grange Halls in Jefferson territory , and those on the mailing list of www.jeffersonstate.com, to gear up for collecting 1 million signatures to take the advisory measure statewide .
" We 'll need the approval of both states and the federal government , but it can be done , " he said .
" And even if we do n't become a new state , we will have made a statement and can at least get some more independence in our own affairs . "
Such a statement would be news to most in Sacramento .
" Never heard of Jefferson , " said Aaron McLear , spokesman for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger .
" We are going to decline comment . "
Gail Fiorini - Jenner , co-author of two books on the state of Jefferson , said the almost 900,000 people who live in the territory are n't hicks .
Just feisty .
And that , she said , is not new : Since the 1850s , there have been similar attempts to create the states of Klamath and Shasta .
" Everyone thinks we 're dumb rednecks , but we have the far left , the far right and a lot of the middle up here , " she said .
" Our only trouble is we have no political power .
It 's no wonder people want to change that . "

Updated : 2008-09-12 07:32
China , which holds a fifth of its currency reserves in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt , may cut the portion held in US dollars , according to China International Capital Corp ( CICC ) , one of the nation 's biggest investment banks .
The US government this week seized control of the two mortgage - finance companies , which account for almost half of the home - loan market in the world 's biggest economy , to prevent defaults from crippling them .
China holds up to $ 400 billion in the two firms ' debt , CICC Chief Economist Ha Jiming said in a report Thursday .
" The crisis has made Chinese officials realize it's a bad idea to put all their eggs in one basket , " wrote Hong Kong - based Ha .
" This will likely lead to greater diversification of foreign exchange reserve investments . "
China held $ 447.5 billion of US agency bonds as of June 2008 , according to the CICC calculations using disclosures by the US Treasury .
It is likely to reduce the portion of reserves in dollar assets from the current 60 percent by purchasing more non-dollar assets with new reserves , he said .
Countries in Asia have stockpiled foreign exchange reserves since the 1997 - 98 financial crisis to act as a cushion against a run on their exchange rates .
That in turn has increased pressure on policymakers to ensure higher returns from more than $ 4 trillion in assets .
China will expand its investments in corporate bonds and equities , according to Ha .
Treasury and agency bonds account for 50 percent and 40 percent of total dollar assets held by the central bank , he wrote .

About the Machine Learning Group ( Last updated 13 Jul 2001 )
The Laboratory for Knowledge Discovery in Databases ( KDD ) is a research group in the Computing and Information Sciences ( CIS ) Department at Kansas State University .
Its research emphasis is in the areas of applied artificial intelligence ( AI ) and knowledge - based software engineering ( KBSE ) for decision support systems .
More specifically , we are interested in machine learning , data mining and knowledge discovery from large spatial and temporal databases , human - computer intelligent interaction ( HCII ) , and high - performance computation in learning and optimization .
In our research , we look for ways to systematically decompose analytical learning problems based upon information theoretic and probabilistic criteria , so that the most appropriate machine learning methods may be applied to the resulting transformed problems .
One of the major challenges in this area is the design of unsupervised learning and bias ( or hyperparameter ) optimization methods to produce an effective decomposition of learning tasks .
An interesting opportunity presented by this problem is that , by addressing the high - level control of inductive learning in a statistically sound fashion , we can improve our techniques for both model selection and model integration ( as practiced in multimodal sensor fusion ) .
We have developed and applied such approaches to multistrategy learning , which are potentially computation - intensive , to interesting analytical problems in the areas of decision support ( uncertain reasoning ) and control automation .
The goal of our work is to gain insight into the interaction between artifacts that adapt or learn - whether by Bayesian , neural , or genetic computation - and their users .
Important examples of this interaction include data visualization in intelligent displays , software agents for distributed high - performance computation and information retrieval , and virtual environments for simulation and computer - assisted instruction .
Currently our projects are primarily focusing on the reimplementation of a subset of MLC ++ into MLJ and the implementation of wrappers for performance enhancements in KDD .
In doing these projects , it is our intent to better understand the workings of different induction alogrithms , and to build upon them for furture research .

Four Real - Life Things That Are Creepier Than Halloween
The entire month of October is more or less devoted to doing something that is perceived as frightening , which it usually fails to do .
As a child of the Internet age , there is n’t much I have n’t seen in terms of horrific , mind - numbingly evil fiction or “ realistic fiction ” ( fake is fake is fake ) .
So instead of going down the a -typical list of things you should do as a horror geek , I decided to dig up real things that are way creepier than Halloween and the entire month of October combined .
Actually , this stuff is so twisted , you should probably click the little “ x ” in the corner and call it a day .
You do n’t want to read this .
( I ’m F&# ^ $ serious , look away . )
But if you must , here are four real things that beat Halloween ’s scare factor …
The Body Farm
Hypothetically , a Zombie outbreak is the most mind - numbingly frightening thing that our world could ever experience .
But until that day comes , The Body Farm takes the cake in terms of creepy ass place that actually exists .
In 1981 , Dr. William Bass created the first facility devoted to recreating various situations in which human bodies decompose a.k.a. a compound of death .
Located on a 2.5 acre stretch of land in Knoxville , Tenn. , the compound contains dead bodies stuffed in car trunks , left in wooded areas to rot , placed in and under water , infested by insect populations , buried in shallow soil … Basically if you ’ve seen it on CSI then the chances are pretty good its taken place on The Body Farm .
Of course , all of this is being done in the name of forensic science , but , it does n’t change the fact that it ’s still the creepiest place in the entire world .
Crash Test Zombies ( Buckle up ! )
Do you remember those government - funded public service announcements reminding people to buckle up ?
They used to prosthetic “ dummies ” who would quip back and forth until inevitably having their car crash .
They were so well perceived that they even did a short - lived cartoon series using the Crash - Test - Dummies .
Well , sometimes , you just ca n’t get a natural five star crash test safety rating without using the real deal — dead human bodies .
General Motors is actually the only documented company to have continued to use the dead bodies , most recently by testing Saab model automobiles in the comforts of Sweden .
I wonder what these deceased folks would say if they knew how “ science ” decided to use their lifeless body .
Tennessee Law Protects the “ Resting ”
If you live in Tennessee then you ’ve probably seen a whole lot of small patches of headstones crammed into the middle of strip malls and major areas of commerce .
The reason for this is the state ’s law concerning grave sites .
Basically , if you buy a plot of land that happens to contain an old family relative underneath its soil , you ’ve got to put it into the contract that you ’ll maintain the site and will not remove it without probably cause .
Apparently , it ’s very difficult to find a really good probable cause because there are solitary graves everywhere .
I ’m not even lying , there ’s a dead 10 - year - old , ( which I would liked to believe is actually a dog with a very fancy marble headstone ) , in my backyard .
I did n’t even notice this until about a month after signing the lease .
So pretty much I live in constant fear that the creepy little girl from Night of the Living Dead will pay me a surprise visit .
To be a hundred percent clear , I do n’t know the state laws for grave / burial sites are similar in other states .
What I do know is that they filmed the first Evil Dead movie in this state for a reason .
Toxoplasmosis
Enjoy eating pork ?
Bacon ?
Ham ?
Yeah , well you could be harboring a parasitic cousin of the zombie apocalypse called Toxoplasma gondii and a third of the world is already infected , probably .
But do n’t worry , if you ’re firmly against the consumption of pigs you ’re insane and also just as much at risk .
Toxoplasmosis can also be contracted by eating the meat of lamb , cows and any enclosed area containing cat feces .
So what exactly does this parasite do ?
Not much if your human , but you can never get rid of the stuff either .
Tests done on rats indicate a major shift in the way rats percieve the scent of feline urine .
While the natural reaction for these rodents is to become immediately fearful , once infected with the parasite , the rats actually become attracted to the smell .
This is because the organism can’t actually reproduce inside of us — or even the rats themselves .
It can , however , grow inside the body of a cat .
So it messes with the emotions of the rats so that they actually WANT TO DIE .
Â
Seriously , knowing this how can you possibly think we ’re just a bad flu shot away from the undead walking the earth .
The anguish of being a weekend dad :
One part - time father gives his poignant testimony
Three years ago , in his mid-40s , writer William Leith , who lives in Lewes , East Sussex , rejoiced at becoming a father at last .
But two years later , his relationship with his partner - whom he had known for 20 years - broke down .
Now that he is no longer part of a family home , he finds himself among the ranks of Britain 's part - time parents .
Here , he reflects on the loneliness and anxiety of being a weekend dad .
Every week , I walk up the road to my son's house , either to pick him up or to drop him off .
I walk up the road and down the drive and knock on the door of the house I used to sleep in .
These are anxious moments .
I stand on the doorstep while my brain whizzes around , taking in detail , thinking about what might have been .
But I must edit these thoughts .
I must move on ; I must move on .
I 'm fine , I say to myself as I look at the front door .
Just fine !
And now I can hear something .
My son's mum , my ex in other words , is getting his stuff together .
There is rustling .
And now I can hear his voice !
Billy !
A balloon expands in my chest .
My son !
It 's still weird , this feeling , even after three and a half years .
My son !
I do n't usually go more than three days without seeing him .
But sometimes it feels like a long time not to see your son .
Of course , in the Stone Age , men probably went off on hunting trips and did n't see their sons for days on end .
And lots of people I know did n't see their dads much , even when they lived at home .
Precious : William Leith wth his son , who he sees once a week since his split with his son's mum
But a three - year - old can change appreciably in half a week .
Then again , if I saw him every day , the change would be more incremental , so I might not notice it as much .
I can hear him through the door .
' No ! ' he 's saying .
Is he going through a ' No ! ' phase ?
How sweet , I think .
He says : ' I do n't want my wellies ! '
This might take a while .
I stand there , peering at the frosted glass .
I did n't think I 'd have children .
And then my son was conceived when I was 44 .
I 'd got to a point where I thought I 'd missed out , thought I 'd spend a lifetime of what - ifs and wondering about the mysteries of parenthood .
I 'd wanted children , but it kept on not happening .
The moment I knew I was going to be a father I felt elated in a very strange , time - standing - still way .
I looked at the line on the pregnancy testing kit .
I felt great .
We felt great .
Of course , things did n't work out between me and Billy 's mum .
And so I have these confused memories ; they start off with ' us ' , which is me and her , and then 'us ' , which is all three of us after Billy was born , and now , for me , the 'us ' is just me and him .
Wanting a son
I desperately wanted a son .
I do n't know why .
I really do n't .
I also felt sure that he was a son .
We - there it is again , that ' we ' - decided not to find out the sex of the baby .
But there were complications with the pregnancy , scans and , at one point , a nurse said something like : ' Look - there he is . '
I said : ' But I thought you were n't going to tell me the sex . '
She thought for a second and said : ' Um , I always say " he " , whether it 's a boy or a girl . '
I did n't believe her .
I was right not to .
A boy !
He was born , by Caesarean section , nearly six weeks premature .
He had to lie in an oxygen box because his lungs had n't formed properly .
They said he was pretty likely to survive .
But they also said it was n't absolutely certain .
A nurse told me I should spend some time alone with him .
I was allowed to hold his foot , but nothing more .
I talked to him and tried to stop myself crying .
Three days later , a doctor said he would be fine .
Then I really cried .
And now at his house the door opens , and it 's him .
' Daddy ! '
I pick him up , and then put him down gently .
He is full of things to tell me .
As a three - year - old boy , he 's interested in machines and creepy - crawlies .
' There was a big spider and it made a web , and that was to catch a fly ! '
And : ' Look , Daddy , there are more webs !
With more spiders !
There was a spider in the car !'
I talk to his mum .
My ex .
We talk times , dates .
There is so much more I want to say .
One day , soon , I will find the words .
We talk wellies , Crocs .
My voice is shaky .
But less shaky than it was .
And now we 're off .
I hold his hand and turn the corner and we 're gone ; now it 's just the two of us , and this is one of the best moments of my week .
I 've lost a relationship , and that 's sad , but I 've gained this boy , I 've gained these moments , and it 's terrific .
I say : ' It 's lovely to see you ! '
To which he sometimes says : ' I love you , Daddy . '
And sometimes : ' I want to talk about spiders !'
I say : ' What have you been doing ? '
' Playing . '
' Who with ? ' ' People . '
It occurs to me that one day he might say a name in answer to that question , and it might be the name of a future stepfather .
But I must take this in my stride .
Always vulnerable
' A single father is always vulnerable .
I mean , my God , those Fathers 4 Justice guys who dress up in superhero costumes and climb up the sides of buildings ...
I try to dispose of these thoughts as soon as they enter my head .
Mentally , I cross myself .
I say : ' So , how are you ? '
And sometimes he scowls .
Sometimes he 's grumpy .
But I love that , too , his grumpy face just like my grumpy face from old photographs .
One of the complications of being a part - time parent is that you tend to love everything they do , even when they throw things and have tantrums .
I worry that it might be more difficult to keep these things in perspective .
Maybe I find it harder to tell him off than I would if I lived with him .
Once , a while back , I took him to the open day of a nursery school .
We were standing in a semi-circle listening to the principal , and all these kids were being very well behaved .
' Can we go and see some more dead things ? '
William 's son asked him , after he saw a bee ' come back to life ' ( picture posed by models )
But I could feel my son tugging at my hand .
Then he pulled his hand away and ran into the school .
I ran after him .
I could hear things being thrown and over - turned .
He was shouting .
I remembered that there was a table with children sitting around , stringing things on beads .
And then I heard a noise that meant the box of beads had been tipped over ; when I got there , the floor was awash with beads .
But my son was already somewhere else , way ahead of me , having located some plastic food .
He was shouting : ' I want cake ! '
When I finally picked him up , he whacked me in the face , over and over .
But I wanted to laugh .
I must remember not to laugh when he does stuff like this , even though I want to .
I know that I must not be over - indulgent .
But am I too strict in other ways ?
Am I too careful ?
When I get him to my house , he wants to get on his tricycle or ride on the top of his toy bin lorry - ' bin lorry surfing !
Bin lorry surfing !' - and he wants to go fast , wants to hurtle along , wants to risk crashing and falling off , and I 'm always watching him , always worried about sending him home with a cut or a scrape I could have avoided , also thinking : ' But that 's how they learn , you idiot ! '
And I insist on holding his hand when we 're near a road , always wondering if I 'm being too cautious .
When I press the button at the crossing , I wait for the green man , even if the road is quite empty .
Indulgence
I used not to worry about hygiene so much , even let him eat soil when he was a toddler .
But then I split up with his mum and I became more worried .
He wo n't eat soil on my watch , I thought .
Now I 'm getting calmer .
On our days out together , we wander around town .
We look in shops .
For a long time there was no part of my mind that could ever have imagined it : me , walking along , holding hands with a small boy .
Me , a father !
And then : me , a single father .
There 's a whole world out there I did n't know about - not just the world of parenthood , but also the world of single parenthood - a daytime world of mums and dads with kids , in parks and leisure centres .
And a part - time world of mums and dads who are sometimes on their own , whose lives fall into two separate parts - with their children , and without them .
Of course , there are endless questions .
One thing about being a single parent is that you do n't spend as much time as you might otherwise spend talking to your co-parent about what you should say about this and that .
You do not present a united front , because you are not a united front .
On this particular outing , we see a bee on the path .
My son asks me if the bee is dead .
But then the bee moves .
' It 's come back to life ! '
I say , well , no , the bee has not come back to life - it had never been dead .
He looks at me , turning the thought over in his mind .
We walk on .
My son says : ' Look - what is that ? '
It 's a dead squirrel .
' It 's a dead squirrel . '
My son looks at the dead squirrel .
He says : ' What can we do to make it come back to life ? '
' Um , nothing . ' ' Why ? '
And here it is , possibly the first Big Question , and for a few moments it flashes through my mind , the panorama of death , and I do n't know what to say , and what comes out is : ' Well , that 's just the way it is .
When something is dead , it 's dead .
That 's it .'
My son looks at me .
He ponders this , and nods his head .
' Dad , ' he says .
' Yes ? '
' Can we go and see some more dead things ? '
Later , we go to the fish counter at Tesco to see the dead fish , and I realise I 'd love to tell his mum about it , but I wo n't have time to tell the story , with all its nuances - the way he ran into the shop and shouted : ' Are there any dead fish in here ? ' and then what he said to the fishmonger .
Fear of a rival
Being a single father makes you vulnerable .
You fear a rift , a rival stepfather , the fact that your child might move away .
I sometimes wonder if this somehow hardens you emotionally , if your brain is secretly preparing for the possibility of these things .
You wonder what your child is doing when you 're not there , when you wo n't be there , in his life , for days .
You get good at blocking out bad thoughts .
You get less shaky .
But at what cost ?
Of course , you 'll never know .
There 's a lot you 'll never know , like what it would be like to live with your son in a family situation .
There is guilt .
Sometimes I wonder : do I want more kids ?
Maybe .
Maybe not .
It 's hard to imagine .
There are other things .
I do n't know if the stories I read my son are the same stories his mum reads him , or some of the same ones or completely different ones , and I wonder if we 're talking to him about words and numbers in a slightly different way , because even if you talk about these things , you never quite see the other parent in action .
Over indulgent ?
William struggles not to laugh when his son is naughty , and whacks him around the face ( picture posed by models )
Some of the single mums I know say that there are unspoken rules : for instance , the non-custodial parent should not give or arrange haircuts .
Haircuts are the province of the custodial parent .
One mum told me she'd be mortified if her ex bought their daughter a pair of shoes .
She said that would be going too far .
Sometimes I take my son back to the house on the bus .
He says : ' We 're going to Mummy 's house . '
Occasionally , when he says this , somebody will catch my eye .
Recently he said : ' Mummy does n't go to Daddy 's house , and Daddy does n't go to Mummy 's house . '
' Yes , ' I said conversationally .
' Why ? '
' Well , ' I replied .
' That 's the way - that 's the way it turned out . '
On the way back to the house at the end of the day , I have a pang of sadness .
I know that , for a while , I will carry around a strange , hollow feeling , a bit like homesickness feels like when you 're a kid .
I will walk away , this time on my own .
Then I will not see my son for three more days .
Three whole days .
Recently , I was walking in the hills above the town , in the early evening , and I took an unfamiliar path , and turned a corner , and saw a view that I had n't expected .
About a mile away , in the far distance , I could clearly see my son's house .
He would be in there .
Probably getting ready for bed .
I looked at the house for a while .
And here we are .
Back again !
He runs towards his mum .
My ex. ' Mummy ! ' he says .
I stand there .
I want to tell the story about the dead squirrel and the fish shop .
But I wo n't be able to get in the nuances .
My voice will be shaky .
My timing will be off .
' We saw this bee , ' I begin .

A new age for air travel is dawning ; at least if you ’re one of the lucky few in the market for supersonic luxury travel .
Lockheed Martin's advanced Skunk Works unit is designing a small , 12 - seat passenger jet that would travel at 1,200 mph ( Mach 1.8 ) but which would produce only a whisper of the annoying crack once emitted by the retired Concorde .
Aimed at business executives and diplomats , the QSST will fly at nearly twice the speed of conventional business jets and have a range of 4,600 miles nonstop -- Los Angeles to New York in just over two hours .
The sleek , 130 - foot - long QSST ( for " quiet supersonic transport " ) aircraft is being designed for a Nevada consortium called Supersonic Aerospace International , or SAI , at an estimated cost of $ 2.5 billion .
According to the company , it could be ready for boarding by 2013 .
It seems that this is a technology that is long overdue , and it may seem curious that domestic supersonic travel does n’t already exist .
But it ’s been the pesky sonic boom that accompanies supersonic flight that has prevented development in this area -- until now .
Because of the excessive noise disruption that a sonic boom causes to the population below a plane ’s flight path , supersonic flight is currently banned over land .
This is why the recently retired Concorde was limited only to transatlantic flights .
However , the QSST boasts a patented design that produces a low “ shaped sonic signature ” that is over 100 times quieter than the Concorde .
To develop the technology required to “ quiet ” a sonic boom , it ’s important to understand the forces that create it in the first place .
When an object passes through the air , it creates a series of pressure waves in front of it and behind it , similar to the bow and stern waves created by a boat .
These waves travel at the speed of sound , and as the speed of the object increases , the waves are forced together , or compressed , because they cannot " get out of the way " of each other , eventually merging into a single shock wave at the speed of sound .
This critical speed is known as Mach 1 and is approximately 1,225 kilometers per hour ( 761 mph ) at sea level .
The Formation of a " Sonic Boom "
The following graphics do a fantastic job of illustrating the phenomenon of sound waves , and their creation of the intense pressure waves that produce sonic booms .
All animations and accompanied descriptions are courtesy of Dr. Dan Russell , Kettering University .
Stationary Sound Source
This illustration shows a stationary sound source .
Sound waves are produced at a constant frequency , and the wave fronts propagate symmetrically away from the source at a constant speed , which is the speed of sound in the medium .
The distance between wave fronts is the wavelength .
All observers will hear the same frequency , which will be equal to the actual frequency of the source .
Source moving Slower than the Speed of Sound
This shows the same sound source radiating sound waves at a constant frequency in the same medium , however now the sound source is moving to the right .
The wave fronts are produced with the same frequency as before .
However , since the source is moving , the center of each new wave front is now slightly displaced to the right .
As a result , the wave fronts begin to bunch up on the right side ( in front of ) and spread further apart on the left side ( behind ) of the source .
An observer in front of the source will hear a higher frequency , and an observer behind the source will hear a lower frequency .
Source moving Equal To the Speed of Sound
Now the source is moving at the speed of sound in the medium ( Mach 1 ) .
The wave fronts in front of the source are now all bunched up at the same point .
As a result , an observer in front of the source will detect nothing until the source arrives .
The pressure front will be quite intense ( a shock wave ) , due to all the wave fronts adding together , and will not be perceived as a pitch but as a " thump " of sound as the pressure wall passes by .
Source moving Faster Than the Speed of Sound
The sound source has now broken through the sound speed barrier , and is traveling at faster than the speed of sound .
Since the source is moving faster than the sound waves it creates , it actually leads the advancing wave front .
The sound source will pass by a stationary observer before the observer actually hears the sound it creates .
Notice the clear formation of the Mach cone , the angle of which depends on the ratio of source speed to sound speed .
It is this intense pressure front on the Mach cone that causes the shock wave known as a sonic boom as a supersonic aircraft passes overhead .
The shock wave advances at the speed of sound , and since it is built up from all of the combined wave fronts , the sound heard by an observer will be quite intense .
A supersonic aircraft usually produces two sonic booms , one from the aircraft 's nose and the other from its tail , resulting in a double thump .
Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration
There is no escaping the creation of a sonic boom once the sound barrier is broken , but a great deal of study has been going into lessening its effects .
In 2003 , researchers successfully reduced the sonic booms produced by a U.S. Navy jet by giving it a nose job .
Under the Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration ( SSBD ) program sponsored by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , NASA and Northrop Grumman -- researchers tacked on custom nose - glove to the front of Navy F - 5E jet , as well as added an aluminum substructure .
Since the culprit in the creation of a sonic boom is a change in air pressure , the approach of sonic boom reduction focused on altering how this pressure change is distributed .
The added volume on the modified F - 5E allowed researchers to better distribute the air pressure build - up in front of the supersonic plane , which shaped how the pressure was later released in a sonic boom shockwave as the aircraft broke the sound barrier .
Modifying that pressure release resulted in softer sonic booms .
The modifications eliminated about a third of the pressure typically released by unmodified supersonic aircraft , a noticeable difference when the F - 5E boom was followed 45 seconds later by one from an unmodified aircraft .
The Aerodynamics of the QSST
In addition to using innovative aerodynamic shaping , the QSST employs a patented , inverted " V - tail " - instrumental in the radical reduction of QSST ’s sonic sound level .
These design elements are covered by 22 patent applications that are instrumental in the significant reduction of QSST ’s sonic signature .
Only QSST will fly at twice the speed of current commercial passenger and business jets using a “ shaped sonic signature . ”
The QSST uses fine - tuned aerodynamics to control the pressure generated as the plane displaces air at supersonic speeds .
With air disturbances along the craft evened out , the QSST generates more shockwaves of smaller magnitude rather than two explosive shockwaves .
To soften the boom , QSST aerodynamicists sought to spread out the pressure points along the fuselage .
The new aircraft [ above ] generates only moderate shocks at the nose [ 2 ] and tail [ 3 ] with no spike in the middle .
The stretched nose creates a small but distinct pressure spike at the front , as does the rear engine placement .
These two small spikes counter the tendency of the wave to travel forward and backward .
By the time the sound reaches the ground [ 4 ] , the N - wave has diffused into a barely audible poof .
QSST will have ' supercruise ’ sound levels that are so low that SAI believes QSST will be capable of receiving governmental approval for supersonic flight over land and populated areas without causing objection from the general public .
Another key to quiet flight is its broad distribution of lift - generating surfaces .
The QSST´s canards - the small wings near the front of the fuselage - and swept - V tail provide substantial lift , preventing the sharp , loud - boom - generating pressure change typical of larger , wider wings .
The QSST is so sleek that it can fly 10 percent farther on its fuel supply supersonically than it can at subsonic speeds .
The inverted - V tail also allows the two engines to be mounted far aft -- a design feature that further separates the pressure waves and keeps them from crashing into one another .
Normally , this engine placement would require extra material to support the cantilevered weight , but the inherent strength of the V tail 's truss shape compensates .
All of this technology comes with a nice side of luxury as well .
Up to twelve passengers will be able to travel in large cabin comfort .
Configured with club chairs , couches , a spacious bathroom and a sweet A/V system , the QSST is aimed at diplomats or executives with plenty of money - but little time - to spare .
I know I personally look forward to the day that I can enjoy a latte at high elevation as I race toward the West Coast in time to view the sunset .
After -- of course -- enjoying the earlier showing that same evening on the East Coast .

Claim : Some celebrities promised to leave the USA if George W. Bush won the 2000 presidential election .
Status : True .
Origins : Promises of an entertainment world exodus from the USA in the face of a Republican victory in the November 2000 presidential election began in August 2000 , when USA Today reported the opinions of Pearl Jam ’s Eddie Vedder about the upcoming political contest :
He ’s leaning toward Green Party candidate Ralph Nader , though he ’s reluctant to steal votes from Al Gore .
A strong proponent of abortion rights , Vedder says , “ With three Supreme Court positions opening in the next administration , I ’m frightened to think of a Republican in office , especially one raised by a father who was in the CIA .
I ’m moving to a different country if little Damien II gets elected . ”
Then , in mid-September , actor Alec Baldwin said something ( exactly what he said , to whom , and when , remains elusive ) which his wife , actress Kim Basinger , interpreted as a promise to leave the country should Bush win the presidency :
In September , Alec Baldwin gave his own summing - up of a Bush administration ’s aims in his local paper , the East Hampton Star .
“ How can they get that oil flowing in Alaska ?
Cut taxes for the wealthy ?
Create an entire industry on the false promise of school vouchers ?
Build more prisons ?
Execute more indigent defendants ? ” he asked .
In September , Alec Baldwin gave his own summing - up of a Bush administration ’s aims in his local paper , the .
“ How can they get that oil flowing in Alaska ?
Cut taxes for the wealthy ?
Create an entire industry on the false promise of school vouchers ?
Build more prisons ?
Execute more indigent defendants ? ” he asked .
Many Americans , including his wife Kim Basinger , interpreted this as a promise to leave .
“ Alec is the biggest moralist I know , ” Basinger told the German magazine Focus .
“ I can well imagine that Alec makes good on his threat .
And then I ’d probably have to go too . ”
Mitchell Fink , gossip columnist for the New York Daily News , quickly ran a column in which Baldwin not only denied that he had said any such thing , but also maintained his wife had never spoken to Focus magazine :
Welcome to Monday morning in Alec Baldwin ’s house .
Welcome to Monday morning in Alec Baldwin ’s house .
The actor is n’t moving anywhere , no matter who wins and who loses in November , but that did n’t stop hundreds of hard - core conservatives from flooding Baldwin ’s
Web site with what he called “ hideous and graphic ” writings urging him to get out of the country and take his wife , Kim Basinger , with him .
All this started because of a piece in the German magazine Focus , which quotes Basinger as saying that her husband would flee America if Bush beats Al Gore .
The article also says that Basinger , who co-starred with her husband in “ The Getaway , ” would stick with Baldwin if he decided to make good on his threat to get away .
The only problem is that Baldwin never threatened anything .
“ I never said I ’d leave the country , and my wife never heard of Focus magazine and never talked to them , ” Baldwin told me .
Baldwin suspects that the German mag may be confusing him with director Robert Altman , who said during the recent Deauville Film Festival in France that he would leave America if Bush wins .
For the record , here ’s what Baldwin definitely in Gore ’s corner will do if his man loses : “ I ’ll raise as much money as I can to make sure that this Bush winds up like the last Bush , a one - term President . ”
But , as James Hebert then reported in the San Diego Union - Tribune , Baldwin soon flip - flopped and admitted that his wife had talked to Focus magazine , and equivocated by denying that he ’d said he would definitely leave the country :
Alec Baldwin insists he never said that he would leave the country if George W. Bush were elected president .
The German magazine Focus insists that his wife , Kim Basinger , said in an interview that Baldwin did utter such a promise .
Yada yada yada .

Yada yada yada .
What makes the episode interesting is that it has turned into something of a cat fight between New York gossip columnists .
The New York Post ’s Richard Johnson accuses Mitchell Fink , of the rival Daily News , of being a dupe by backing up Baldwin ’s denial .
Baldwin , Johnson says , “ frantically tried to back off his bombastic promise ( to leave the country ) with a statement planted yesterday in Mitchell Fink ’s gullible column . ”
A bit belatedly , Fink has Baldwin acknowledging that Basinger spoke to Focus .
“ But my wife and I never said unequivocally that we would leave the country if Bush won .
Never , ” he quotes Baldwin as saying .
Also in September , American film director Robert Altman made no bones about his intentions to become an expatriate should Bush be the victor in November :
U.S. director Robert Altman , in France to promote his latest film Dr. T and the Women , said yesterday he would move to France if George W. Bush wins the American presidential election in November .
Altman said he normally did not comment on politics at home , but thought a Republican victory “ would be a catastrophe for the whole world . ”
“ If George Bush is elected president , I ’m leaving for France . ”
Altman said he disagreed with Bush ’s plans to cut taxes and raise military spending .
The Washington Post also put Pierre Salinger , White House press secretary during the Kennedy administration and a former ABC news correspondent , on the “ list of voters who vow[ed ] to get out of Dodge if George W. Bush ” were to be elected :
“ I do n’t want any more Bush presidents , ” the 75 - year - old Salinger writes in the new Georgetowner newspaper .
“ If Bush wins , I ’m going to leave the country and spend the rest of my life in France . ”
Similar promises were also attributed to several other celebrities whom most people would consider to be far over to the liberal end of the political spectrum , but we could find no record of their having made such statements :
Barbra Streisand : Singer Barbra Streisand reportedly said at President Clinton ’s final formal White House dinner in December 2000 , “ I do n’t think you ’ll see me around here for at least four years . ”
Her press agents later added that the “ here ” in her statement referred to the White House , not the USA .
( Some accounts claim that Ms. Streisand actually made this statement back in 1992 , but that seems unlikely , as the 1992 election was a contest between incumbent George H.W. Bush and Arkansas governor Bill Clinton .
Why would Ms. Streisand absent herself from the White House — or the USA — if the elder Bush were elected to a second term , when his first term of office had seemingly prompted no such reaction ? )
Lynn Redgrave : Actress Lynn Redgrave reportedly had some caustic words to say on television ’s Politically Incorrect about Bush ’s promise to appoint “ strict constructionist ” judges to the Supreme Court if elected —
“ That ’s like the people who say ‘ Now we ’re going to live our life as it says in Genesis . . . this is really scary ” — but nothing about leaving the country should Bush win .
Cher : Cher reportedly asked in November 2000 whether Bush supporters had “ lost their bleeping minds , ” but again we could find no quotes in which she averred she would leave the USA if Bush became president .
What happened to those celebrities who had said they ’d flee the country ?
The London Times ‘ Jack Malvern attempted to track them down a few days after Bush ’s inauguration on 20 January 2001 .
Alec Baldwin was sticking to his previous denial :
Alec was busy denying everything .
“ My wife never heard of Focus magazine and never talked to them , ” he told the New York Daily News on August 19 .
Then , on August 20 : “ Kim did indeed speak to a Focus magazine . . . but my wife and I never said unequivocally that we would leave the country if Bush won .
Never . ”
During a March 2001 visit to Florida , Baldwin engaged in a battle of press quotes with President Bush ’s brother , Florida governor Jeb Bush , during which he continued to qualify whatever it was he ’d said back in 2000 :
“ He had promised he would leave the country if my brother got elected , ” [ Jeb ] Bush said during a stop in Orlando .
“ Well he ’s back , I guess .
We ’ll welcome him to Tallahassee . ”
“ He had promised he would leave the country if my brother got elected , ” [ Jeb ] Bush said during a stop in Orlando .
“ Well he ’s back , I guess .
We ’ll welcome him to Tallahassee . ”
But Baldwin disputed that he said he ’d leave the country if George W. Bush were elected .
“ I never made that statement , but you can tell Gov.
Bush to rest assured that I ’m not going to leave the country because we have to get him out of office and we have to get his brother out of office in 2004 .
We ’re not resting until we get that done . ”
Even if he had made the statement , Baldwin said there was still no reason to leave .
“ Bush was n’t elected , he was selected – selected by five judges up in Washington who voted along party lines , ” Baldwin said .
Robert Altman , who had since re-interpreted his previous remarks , was disinclined to offer further comment :
Second up the gangplank was the film director Robert Altman , the man behind such films as Short Cuts and The Player .
“ If George Bush gets elected President , I will move back to France , ” he told reporters at the Cannes film festival .
“ He ’s not a very smart man .
He ’s been put up by his father and a bunch of cronies . ”
Despite the fact that this statement was caught on film , Altman later denied making it .
He meant to say , he said , that he would move to Paris , Texas , “ because the state would be better off if [ Bush ] is out of it ” .

When contacted for this article , Altman was no longer inclined to discuss the matter .
“ Is n’t this all getting a little silly ? ” he asked .
And Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder was disappointed with the election results , but apparently not disappointed enough to make good on his boast :
So far Eddie [ Vedder ] has only got as far as Hawaii , where , his spokesman explains , he is commiserating by “ catching a wave ” .
“ He wo n’t be leaving the US but he is extremely disappointed , ” says Matt Reynolds of Epic Records
Pierre Salinger , at least , reportedly stuck to his guns :
In fact , the only person who has made good on his promise is Pierre Salinger , former press secretary to President Kennedy , who is moving to France .

ATLANTA ( CNN ) --
Major markets in Europe , Asia and Latin America sank Monday as traders looked past America 's bank bailout bill and focused on Europe 's growing financial crisis .
The most influential European markets suffered big losses .
London 's FTSE 100 ended down 7.9 % , the CAC 40 in Paris skidded 9 % , and the XETRA DAX in Frankfurt tumbled 7.1 % .
Russia 's RTS index fared worse , shutting down after it fell more than 20 % .
The index lost 9 % of its value in the first 30 minutes of the trading day .
Iceland halted trading in six bank stocks Monday , as Icelandic banks ' assets dwarf the rest of its economy and its currency has fallen sharply in the past week .
The global financial meltdown also hit Latin America , where the economies are reliant on commodity exports .
Brazilian stocks plunged 15 % to a two - year low before rebounding , and trading was halted twice on Sao Paulo 's Ibovespa index .
By the end of the day the Ibovespa was down 5.4 % to its lowest close since Nov. 28 , 2006 .
Brazil 's currency , the real , slumped nearly 7 % to a near 2 - year low , the biggest one - day percentage loss against the U.S. dollar since 2002 .
Mexico's IPC index dropped 5.4 % , while the peso dropped 11.8 against the U.S. dollar , a sharp decline from 11.1 on Friday and the lowest since the government lopped three zeros off the currency in 1993 .
Argentina 's Merval ended the day down 5.9 % , Chile 's IPSA was down 6 % , and Colombia 's IGBC fell 4.9 % .
Experts say a worldwide economic slowdown could devastate the economies of Latin America , which have until recently reaped the rewards of historically high global demand for commodities .
Falling markets could stem that demand .
Earlier Monday , Asian and Pacific markets ended roundly lower .
Japan 's Nikkei Exchange closed down 465.05 points , or 4.25 % , at 10,473.09 , a 4 - 1/ 2 year low .
South Korea 's Kospi index finished the day off 4.3 % .
The Australian Securities Exchange plunged about 3.4 % to 4,544.70 , and Hong Kong 's Hang Seng lost nearly 5 % of its value , falling to 16,803.76 .
In the U.S. , the Dow Jones industrials plunged by as much as 800 points , falling below 10,000 for the first time since October 2004 .
Meanwhile , the euro slid below the $ 1.35 mark for the first time in over a year .
Bailouts , deposit guarantees sink markets
The slump followed a weekend in which Germany 's private financial sector promised to put up an additional 15 billion euros , in addition to the 35 billion euros already pledged , to help shore up Hypo Real Estate bank , the nation 's Finance Ministry said Sunday .
The rescue package will help ailing Hypo , one of Germany 's largest housing lenders .
Earlier in the day , the German government said it would guarantee all private checking and savings accounts in an effort to abate a growing financial crisis in the country , a government official said .
European countries one after another announced deposit guarantees to relieve financial stress on banks and on their markets .
Iceland and Denmark issued guarantees Monday after Germany , Ireland , France , Greece and Sweden did the same Sunday .
The guarantees began with Germany , which said it would guarantee all private bank savings and CDs in Europe 's largest economy .
" We want to tell people that their savings are safe , " said German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday .
Coordinating a response
Yet investors jeered the guarantees , as they raised questions about their potential impact on government finances .
Some analysts say the actions showed European governments could not agree on a unified approach to their financial crisis .
But European governments tried to find a coordinated response to the crisis sweeping financial markets .
European Union finance ministers were to meet in Luxembourg on Monday and Tuesday to discuss ways to boost the battered banking system .
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is pushing a bailout similar to the one passed by the U.S. Congress last week and signed by President Bush on Friday .
Some analysts have said they expect the Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank and the Bank of England to orchestrate the first joint action on interest rates since the September 2001 terrorist attacks .
-- The Associated Press and CNNMoney.com staff writer David Goldman contributed to this report .
A federal judge took a swipe at an “ obdurate ” Secretary of State Mike Coffman this afternoon by ordering Colorado ’s top election official to stop violating federal law by purging voters .
The Advancement Project , a voter protection organization , filed suitagainst Coffman late last week for canceling as many 30,000 voters within 90 days of the federal election , a breach of the National Voter Registration Act.
Coffman ’s office settled with the Advancement Project late Wednesday evening , agreeing to let purged individuals vote by provisional ballot .
But he has removed an additional 146 voters from the rolls since then .
The Advancement Project hauled Coffman back to court this afternoon after the secretary told the Rocky Mountain News that he was still purging voters .
“ The process is continuing ” he said , adding that the plaintiffs , which included Colorado Common Cause , Mi Familia Vota and the Service Employees International Union , “ did not prevail . . . in stopping us from moving forward with additional cancellation through this election . ”
Not so fast , said U.S. District Court Judge John Kane this afternoon .
He demanded that Coffman “ cease and stop ” purging voters immediately .
“ I do n’t think there is anything deliberate about this , but possibly something obdurate about the secretary ’s comments ” in the Rocky Mountain News , Kane said .
Jessie Allen , senior attorney with the Advancement Project , said she was “ concerned that the defendant may not listen to his counsel ” and continue canceling voters just days before the election .
“ If the defendant is not listening to his counsel , he will be listening to me personally , ” said Kane .
“ I do n’t issue threats idly and I am not issuing a threat now .
But I expect [ the order ] to be obeyed . ”
Kane also told Coffman ’s counsel , Deputy Attorney General Maurice Knaizer , to look into reinstating the 146 voters who have been purged in the last day and a half .
Jenny Flanagan , director of Colorado Common Cause , called today ’s ruling “ necessary and critical to protect our election . ”
She saidthe plaintiffs feared that Coffman might conduct mass purges before the election .
According to the initial complaint , the Colorado Republican Party requested an additional 17,000 duplicate registration records purged just last week .
Even though Coffman told the Rocky Mountain News that he wo n’t do it because the election is too soon , today ’s order has put those concerns to rest completely .
“ You have Coffman grandstanding in the media , saying he is going to do whatever he wants anyway , ” says Flanagan .
“ That is the outrageous part .
We were concerned that Coffman would continue to ignore what the court was ordering and the protection that the voters were afforded . ”
The Wednesday settlement — reached after eight hours of deliberation — allows purged individuals to vote by provisional ballot .
These provisional ballots will be verified and counted before others in the two weeks after the election .
Counties must “ presume ” these voters eligible or provide convincing proof that they are not in order to toss their ballots .
The secretary of state ’s office cancels voters for many different reasons .
Some newly registered voters are kicked off because the county can’t verify their addresses when registration cards bounce back to the clerks .
Others are deleted because they have moved .
And duplicate registrations are canceled as well .
But under federal law , the secretary of state is prohibited from removing voters within 90 days of an election unless that person has requested to be taken off , has died or has been convicted of a felony .
MTV Networks announced on Thursday a deal to use songs by The Beatles in a custom video game similar to its popular " Rock Band " video , marking the groundbreaking band 's first major plunge into digital music .
There is no set release date or sale price for the game , but it is due to be ready for a worldwide release in about a year , said MTV Networks and The Beatles '
Apple , which handles the affairs of the group that broke up in 1970 after revolutionizing rock and roll in the 1960s .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The companies released few details about the game - which will be a custom game and not a " Rock Band " brand game - saying it is still in development .
They would only say that it will be an " interactive music making game . "
" Rock Band " - which is developed by MTV's Harmonix and published by Electronic Arts Inc and competes against Activision Blizzard Inc 's rival " Guitar Hero " video - lets fans play plastic guitars along with music on TV screens .
Jeff Jones , chief executive of Apple Corps Ltd , said while he could not say how many songs would be used in the custom game , it would use music from throughout The Beatles ' career .
" This game will take you on a journey from The Beatles first album ' Please , Please Me ' all the way through the last album ' Abbey Road . '
It will span samples of the whole catalogue all the way through , " Jones said .
The Beatles have sold more than 600 million albums worldwide .
While " Abbey Road " was the last album they recorded together , " Let it Be " - recorded before " Abbey Road " - was the final album released .
MTV Networks , owned by Viacom , said the game was conceived creatively by former Beatles Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr and the wives of late Beatles John Lennon and George Harrison , Yoko Ono Lennon and Olivia Harrison .
" The project is a fun idea which broadens the appeal of The Beatles and their music .
I like people having the opportunity to get to know the music from the inside out , " McCartney said in a statement .
Starr said it was wonderful that The Beatles ' legacy " will find its natural progression into the 21st century through the computerized world we live in .
Let the games commence . "
While The Beatles ' video will be a custom game , other bands including classic rock veterans Aerosmith , The Rolling Stones , AC / DC and others have licensed their music to " Guitar Hero " or " Rock Band . "
Pop music fans consider
The Beatles perhaps the greatest rock band ever .
Surviving members of the group as well as its representatives have jealously guarded the distribution of their music online .
For example , Beatles songs are unavailable on Apple 's iTunes over concerns that the songs could be easily pirated .
When asked about plans for the digital distribution of The Beatles catalogue , Jones said , " We 're still working out the details , we have no announcement to make , we have not date or any information , we 're still working on the details . "
The sewer systems we use today are entirely ineffectual and unnecessary .
The primary flaw in our design is that we use fresh water to dispose of feces .
This is perhaps the most ineffectual thing to do with human manure — it pollutes fresh water , and it requires municipalities to maintain extremely costly sewage treatment infrastructures .
Even after treatment , sewage can still wreck havoc on rivers and groundwater .
The most effective and straightforward thing to do with sewage is to compost it ( or use it to produce fuel ) .
It ’s a valuable resource .
The C. K. Choi Building is a 30,000 - square - foot building that is part of the University of British Columbia .
The building has no connection to the sewage system .
Instead it has composting toilets and waterless urinals installed .
The toilets on each of the three floors connect via stainless steel chutes to five Clivus Multrum composting systems in the building ’s basement .
The toilets emit no odors , because all the waste is collected in the basement and fans ensure that no odor escapes the composting containers .
The system is maintained and emptied by the Clivus Multrum company through a service contract .
Every day the university maintenance staff wipes down the toilets and adds a can of wood chips or bark mulch to each toilet .
Every six months , the compost ( which no longer resembles feces ) is removed from the system and used as a fertilizer .
Because of this system , the C. K. Choi building uses just 500 liters of water per day ( 132 gallons ) , a similarly - sized conventional building uses an average of 7,000 liters of water a day ( 1850 gallons ) or fourteen times as much water .
But about the water from sinks and other systems ?
This graywater is filtered and pumped into a 300 - foot - long outdoor planter bed with lilies .
The final discharge is used to irrigate plants .
A test by the city of Vancouver of the fecal coliform counts of the discharged water showed that it contained less than 10 CFU per 100 milliliters ( by comparison swimming is permitted in water with up to 200 CFU per 100 milliliters ) .
The building also captures rainwater : the rain is in a 7,000 - gallon tank below a staircase .
It is used to irrigate the landscape , which is bordered by thirsty ginkgo trees .
What this example clearly shows is that modern buildings can do quite well without a connection to a municipal sewage system .
The maintaining the building ’s composting system is probably less overall than a building with flushing toilets .
More information on this topic ( including many other case studies ) can be found in the excellent Composting Toilet System Book by David Del Porto and Carol Steinfeld .
This August The Pirate Bay was “ censored ” in Italy following a decree from a public prosecutor .
The Pirate Bay appealed the block and eventually won the court case .
Earlier this week the Court of Bergamo detailed its decision , and ruled that no foreign website can be censored for alleged copyright infringement .
Two months ago , following an order from an Italian prosecutor , ISPs started to prevent their customers from accessing the Pirate Bay .
The administrators of the popular BitTorrent tracker were accused of making copyrighted material available on the Internet for commercial purposes .
Of course , the Pirate Bay team did n’t agree , and responded in true Pirate Bay style .
“ We ’re quite used to fascist countries not allowing freedom of speech .
A lot of smaller nations that have dictators decide to block our site since we can help spread information that could be harmful to the dictators , ” Sunde wrote in a blog entry .
The BitTorrent tracker was not going down without a fight , and later announced that it would appeal the decision in court , which they won .
The block was lifted and ISPs could again grant their users access to the most frequently used BitTorrent tracker on the Internet .
The Court of Bergamo decided that this block was unlawful , and earlier this week they explained why .
According to the court statement ( Italian ) , no criminal court is allowed to issue an order to ISPs to block traffic to a foreign website , based on alleged copyright infringement .
Italian law implements an European Directive , 2000 / 31 CE , which this means that this ruling should be valid in other European countries as well .
“ Under Italian law , this is possible only for child porn and for unauthorized gambling , but there is no such provision for copyright infringement , ” Pirate Bay ’s lawyers Giovanni Battista Gallus and Francesco Micozzi explained to TorrentFreak .
“ We have to make sure that no legislative bill promoting such filtering provisions will be passed in the future .
At the European level , many authorities pointed out the need to find a balance between the enforcement of alleged copyright infringements , users ’ rights , and privacy issues . ”
In hindsight , the block only helped the Pirate Bay to grow even further .
The case generated a lot of free promotion , and the number of visitors from Italy increased by 5 percent .
Not exactly the outcome IFPI had hoped for .
This post presents a function &mdash DrawGlossGradient ( CGContextRef context , NSColor * color , NSRect inRect ) &mdash that will draw a " gloss " gradient in a single statement .
All colors in the gradient are calculated from the single color parameter .
Introduction
The following samples are gloss gradients .
They are all made by the DrawGlossGradient function described below .
This type of gradient is common on buttons or other graphical adornments on webpages .
The " aqua " aesthetic of Mac OS X also uses this type of gradient in numerous places .
The gradient is actually composed of a number of components , all intended to simulate a translucent glass or plastic lens - shaped object that is lit from above .
A diagram of the physical structure being modelled would look like this :
The light gray " lens " shape is the glass or plastic translucent object being modelled .
The top half , as seen by the viewer , is dominated by the arc labelled " B " which is light from the light - source reflected directly to the viewer .
The bottom half , as seen by the viewer , contains the effects of two arcs : C and A . Arc C is a " caustic " highlight , where the light from the light source is focussed to a higher intensity by the lens shape of the translucent material .
Arc
A is darker because the recessed nature of the translucent material casts a shadow over this area .
The final point to note is that the lens shape is not flat at the back , so these light and dark components attenuate in a non-linear fashion .
Creating the effect in code
We need four different color values :
The top of the gloss highlight ( whitest due to incident angle of reflection )
The bottom of the gloss highlight ( white - ish but not as white as top )
The background color - darkest visible part of shadow ( will be provided as input to the function )
The caustic color ( brighter than background and incorporating a subtle hue change )
Once we have these values , we can simply create a gradient out of them .
I 'm going to use a CoreGraphics CGShadingRef .
It would be possible to produce a fairly similar effect using an NSGradient but that class only handles constant - slope gradients and I want to incorporate a subtle exponential in the gradients .
The gloss highlight color
The two gloss highlight colors will just be a blend of white and the background color .
Picking relative intensities of these two colors is not very hard .
I chose a 0.6 fraction of white for my top gloss color and a 0.2 for the bottom of the gloss ( although these fractions will be reduced by the scaling below ) .
When using a range of background colors , I found that dark colors needed a smaller fraction of white than light colors to appear similarly glossy , so I had to scale the effect based on background brightness .
I chose the following function to produce a scaling coefficient for my gloss brightness , based on brightness of the background color :
float perceptualGlossFractionForColor ( float * inputComponents ) { const float REFLECTION_SCALE_NUMBER
= 0.2 ; const float NTSC_RED_FRACTION
= 0.299 ; const float NTSC_GREEN_FRACTION
= 0.587 ; const float NTSC_BLUE_FRACTION
= 0.114 ; float glossScale = NTSC_RED_FRACTION
* inputComponents [ 0 ] + NTSC_GREEN_FRACTION
* inputComponents [ 1 ] + NTSC_BLUE_FRACTION
* inputComponents [ 2 ] ; glossScale = pow ( glossScale , REFLECTION_SCALE_NUMBER
) ; return glossScale ; }
The input components are 3 floats ( RGB ) .
The coefficients with which I multiply them are the NTSC color - to - luminance conversion coefficients .
It 's an acceptable " perceptual brightness " conversion for color and far easier than RGB to LUV .
I then raise this value to a fractional power — value chosen experimentally as it seemed to give about the right final value across the range of brightnesses .
The caustic highlight color
The caustic color is a harder problem .
We need to achieve a hue and brightness shift of the background color towards yellow , while retaining the background 's saturation .
Again , as with gloss , there was a non-linearity to account for : colors further in hue from yellow required proportionally less hue shift to maintain the appearance of the same hue - shift effect .
I chose to scale the hue shift by a cosine such that the hue shift seemed perceptually appropriate .
In addition , grays ( having no real hue ) need special handling .
Reds needed special handling to account for the fact that hue wraps around at red .
Purples did n't really look good hued towards yellow , so I decided to make them hue towards magenta .
void perceptualCausticColorForColor ( float * inputComponents , float * outputComponents ) { const float CAUSTIC_FRACTION = 0.60 ; const float COSINE_ANGLE_SCALE = 1.4 ; const float MIN_RED_THRESHOLD = 0.95 ; const float MAX_BLUE_THRESHOLD = 0.7 ; const float GRAYSCALE_CAUSTIC_SATURATION
= 0.2 ; NSColor * source = [ NSColor colorWithCalibratedRed : inputComponents [ 0 ] green : inputComponents [ 1 ] blue : inputComponents [ 2 ] alpha : inputComponents [ 3 ] ] ; float hue , saturation , brightness , alpha ; [ source getHue : & amp ; hue saturation : & amp ; saturation brightness : & amp ; brightness alpha : & amp ; alpha ] ; float targetHue , targetSaturation , targetBrightness ; [ [ NSColor yellowColor ] getHue : & amp ; targetHue saturation : & amp ; targetSaturation brightness : & amp ; targetBrightness alpha : & amp ; alpha ] ; if ( saturation & lt ; 1e - 3 ) { hue = targetHue ; saturation = GRAYSCALE_CAUSTIC_SATURATION
; } if ( hue & gt ; MIN_RED_THRESHOLD ) { hue -= 1.0 ; } else if ( hue & gt ; MAX_BLUE_THRESHOLD ) { [ [ NSColor magentaColor ] getHue : & amp ; targetHue saturation : & amp ; targetSaturation brightness : & amp ; targetBrightness alpha : & amp ; alpha ] ; } float scaledCaustic = CAUSTIC_FRACTION
* 0.5 * ( 1.0 + cos ( COSINE_ANGLE_SCALE
* M_PI * ( hue - targetHue ) ) ) ; NSColor * targetColor = [ NSColor colorWithCalibratedHue : hue * ( 1.0 - scaledCaustic ) + targetHue * scaledCaustic saturation : saturation brightness : brightness * ( 1.0 - scaledCaustic ) + targetBrightness * scaledCaustic alpha : inputComponents [ 3 ] ] ; [ targetColor getComponents : outputComponents ] ; }
So this function is really just an HSV conversion of the inputComponents and the yellowColor , and the blending of the two .
Composing into a single gradient
Now to assemble the colors into a gradient .
We 'll need to implement an interpolation function that will return the correct color for a given progress point in the gradient .
With the aforementioned " background color " , " caustic color " , " top gloss white fraction " and " bottom gloss white fraction " passed into this function as the " color " , " caustic " , " initialWhite " and " finalWhite " parameters of the GlossParameters struct , the function looks like this :
typedef struct { float color [ 4 ] ; float caustic [ 4 ] ; float expCoefficient ; float expScale ; float expOffset ; float initialWhite ; float finalWhite ; } GlossParameters ; static void glossInterpolation ( void * info , const float * input , float * output ) { GlossParameters * params = ( GlossParameters * ) info ; float progress = * input ; if ( progress & lt ; 0.5 ) { progress = progress * 2.0 ; progress = 1.0 - params -& gt ; expScale * ( expf ( progress * - params -& gt ; expCoefficient ) - params -& gt ; expOffset ) ; float currentWhite = progress * ( params -& gt ; finalWhite - params -& gt ; initialWhite ) + params -& gt ; initialWhite ; output [ 0 ] = params -& gt ; color [ 0 ] * ( 1.0 - currentWhite ) + currentWhite ; output [ 1 ] = params -& gt ; color [ 1 ] * ( 1.0 - currentWhite ) + currentWhite ; output [ 2 ] = params -& gt ; color [ 2 ] * ( 1.0 - currentWhite ) + currentWhite ; output [ 3 ] = params -& gt ; color [ 3 ] * ( 1.0 - currentWhite ) + currentWhite ; } else { progress = ( progress - 0.5 ) * 2.0 ; progress = params -& gt ; expScale * ( expf (( 1.0 - progress ) * - params -& gt ; expCoefficient ) - params -& gt ; expOffset ) ; output [ 0 ] = params -& gt ; color [ 0 ] * ( 1.0 - progress ) + params -& gt ; caustic [ 0 ] * progress ; output [ 1 ] = params -& gt ; color [ 1 ] * ( 1.0 - progress ) + params -& gt ; caustic [ 1 ] * progress ; output [ 2 ] = params -& gt ; color [ 2 ] * ( 1.0 - progress ) + params -& gt ; caustic [ 2 ] * progress ; output [ 3 ] = params -& gt ; color [ 3 ] * ( 1.0 - progress ) + params -& gt ; caustic [ 3 ] * progress ; } }
As you can see , the function is split into two halves : the first half handles the gloss and the second half handles the caustic .
An exponential is used to create an attenuating effect on the gradient .
Draw the gradient
The draw function is pretty straightforward .
Most of it is configuring the GlossParameters struct with the coefficient and offsets of the exponential , invoking the functions to generate the required colors and performing the mechanics of drawing a gradient using CGShadingCreateAxial and CGContextDrawShading .
void DrawGlossGradient ( CGContextRef context , NSColor * color , NSRect inRect ) { const float EXP_COEFFICIENT = 1.2 ; const float REFLECTION_MAX = 0.60 ; const float REFLECTION_MIN = 0.20 ; GlossParameters params ; params .
expCoefficient = EXP_COEFFICIENT
; params .
expOffset = expf ( - params . expCoefficient ) ; params .
expScale = 1.0 / ( 1.0 - params . expOffset ) ; NSColor * source = [ color colorUsingColorSpaceName : NSCalibratedRGBColorSpace ] ; [ source getComponents : params .
color ] ; if ( [ source numberOfComponents ] == 3 ) { params .
color [ 3 ] = 1.0 ; } perceptualCausticColorForColor ( params .
color , params .
caustic ) ; float glossScale = perceptualGlossFractionForColor ( params . color ) ; params .
initialWhite = glossScale * REFLECTION_MAX
; params .
finalWhite = glossScale * REFLECTION_MIN
; static const float input_value_range [ 2 ] = { 0 , 1 } ; static const float output_value_ranges [ 8 ] = { 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 } ; CGFunctionCallbacks callbacks = { 0 , glossInterpolation , NULL } ; CGFunctionRef gradientFunction = CGFunctionCreate ( ( void * ) & amp ; params , 1 , // number of input values to the callback input_value_range , 4 , // number of components ( r , g , b , a ) output_value_ranges , & amp ; callbacks ) ; CGPoint startPoint = CGPointMake ( NSMinX ( inRect ) , NSMaxY ( inRect ) ) ; CGPoint endPoint = CGPointMake ( NSMinX ( inRect ) , NSMinY ( inRect ) ) ; CGColorSpaceRef colorspace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB
( ) ; CGShadingRef shading = CGShadingCreateAxial ( colorspace , startPoint , endPoint , gradientFunction , FALSE , FALSE ) ; CGContextSaveGState ( context ) ; CGContextClipToRect ( context , NSRectToCGRect ( inRect ) ) ; CGContextDrawShading ( context , shading ) ; CGContextRestoreGState ( context ) ; CGShadingRelease ( shading ) ; CGColorSpaceRelease ( colorspace ) ; CGFunctionRelease ( gradientFunction ) ; }
Conclusion
There are lots of parameters in these functions that can be tweaked to personal preference .
You can enhance the hue change , the gradient slopes and the gloss intensity very simply .
I 'm fairly happy with the gloss and its brightness .
I think that 's worked well .
The hue shift for the caustic works well but the brightness of the caustic seems a little inconsistent .
This could be tweaked a little .
Purples on the boundary with blue or red can look a little strange .
Maybe there 's a way to smooth this , I do n't know .
I have n't really thought about it .
This approach does n't work well with bright colors provided as the input color , since the input color is used as the darkest color in the gradient .
This is not a problem as much as it is a consideration when choosing the input color .

Because of endless news and entertainment on television , Internet and radio , people only have an hour of freedom each day .
The media researchers M - Lab discovered that 1 in 3 adults do not dispose of even one hour of rest while 1 in 5 have not more than 30 minutes of media - free time .
About 32 percent of people who participated in the study said that they were disturbed at night by the sound of television or radio .
Almost 71 percent of the correspondents said that before going to sleep at night they always listed to television or radio or checked the Internet for news .
This month Ofcom has released a report which said that each week adults in Great Britain consume more than 50 hours of media .
" I do n't think it 's that surprising .
I am more surprised there are people who have this golden hour where they do nothing .
People multi-task .
I think people usually have two bits of media going at the same time .
Back in the day , the phone was usually in the hall but because phones are mobile now people can move around , people can watch TV and use the phone .
I think it 's the way media has become portable , " said Graham Williams , the director of M - Lab .
He mentioned that 5 or 6 years ago people would simply go into a room and take a phone call and today you have to ask people to turn off their phone .
Earlier people would not try to take a phone call at a conference but today they do it .
" I think its the way people work and I think people accept it .
A newspaper would have previously got one golden moment when the reader would sit by themselves and read it .
Nowadays I watch people on the train they have a walkman on and read a paper at the same time , " he said .
Williams also said that noise represents a vital sense of safety and companionship for some people .
Most often people find free time from 12 - 00 pm to 12 - 30 pm and from 5 pm to 5 - 30 pm .
This means that people get away from the noise generated by media when they go to eat some food .

Obama 's America vs. McCain's America : Ten Reasons Undecideds Should Choose Obama
Partially hyperlinked to sources .
For all sources , see the data resources page .
Sources you 'll hear include : the New York Times , the Washington Post , the websites of Barack Obama and John McCain , aflcio.org , Reuters , the Wall Street Journal , commondreams.org , thinkprogress.org , Yahoo News , and CNN .
Usually on Blast The Right you hear me condemn right - wing ideology and policies .
Not only the theory , but the negative effect of right - wing rule on flesh - and - blood humans .
Then the idea is , you use the information to win the water cooler wars , to " blast the right . "
With just about a month to go before the election , arguing with right - wingers is n't the most productive use of your time now , I do n't think .
This presidential election could well be razor - tight .
The polls consistently indicate that 4 - 8 % of the electorate says they 're undecided .
And what really struck me , up to a total of 18 % say they could still change their mind .
In other words , they 're persuadable .
The undecideds and persuadables are n't guided by ideology or party loyalty .
Or else they already would have firmly settled on a candidate .
So in this podcast I 'm going to set out Ten Reasons undecideds and persuadables should choose Obama , hopefully in a way undecideds and persuadables will find convincing .
A bit softer than my usual style .
Remember , in addition to the audio of this show , there 's a transcript available on the Blast The Right home page , in case you want to send all or part of it to an undecided voter you know .
OK , I 'm going to start off with the broadest issues , and then work my way down to more specific areas of voter concern .
Reason number one has to do with the overarching question , what 's the proper role of government ?
Ronald Reagan famously declared :
audio : Reagan
I 've always felt the nine most terrifying words in the English language are , ' I 'm from the government , and I 'm here to help . '
Government is the enemy .
Grover Norquist is a long - time Republican strategy guru , a Reaganite .
He said the right - wing goal is to shrink government down to the size where you can drown it in the bathtub .
One way to do that is , in his terminology , to " starve the beast . "
Drastically cutting taxes , and running up huge deficits , are two ways the right - wing works to starve the government .
To deny government the revenue it needs to function , except for functions like the Defense Department .
Government as a leveler of the playing field ?
As a positive force for good ?
As a provider of a safety net for our fellow citizens who have fallen ?
Forget about it .
Present day head cheerleader for the Reagan Revolution , Rush Limbaugh , has no shame in boasting :
audio : Limbaugh
Roosevelt is dead .
His policies may live on , but we 're in the process of doing something about that as well .
Roosevelt 's entire New Deal and its later offspring -- Social Security , Medicare , student loans , the Environmental Protection Agency -- all that kind of government activity -- the Reagan Revolution wants to destroy .
What 's this got to do with McCain ?
McCain is no moderate , as many people mistakenly think .
John McCain often proudly says that he began his political career as " a foot soldier in the Reagan revolution . "
And there he remains , as you 'll see .
If you 're undecided , or not sure you 're who you 're going to vote for , please ask yourself : do you want to continue the process of destroying the New Deal ?
Destroying social security and all the other important programs that help the average citizen like yourself ?
If so , McCain would be your choice , because that 's the direction he'd take the country .
If not , if you believe in a positive government role to assist the average citizen , level the playing field , vote for Obama .
Now let 's get into some details .
As you 'll see , much of what follows flows from this anti-government , government is not capable of being , should n't be a force for good , philosophy .
It permeates McCain 's positions .
Reason number two to support Obama is the all - important Supreme Court .
Among other things , it decides which laws are constitutional , which are n't .
The Supreme Court , to quote one legal scholar , currently " sits on a knife 's edge . "
There 's a 4 - 4 liberal - conservative split , with Justice Anthony Kennedy a swing vote .
The next president will replace two , possibly three Supreme Court justices .
John McCain states right on his website that he would appoint more justices like Samuel Alito and John Roberts .
Ultra -conservatives .
Reagan Revolution types .
A President McCain could produce a 6 - 3 , or even 7 - 2 , solidly right - wing court .
Why is that dangerous ?
A McCain right - wing Supreme Court would use its power to further the anti-government agenda of the Reagan Revolution .
It 'll do so by interpreting the Constitution in a way that severely curtails the power of the federal government .
Mr. McCain ’s justices are likely to join the conservative crusade against the power of Congress .
They could be expected to strike down , or sharply limit , federal power to protect clean air and water ; ensure food and drug safety ; safeguard workers ; and prohibit discrimination against women and minorities .
They would also likely further erode the separation between church and state .
[ source ]
And of course there 's a woman 's right to choose .
That 's a whole separate reason , up next .
Hillary Clinton in her speech to the Democratic Convention , said the Supreme Court was already in a right - wing headlock .
A President McCain would make things even worse .
A President Obama , on the other hand , would appoint justices who would allow the federal government to play a positive role in our national life .
Reason number three , as I just said , is the very fate of a woman 's right to choose , reproductive choice .
Literally written on his website , John McCain states that Roe v. Wade should be overturned .
Surprised ?
Some people think McCain is pro-choice .
He does n't go around trumpeting his anti-choice position .
But that 's where he firmly stands .
And McCain will appoint justices who will " lead the charge to eliminate the right to abortion . "
To safeguard a woman 's right to choose , it 's President Obama you want to see elected .
Up next : how Obama and McCain compare on economic issues .
Stick around .
BREAK
The fourth reason to support Obama is taxes .
Nearly two - thirds of Americans think the rich pay too little in taxes .
McCain should definitely not be their candidate .
McCain wants to make the system even more unfair .
He would continue Bush 's tax cuts , which disproportionately favor the wealthy .
McCain would actually be even worse than Bush , and reduce taxes on the rich even further .
Obama stands in direct contrast .
He 's for a more fair tax system .
We 're all in this together , one country , and the rich should pay their fair share .
Obama 's tax plan would increase taxes on the richest 3 - 5 % of Americans who make more than $ 200,000 filing singly , $ 250,000 married .
The vast majority of working Americans would enjoy a tax reduction in the form of a credit against their payroll taxes .
Also , very important : Obama , unlike McCain , would retain the estate tax .
Right - wingers call the estate tax the death tax .
That 's a deliberately misleading name .
Everyone dies , but less than 1 % of Americans wind up paying an estate tax .
That 's because it only applies if you leave millions behind .
That 's why it 's called an estate tax .
Choosing Obama means tax fairness , McCain fairness only for the wealthy .
Continuing on with the theme of economic fairness , you have the federal minimum wage law , reason number five .
The minimum wage law has proven to be one of the most effective means to enable the working poor to lift themselves out of poverty and into the working class .
The effect of the minimum wage also ripples upwards a few steps of the economic ladder , increasing wages there as well .
Most Americans recognize the bedrock morality of establishing a floor on how low wages can go .
Strong majorities consistently support raising the minimum wage when it falls behind inflation .
But McCain and the Republicans have been no friends to the minimum wage .
To say the least .
Right - wing ideology would prefer to have no minimum wage laws at all .
Such laws are , in the conservative view , an unwarranted intrusion on the market place .
Republicans vehemently opposed the first minimum wage law passed during the New Deal .
Like all of Roosevelt 's policies that Limbaugh wants to kill , the minimum wage is constantly under attack by Republicans in Congress .
For 10 years , while in control of Congress , Republicans refused to raise the minimum wage .
According to the AFL - CIO , in 2007 McCain voted for a measure that would have repealed minimum wage laws in at least 45 states .
Other times McCain has only agreed to support an increase in the minimum wage when provisions were included to weaken enforcement of the law .
On the other hand , raising the minimum wage was one of the first goals that Democrats accomplished in their first 100 days in control of the Congress in 2007 .
Obama continues in that tradition of supporting this crucial piece of New Deal legislation .
Obama 's plan would increase the minimum wage to $ 9.50 an hour by 2011 .
Critically , he would index it to inflation , so that in the future increases would be automatic , and could n't easily be blocked by hostile Republicans .
Like John McCain .
Reason number 6 is related :
If minimum wage laws lift workers out of poverty and into the working class , then unions are one of the main vehicles that allow Americans to leap out of the working class and enjoy a middle class level of comfort .
Unions fight for , and have achieved , higher wages , increased benefits and improved working conditions for Americans across the nation .
Unfortunately , these days you may intuitively feel that the rich are getting richer , and everyone else is getting poorer .
You 're correct .
Income inequality is at its greatest level since the Great Depression .
Since 1980 the richest 1 % of Americans of have increased their share of the national income nearly threefold , from 8 % to 22 % .
One reason for this growing inequality is the successful 27 year campaign against labor unions by the Reagan Revolution , which John McCain brags he 's a foot soldier in .
George W. Bush appointed anti-labor ideologues to head the Labor Department and staff the National Labor Relations Board .
There 's now a $ 4 billion union - busting industry .
John McCain is no moderate here either , but a good Reagan Revolution foot soldier .
Labor 's main goal in recent years has been to pass the Employee Free Choice Act .
It would prevent employers from intimidating workers when they 're deciding whether to form a union or not .
John McCain voted against the Employee Free Choice Act .
In fact , you should know that McCain has a 17 per cent lifetime AFL - CIO rating .
If you want fairness in the labor market , and a strong middle class , you 'll want to support Obama .
He 's a sponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act .
Obama has a 98 % favorable voting record with the AFL - CIO .
That 's why harshly anti-union Wal - Mart warned all its managers recently against a Democratic victory .
McCain 17 % . Obama 98 % .
Who 's on the side of the working man and woman ?
On the side of fairness in our society ?
OK , reason number seven to support Obama is health care .
Tens of millions of Americans lack health insurance .
Tens of millions more have insurance but it 's inadequate .
The government estimates that lack of health insurance kills 18,000 Americans every year because of late diagnosis or inadequate treatment .
You may be one of the vast majority of Americans who believes the government should guarantee health care for all citizens .
Barack Obama agrees , but John McCain does n't .
McCain 's health care plan might actually make things worse .
It 's actually somewhat similar to George Bush 's roundly rejected health care scheme .
McCain would force workers to pay taxes on the estimated value of the health care coverage provided by their employers .
That 's expected to lead many employers to drop health care benefits .
A recent study estimates 20 million Americans would lose employer coverage under McCain 's plan .
McCain would then offer individuals a tax credit of $ 2500 , families $ 5000 , to secure insurance in the private market .
How absurd !
Insurance costs far more than that , over twice as much .
Even worse : if you 're already sick , insurers can deny coverage .
McCain proposes a high - risk pool to cover those denied , but does n't provide adequate funding for it .
McCain 's plan is a disaster .
The study says it will “ almost certainly … increase family costs for medical care . ”
Bob Herbert wrote in the New York Times :
This entire McCain health insurance transformation is right out of the right - wing Republicans ’ ideological playbook : fewer regulations ; let the market decide ; and send unsophisticated consumers into the crucible alone .
[ source ]
On the other hand , Obama 's plan just builds on the current system .
It essentially sets up a Medicare - type plan , publicly run , that anyone , employer or individual , can buy into .
But if you 're happy with your current insurance , you can keep that .
Subsidies would be available to make sure low and moderate income families can afford insurance .
The plan details how the subsidies would be funded .
Remember , when it came time last year to vote on providing millions of children health care , Obama voted yes , but McCain voted no .
That 's a good indication of what the effect would be of their respective overall health care plans .
Stay tuned to hear the remaining Top Ten reasons , and a summary comparison of Obama 's America vs. McCain 's America .
BREAK
Your eighth reason to prefer Obama over McCain , involves another New Deal legacy that right - wingers and McCain are hostile to .
I 'm talking about the federal regulatory agencies .
Do you recall in the past year or so , the stories about antifreeze in toothpaste , poison in the drug heparin , lead paint covered toys ?
Such problems result when the starve the beast strategy is used .
The federal agencies designed to protect Americans , like the Food and Drug Administration , and the Consumer Products Safety Commission , are systematically under - funded and shrunk down by right - wingers in Congress .
Remember , these agencies have to be drowned in the bathtub , as part of the Reagan Revolution that McCain 's a proud member of .
Oh , and all this anti-regulatory fervor includes the financial system .
Lack of adequate regulations or enforcement of existing regulations , is a major cause of the present - day financial crisis .
McCain has
consistently characterized himself as fundamentally a deregulator and he has no history prior to the presidential campaign of advocating steps to tighten standards on investment firms .
audio : McCain
McCain :
Our financial market approach should include encouraging increased capital and financial institutions by removing regulatory , accounting , and tax impediments to raising capital .
McCain : I am less government , less regulation , lower taxes .
McCain :
We need less government .
We need less regulation .
Even after the present day crisis developed , McCain has no regrets , as he told the program 60 Minutes :
audio : McCain
Questioner :
In 1999 , you were one of the senators who helped pass deregulation of Wall Street .
Do you regret that now ?
McCain :
Well , I think the deregulation was probably helpful to the growth of our economy .
Obama , on the other hand , understands that proper regulation of the financial markets is critical for the health of those markets and the economy as a whole .
audio : Obama
[ W ]e 're also going to have to look at , how is it that we shredded so many regulations ?
We did not set up a 21st - century regulatory framework to deal with these problems .
And that in part has to do with an economic philosophy that says that regulation is always bad .
The next to last reason to support Obama , builds on all the prior reasons .
As you 've seen , the best policies in the areas I spoke about , are Democratic policies .
Regardless of who 's elected , the Democrats will control Congress .
And can pass good legislation to help the average American .
But if McCain is president , he can veto those bills .
It then will take a two - thirds majority in each house to override McCain 's veto .
And that 's very difficult to achieve .
So having a President Obama will ensure that good legislation actually gets signed into law .
The final reason I 'll suggest that Obama is a far better choice than McCain , involves the ultimate issue : war and peace .
After the Iraq disaster , one would expect prudence and caution from a leader .
But listen to McCain in January at a town hall meeting :
audio : McCain more wars
This is a tough war we 're in .
It 's not going to be over right away .
There 's going to be other wars .
I 'm sorry to tell you , there 's going to be other wars .
McCain did n't say we may have another war , singular .
Or even that we may have more wars , plural .
No , he 's certain that there will be other wars , plural .
I wonder which countries he already has in mind ?
Does McCain even take war seriously ?
Apparently not :
audio : McCain
That old Beach Boys song , " Bomb Iran " ?
Bomb , bomb , bomb …
The psychology of McCain here is scary : can you in your wildest nightmares imagine Obama having such a cavalier attitude ?
You should know that McCain 's top foreign policy advisor , Randy Scheunemann , was a director of the right - wing advocacy group that was calling for an invasion of Iraq , long before 9/11 .
If you 're concerned about McCain 's cavalier attitude towards war , his almost war - mongering persona , you 're not alone .
A recent poll found that 63 % of the American public was worried that when problems arise with other countries , McCain will be too quick to take military action .
War and peace -- Obama 's the best bet here as well .
Ok , you 've heard a lot in my whirlwind tour .
Let me quickly paint you a summary picture , McCain 's America vs. Obama 's America .
In McCain 's America , from the President on down , it 's assumed government should be diminished in size and influence at all costs .
The Supreme Court will be all too happy to go along with that view , striking down laws enacted by Congress to help the average American .
Abortion will be made illegal .
Taxes on the wealthy will continue to be reduced , leaving the rest of us to increasingly shoulder the burden .
The minimum wage will stagnate , sending more and more workers into poverty .
Anti-union efforts will proceed apace , further weakening the American middle class .
Tens of millions of Americans will remain without adequate health care , and that problem will get worse .
Federal regulatory agencies will fail to protect our food , drugs , consumer products , air and water .
Not to mention our financial system .
And , in President McCain 's own words , there will be other wars .
Now please envision this reality :
In Obama 's America , from the President on down , there will be an understanding that the government has a positive role to play , that duly elected representatives can and should enact measures to help and protect the public .
The Supreme Court will decide cases with such an understanding of the Constitution as well .
A woman 's right to choose will be protected .
The tax system will be fixed so that the wealthy pay their fair share , lessening the burden on everyone else .
The minimum wage will be raised and millions escape poverty .
Unions will be supported by the government , not attacked , and the middle class will grow .
A national health care plan will ensure that every American has adequate medical care .
Federal regulatory agencies will do a better job in protecting our food , drugs , consumer products , air and water .
The financial system will be adequately monitored , our economy safeguarded .
And President Obama will protect our nation by relegating war to an absolute last resort .

Over in California , champagne corks are popping .
In the offices of the MPAA and RIAA , lawyers turned lobbyists are dancing jigs .
In houses all around the US however , people are left dumbfounded by the passage of a bill based on appeasement to big money , at a time when the country is in economic turmoil .
The Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008 , or PRO IP Act , finally gathered the signature of President George W. Bush , and made it into law .
The act , as we previously reported , has been criticized by both the US Departments of Justice ( DOJ ) and Commerce ( DOC ) , but gathered support in the wake of economic troubles that have hit the US .
Title I of the bill , which allowed the DOJ to pursue civil copyright cases , was dropped by the senate when they passed the bill , with Richard Esguerra , spokesman for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , noting that he was relieved that attorneys wo n’t become “ pro bono personal lawyers for the content industry . ”
However , the objections of the DOC – that the creation of a ‘ Copyright Czar ’ would be an unconstitutional violation of Separation of Powers – went unopposed .
Included in the bill is the issue of ‘ civil forfeiture ’ , where articles can be seized and held if it is thought they are to be used in committing a crime , or infringement .
The unanimous passage of this bill is worrying , mainly because it shows a triumph for lobbying over facts , and how common sense can be easily overruled with enough money and influence .
Claims that support the bill include spurious job creations from this bill , to money saved in the economy .
“ Counterfeiting and piracy costs the United States nearly $ 250 billion annually , ” says the US Chamber of Commerce in a Reuters article , while others have more effectively broken down the figures and pointed out how they do n’t make sense .
Yet , in a country on the brink of economic meltdown , a bill that is claimed to help the economy by creating jobs ( and boost the economy by reducing those jobs and revenue claimed to be lost ) seems like a good political move , regardless of how absurd and baseless the figures are .
Dan Glickman of the MPAA certainly wants to play the economic card , saying : “ At this critical time for our economy , it ’s important to send a message that the jobs created and maintained by the protection of intellectual property is a national priority . ”
The person filling this Copyright Czar role will , presumably , be in a similar position to that of the Drugs Czar , and will listen mainly to lobbyists and ‘ safe ’ peer pressure .
Just as in the case of narcotics , and symptoms will be dealt with , and not causes .
Targeting causes means targeting contributors , while targeting symptoms just means targeting voters , and there are millions of them .
It also remains to be seen who will be given the role of Copyright Czar , but do n’t be surprised if it ’s a member of the MPAA / RIAA , although some might start pushing for Prof.
Lessig , as happened when California ’s 12th District lost its congressman .
However , Prof. Lessig told TorrentFreak that he ’s “ not going to be an enforcement czar , and nor would I be wanted for that . ”
Perhaps the worst aspect of the bill , though , is the extension of forfeiture .
Already used extensively in drugs cases , it is often inappropriately applied .
If drugs are found in someone ’s home , and along with that comes a claim from a 3rd party ( even if they were caught breaking into the home ) that they were dealing , the home owner can have their house taken away , along with anything of value in it .
Although some may feel that forfeiture is an appropriate response to serious large scale drug dealing , those same draconian measures can now apply to copyright infringement cases .
