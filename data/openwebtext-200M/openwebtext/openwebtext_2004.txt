( CNN ) --
Most people have an inkling that if you drilled down to the Earth 's core , it would feel pretty hot down there -- around 5,500 degrees Celsius ( 9,932 degrees Fahrenheit ) to be precise , in fact , according to Greenpeace .
( Nearer the Earth 's surface , however it is a more bearable 10 - 16 degrees Celsius ( 50 - 60 degrees F ) all year round . )
All that heat produces an extremely high amount of virtually limitless energy .
Geothermal energy is the art of exploiting that very resource .
Geothermal energy is the art of exploiting the vast amounts of hot water and steam that is to be found deep within the rocks and fractures beneath the Earth 's crust .
The hot water that is found nearer the Earth 's surface can be directly pumped into our homes in the form of heating and hot water .
And conversely , in Summer time that same system can cool buildings too .
According to the U.S. Department of Energy ( DoE ) , when used on an industrial scale , geothermal fields emit one - sixth of the carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions that come from a " clean " natural gas power plant .
The advantage geothermal energy has over other energy sources , is it is available for use 24 hours a day , all year - round , at a rate of 90 % ( compared to 75 % for coal ) , the DoE says .
According to Environmental Defense , existing geothermal plants in the U.S. produce enough electricity to power 3.5 million homes .
The known geothermal reserves , however -- if utilized with currently available technology -- could power the whole nation for the next 30 years .
Geothermal energy is considered a renewable energy resource as the volume of heat or water taken out can be reinjected back into geothermal areas .
The largest complex of geothermal power plants to be found anywhere in the world are known as the Geysers , and can be found in North California .
While geothermal energy is not in widespread use , the knowledge and technology has been around for more than a century .
According to Sierra Age Power , the world 's very first geothermal plant began operating back in 1904 in Italy .
It is still running today .
Countries around the world that currently use geothermal energy include Iceland , the U.S. , Japan , Italy , Indonesia , New Zealand , Mexico , the Philippines , Kenya , Costa Rica and Nicaragua .

Growing up in the 90s , I looked forward to coming home and being able to see Home Alone every Thanksgiving weekend since it began airing on television .
I enjoyed watching it yet again when it aired on and around Christmas .
Being named Kevin , it was virtually impossible for me to not think I was Kevin McAllister and that if I wanted to I could take on burglars if they ever broke into my home .
For too many Christmases , those burglars in a different form as Dick Cheney ( Harry ) and Dubya Bush ( Marv ) have threatened our homes whether we liked it or not .
They have wanted to steal our freedom and all the money we have which allows us to live that freedom .
They took it because they think it belongs to them and they will use anything even Jesus to win it from us if that ’s what it takes .
And this year , again , they ’ll take it right out from under our noses .
It ’s not hard to imagine at all watching Home Alone with Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern replaced by Cheney and Bush .
Dick “ Harry ” Cheney drives around in a van snarling with that grimaced look on his face muttering curse words and saying , “ Bah humbug ! ”
He drives around with Dubya “ Marv ” Bush and Dubya tells him all these ideas for things that can be done to knock off people --- how they are going to make their mark .
He comes up with a nickname for the kind of bandits they are the same way he has come up with nicknames like Turd Blossom for Karl Rove .
Sticky bandits ?
Nope .
Wet bandits ?
Nope .
How about the Jesus bandits ?
Yes , that ’s it and then Dick Cheney will hit him with a crow bar for being dumb , retarded , and unoriginal .
Like Joe Pesci , his gold tooth will glisten as he repeatedly tells the prodigal son to go f*ck himself .
In the same way that Bush talks to us about two or three jobs being uniquely American or asks is our children learning , when he runs into us while looking for the best targets to knock off , Dubya “ Marv ” Bush will poke his head out and say something like , “ Santy do n't visit the funeral homes , little buddy . ”
I imagine myself in this movie .
I imagine myself putting up booby traps for Bush and Cheney to get caught in .
I imagine myself declaring , “ This is my house .
I have to defend it . ”
I imagine coming up with sly remarks like , “ ' I ’m over here you big horse 's ass , come and get me before I call the police . ”
Burned .
Torched .
Wounded .
Knocked Out .
And Demoralized …I imagine relishing every moment that I keep these burglars from ruining Christmas for me and my family .

Abstract
Instant messaging ( IM ) is an increasingly popular mode of communication on the Internet .
Although it is used for personal and private conversations , it is not at all a private medium .
Not only are all of the messages unencrypted and unauthenticated , but they are all routedthrough a central server , forming a convenient interception point for an attacker .
Users would benefit from being able to have truly private conversations over IM , combining the features of encryption , authentication , deniability , and forward secrecy , while working within their existing IM infrastructure .
In this talk , I will discuss " Off - the - Record Messaging " ( OTR ) , a widely used software tool for secure and private instant messaging .
I will outline the properties of Useful Security and Privacy Technologies that motivated OTR 's design , compare it to other IM security mechanisms , and talk about its ongoing development directions .

Nonstandard adjectives in mathematics
Ranjit Bhatnagar once propounded the notion of a " nonstandard " adjective .
This is best explained by an example .
" Red " is not usually a nonstandard adjective , because a red boat is still a boat , a red hat is still a hat , and a red flag is still a flag .
But " fake " is typically nonstandard , because a fake diamond is not a diamond , a fake Gucci handbag is not a Gucci handbag .
The property is not really attached to the adjective itself .
Red emeralds are not emeralds , so " red " is nonstandard when applied to emeralds .
Fake expressions of sympathy are still expressions of sympathy , however insincere .
" Toy " often goes both ways : a toy fire engine is not a fire engine , but a toy ball is a ball and a toy dog is a dog .
Adjectives in mathematics are rarely nonstandard .
An Abelian group is a group , a second - countable topology is a topology , an odd integer is an integer , a partial derivative is a derivative , a well - founded order is an order , an open set is a set , and a limit ordinal is an ordinal .
When mathematicians want to express that a certain kind of entity is similar to some other kind of entity , but is not actually some other entity , they tend to use compound words .
For example , a pseudometric is not ( in general ) a metric .
The phrase " pseudo metric " would be misleading , because a " pseudo metric " sounds like some new kind of metric .
But there is no such term .
But there is one glaring exception .
A partial function is not ( in general ) a function .
The containment is in the other direction : all functions are partial functions , but not all partial functions are functions .
The terminology makes more sense if one imagines that " function " is shorthand for " total function " , but that is not usually what people say .
If I were more quixotic , I would propose that partial functions be called " partialfunctions " instead .
Or perhaps " pseudofunctions " .
Or one could go the other way and call them " normal relations " , where " normal " can be replaced by whatever adjective you prefer — ejective relations , anyone ?
I was about to write " any of these would be preferable to the current confusion " , but actually I think it probably does n't matter very much .
[ Addendum 20080201 : Another example , and more discussion of " partial " . ] [ Addendum 20081205 : A contravariant functor is not a functor . ] [ Addendum 20090121 : A hom - set is not a set . ] [ Addendum 20110905 : A skew field is not a field .
The Wikipedia article about division rings observes that this use of " skew " is counter to the usual behavior of adjectives in mathematics . ] [ Addendum 20120819 : A snub cube is not a cube .
Several people have informed me that a quantum group is not a group . ] [ Addendum 20140708 : nLab refers to the red herring principle , that “ in mathematics , a ‘ red herring ’ need not , in general , be either red or a herring ” .
] [ Addendum 20160505 : The gaussian integers contain the integers , not vice versa , so a gaussian integer is not in general an integer . ] [ Addendum 20190503 : Timon Salar Gutleb points out that affine spaces were at one time called “ affine vector spaces ” so that every vector space was an affine vector space , but not vice versa . ]

If you 're worried about nuclear terrorism , it makes sense , at face value , to support nonproliferation programs , particularly those that target the former Soviet Union .
The problem , however , is that money can't always buy you security .
Nothing illustrates this dilemma better than anew report by the Government Accountability Office .
The GAO says that no only does the Department of Energy overstate success in one of its key nonproliferation programs , but perhaps even more troubling , U.S. funding , intended to ensure that Soviet - era weapons scientists do n't end up working for rogue states , is actually being used to recruit young scientists to work at weapons facilities :
[ I ] nstead of supporting Soviet - era WMD scientists as a way of minimizing proliferation risks , officials at 10 nuclear and biological institutes in Russia and Ukraine told us that IPP program funds help them attract , recruit , and retain younger scientists and contribute to the continued operation of their facilities .
This is contrary to the original intent of the program , which was to reduce the proliferation risk posed by Soviet - era weapons scientists .
For example , about 972 of the scientists paid for work on these 97 projects were born in 1970 or later , making them too young to have contributed to Soviet - era WMD efforts .
Second , although DOE asserts that through April 2007 , the IPP program had helped create 2,790 long - term , private sector jobs in Russia and other countries , we were unable to substantiate the existence of many of these jobs in our review of 48 of the 50 projects DOE considers to be commercial successes .
There 's another issue here , of course .
Russia , right now , is flush with money from oil and natural gas exports , raising the issue of why , over 15 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union , Moscow can't find the money to support and secure its own WMD infrastructure .
[ Note : In our forthcoming book , A Nuclear Family Vacation , Nathan Hodge and I travel to Russia to see firsthand if U.S. funding is really helping to protect us from the threat of rogue weapons scientists . ]

The extent of San Diego 's Witch fire , the most destructive of the recent spate of wildfires in Southern California , is graphically depicted in this November 6 false - color image from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer on NASA 's Terra spacecraft .
Vegetation is shown in green , burned areas in dark red and urban areas in blue .
The fires that ravaged Southern California in late October 2007 have left an indelible mark on the community and the landscape .
This image , obtained by NASA ’s Terra satellite on November 6 , shows the burn scar left by the Poomacha Fire .
According to the National Interagency Fire Center , this blaze has burned nearly 50,000 acres and is one of the last fires that has not yet been fully contained .
The scorched areas appear as a bright pink or red color , while the bare , dry land is a lighter pink and vegetation is bright green .

On October 31 , NASA ’s Aqua satellite captured this remarkable image of Southern California , showing the burn scars left behind after wildfires devastated the area .
This image , made using visible and infrared light , shows the extent of the fires over the landscape .
The charred areas appear red , unburned vegetation is bright green and bare earth is a tan color .
Over the past two weeks the fires have burned more than 500,000 acres , according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection .
Two fires were still burning in Southern California as of November 5 , the Santiago and the Poomacha fires .
Despite weaker than predicted winds , firefighters were not able to fully contain the blazes over the weekend as they had initially predicted .
The National Weather Service is forecasting little to no wind to affect the area over the upcoming week .
Fire officials say they expect full containment of the fires by the end of this coming weekend .
Related Link : NASA satellites captured new images of the scorched Southern California landscape on October 26 , 2007 .
These pictures were obtained by NASA ’s Terra ( left image ) and Aqua ( right image ) satellites at 2:55 p.m. EDT and at 4:35 p.m. EDT respectively .
They show several fires still burning in Southern California .
Smoke from these blazes blanket the region .
According to news reports , favorable weather conditions have allowed firefighters to gain ground against several of the massive fires that caused extensive damage and destruction to Southern California throughout the past week .
The National Interagency Fire Center reports that the cooler temperatures and increased humidity forecasted for the area today should help firefighters to contain the remaining blazes .
As of October 29 , the number of fires not yet contained was down to nine , which allowed hundreds of thousands of residents to return to their homes after massive evacuations .
While the fires are coming under control , the smoke they have produced remains a concern .
The Air Pollution Control District of San Diego County reports that smoke from these blazes , visible in the above images , has lead to unhealthy air quality levels .
These visualizations display data acquired by the Advanced Land Imager ( ALI ) onboard NASA 's EO - 1 satellite .
Shortwave infrared surface radiation indicates actively burning areas , which appear bright orange - red to yellow in these images .
The left image was captured October 23 , and the right was captured October 25 .
A thick haze of smoke has settled over the southern California region where massive wildfires have been burning since October 21st .
NASA satellites captured new images of the fire - ravaged area as they passed overhead on Oct. 25 , 2007 .
The first image was acquired by NASA 's Terra satellite at 2:15 p.m. EDT .
NASA ’s Aqua satellite obtained another image of the affected area just over three hours later at 5:30 p.m. EDT .
According to news reports , the Santa Ana winds that fueled these massive wildfires have all but died out , and relatively calm weather patterns are taking hold in the area .
These favorable weather conditions have allowed firefighters to begin to contain some of the larger fires .
The National Interagency Fire Center reported that as of yesterday the largest and most devastating blaze , the Witch fire in San Diego County , was 20 percent contained .
The National Weather Service is forecasting winds to continue to weaken though tomorrow , with gusts not to exceed 25 mph .
Earlier this week winds reached nearly 70 mph .
Rising humidity and falling temperatures are also aiding firefighters .
NASA 's Ikhana unmanned research aircraft flew over several of the Southern California wildfires Wednesday and Thursday , Oct. 24 - 25 , with its sophisticated thermal - infrared imaging equipment peering through smoke and haze to record high - quality imagery of the hot spots .
A third flight is planned for today .
The imagery is processed on board , downlinked and overlaid on Google Earth maps at NASA Ames Research Center in Northern California , and then made by the National Interagency Fire Center to incident commanders in the field to aid them in allocating their fire - fighting resources .
The mission was controlled by pilots remotely from a ground control station at NASA 's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base .
Thermal - infrared imaging sensors on NASA 's Ikhana unmanned research aircraft recorded this image of the Grass Valley / Slide Fire near Lake Arrowhead / Running Springs in the San Bernardino Mountains of Southern California just before noon Oct. 25 .

But in the right data visualization , using three of the shortwave infrared channels , EO - 1's Hyperion cut through the billowing smoke to give a better view of the burning fires located below .
These images were collected on October 23 , 2007 and show the area around the Witch Wildfire located just south of Escondido , California .
NASA will continue to provide satellite imagery to a variety of wildfire agencies around the country working with the National Interagency Fire Center .
Additionally , NASA 's Ikhana unmanned aircraft system is flew over several of the major Southern California wildfires Thursday , capturing thermal - infrared imagery to aid firefighters battling those blazes .
Ikhana , a General Atomics ' Predator B modified for civil science and research missions , took off about 9:15 a.m. PDT from its base at NASA 's Dryden Flight Research Center on Edwards Air Force Base on what is expected to be a nine - hour mission .
Passing over Southern California at 3:10 p.m. on October 24 , 2007 , NASA 's Terra satellite captured this image of the massive wildfires that have devastated the area .
These startling images show the Southern California region covered in a thick blanket of smoke .
Red pixels indicate fire activity .
Smoke can also be seen billowing out over the Pacific Ocean .
While news agencies report that the strong Santa Ana winds that fueled these fires are expected to nearly disappear soon , there are still 15 large fires burning in the region .
These blazes have charred 695 square miles and destroyed 1,609 homes , with damage estimated by the state Department of Insurance at more than $ 1 billion .
The largest fire currently burning in the area is the Witch fire in San Diego County , one mile east of Ramona .
According to the National Interagency Fire Center , the blaze has burned 196,420 acres , destroying hundreds of homes , businesses , and other structures .
The National Weather Service is predicting cooler temperatures and higher humidity for this area as the week progresses .

NASA satellites continue to capture remarkable new images of the wildfires raging in Southern California .
At least 14 massive fires are reported to have scorched about 425 square miles from north of Los Angeles to southeast of San Diego .
These latest images , captured by NASA satellites on the afternoon of October 22 , show the thick , billowing smoke coming off the numerous large fires and spreading over the Pacific Ocean .
Fire activity is outlined in red .
Dry , drought - stricken vegetation and Santa Ana winds , which can reach hurricane speeds , have contributed to the devastating effect of these blazes .
The National Interagency Fire Center reports that the Santa Ana winds are expected to continue through Wednesday .
According to news reports , almost 700 homes have been destroyed and hundreds of thousands of residents have been forced to evacuate .
Today , President Bush issued an emergency declaration for seven California counties , ordering federal disaster relief to the area .
Powerful Santa Ana winds have fueled more than 10 large wildfires throughout Southern California , stretching from Santa Barbara to San Diego .
This pair of images , depicting the area around Los Angeles on October 21 , 2007 , shows just how quickly the fires grew .
The left image , captured by NASA ’s Terra satellite at 11:35 a.m. local time , shows several fires giving off small plumes of smoke .
Just over 3 hours later , at 2:50 p.m. when NASA ’s Aqua satellite passed overhead , large amounts of smoke were pouring from blazes northwest of Los Angeles .
Actively burning fires are outlined in red .
In the right image plumes of smoke can be seen blowing off the coast , indicating the intensity of the winds and the presence of additional fires farther south .
According to the National Interagency Fire Center , these blazes have burned over 84,000 acres since they began over the weekend .
Thousands of residents have been evacuated from their homes and a state of emergency has been issued for 7 California counties .
Hot , dry Santa Ana winds began blowing through the Los Angeles and San Diego areas on Sunday October 21 , 2007 .
Wind speeds ranging from 30 to 50 mph were measured in the area , with extremely low relative humidities .
These winds , coupled with exceptionally dry conditions due to lack of rainfall resulted in a number of fires in the Los Angeles and San Diego areas , causing the evacuation of more than 250,000 people .
These two images show the Southern California coast from Los Angeles to San Diego from two of the nine cameras on the Multi- angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer ( MISR ) instrument on the NASA EOS Terra satellite .
These images were obtained around 11:35 a.m. PDT on Sunday morning , October 21 , 2007 and show a number of plumes extending out over the Pacific ocean .
In addition , locations identified as potential hot spots from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) instrument on the same satellite are outlined in red .
The left image is from MISR 's nadir looking camera and the plumes appear very faint .
The image on the right is from MISR 's 60° forward looking camera , which accentuates the amount of light scattered by aerosols in the atmosphere , including smoke and dust .
Both these images are false color and contain information from MISR 's red , green , blue and near - infrared wavelengths , which makes vegetated land appear greener than it would naturally .
Notice in the right hand image that the color of the plumes associated with the MODIS hot spots is bluish , while plumes not associated with hot spots appear more yellow .
This is because the latter plumes are composed of dust kicked up by the strong Santa Ana winds .
In some locations along Interstate 5 on this date , visibility was severely reduced due to blowing dust .
MISR 's multiangle and multispectral capability give it the ability to distinguish smoke from dust in this situation .
The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer observes the daylit Earth continuously and every 9 days views the entire globe between 82 degrees north and 82 degrees south latitude .
These images were generated from a portion of the imagery acquired during Terra orbit 41713 , and use data from blocks 63 to 66 within World Reference System - 2 path 40 .

Description :
FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates generally to the field of microprocessors and computer systems .
More particularly , the present invention relates to a method and apparatus for a byte swap operation for a 64 bit operand .
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Computer systems have become increasingly pervasive in our society .
The processing capabilities of computers have increased the efficiency and productivity of workers in a wide spectrum of professions .
As the costs of purchasing and owning a computer continues to drop , more and more consumers have been able to take advantage of newer and faster machines .
Furthermore , many people enjoy the use of notebook computers because of the freedom .
Mobile computers allow users to easily transport their data and work with them as they leave the office or travel .
This scenario is quite familiar with marketing staff , corporate executives , and even students .
Given that most of these computers are connected to local area networks ( LANs ) or the Internet at one point or another , data is transferred and exchanged among these machines .
However , not all computers are created equal .
For instance , each type of computer can have a different internal architecture or run on a different operating system .
Thus , not all of these computer platforms may be compatible .
One such issue can arise from the format in which an architecture handles data .
Similarly , these computers may not all be designed to process data the same way .
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
The present invention is illustrated by way of example and not limitations in the figures of the accompanying drawings , in which like references indicate similar elements , and in which :

FIG .
5A is a flow chart illustrating one embodiment of a method to byte swap a 64 bit operand ; and
FIG .
5B is a flow chart illustrating another embodiment of a method to byte swap an operand .
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
A method and apparatus for a byte swap operation for a 64 bit operand is disclosed .
The embodiments described herein are described in the context of a microprocessor , but are not so limited .
Although the following embodiments are described with reference to a processor , other embodiments are applicable to other types of integrated circuits and logic devices .
The same techniques and teachings of the present invention can easily be applied to other types of circuits or semiconductor devices that can benefit from higher pipeline throughput and improved performance .
The teachings of the present invention are applicable to any processor or machine that performs data manipulation .
However , the present invention is not limited to processors or machines that perform 64 bit or 32 bit data operations and can be applied to any processor and machine in which data swapping is needed .
In the following description , for purposes of explanation , numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention .
One of ordinary skill in the art , however , will appreciate that these specific details are not necessary in order to practice the present invention .
In other instances , well known electrical structures and circuits have not been set forth in particular detail in order to not necessarily obscure the present invention .
Data transfers like FTP between computers having different architectures can involve a bit of manipulation .
One characteristic of computer architectures concern which bytes are most significant in multi- byte data types .
In big-endian architectures , the leftmost bytes ( those with a lower address ) are most significant .
In little - endian architectures , the rightmost bytes are most significant .
Many mainframe computers , such as IBM mainframes , use a big-endian architectures .
Most modern computers , including PCs , use the little - endian system .
The Power PC system is bi-endian because it can understand both systems .
Converting data between the two systems is sometimes referred to as the NUXI problem .
The bit ordering within each byte can also be big-endian or little - endian .
Some architectures even use big-endian ordering for bits and little - endian ordering for bytes , or vice versa .
Thus the sending of data from a little - endian computer to a big-endian computer can require the flipping around of all the data so that the data is correctly interpreted .
Embodiments of the present invention provide a way to reorganize the order of data elements through a byte swap operation .
A byte swap macro instruction can be used to reverse the order of all the bytes in a register .
One reorganization that can be achieved is the movement of eight bytes of data from their original positions and flipping the order of the bytes around .
Thus a byte swap operation can be used to converting ABCDEFGH to HGFEDCBA , wherein each letter represents a byte of data .
One embodiment of the present invention first performs a 64 bit “ partial byte swap ” on the source data .
This reverses both halves of the data in a register so that ‘01 23 45 67-89 AB CD EF ’ become ‘ 67 45 23 01 - EF
CD AB 89 ’ , wherein each character comprises of four bits and each pair of numbers / letters represent a single byte of data .
Then a 64 bit rotate left by 32 bits is performed on the swapped data .
This has the effect of exchanging the upper and lower halves of the register contents so that ‘ 67 45 23 01- EF CD AB 89 ’ above becomes ‘ EF CD AB 89-67 45 23 01 ’.
Generally , the movement of data in logic and circuitry in a processor entails numerous wires going back and forth .
In the movement of a large number of bits such as with a 64 bit operand , the data may have to be fed through the logic hardware more than once .
For example , such a situation would exist where a 32 bit processor attempts to manipulate a 64 bit wide piece of data .
Although this example describes a 32 bit processor , certain portions of such a processor may be able to handle more than 32 bits of data .
The phase “ 32 bit processor ” generally refers to a processor that cannot process an entire 64 bit wide operand in its execution units at a time .
The 64 bit data would have to be routed through the 32 bit processor twice in order to perform an operation on the entire 64 bit piece .
In the case of a byte swap as described above , the 32 bit processor would have to operate on four bytes at a time and then merge the pieces together during later passes .
Furthermore , a 32 bit processor would not have the 64 bit wide hardware such as registers to handle the entire 64 bit piece .
The 64 bit data needs to be shifted around and aligned in other passes so that the 32 bit processor can operate correctly .
Temporary registers are needed to store the various pieces of the 64 bit data while the processor is working on it .
The additional circuitry and routing to handle these extra passes through the execution unit of a processor can become costly in terms of execution time , power consumption , and die area .
Additional microcode is also necessary to perform the operations on the 64 bit data in such a processor .
Each time something is sent through the execution unit , one micro operation ( uop ) is performed with the microcode .
But not all uops are the same .
Some uops are slower and require more time to complete .
Thus slow uops can impact the throughput of the processor pipeline and overall processor performance .
By making the number of passes through the executions units fewer , less uops are needed to achieve the same result .
In addition to optimizing the number of uops , how fast the operation is processed can be improved by using faster uops .
Improvements that reduce or speed up an algorithm like that for a byte swapping operation can reduce power consumption .

FIG .
2 is a block diagram of a processor 200 that includes an embodiment of a byte swap mechanism 241 in accordance the present invention .
The front end 202 of the processing phase is coupled to schedulers 230 via allocator / renamer 210 and a rescheduler replay queue 220 .
Instructions can be dispatched speculatively from the schedulers 230 .
Thus the schedulers 230 can dispatch an instruction without first determining whether data needed by the instruction is valid or available .
Schedulers 230 are to dispatch instructions from the front end 202 when the input data needed to execute the instructions is projected to be ready when the instruction would reach execution .
Processor 200 further includes a replay mechanism implemented via a checker 260 , staging queues 250 , and replay multiplexor 235 .
In addition replays can be done from the replay queue 220 when the checker 260 elects to do so .
The replay system can replay instructions that were not executed correctly after they were scheduled by the schedulers 230 .
The execution units 240 can perform data speculation in executing an instruction .
Execution units 240 can be an arithmetic logic unit ( ALU ) , a floating point ALU , a memory unit , etc .
The execution units 240 can also be collectively referred to as an execution cluster .
Logic to perform byte swap operations for 64 bit operands is also located in the execution units 240 .
One execution unit 240 of this embodiment includes logic 241 to perform byte swap operations on 64 bit operands in accordance with the present invention .
A register file in the execution units 240 can store operands and other data for use during instruction execution and processing .
Although the example of FIG .
2 shows one execution unit 240 and one staging queue 250 in order to simplify the description , multiple execution units 240 and staging queues 250 can be coupled to multiple schedulers 230 .
Execution units 240 may be coupled to multiple levels of memory devices from which data may be retrieved and to which data may be stored .
In one embodiment , execution units 240 are coupled to L0 cache 244 , L1 cache 246 , and external memory devices 284 , 286 , 288 , via memory request controller 242 .
If data requested is not found in L0 cache 244 or L1 cache 246 , execution units 240 may attempt to retrieve the needed data from additional levels of memory .
Such requests may be made through memory request controller 242 .
An external bus interface 248 is coupled to memory request controller 242 and external bus 282 .
In one embodiment , external memory devices may includes L2 cache 284 , main memory 286 , disk memory 288 , and other storage devices which may be coupled to external bus 282 .
Access to external memory devices is much slower than access to the on - die cache memory .
When attempting to load data to a register from memory , execution unit 240 attempts to load the data from each of the memory devices from fastest to slowest .
In one embodiment , the fastest level of memory devices , L0 cache 244 , is checked first , followed by L1 cache 246 , L2 cache 284 , main memory 286 , and disk memory 288 .
The time to load memory increases as each additional memory level is accessed .
When the needed data is eventually found , the data retrieved by execution units 240 can be stored in the fastest available memory device for future access .
The term “ registers ” is used herein to refer to the on - board processor storage locations that are used as part of macro-instructions to identify operands .
In other words , the registers referred to herein are those that are visible from the outside of the processor ( from a programmer 's perspective ) .
However , the registers described herein can be implemented by circuitry within a processor using any number of different techniques , such as dedicated physical registers , dynamically allocated physical registers using register renaming , combinations of dedicated and dynamically allocated physical registers , etc .
In this embodiment , staging queue 250 can delay instructions for a fixed number of clock cycles so that the report on problems in executing the instruction in the execution units 240 and the instruction may enter the checker 260 at the same moment in time .
In various embodiments , the number of stages in staging queue 250 varies based on the amount of staging or delay desired in each execution channel .
A copy of a dispatched instruction may be staged through staging queue 250 in parallel to being executed through execution units 240 .
In this manner , a copy of the instruction maintained in staging queues 250 is provided to checker 260 .
This copy of the instruction can be routed back to replay multiplexor 235 by checker 260 for re-execution if the instruction did not execute successfully .
In this architecture , a checker unit 260 is positioned after the execution core 240 .
The checker 260 can analyze the data dependency of the instruction and whether any error exists .
Furthermore , the checker 260 also checks the condition of the result of the execution to determine whether replay is necessary .
If an instruction has executed successfully , the checker 260 marks the instruction as completed and declares the instruction “ replay safe ” .
“ Replay safe ” instructions are forwarded to retire unit 270 .
For another embodiment , multiple checkers ( a fast or early checker and a slow or late checker ) can be used , and permit the detection of incorrect instruction execution at different points in the pipeline .
Similarly , another embodiment can have multiple replay paths .
Other conditions can also generate replays .
The performance of the processor 200 can improve if instructions are replayed more quickly .
The checker 260 is coupled to the retirement unit 270 .
The schedulers 230 and execution units 240 assume that everything is okay .
The checker 260 and retirement unit 270 check for problems .
After the execution , the micro-ops and results are temporarily stored to await commitment to architectural state .
If there are no execution problems , the instructions are retired and the results committed to the architectural state .
FIG .
3 is a block diagram of a byte swap operation on a 64 bit operand in accordance with the present invention .
The initial 64 bit operand 310 in this example comprises of eight data segments : A , B , C , D , E , F , G , and H .
The data segments here are of equal length and each comprise of 8 bits or a byte of data .
For one embodiment , the operand 310 can reside either in a register or a memory location or a register file .
The initial 64 bit operand 310 is sent to an execution unit 320 in the processor along with a byte swap instruction .
By the time the byte swap instruction reaches the execution unit 320 , the instruction should have been decoded earlier in the processor pipeline .
Thus , the byte swap instruction can be in the form of a micro operation ( uop ) or some other decoded format .
Internally to the execution unit 320 , the 64 bit operand 310 is separated into two pieces of 32 bits wide each .
Each 32 bit portion is bussed to a 32 bit execution logic block .
The logic blocks 322 , 326 , can operate as two relatively independent 32 bit halves .
In this embodiment , the upper 32 bit portion comprises of data segments A , B , C , and D , which are sent to the upper 32 bits logic block 322 .
Similarly , the lower 32 bit portion comprises of data segments E , F , G , and H , which are sent to the lower 32 bits logic block 326 .
As shown in FIG .
3 , the two logic blocks 322 , 326 , are capable of communicating and exchanging data with each other via internal routing connections 324 .
The 32 bit execution logic block of this embodiment are arithmetic logic units ( ALUs ) , but are not limited as such .
Other types of logic circuits can also be implemented .
Within each 32 bit logic block 322 , 326 , the respective 32 bit portion of the 64 bit operand 310 is manipulated .
For this embodiment , the logic blocks 322 , 326 , first shift the data segments in its respective 32 bit portion .
For example , the upper portion of A , B , C , and D are shifted to become D , C , B , and A . Likewise , the lower portion of E , F , G , and H , are shifted to become H , G , F , and E .
Then the shifted data segments are swapped between the logic blocks 322 , 326 , and outputted from the execution unit 320 as a 64 bit piece of data .
The exact order of the shifting and swapping can vary in other embodiments and implementations .
The performing of a 64 bit byte swap operation has virtually no impact on the speed of the hardware versus a 32 bit byte swap operation because the upper and lower halves of the operation are independent .
The two independent 32 bit byte swaps happen in parallel and take the same time as doing a single 32 bit byte swap .
The two logic blocks 322 , 326 , of this embodiment are also designed such that an instruction can cause the execution unit 320 to conduct a 32 bit operation on a single 32 bit portion .
For instance , a lower byte swap instruction can activate the lower 32 bit execution logic 326 to only modify the lower 32 bits of an operand , wherein the upper portion of the 64 bit operand is unaffected .
Similarly , a upper byte swap instruction can cause the upper 32 bit execution logic 322 to perform an operation on the upper 32 bits of an operand .
The present example describes the two byte swaps as happening in parallel , but in an another implementation , the byte swaps can occur in serially in time but with two separate execution logic blocks 322 , 326 .
Although the logic blocks 322 , 326 , of this embodiment are shown as blocks containing logic circuitry and can be identical in structure , other embodiments of the present invention are not limited as such .
The logic blocks 322 , 326 , can each contain different logic to manipulate and process data in various ways .
For instance , the lower 32 bits logic block 326 can be capable of performing operations not available in the upper 32 bits logic block 322 , and vice versa .
Similarly , one logic block can be optimized to handle fast uops while the other is optimized to handle slow uops .
Furthermore , alternative embodiments of the execution unit 320 in accordance to the present invention can include a 64 bit logic block or ALU wherein the entire 64 bit operand 310 is processed internally and the 32 bit separation is not visible .
The eight data segments of the original 64 bit operand 310 were ordered as A , B , C , D , E , F , G , and H .
On the other hand , the resultant 64 bit operand 330 comprises of the original eight data segments in reverse order : H , G , F , E , D , C , B , and A .
Although the operands of these examples comprise of 64 bit long operands , other embodiments of the present invention can be implemented with operands of alternative lengths such as 32 , 128 , and 256 .
Similarly , these operands are not restricted to having eight data segments .
The data segments are described of 8 bit bytes .
Alternative embodiments of byte swapping instructions can have various data segment types and sizes depending on the particular architecture and instruction set .
For example , the 64 bit operand may be composed of four 16 bit data segments or words instead .
The term byte can be defined as having any number of bits depending on the particular processor architecture .
Thus the execution unit of another embodiment may operate on word boundaries instead of byte boundaries .
In other embodiment , a 128 bit operand may have data segments of 32 bits or double word length swapped .
FIGS .
4A , 4B , 4C , and 4D illustrate the operation of a byte swap instruction in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention .
In FIG .
4A , a operand 400 comprised of eight data segments ( A 401 , B 402 , C 403 , D 404 , E 405 , F 406 , G 407 , H 408 ) is presented for byte swapping .
As described above , the data segments of this example are also comprised of 8 bit wide bytes , making the operand 400 64 bits wide .
Other embodiments can have different sized bytes and operands .
The operand 400 is accompanied with a byte swap instruction and sent through a processor execution pipeline for processing .
FIG .
4B illustrates a first portion of the byte swapping operation on the operand 400 .
The execution unit of this embodiment treats the operand 400 as two individual 32 bit wide segments 410 , 420 .
Each 32 bit wide segments 410 , 420 , comprises of four bytes .
A byte rotation or swap 412 is performed on bytes A , B , C , and D in the first 32 bit segment to obtain a byte ordering of D , C , B , and A .
A similar byte rotation or swap 422 is conducted on bytes E , F , G , and H in the second 32 bit segment to obtain a byte ordering of H , G , F , and E .
For one embodiment , a single byte swap microinstruction can cause both the upper and lower byte swaps to occur even though the two 32 bit halves appear to be separate .
FIG .
4C illustrates a second portion of the byte swapping operation on the operand 400 .
The operand 400 has been transformed to include a first portion 430 comprising D , C , B , and A , and a second portion 440 comprising H , G , F , and E .
A shifting or swap 432 is performed on the first 430 and second 440 portions such that the second portion 440 is moved ahead of the first portion 430 .
The resultant operand is a data segment 450 comprising bytes in an order of H , G , F , E , D , C , B , and A as illustrated in FIG .
4D .
FIG .
5A is a flow chart illustrating one embodiment of a method to byte swap a 64 bit operand .
For this example , a 64 bit wide operand is located in a register located in a processor .
The 64 bit wide operand of this embodiment is comprised of 8 individual bytes , each byte having 8 bits .
During this byte swap operation , the 64 bit operand is treated as two data segments , wherein each half of the operand comprises of four bytes .
At block 502 , the order of the four bytes in each half of the register is reversed .
Thus bytes ordered as WXYZ are rotated to become ordered as ZYXW .
The reversing of each half of the operand in this embodiment happen in parallel or simultaneously .
The upper and lower halves of the register contents are swapped at block 504 such that the upper four bytes in the register are moved to the position of the lower four bytes while the four bytes in the lower portion of the register are moved to the upper four byte position .
The resultant of this byte swap operation is a 64 bit operand of reversed order from that of the initial operand .
FIG .
5B is a flow chart illustrating another embodiment of a method to byte swap an operand .
The byte swapping operation of this example is performed on a 64 bit wide data packet .
However , the data packet is operated on as two 32 bit chunks .
At block 522 , the order of the bytes in the lower portion of the data packet is rotated such that the first byte of the lower portion is swapped with the fourth byte of the lower portion and the second byte of the lower portion is swapped with the third byte .
At block 524 , the order of the bytes in the upper portion of the data packet is rotated such that the first byte of the upper portion is swapped with the fourth byte of the upper portion and the second byte of the upper portion is swapped with the third byte .
Although the rotation of the bytes in the upper portion and the lower portion are discussed separately as blocks 522 and 524 in this example , the reorder operations are actually occurring in parallel .
In other words , the reorder of the upper portion can be taking place at one logic block approximately at the same time as the reorder of the lower portion at a second logic block .
For example , the reorder operations of one embodiment can be described as occurring in parallel in the sense that the operations can happen during approximately the same clock cycles or proximate in time .
Furthermore , in an alternative embodiment , the reorder operations may , but are not required , to occur simultaneously or contemporaneously .
Similarly , another embodiment can implement the swapping operations in series wherein one of the 32 bit portions are swapped before the second portion .
The 32 bit wide upper and lower portions of the data packet are swapped at block 526 , wherein the upper four bytes are exchanged positions with the lower four bytes .
The resultant of this byte swap operation is a 64 bit operand of reversed order from that of the initial operand .
In the example embodiments as discussed for FIGS .
3 , 4A–D , and 5A–B , the 64 bit byte swap operations are describes as first performing 32 bit byte swaps in upper / lower portions and then performing a 32 bit swap of the upper / lower 32 bit portions .
However , other embodiments of the present invention are not limited as such .
For example , one embodiment of a 64 bit byte swap operation can be constructed to first perform a 32 bit swap of the upper and lower 32 bit portions of a 64 bit operand before performing byte swaps of the bytes in each of the 32 bit portions .
Embodiments of methods in accordance to the present invention are not restricted to being performed in any particular order and can vary depending on the implementation .
Although the above examples describe the byte swap operations in the context of a execution units and logic circuits , other embodiments of the present invention can be accomplished by way of software .
Such software can be stored within a memory in the system .
Similarly , the code can be distributed via a network or by way of other computer readable media .
For instance , a computer program may be distributed through a computer readable medium such as a floppy disk or a CD ROM , or even a transmission over the Internet .
Thus , a machine - readable medium can include any mechanism for storing or transmitting information in a form readable by a machine ( e.g. , a computer ) .
For example , a machine - readable medium can include a read only memory ( ROM ) , random access memory ( RAM ) , magnetic disk storage media , optical storage media , flash memory devices , and electrical , optical , acoustical or other forms of propagated signals ( e.g. , carrier waves , infrared signals , digital signals , etc. ) .
In the foregoing specification , the invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof .
It will , however , be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereof without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims .
The specification and drawings are , accordingly , to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense .
Chimps eat dirt .
This has been known for years .
And while chimp cuisine might look more gritty than gourmet to us , it turns out our closest animal relations have a good reason for feasting on soil :
It improves their health .
By studying samples of soil eaten by chimpanzees in Kibale National Park in Uganda , a research team led by Sabrina Krief of the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris found that eating soil with their meals boosts the anti-malarial properties of plants the chimps eat .
Krief collected the dirt along with leaves from one of the chimps ' favorite foods , the Trichilia rubescens plant .
She found that when eaten alone , the leaves had no pharmacological effect , but when combined with soil , the mixture had clear anti-malarial properties .
Scientists previously suspected that animals might eat dirt when stressed or as a source of missing minerals .
This new result is the first suggestion that the combination of soil and other foods could have health benefits , Krief said .
" Here we show by eating plants and soil shortly after , the properties of the plants may be revealed or enhanced , " she told LiveScience .
" It ’s this association of items which provide potential benefits which is new . "
The study will be published online this week in the journal Naturwissenschaften .
Krief also compared the dirt chimps eat to that used by nearby human healers to treat diarrhea .
The samples shared many similarities , including a high concentration of the mineral kaolinite , the main ingredient of some anti-diarrheal medicines .
" Local people around Kibale use soil in traditional medicine , associated to different plant parts , " Krief said .
" It may potentialize the properties of plant or attenuate their toxicity by adsorbing noxious compounds . "
This discovery could help reinforce the idea that conservation benefits humans and animals alike , Krief said .
" This overlapping use by humans and apes is interesting from both evolutionary and conservation perspectives , " she said .
" Saving apes and their forests is also important for human health . "

Success depends on you being distracted away from the pocket being picked , and this is usually done by a physical bump or shove .
Or you do all the work distracting yourself by walking into a crowd at an outdoor celebration .
Sometimes you are discreetly marked with chalk beforehand as a signal to nearby pick pocket accomplices .
Defense : Reach for your pockets when you get bumped .
Do n’t walk into crowds and at the minimum do n’t put anything valuable in your back pockets .
2 . The bag lift .
Either sitting in a park or outdoor cafe , you notice keys or change on the ground .
As you pick it up , the backpack you left a couple feet behind has disapeared .
Defense :
Do n’t take your eyes off your bag .
Everyone who had their bag snatched says they only looked away “ for a second . ”
3 . The bag slash .
Usually on a crowded bus , someone slashes the outside of your backpack while you are distracted with some random commotion .
Once slashed , someone sticks their hand in hoping to find something valuable .
You do n’t realize your bag has been slashed .
Variation : Instead of slashing they just open the zipper and reach inside .
Defense :
Put your bag in front of you when taking public transport .
4 . The mustard spray .
Someone sprays a condiment around your waist as you are walking outside .
A very polite accomplice with toilet paper then offers to help clean up the mess but to get it out all you need to do is take off your backpack .
You never see it again .
Defense :
Walk with the mustard until you get to a safehouse .
5 . The fake police .
This is a particularly dangerous scam operated by organized gangs that involves an English speaking confederate who befriends you in a public space like a bus station .
A “ policeman ” arrives to do a random check and finds out your new friend has contraband , and demands you come with him to the fake police station where you tied up and relived of your credit cards and their PINs .
Sometimes you are held for days as the robbers withdraw the daily maximum amount from your accounts .
Variation :
You are in a cab and someone wants to share the ride with you .
Almost immediately , a fake policeman pulls the cab over and discovers contraband on the new passenger .
The key to this type of scam working is you making the decision to voluntarily follow the fake policeman .
Defense : Ignore a lone officer by pretending you do n’t understand him .
Do n’t follow any policeman unless multiple vehicle backup arrives and it ’s obvious they are real .
Two Austrian tourists were victims of this scam in Bolivia and were killed .
6 . The bus overhead grab .
Once you fall asleep on the bus someone either sifts through your bag in the overhead or grabs it and gets off at the next stop .
Nearly 100 % chance of happening on overnight buses in countries like Ecuador and Bolivia .
A variation is grabbing things from your jacket / fleece pockets as you sleep ( while you are wearing it ) .
Defense : Keep your bag on your lap or check everything in underneath the bus , where it will be safer .
Putting your bag on the floor is a poor defense if the robber gets in the seat behind you .
7 . The taxi runaround .
If you are coming out of a bar or club at night piss drunk , a crooked cab driver will disorient you by driving around .
Then he pulls into an alley where an accomplice with a weapon relieves you of your money and clothes .
This is an opportunistic crime because the cab driver selects people who he thinks would n’t notice being driven in the wrong direction .
Defense :
Do n’t get so trashed that you do n’t know the route home .
Speak up if you think something is off to let the cab driver know you wo n’t be an easy victim .
If you are certain he ’s driving you into a trap , get behind his seat and go apeshit .
Sitting next to a cab driver is a poor defense because accomplices can get in the backseat .
8 . The bar tab .
An English speaker befriends you and tells you about this really great bar down the street .
You get there and see two girls at the table next to you raise their glasses in salud after opening an expensive bottle of wine .
Your tab comes and turns out you bought that bottle of wine and several more for the many mediocre ladies in the bar .
Burly bouncers wo n’t let you leave until you charge an exorbitant sum to your credit card .
Primitive variation :
You are led into a “ bar ” ( abandoned building ) where you are immediately relieved of your goods .
Defense :
Do n’t follow someone you just met on the street into a bar or club unless it ’s a really hot girl .
9 . The found money .
You are walking down the street and a man walking next to you finds a large roll of cash on the floor .
He offers to split it with you .
Out of nowhere an accomplice enters and claims it was his money and there is a significant amount missing .
The man who found the money pays up and urges you to do the same to avoid serious trouble .
Defense :
If it ’s too good to be true …
10 . The switcharoo .
A guy on the street is hawking cheap cameras that seem legit .
Vendor is long gone by the time you realize you bought a box of rocks .
Sometimes even stores will give you a box that is already opened .
Defense : Examine the goods .
Even if you know every travel scam , you will still be defenseless against a mugger with a knife or gun , or someone who randomly karate kicks you in the head .
This usually happens at night where you are not carrying things like passport , jewelry , credit cards , or your Canon digital SLR camera .
It ’s best to give up the goods when attacked unless you have a weapon of your own and want to battle .
Bottom line :
Be skeptical of people and use your brain but do n’t but do n’t let paranoia rob you of what could be a sexual experience with a local .
Not everyone is trying to rob you .

Dan Berninger has been deeply involved in the VoIP world for many years .
If you need to know anything about the early days of VoIP , Berninger is worth talking to .
These days , he's an analyst for Tier1 Research and has just published ( and emailed to us ) a note looking at the claims in Verizon 's VoIP patents that a judge has ruled Vonage infringed on .
There are just a few problems with that ruling -- with the key one being that the concepts in those patents were clearly discussed and published by others prior to the patent being filed .
Berninger says that the ideas were discussed at the VoIP forum meeting in 1996 and published in January of 1997 .
The patents in question were filed after that .
I 've included Berninger 's note after the jump .
However , due to the fun way the patent system works , introducing that kind of prior art to the USPTO for it to review the validity of Verizon 's VoIP patents will take quite a bit of time and effort -- much longer than Vonage has to fight Verizon in court .
Daniel BerningerVP , Sr AnalystTier1
ResearchVerizon's two name translation patents anticipated by open standards groupsEric Voit , the author of the two " name translation " patents ( 6,104,711 - filed March 6 , 1997 ; 6,282,574 - filed February 24 , 2000 ) in Verizon 's patent litigation against Vonage , was not the original and first inventor of the claims in dispute .
The 16 lines associated with the two surviving claims assert the invention of " name translation " in the context of VoIP call - set up and termination via a telephony gateway .
See claims and links to patents : http://scratchpad.wikia.com/wiki/Vonage
The topic of " call set up " , " name translation " , and " telephony gateways " was discussed extensively in the year prior to the first Voit patent by participants in both the two main VoIP open standards development efforts - SIP and H.323 .
In particular , the claims in both patents were anticipated by open standards assembled by the VoIP Forum ( H.323 ) in 1996 and published in January 1997 with the participation of members from Cisco Systems , Microsoft , IBM , Nortel , Intel , Motorola , Lucent , and Vocaltec Communications , among others .
See : IMTC Voice over IP Forum Technical Committee , " IMTC Service Interoperability Implementation Agreement " , Draft 0.91 , January 13 , 1997 .
The Eric Voit patent applications reflect , in particular , contributions made by VocalTec Communication to the VoIP Forum during 1996 and formally published at the same time as a separate document .
See : O. Kahane and S. Petrack , " Call Management Agent System : Requirements , Function , Architecture , and Protocol , " IMTC VoIP Forum Contribution , Seattle , Washington , January , 1997 .
The work of the VoIP Forum , publication plans , and disclosure requirements were noted in a correspondence between the VoIP Forum and the ITU Telecommunications Standardization Sector .
See : ITU Telecommunications Standardization Sector , Document AVC - 1086 , Istvan Sebestyen , December 5 , 1996 .
Verizon filed another patent application ( 6,298,062 ) in the same time period that does reference the Kahane - Petrack paper of January 1997 .
The two Voit " name translation " patents address the identical subject matter with the ' 574 patent specifically labeled as a continuation of the ' 711 patent .
They assert different claims , but they share the same abstract , references , and description sections .
In any case , the notion of " name translation " in " call set up " involving " telephony gateways " was by no means invented by Eric Voit in March 1997 .

The ( Very ) Strange Economics of Tuesday Night ’s Debate
It is n’t much fun being both a non-economist and a Democratic presidential candidate .
There is tremendous pressure to give nonsense answers to issues of economic policy .
Over at U.S. News and World Report , writer James Pethokoukis does a commendable job of deconstructing some of the answers given during Tuesday night ’s debate .
Here ’s an example :
( CNN ) -- Police in Arvada , Colorado , searched for a killer on Sunday , while a school for missionaries mourned the deaths of two of the gunman 's victims and prayed for two others whom he wounded .
Investigators were looking for any connections between the shootings and a later assault on a church in Colorado Springs , but police officials would not discuss possible links Sunday afternoon .
In the Colorado Springs incident , a gunman attacked worshippers , killing one person and wounding four others before being killed by a security staff member , police said .
" We are not in a place to confirm any information about any possible similarities to these incidents , being widely reported throughout the media , " Arvada Police Chief Don Wick told reporters .
" I 'm asking that all of our communities be vigilant until we determine who 's responsible for these crimes . "
Authorities described the Arvada gunman as a white male , roughly 20 years of age , wearing a dark jacket .
He may have a beard or mustache and may be wearing glasses and a dark skull cap or beanie , police said .
Police confirmed that two of the four people shot early Sunday at the live - in training center for young Christian missionaries were dead , and identified them as Tiffany Johnson and Philip Crouse .
At about 12:30 a.m. Sunday , the gunman entered a building where Youth With a Mission members were cleaning up from a Christmas banquet , said Peter Warren , the center 's co-founder .
He asked for housing for the night , Warren said , which Johnson refused to give him .
" She said , ' We really can't do that right now , ' " Warren said .
" And then he opened fire . "
Police had tried to track the gunman through fresh snow with the help of dogs , but lost his trail in a heavily walked area , deputy police chief Gary Creager told CNN .
Watch police swarm around missionary center »
Johnson , 26 , was from Minnesota and Crouse , 24 , was from Alaska , police said in a statement .
Warren said both Johnson and Crouse died in surgery .
The two other shooting victims are men , ages 22 and 23 , police said .
One was in critical condition with a bullet wound in his neck and the other was in stable condition with wounds on his legs .
Paul Filidis of Youth With a Mission 's Colorado Springs office identified the wounded men as Charlie Blanch and Dan Griebenow , CNN affiliate KUSA reported .
Both are staff members , according to the organization 's Web site .
Johnson has been affiliated with the organization since 2006 , and joined the staff in spring 2007 , the Web site says .
Warren said a memorial service for the two dead would likely be held Tuesday or Wednesday .
" These kids were like our kids , you know ? " he told KUSA .
" It 's just such a tragedy . "
Warren said the center was bringing the 80 or so other people who live at the Arvada campus to the group 's mountain campus in Golden , Colorado .
" We 're just going to be honest , and pray for one another , and cry with one another , " he said .
Youth With a Mission was founded in 1960 , and now operates in more than 1,000 locations in 149 countries , according to its Web site .
The organization has a staff of nearly 16,000 .
The center is home to dozens of young people from all over the world who are being trained as Christian missionaries , according to the center 's Web site .
Arvada is a Denver , Colorado , suburb with a population of about 105,000 .

Anti-Pope slogans have appeared at La Sapienza
The Pope had been set to make a speech at La Sapienza University on Thursday .
Sixty - seven academics had said the Pope condoned the 1633 trial and conviction of the astronomer Galileo for heresy .
The Vatican insists the Pope is not " anti- science " - but in light of the protests they have decided it would be better for him not to attend .
Galileo had argued that the Earth revolved around the Sun .
The Vatican says the Pope will now send his speech to La Sapienza , instead of delivering it in person .
Landmark controversy
Pope Benedict was in charge of Roman Catholic doctrine in 1990 when , as Cardinal Ratzinger , he commented on the 17th - Century Galileo trial .
In the speech , he quoted Austrian - born philosopher Paul Feyerabend as saying the Church 's verdict against Galileo had been " rational and just " .
An old controversy has come back to haunt the Pope
Galileo , a devout Catholic , was forced to renounce his findings publicly .
In 1992 , Pope John Paul II expressed regret at the way Galileo had been treated .
" The error of the theologians of the time , when they maintained the centrality of the Earth , was to think that our understanding of the physical world 's structure was , in some way , imposed by the literal sense of Sacred Scripture , " he said .
The academics at La Sapienza signed a letter saying Pope Benedict 's views on Galileo " offend and humiliate us " .
They said it would be inappropriate for the Pope to open their academic year on Thursday .
It 's a good thing that someone in Italy has the courage to say no to the Pope .

" In the name of the secular nature of science we hope this incongruous event can be cancelled , " said the letter addressed to the university 's rector , Renato Guarini .
In a separate initiative , students at La Sapienza organised four days of protest this week .
The first revolved around an anti-clerical meal of bread , pork and wine , the BBC's Christian Fraser reports from Rome .
The banner at their lunch read : " Knowledge needs neither fathers nor priests " .
Vatican Radio said the protest at La Sapienza had " a censorious tone " .

Scientists have found the fossilised claw of a 2.5 - metre ( 8 - foot ) sea scorpion , a nightmarish creature living before the age of dinosaurs .
The discovery of the 390 - million - year - old specimen in a German quarry suggests that prehistoric spiders , insects , crabs and similar animals were much larger than previously thought , researchers at Britain 's Bristol University said on Wednesday .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Scientists have found the fossilised claw of a 2.5 - metre ( 8 - foot ) sea scorpion , a nightmarish creature living before the age of dinosaurs .
The discovery of the 390 - million - year - old specimen in a German quarry suggests prehistoric spiders , insects and crabs were much larger than previously thought , researchers at Bristol University said on Wednesday .
“ This is an amazing discovery , ” said university researcher Simon Braddy .
“ We have known for some time that the fossil record yields monster millipedes , super - sized scorpions , colossal cockroaches , and jumbo dragonflies but we never realised , until now , just how big some of these ancient creepy - crawlies were . ”
The find was described by Braddy and colleagues in the journal Biology Letters .
The claw of the sea scorpion Jaekelopterus rhenaniae measured 46 centimetres ( 18 inches ) long , indicating the creature was half a metre longer than previous estimates of the ancient arthropods .
Just why prehistoric arthropods -- creatures with external skeletons and segmented bodies -- grew so large is unclear .
Some scientists believe they may have become giants because of the higher levels of oxygen in the atmosphere in the past .
Another theory is that they evolved in an “ arms race ” alongside their likely prey , the early armoured fish .
But the two remain apart and Fatima is considering suicide , she said , if her recent appeal to King Abdullah does n't reunite her with the man she still considers her husband .
" Only the king can resolve my case , " Fatima said by telephone in a rare interview .
" I want to return to my husband , but if that is not possible , I need to know so I can put an end to my life . "
Fatima 's case underscores shortcomings in the kingdom 's Islamic legal system - in which rules of evidence are shaky , lawyers are not always present and sentences often depend on the whim of judges .
Those rules ' most frequent - and recently , most high - profile - victims are women , who already suffer severe restrictions on daily life in Saudi Arabia : they cannot drive , appear before a judge without a male representative , or travel abroad without a male guardian 's permission .
Recently , the king did intervene and pardon another high - profile defendant - a rape victim who was sentenced to be lashed and jailed for being in a car with a man who was not her relative .
The two cases have brought Saudi human rights once again into the international spotlight - revealing not only the weakness of the kingdom 's justice system , but the scant rights Saudi women have .
" When I heard that the [ rape victim ] was pardoned , I could n't believe it .
My case is so much simpler than hers , since my divorce is invalid , " Fatima said .
Fatima said her husband , a hospital administrator , followed Saudi tradition in asking her father for permission to marry her in 2003 .
" My brother reported good things about him , so my dad accepted his proposal , " said Fatima , a computer specialist who was 29 when she married .
She said her father knew that Mansour came from a less prominent tribe than hers , but that he did n't mind because he " cared about the man himself " .
A few months after the wedding , several of Fatima 's relatives , including a half brother , persuaded her father to give them power of attorney to file a lawsuit demanding an annulment , she said .
Then her father died , and Fatima said she 'd hoped the case would be dropped .
But on February 25 , 2006 , police knocked on the couple 's door to serve Mansour with divorce papers - which said his marriage had been annulled nine months earlier .
" We were shattered .
How did this happen ?
Why ? " Fatima asked .
Saudi lawyer Abdul - Rahman al - Lahem , who used to represent the couple , said local interpretations of Islamic law hold that relatives of a married couple have the right to seek an annulment if they feel the marriage lowers the extended family 's status .
He said authorities are reluctant to overrule such annulment orders , believing they are private matters within extended families .
Fatima took the couple 's two - year - old daughter and four - month - old son to live with her mother , who had persuaded her to let Mansour deal with the legal issues on his own .
But after three months without her husband , Fatima and the children snuck out of her mother 's house and flew with Mansour to the western seaside city of Jiddah , where they sought to live in anonymity .
Saudi police soon discovered them and imprisoned the family for living together illegally .
" The police told me I either return to my ( mother 's ) family or go to jail , " Fatima said .
" I chose jail .
" My children and I were thrown in a cell with women sentenced for pushing drugs , practicing witchcraft and behaving immorally , " Fatima said .
Authorities allowed her to send her daughter back to live with her father , but the infant stayed with Fatima in jail .
" He learned to speak in jail , he learned to walk in jail and his teeth came out in jail , " she said .
Meanwhile , Mansour went to court to appeal the divorce ruling , but a Riyadh appeals court upheld the decision in 2007 .
Last September , the head of a prominent Saudi human rights group reportedly asked the kingdom 's highest court to review the case .
Bandar al - Hajjar , head of the National Society of Human Rights , submitted two Islamic studies concluding that the divorce was invalid , according to the Arab News , a Saudi English - language daily .
The studies , conducted by Islamic researcher Adnan Al - Zahrani and Bassam Al - Bassam , a counsellor at the Court of Cassation in Mecca , said that if a woman 's legal guardian represented her at the original wedding , then other relatives have no right to object to the marriage based on compatibility .
Both studies concluded that Fatima married Mansour with her father 's permission , and that only the wife can decide whether she wants her marriage annulled , the paper reported .
Despite their legal fight , Fatima and Mansour remain apart .
After nine months in jail , Fatima moved to an orphanage where she and her son share an apartment with several other women .
Fatima said she is holding out hope the king might pardon her , and recognise her as " married to Mansour , before God " .
" I love him more than ever .
He 's the only one who has stood by me , " she said .

A giant , smiling Lego man has been fished out of the sea in the Dutch resort of Zandvoort .
Workers at a drinks stall rescued the 2.5 - metre tall model , which had a yellow head and blue torso .
" We saw something bobbing about in the sea and we decided to take it out of the water , " said a stall worker .
" It was a life - sized Lego toy . "
A woman nearby added : " I saw the Lego toy floating towards the beach from the direction of England . "
The toy was later placed in front of the drinks stall .

The FBI boss wanted suspects held in military and federal prisons
The FBI chief sent his proposal to US President Harry Truman just after the start of the Korean War in 1950 , The New York Times newspaper reports .
He asked the president to declare the mass arrest necessary to counter " treason , espionage and sabotage " .
There is no evidence any part of the plan was ever approved .
Mr Hoover wanted the president to suspend the centuries - old legal right of habeas corpus , which protects individuals against unlawful arrest .
The FBI director planned to detain the suspects - whose list of names he had been compiling for years - in US military and federal prisons .
" The index now contains approximately 12,000 individuals , of which approximately 97 % are citizens of the United States , " wrote Mr Hoover , in the now declassified document .
The New York Times gave no details about the identities of those targeted .
The US Department of State declassified the plan , along with other Cold War-era documents from 1950 - 55 this week .

モテるプロフィールの作成/サンプル写真・自己紹介文
POINT 誰にでもできるモテる写真・自己紹介文 プロフィール作成のポイントは、次の２つになります 効果的なプロフィール写真のセレクト
異性を惹きつけるプロフィールコメント・自己PR とても大切であって、最も重要なプロフィール作成、その書かれている内容によって、 ’’ 出会いチャンス ’’ を大きく左右させてしまうファクターです 言い換えれば、 ’’ 出会える ’’ ’’ 出会えない ’’ それを、決定づけているといっても過言ではありません 一生懸命になって、異性にメールアプローチをしているのに、なぜか2〜3回のメールやりとりで終わってしまう
そのほとんどの原因は、より相手のことを知ろうと、プロフィール内容をつぶさに見たことにあります
もしそこに、好感を抱くような写真・コメントがあったら、ポジティブになってメールを続けていたことでしょう
これは、男性ばかりでなく、女性にもいえることです
女性からメールアプローチがあっても、写真がなければスルーする男性も多くいます
効果的なプロフィール写真のセレクト ここでは、顔出しNGの際、効果的な写真のセレクトを説明しています
異性に共感性をイメージさせる写真にすることで、好感を抱かれやすく出会いに繋がります
自慢気であったり、暗い雰囲気をイメージとして与えてしまう写真は好まれません
そして、男女によって、その効果的な写真のセレクトは違っています
男性なら、雰囲気重視の写真をセレクトします
この写真は、ローアングルからスマホ・タイマー撮影したのち、加工を施したものです
街中やプレイスポット、カジュアルな雰囲気をイメージさせる写真は好まれます
明るくて、ポップであって、楽しそうな、写真のイメージからそんな連想ができれば、さらに好まれます
女性は、男性の容姿の良さより、全体から醸し出している雰囲気から、その男性を判断しています
顔の良さ、身長、それぞれ思ったほど大きなウェイトは置いていません
そして、顔が見えているか、見えていないかなども気にしていません
この写真のように、顔が分からなくても、ビジネスシーンを思わせる ’’ 爽やかさ・清潔感 ’’ は、女性に伝えることはできます ただ、年齢や使い方によっては、 ’’ 時計を自慢しているの？ ’’ などと、誤解を招く恐れがあります 成熟した大人の女性を相手にする際であれば、経済面から効果的であり、好まれる傾向にあります プロフィール写真は、いつでも自由に入れ替えることができるので、シチュエーションに合わせ、何枚か用意しておくとよいでしょう 女性は雰囲気や経済面を重視する一方で、男性は、女性の容姿に拘る傾向にあります とはいえ、その顔の可愛さでなく、プロフィール写真の顔の雰囲気で判断しています 女性の場合も、顔は分からなくて構いません このような雰囲気をした写真をもとに、顔の雰囲気が分かる程度の画像加工を施します 極端にいってしまえば、顔のパーツはすべて、スタンプやモザイクで加工し、顔が分からなくなってもいいのです ヘアースタイル・ヘアーカラー・顔の輪郭から、男性は女性の雰囲気をイメージします このように、季節感を思わせる写真も、男性女性問わず好まれます リゾート、アクティブな雰囲気をイメージさせる写真は、共感性を得るのに最適です 異性を惹きつけるプロフィールコメント・自己PR プロフィール自己紹介文・自 己PRのコメントを書くこと、それを苦手としている方が多くいます しかし、写真と同様、自己紹介文は大きなアピール要素であることから、文書作成には気を使う必要があります 多くの場合、自己紹介文だからといって、当然のように自分のアピールばかり、 ’’ 僕が・・・僕が・・・ ’’ ’’ 私が・・・私が・・・ ’’ などとなりがちです 自分の書きたいように、自己紹介コメントを書いたら、その多くはモテません 自分が何を求めているのかではなく、相手が何を求めているのかです モテる自己紹介コメントにするには、異性が求めている内容や、そのとき流行っている事柄を織り交ぜながら、自分のアピールをすることです また、プロフィールを閲覧していると、勿体ないな・・・と思わせる自己紹介コメントをよく見かけます 一行程度の簡単なフレーズ、箇条書き、それでは相手に伝わる情報があまりにも乏しく、出会いに繋がらない大きな要因になります プロフィール写真に好意をもち、次に、自己紹介文のコメントに目を通してみたら、10文字程度の僅かな文字が並んでいる どのような人なのか様子も分からない、メールアプローチしようと思っていたが・・・
そして、そのままスルーしてしまう せっかく好意を持ったのに、次のステップに進めない！
これは機会損失であって、それを防ぐには、情報を含んだコメントにすることです
あるいは、コメントは多く書かれているものの、理想とは程遠い内容であれば、次のステップに進むのは難しくなります
【自己紹介コメント例 ： 男性】 「 はじめまして 。
ここ数年仕事が楽しくて充実した生活を送っていました。
そのせいなのか、いい出会いが見つけられないでいます。
見た目の好みやこだわりは、あまりありません。
年上なら落ち着いている女性。年下なら明るい女性。
年齢相応の魅力のある女性は素敵だと思っています。
会話は好きなのですが、あまり得意なほうでなく、女性の話をいろいろ聞くのは得意です。
年上の女性なら仕事や日常の会話を、年下の女性なら相談事を話せるかもしれません。
映画や旅行、食べ歩きも好きなので、そのようなことも話題にしたいと思っています。
来月公開の映画○○に興味があります。
仕事は、○○です 。
土日が休みです。平日なら仕事終わりでも時間の都合はつきます。
趣味は、スポーツ・旅行・ドライブです。
ここまで読んでいただいてありがとうございます。
ちょっとでも、気になったらお話しませんか。
よろしくお願いします。 」 この自己紹介コメントを基本として、個別でコメントの置換・プラスマイナス修正をします
【自己紹介コメント例 ： 女性】 「 はじめまして 。
友達に良い出会いがあって、その友達の紹介で登録しました。
仕事ばかりの日々で、出会いがなく・・・どうしようかと思っていたのです。
人見知りなので、あまり積極的にお話しできないかもしれませんが、真面目に出会いたいと思っています。
もともと話好きで、慣れたらたくさんお話したいです。
料理が好きで、休みの日はいろいろなメニューにチャレンジしています。
あと、季節を感じさせる旅行も大好きです。
ちょっと、おっちょこちょいなところがあるようです。
よろしくお願いします。 」 女性の場合は、適度なアピールに留めておくことによって、女性らしさが伝わり良い結果に繋がります

雰囲気のある後姿・写真添付
プロフィール内容を充実させておく ファーストメールは、一般的に情報をたくさん詰め込む傾向にあります
しかし、それは長文化することから、効果的ではありません
スマホ画面をスクロールすることなく、すべて読み切れることが理想です
メール内容は、最低限の内容であって簡素にし、それを補うように後姿写真を添付します
活字とともに、視覚に訴えるこにより、相手に安心感を与えます
さらに、雰囲気ある後姿にしたことで、相手女性にミステリアスなイメージを与え、関心を抱くことが期待できます

褒めながら軽くけなす メール内容に、aorinさ ん、名前など情報を織り込むことによって、コピペメールでないことを、aorinさんに理解させます ことに、女性は名前で呼ばれることで、親近感を抱きやすいことから効果的です 好意を押し付ける内容としない、ガツガツとせず、aorinさんを理想であるかのように表現します そして、可愛いと褒めながらも、 ’’ ちょっと可愛い ’’ としていることで、aorinさ んは複雑な関心が芽生えます そしてそして、ファーストメールの準備ができたら、次のように、枠内にコメントを入力して【メール送信】します 相手女性が、社会人であったり、大人の女性であったら、次のような写真が効果的です 女性に疑問を与えるファーストメール ところで、よく見かけるメール指南サイトでは、ファーストメールは、「自己PRを含めた質問形式にする 」 と多くの方が説明しています これは、一般的にいわれている通りであって、間違いではありません

男性から受け取るメールは、いつも見慣れたありきたりな内容、さらに長文になりすぎている
そのようなファーストメールを受け取った女性の多くは、メールを読み終わる前に、そのメール画面から途中離脱します

ちなみに、返事をもらうだけの手段であれば・・・ 「 〜〜〜 けど、すごいです ね( ^_^ ) 」 このコメントをファーストメールの文末に書くだけで、かなりの確率で返信はあります
そのメールを見た女性は・・・ ’’ 何のことを言ってるのかな・・・気になる！！！何だろ・・・？ ’’ 侮辱でなく、褒められていることから、女性はイヤな気持ちにはならず、つい気になって返信してしまいます 返信があったら、プロフィール内容から適当なコメントを考えメールします 今回の aorinさんであれば・・ ・

WASHINGTON –
On Thursday , the United States and Israel conducted a Strategic Dialogue led by Under Secretary for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transportation Shaul Mofaz to strengthen the already close strategic cooperation between the two countries .
This is the third Strategic Dialogue between Israel and the US this year .
The last one took place in June .
" These talks are a manifestation of the profound historical and security ties between the two nations and are based on close friendship , shared values and common interests , " a joint statement issued by the two sides following the talks said .
" The Strategic Dialogue provided a welcome opportunity to discuss a broad range of regional issues that are of great importance to both Israel and the United States . "
The US and Israeli teams discussed Iran ’s destabilizing regional impact .
They shared their latest assessments of Iran ’s nuclear program and diplomatic efforts underway to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons .
Earlier , Minister Shaul Mofaz spoke to reporters regarding joint America - Israeli efforts vis-à - vis Iran and said : " We 're progressing with the strategy that was put in place and we are raising the level of sanctions incrementally .
There are more severe measures that can be taken against Iran , its leadership and its economy .
It is important to exhaust all these possibilities before we resort to the use of force , " Mofaz told reporters .
The two governments also discussed the situation in Lebanon , including the need for full implementation of UNSC Resolution 1701 and the next steps in the international community 's common efforts to prevent the rearming of Hizbullah .
Replacing ElBaradei is a good idea
Mofaz also echoed Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's comments on Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei in his remarks to reporters after meeting with American officials .
" Replacing ElBaradei is the right option , " Mofaz said .
" He is saying that he does n't know about an Iranian nuclear weapons program , it 's as if he's not familiar with his job , " Mofaz claimed .
The US is currently having a difficult time convincing UN Security Council veto - holders Russia and China to support additional sanctions on Iran .
ElBaradei has claimed that it is not at all clear that Iran has nuclear weapons ambitions although the US and Israel are convinced that the Iranians do intend to procure a nuclear arsenal .
A baby - faced eighth grader , viciously bullied online , hangs himself .
With a click of her mouse , a young woman with anorexia uses cyberspace to find tips on starving .
A high school student , with a world of plot outlines available on the Internet , admits that he cannot recall ever actually reading a book .
If 21st - century parenthood is not scary enough , “ Growing Up Online , ” a documentary to be broadcast on the “ Frontline ” program on most PBS stations on Tuesday night , uses those real - life stories to ask an increasingly important question :
What does it mean to be part of the first generation coming of age steeped in a virtual world seemingly outside parental control ?
The documentary touches on the much discussed fear of online sexual predators , as well as concerns about the ease of cut - and - paste plagiarism , using the Internet .
It also examines how notions of privacy and the meaning of friendships change when a computer button can ferry your words and your images to strangers .
“ It ’s one of those societal shifts that ’s happening so quickly there ’s not a lot of good data on what this means for our kids ’ brains or hearts , ” said Rachel Dretzin , the writer of “ Online . ”
Her documentary credits include “ Failure to Protect , ” a series about Maine ’s child welfare system , and “ Hillary ’s Class , ” about the 1969 Wellesley College graduating class that included the future Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton .
( Ms. Dretzin has also produced a 15 - minute video on middle - aged sexuality for nytimes.com . )
Ms. Dretzin co-produced and directed “ Online ” with John Maggio , whose documentary work includes “ Ten Days That Unexpectedly Changed America : Einstein ’s Letter , ” part of a series on the History Channel .
Barack Obama 's campaign has now released a relatively comprehensive and extremely ambitious technology document ( PDF ) that lays out a whole slew of general and specific proposals for doing everything from reforming the patent system to implementing a national broadband policy .
In releasing this " technology and innovation plan , " Obama is the first major presidential candidate on either ticket to release a technology policy document that 's this comprehensive — some of the proposals here have been pitched by Edwards and others , but Obama is the first to put them all in one place .
The document begins with a set of policy goals that pretty well sum up the major areas that the proposals address :
Ensure the full and free exchange of information among Americans through an open Internet and diverse media outlets .
Create a transparent and connected democracy .
Encourage the deployment of a modern communications infrastructure .
Employ technology and innovation to solve our nation 's most pressing problems , including reducing the costs of health care , encouraging the development of new clean energy sources , and improving public safety .
Improve America ’s competitiveness .
If you read Lawrence Lessig 's writings on corruption issues , or if you 've read Ars 's own coverage of H1B visa reform , network neutrality , IT and healthcare , America 's R&D shortfall , media consolidation , broadband policy , ratings systems for content in games and movies , privacy , and a host of other technology policy - related issues , then you could almost flesh out the bullet points above all on your own by searching Ars for these topics and looking for the policy ideas that we seem to like .
This is n't to say that I did n't find glaring omissions and points where I disagree with the document , but I do have to admit that it reads like something that many of the ( non-libertarian ) writers and editors at sites like Ars , BoingBoing , Slashdot , and Wired might have gotten together and hashed out over a long weekend .
Conversely , because the document envisions a fairly robust role for the federal government in technology in terms of spending , bureaucracy , and regulation , the libertarians among us — both staff and readers — will find much to dislike about it .
I 'll start my discussion of Obama 's plan with the two most important parts — the " open government " and " technology czar " proposals — before giving a short list of the highlights of the rest of the document , organized around issues that we 've covered in the past on Ars .
I 'll follow this list with some critical feedback , below .
Sunlight is the best disinfectant
The " open government " section is by far the boldest and most radical part of Obama 's plan .
If even half of the proposals outlined here were to be implemented , it would fundamentally change the nature of our democracy for the better ... which is precisely why very few of these proposals have any chance at all of ever being implemented .
Most of the proposals in this area involve using the Internet to open up the decision - making processes of the executive branch and the legislative process of congress .
The idea is to give citizens a chance to view and comment on policy and legislation before it gains the force of law .
Take a look at my summaries of four of them .
Put government data online for citizen access , analysis , commentary , and action .
The document cites environmental data on pollution as one type that could be made available .
Effectively " crowd - sourcing " ( though that term is n't used ) some amount of agency decision - making by tapping the public 's distributed expertise .
Build an online database that enables citizens to track federal grants , contracts , earmarks , and lobbyist contacts with government officials .
Give " the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House web site for five days before signing any non-emergency legislation . "
There 's a fifth sunlight proposal in Obama 's list that 's so gloriously idealistic and infeasible that I have to quote it in full :
Requiring his appointees who lead Executive Branch departments and rulemaking agencies to conduct the significant business of the agency in public , so that any citizen can watch a live feed on the Internet as the agencies debate and deliberate the issues that affect American society .
He will ensure that these proceedings are archived for all Americans to review , discuss and respond .
He will require his appointees to employ all the technological tools available to allow citizens not just to observe , but also to participate and be heard in these meetings .
It 's a nice sentiment , but I seriously do n't want to officially move all important federal business to golf courses and to the back rooms of DC restaurants , which is what putting a camera on these meetings would do .
It would also slow the bureaucracy down even further by necessitating private meetings convened for the purpose of prepping for on - camera meetings .
If you put people in front of a camera , they will eventually start to act for it .
This summary gives you an idea of what the Obama team is thinking about in the area of open government .
As I read over this material , I felt that their heart was in the right place , but I 'm also cynical enough to think that most of these ideas either have no chance in Washington , or they 'll be worked around fairly quickly , as the cockroaches naturally find the shadows in the new terrain so that they can go on about their business .
A national technology czar
In contrast with the wonderful but idealistic transparency proposals outlined above , Obama 's proposal to create the nation 's first Chief Technology Officer is not only practical , but it 's desperately overdue .
Even Louisiana has a state CTO , and the US as a whole has needed one for the better part of a decade .
Obama proposes that the CTO focus on transparency issues , technological interoperability of government agencies , communication infrastructure for emergency response , and populating government agencies with people who have a technology background .
Other proposals
Here 's quick but incomplete summary of some of the other proposals in the document :
Network neutrality : Obama comes out in full support of network neutrality legislation , but in a way that does n't display any particularly deep technical understanding of the issue .
The document worries about the possibility of " toll charges " foisted on sites by greedy " network providers , " but it does n't draw the necessary distinction between quality - of - service at the backbone level and traffic shaping at the last - mile ISP level .
Still , this is more of a political document than a full - fledged policy document , so the main thing that his network neutrality stance indicates to me is that he 's listening to people with whom I agree on this issue .
Media consolidation : Obama decries media consolidation and pledges to " encourage diversity " in media ownership , but beyond this there 's not a lot of detail here .
Parental controls and ratings :
The document proposes the creation of a modern , online answer to Sesame Street called Public Media 2.0 .
Aside from a name , the document does n't say much else about this , opting instead to move into a more detailed discussion of voluntary ratings , tagging , and filtering that are generally " opt- in " by parents and industry .
Privacy :
The document acknowledges that government - maintained databases on America citizens are " necessary tools in the fight against terrorism , " while making general noises about safeguards .
This is typical of Obama 's entire section on privacy , which presumes the existence of all kinds of databases ( law enforcement , health records , location data , etc. ) and then talks about safeguards against abuse .
Broadband : Obama wants a national broadband policy that includes a formal redefinition of " broadband " from its current low of 200 kbps , opening up the wireless spectrum to fresh competition ( Google has endorsed this part of his plan ) , increased broadband penetration using a combination of government subsidies , the aforementioned spectrum policy reform , and public / private partnerships .
The goal is for broadband access to be a widely accessible utility like phone or electricity .
H1B reform :
Here 's a place where Obama wants to appeal to all sides of the debate .
He begins his discussion of immigration reform with a commitment to tapping more American workers ( especially underrepresented minorities ) for high - tech jobs , but then moves to a carefully couched suggestion that we might increase the number of H1 Bs before finishing off with a nod to common criticisms of the program voiced here and in other places : " Obama will work to ensure immigrant workers are less dependent on their employers for their right to stay in the country and would hold accountable employers who abuse the system and their workers . "
Investments in basic science and R&D : The basics of Obama 's plan to boost American competitiveness can be summarized in this partial list : double federal funding for basic research , make existing R&D tax credits permanent , throw technology at education , reform immigration , and reform the patent system .
Conclusions
The document 's privacy stuff is disappointingly weak .
There 's no mention of any kind of real legal recourse for those who 've been unfairly targeted by government databases and lists , like the infamously false - positive - prone " no - fly list . "
Privacy is indeed about databases , but it 's not just about how law enforcement databases are used .
Privacy in the digital age is about answering the following questions :
What kinds of databases in both the public and private sector are allowed to be created
What kind of data is permitted in those databases
Who has access to that data
How secure is that data
What happens to the data when it's no longer needed
How is the data corrected and updated
How much do people know about what kinds of things are being recorded about them , why , and by whom .
Who 's responsible for cleaning up the mess when someone 's privacy has been violated , due to a failure in the technological and / or policy safeguards implied in the bullet points above ?
In other words , privacy is a much bigger issue than warrantless wiretapping , encompassing as it does issues from credit reporting to ID theft .
A comprehensive privacy policy is one that takes a database record ( public sector or private ) as its primary object , and then asks a set of progressively more specific outcome - oriented questions about read - write - modify access and ownership of that record .
There are other problems with the document , but like the privacy issue , they 're mainly matters of focus and substance .
For instance , the pie - in - the - sky transparency stuff is great , but I 'd rather have seen more space dedicated to the kinds of core science policy and basic research funding issues that John Timmer and I have covered over the past two years .
Also critical is the issue of intellectual property reform , a topic that gets relatively short shrift in the document but without which all talk of a real " innovation plan " is meaningless .
Ultimately , however , Obama has thrown down the gauntlet to the other primary candidates with this proposal .
Hillary Clinton in particular , who appears to be on the industry side of the telecom immunity and network neutrality issues , should be worried about losing ground to Obama among the wired progressive crowd because of this document .
Owning a pet zombie can be a surprisingly stressful experience .
Most people who endeavor to keep zombies do so with poor education .
Believe it or not , the zombie is a very high - maintenance creature .
The following is a primer for the beginning zombie owner .
More detailed information on zombie care can be obtained from your local Necromancer or other black magician .
Housing & Bedding
Maintenance of zombie habitat is likely the most stressful and involved part of zombie ownership .
You 'll need to construct an enclosure measuring at least 5 by 5 feet out of sturdy material .
Plexiglass anchored with concrete works nicely .
Zombies do not handle humidity well .
Accordingly , your main task is to keep your zombie 's enclosure dry .
Include one to six industrial grade de-humidifiers inside the enclosure where your zombie cannot reach them .
Line the enclosure with a one - foot - deep mix of cedar chips and silica sand .
The sand will pull moisture to the bottom of the enclosure while the cedar chips will help with the stench .
You may also wish to include a bed of willow ashes for resting .
Some owners have constructed ' playpens ' out of industrial sewage pipe similar to the Habitrail toys used by Hamsters .
While this is a nice option , it is not necessary : a typical zombie does not require much in the way of stimulation ( see Recreation ) .
Feeding
Like snakes , zombies are carnivorous .
An animal which is carnivorous eats only meat .
Zombies are more picky than most carnivores : they eat only brains .
Many new zombie owners assume that zombies are able to subsist on any kind of flesh .
While a zombie will consume any biotic material available , it requires the divine spirit contained in the Hypothalamus of the brain to maintain its hellish energy .
Now , before you worry about locating adequate supplies of human brains , be aware that the brains of animals will do just fine in large enough supply .
Unlike most animals , zombies lack the nervous triggers which tell it when it is full .
Consequently , if enough food is available , it will eat until its organs burst .
Because zombies in the wild are not effective hunters , the danger of eating too much is rarely a concern .
However , under the supervision of a live owner , a zombie 's brain intake must be carefully monitored to maintain health .
Feed your zombie no more than five ( 5 ) pounds of brain matter per day .
Optimally , each day contains 20 or so meals consisting of only a few ounces of brain .
An evolutionary blunder in the zombie is a slow digestive system coupled with an overwhelming drive to constantly eat .
Consequently , rate of feeding is a delicate matter .
A reputable Necromancer will likely have more detailed instructions for feeding your zombie .
Recreation
Being a mindless killing machine , a zombie is typically not much for recreation .
It can be taken for short walks in warm weather ; you can participate with it in a crude game of catch by ( softly ) throwing balls and / or sticks at it , triggering the reflexes remaining from the prior nervous system .
To keep the muscles sharp , walk with it on a leash in quick bursts of five to ten short steps , followed by several minutes of rest .
Taking your zombie for a walk is a lot like taking your guard dog out for a walk .
There 's potential for injury .
Getting to know signs of zombie aggression is the first step to preventing catastrophe .
When a zombie is about to attack , it will assume a very specific stance : it will outstretch its arms and moan .
It may gag also .
While zombies are typically ambush hunters , they are sometimes able to subdue prey from a distance by squirting bile from the nose and mouth .
If you are bitten or burned , immediately amputate the affected body part (s ) .
If infected blood reaches your brain the result is almost always fatal .
Having your zombie de-toothed is the best defense against deadly attack .
On behalf of PETU ( People for the Ethical Treatment of the Undead ) , allseeingeye has raised concerns that the practice of zombie de-toothing is cruel and unusual treatment .
While the process itself is not pleasant to witness , it 's beneficial to the zombie 's health in the long run : invariably , teeth become infected , and because the zombie possesses no immune system , small disturbances can quickly turn disastrous .
Cause of death for zombies with teeth is typically decomposition of the head resulting from infected teeth ; toothless zombies tend to live months longer .
As peak oil approaches , shortly followed by peak gas and eventually peak energy , we have to retreat to agriculture as the prime energy producer in society .
Post - peak agriculture will be radically different to modern agriculture .
Today ’s agriculture is more an energy consumer than an energy producer .
In developed countries it takes ten calories worth of energy from fossil fuels put into a farm in the form of fertilizers , pesticides and transportation fuel , to get one calorie back in the form of food ( see also here and here ) .
This is a guest post by WisdomfromPakistan .
Wisdom is a computer engineer living and working in Karachi , a cultured city of some 20 million people .
He has been conducting his own research into human nutritional requirements and the Earth 's carrying capacity which he now wants to share with The Oil Drum readership .
Some of this input can be reduced by localization , which cuts considerable expenses in the form of transportation fuel , but other expenses like fertilizers and pesticides ca n’t be reduced without having a considerable reduction in food production .
A detailed look on the situation , how we got here and an account of agricultural productivity before industralization is therefore necessary .
Up untill 1950 the World 's agriculture was mostly run on organic lines with no artificial chemicals put into the soil .
After the Second World War efforts were made to dump the large amount of chemicals made for military purposes into farm chemicals .
In the 1960s , with the advent of the green revolution world agriculture slowly transitioned to an artificial fertilizer base .
As a result , food production increased 2.5 times on average .
This increase in productivity comes from higher nitrogen absorption , selective cropping and high grain - mass to plant - mass ratio .
Higher nitrogen absorption means more water use .
This was supported with intensive dams construction along with canal systems to have enough water in winters to have two crops per year .
Higher grain - mass to plant - mass ratios mean less crop residue available for animals as a larger part of the plant is now eaten by people .
Selective cropping
Selective cropping means only high - yield varieties are grown .
This reduces resistance against pests as miles and miles of the same crop variety is an easy target for pests .
To compensate , a lot of pesticides are used .
It also means reduction in crop -diversity .
For example in China in 1949 about 10,000 varieties of rice were grown , in 1970 it reduced to 1000 , in 2002 that further reduced to 300 .
The 14 leading varieties occupy more than 40 % of chinese wheat fields now .
India had 30,000 different types of wheat , now 90 % of the wheat acreage is covered by 10 different but highly productive varieties ( “ Saving Crop Diversity Key to Winning War On Hunger ” , Reuters , 7/3/01 ) .
Out of 700 crop species that have been domesticated by humans , only 30 species now provide 90 % of the global food intake .
( FAO , “ The State of the World ’s Plant Genetic Resource for Food and Agriculture ” , Rome , 1997 , p 14 ) .
As in all systems , efficiency was gained at the cost of resilience , as low productive but more shock - absorbing components were taken out of the system .
World ’s average wheat production used to be 400 kg per acre per year in 1950 .
By the 1970s this was boosted up to 2000 kg per acre per year in South Asia and 4000 kg per acre per year in Europe and the USA .
That is one of the reasons the world was able to compensate for rapid increase in population .
In 1950 world population was about 3 billion , it is more than double now , but world 's agricultural land area is about the same .
Also , the world 's diet shifted from a mostly vegetarian diet to a more meat based diet .
Now , there is no more increase in agricultural productivity that the green revolution can provide and the World population is still increasing .
Not much unused agrarian land is available .
As a result per capita agriculture production is starting to decline .
Energy needs and a balanced diet
The basic need of humans is food .
We need food to have energy to perform vital body functions , to reproduce , to work and to have fun .
The unit of energy used by dietitians is the Calorie ( or kilocalorie ) , that is , 4200 joules of energy , enough to raise the temperature of one kg of water by one degree celsius .
The energy need of a typical adult is 2500 Calories per day .
Children and elderly need less than that .
That brings the average to 2000 Calories per day for all .
The calculation can be done here .
The caloric values must come 55 % - 60 % from carbohydrates , 12 % - 15 % from proteins and 33 % - 25 % fats .
The variation based on climate , culture and personal preferences .
For our calculation we take the most recommended 60 % from carbohydrates , 12 % from protein and 28 % from fats .
It must be kept in mind that this is an attempt to summarize highly complex and variable data into a meaningful format .
There are hundreds if not thousands of food items available for human use , which particular item one uses depends a lot on one ’s religion , culture , climate , personal preference etc .
Food productivity differs a lot on the basis of geographical location .
A scheme of balanced daily diet ( link to Excel file ) :
Kgs / year Grains & Cereals 100 Milk 100 Fruits 100 Vegetables 25 Meat ( goat , horses , sheep ) 25 Oil 12.5 Sugar 12.5 Dry Fruits / Eggs 12.5 Spices 12.5
Average worldwide food output kg per acre per year before green revolution :
kg per acre per year Grains & Cereals 400 Fruits & Vegetables 800 Milk 200 Meat ( goat , camel , horse ) 50 Meat ( fish , chicken ) 100 Oil 200 Sugar 200 Dry Fruits / Eggs 200 Spices 200
Land needed per person in sq meteres :
sq meteres per person Grains & Cereals 1000 Fruits & Vegetables 500 Oil 250 Sugar 250 Dry Fruits / Eggs 250 Spices 250 Pasture 1000 Cotton , tea , coffee , wool etc. 500
Notes :
4000 sq metres = 0.4 hectares .
1 hectare = 2.47 acres .
Therefore , land required per person is roughly 1 acre .
• It is estimated that egg production in kg would be at least twice than chicken meat per acre .
That is because of the savings in energy when eggs are directly used in diet that would otherwise be used by the chicken in its life time , after it hatches out of the egg , grows up and gains weight up to age of a few weeks before being finally slaughtered .
• Land needed for vegetables is so little ( 25 / 800 * 4000 = 125 sq meter ) that a side crop along with grains / cereals can be grown for that .
That ’s the traditional Chinese method of having a crop of vegetables along with rice .
A nitrogen - fixing crop is needed anyways as a side crop on land where grains / cereals are grown to maintain soil fertility .
• A quarter acre dedicated to pasture grows 200 kg of fodder per year .
The total fodder requirement for milk and meat is 400 kg .
It is because 2 kg of fodder is needed to have 1 kg of milk and 8 kg of fodder is needed to have 1 kg of goat / camel / horse meat .
The other 200 kg of fodder comes from crop-residue , leaves etc from grain / cereals , fruits and vegetables .
100 kg of grains / cereals leave 160 kg fodder , 100 kg fruits leave 200 kg fodder , 50 kg of miscellaneous ( oil , sugar , spices and dry fruits ) leaves 80 kg of fodder .
Assuming it would have half of the caloric values left when finally consumed by animals that is equivalent of 200 kg of fodder .
A simplified division of land is as follows :
Farm ( for grains / cereals ) Quarter acre per person Pasture ( for growing fodder ) Quarter acre per person Orchard ( for growing fruits )
Half - Quarter acre per person Farm ( for tea , cotton , wool ) Half - Quarter acre per person Oil ( for veg oil ) Quarter - Quarter acre per person Sugar ( honey or sugarcane ) Quarter - Quarter acre per person Dry fruits Quarter - Quarter acre per person Spices Quarter - Quarter acre per person
Water
Water is another important factor in farm productivity .
A land rich in organic material and minerals is of no use without a supply of water .
The primary source of water is rain falling directly on land .
Secondary sources like canals are also used to increase productivity .
Finally tertiary sources like wells and tube wells are used which to some degree recycles the water already used at the farm .
A 10 inch rain fall on one acre means 1000 tons of water .
For a summer crop , at least in my part of world 80 % of rain falls during the monsoon , right when the crop needs it .
So 800 cubic meters of water directly from rain is enough ( same Excel file as before ) to grow the food per person per acre using these water requirements ( see also here ) , assuming 20 % loss of water at the farm due to evaporation and soil absorption before being used by plants .
The calculation includes water needed for world average use of 3.5 kg cotton , 1.1 kg coffee and 0.5 kg tea per capita per year .
If canals are used an additional 800 meter cube of water ( one acre ft with 33 % loss between dam and farm because of soil absorption , evaporation etc ) is available per acre to support two people per acre .
Carrying capacity
Lets try to estimate the World ’s carrying capacity based on the above mentioned diet .
The world land area is 150 million sq km that means about 37.5 billion acres.
10 percent of it can be used to grow grains .
10 percent as pasture land and another 20 percent as forests to raise animals on .
Altogether 15 billion acres are useful for food production .
Those 15 billion acres can be used to grow food for total 15 billion people sustainably provided :
1 ) There are no other species than humans .
2 ) Human population is distributed in such a way that more people live where there is more arable land .
Out of 4 million species of plants and animals today , we are just one specie .
There are many species of animals , birds , insects that we need for our survival .
For example , some of them eat others to keep their numbers in check .
Some like honey bees are needed for pollination without which food production would be very low etc .
Human population is not distributed on the basis of where arable land is .
In Australia and Canada 20 million people live in 9 million sq km , about 2.5 people per sq km .
In the Indian sub - continent at least 1.2 billion people live in just 4 million sq km , 300 people per sq km .
So , at some places there is much less arable land available per person and vice versa in other places .
Today , out of total food production of this planet , humans consume 40 % .
That confirms that total life support on the planet is 15 billion people ( or other animal , insect , bird species of same mass ) .
Assuming that we can sustainably use 40 % of world 's food production for our use leaving the rest for all other species , we can have food for 6 billion people on this planet if our population is distributed evenly .
Since it is not , long term human population support on this planet ranges from 2 billion to 4 billion .
Taking the average 3 billion , this is roughly the population of the world at the end of the second world war .
How to increase productivity
If crop -residue can be saved in a better way , so that most of its caloric values are retained , the need of pasture would be eliminated , saving a quarter of acre .
Also , in a culture that use more rice than wheat more land can be saved as rice productivity is typically thrice that of wheat , without destroying the soil .
Both of these together can reduce per capita land requirement to half an acre .
If two crops can be grown instead of one , by using excess water from canals and underground , productivity can be doubled .
In more fertile lands with crop output double than world ’s pre-industrial average , half the land would be needed per capita .
Looking at the large picture , the increase in productivity in more fertile land is mirrored by decrease in productivity in less fertile land .
“ The magic of big numbers ” .
So this is not a large scale solution .
In short per capita land requirement can fluctuate between 4 acres in feudal ages of middle Europe ( where half the land was kept fallow and on other half output was half that of world ’s average ) to a quarter acre in a rice - eating vegetarian culture .
For the world as a whole , it ’s safe to assume the average to be 1 acre .
Conclusion
In the detailed discussion above we found out that long - term , average - diet , pre-industrial , per capita arable land requirement is 1 acre .
We also found that using 40 % of all food produced in the world ( currently consumed by 4 million species of plants and animals ) that 6 billion people can be supported on Earth .
Since human population is not distributed on basis of availability of arable land , in reality only 2 billion to 4 billion people can be supported .
An educated guess is 3 billion , the population of humanity after the Second World War and before the green revolution .
What will happen to the surplus population is a matter of mere speculation .
Since fossil fuels will not decline in one day one can expect a gradual decline in population either right after peak energy or over a period of time .
How the population declines is also a matter of mere speculation .
In a poorer world higher birth rates may be expected , as is observed in developing countries vs developed countries .
So , the decline is more likely to come from reduction in health care with a reduction in life expectancy and an increase in infant mortality .
Seagate is warning customers of its external hard drives that their bare drive may not be so bare after all -- it might have a Trojan hidden on it .
The infection is relatively harmless , unless you play " World of Warcraft , " and still very rare .
Only 1,800 machines were infected .
But it does raise the issue of problems in the manufacturing process .
The issue involves Maxtor Basics Personal Storage 3200 .
Seagate bought Maxtor in 2005 for $ 1.9 billion .
Somehow , a virus called Win32.
AutoRun.ah , a molar virus that searches for passwords to online games , got on the drives .
All but one of the games affected are Chinese .
The one non-Chinese game is " World of Warcraft , " an online game from an American firm , Blizzard Entertainment .
After grabbing the login and password info of a game , the info is sent to servers based in Korea and the U.S. , not China as previously believed .
The virus also deletes other molar viruses ( password stealing viruses ) and can disable virus detection software .
However , it is a few months old and the majority of antivirus software products can detect and remove it .
To assist its customers , Seagate is making a version of the Kaspersky antivirus software with a 60 - day usage license available for free download .
In a statement on its Web site , Seagate said the problem was traced to a sub- contract manufacturer located in China and that all units now leaving the facility in question have been cleared of the virus .
While the virus is relatively benign and the overall infection rate is small , the incident raises bigger issues surrounding manufacturing and purchasing storage .
Even though many drives come pre-formatted for use out of the box , it 's not a good idea to do that .
" I would always format my hard drive as soon as it arrives , " Paul Ferguson , network architect for antivirus vendor Trend Micro told InternetNews.com .
" For many people , most hard drives arrive pre-formated from the plant and they use it as is .
My advice would be always reformat the drive before installing anything on it . "
Added Randy Abrams , director of technical education with antivirus vendor ESET Software , " Any device that stores data today really has to be suspect when you receive it .
Items can be returned after a user has accessed them .
Some stores are not sophisticated enough to realize they need to check the contents of returned thumb drives , and media players , or potentially even hard drives . "
It 's yet another manufacturing black eye for China .
All year there have been recalls of children 's toys made in China due to lead paint , and an iPod virus infection in late 2006 also originated in China .
In the iPod instance , it was found that a manufacturing computer had been connected to the Internet and someone used it to download games , thus allowing for the infection , according to Jamz Yaneza , research project manager at Trend .
" Companies need to keep their manufacturing systems off the Internet , " said Yaneza .
" There is no reason for manufacturing systems to be online .
You do n't want to introduce any variables that may interfere with your process .
It 's supposed to be a closed system . "
Abrams concurred .
" In order to prevent new devices from leaving with inappropriate content of any type on them , it is essential for there to be processes in place that prevents the introduction of content .
This includes system isolation , and returning any product taken off the line for testing to a known state , " he said .
George Clooney addressed the UN Security Council in 2006
The Hollywood star has campaigned to stop the conflict in Darfur , Sudan .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon hailed his " dedication to raising awareness and mobilising action on Darfur " .
Clooney pledged to build support for the UN's " critically important work in some of the most difficult , dangerous and dire places in the world " .
" I am deeply honoured to receive this appointment , " he said .
In 2006 , Clooney delivered an impassioned speech to the UN Security Council , telling its members that genocide was taking place " on your watch " .
' Personal mission '
Last April , the Ocean 's 11 and Syriana star set up a charity , Not On Our Watch , with fellow actors Don Cheadle , Brad Pitt and Matt Damon to raise funds for Darfur .
The charity has so far gathered more than $ 9.3 m ( £ 4.75 m ) for humanitarian work in the area .
At least 200,000 people have been killed in Darfur and two million forced from their homes in the five - year conflict between the government and rebel groups .
The UN recently took control of the peacekeeping mission in the region , although the force is still far short of its intended total of 26,000 troops .
Mr Ban told Clooney , who has been to Darfur : " You have seen first - hand the pain experienced by the victims of war and made it your personal mission to help end violence and human suffering . "
Clooney joins eight other current UN messengers of peace , who include conductor Daniel Barenboim , author Paulo Coelho , cellist Yo - Yo Ma and film star Michael Douglas .
Looking over this week ’s headlines thus far , a trend emerges — Republican blocked a habeas corpus bill from coming to a vote .
They also blocked a bill to give DC residents a voice in Congress from coming to a vote .
Republican are looking at Jim Webb ’s amendment to give troops equal time off for the time they spend in combat and they want to block it from coming to a vote .
The Senate Democratic leadership is working on a funding bill for Iraq that includes a withdrawal timeline , which Republicans will block from coming to a vote .
And that ’s just from news items yesterday .
Kevin Drum highlights the problem we ’ve been watching all year .
Republicans are n’t just obstructing legislation at normal rates .
They ’re obstructing legislation at three times the usual rate .
They ’re absolutely desperate to keep this stuff off the president ’s desk , where the only choice is to either sign it or else take the blame for a high - profile veto .
As things stand , though , Republicans will largely avoid blame for their tactics .
After all , the first story linked above says only that the DC bill “ came up short in the Senate ” and the second one that the habeas bill “ fell short in the Senate . ”
You have to read with a gimlet eye to figure out how the vote actually broke down , and casual readers will come away thinking that the bills failed because of some kind of generic Washington gridlock , not GOP obstructionism . [ … ]
Would it really be so hard for reporters to make it clear exactly who ’s responsible for blocking these bills ?
Good question .
The only resolution to GOP obstructionism is public outrage , which might encourage the GOP to allow the Senate to start voting on bills again , and which might happen if reporters gave it to us straight .
ORANGE COUNTY , California ( CNN ) --
One of the larger fires in Southern California was deliberately started by someone with apparent knowledge of arson , a fire official said Thursday .
Firefighter Luke Perisin sets a backfire Wednesday against the Santiago Fire in Live Oak Canyon , California .

The Santiago Fire in Orange County was started in two places along a little - traveled road , according to Chief Chip Prather of the county 's fire authority .
The fire , which has burned more than 25,000 acres , was started in brush just off Santiago Canyon Road , not close to homes .
It spread rapidly , indicating the arsonist had some knowledge of winds and other factors .
" It is a confirmed arson .
There was evidence found at the scene .
That is the purpose of our early declaration of it being an arson- caused fire , " Prather said .
He would not describe the evidence .
Watch how the evidence points to arson »
Prather said officials originally thought the fire had three points of origin instead of two .
The Santiago Fire 's points of origin are considered crime scenes , said Jim Amornino , a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff 's Department .
The reward for information leading to an arrest has increased to $ 250,000 -- $ 50,000 each from the governor 's office , the U.S. agency of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , and the FBI , Prather said .
KFI radio has chipped in another $ 100,000 , the sheriff 's department said .
The state established a toll - free arson tip line at 800 - 540-7085 .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said anyone convicted of arson would be dealt with harshly .
If a suspect is to be found , " it 's going to be by a clue from the public , " said county Sheriff Mike Corona .
About 1,100 firefighters were working on controlling the Santiago Fire , which has destroyed at least 22 structures , according to Orange County Fire Battalion Chief Kris Concepcion .
The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the fire was only 30 percent contained Thursday morning after being 50 percent contained the day before .
Watch the Santiago flames rage »
The motive of the Santiago Fire 's arsonist was a mystery to Concepcion .
" That 's the part that I really can't figure out , to tell you the truth , " he told CNN .
" That individual knew on Sunday when this fire started that we had , really , the perfect storm , if you will .
We had the heavy Santa Ana winds , we had the low relative humidities , we had the high temperatures .
" And then for someone to even think about doing something as reprehensible as starting a fire where they knew the fire would grow as rapidly as it would -- traveling about three , 3 ½ miles in about an hour -- is just really absolutely unconscionable , " he said .
The smaller Rosa Fire in Riverside County , 100 percent contained at 411 acres Thursday morning , was also probably arson , state officials said .
Meanwhile , Los Angeles Fire Department investigators are looking into whether a man who was arrested on suspicion of arson in the San Fernando Valley may have had a role in any of the ongoing blazes , an L.A. police spokeswoman said .
Catalino Pineda , 41 , was arrested Wednesday , Officer Kate Lopez told CNN .
Witnesses told police they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside in the West Hills area of San Fernando -- northwest of Los Angeles -- then walking away , Lopez said .
Pineda was already on probation for " making excessive false emergency reports " to police at the time of the arrest , Lopez said .
His bail has been set at $ 75,000 , she said .
The fire he allegedly set was brought under control , but now authorities want to find out if he had any role in the other wildfires .
In San Bernardino County , John Alfred Rund , 48 , was arrested Tuesday evening and charged with setting a small fire along a rural roadside near Victorville .
Rund was to be arraigned Thursday morning in Victorville .
He was being held in lieu of $ 750,000 bail .
The county 's district attorney 's office on Thursday also filed arson charges against Anthony Riperti , 47 , of Redlands .
A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire .
He is being held on $ 250,000 bail and will be arraigned later Thursday .
The San Diego County Sheriff 's Department also arrested an adult and a juvenile accused by an anonymous tipster of starting a fire in Vista in the northern part of the county .
In a written statement , the sheriff 's department identified the adult as Gorgonio Nava .
The Vista Fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control , the statement said .
Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley Fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson , and a preliminary investigation into the cause of the 10,152 - acre Slide Fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor , sheriff 's spokeswoman Cindy Beaver said .

Mr Mohammed was jailed even though his ' victim ' was still alive
A Supreme Court official confirmed on Wednesday that Malik Taj Mohammed had been the victim of a " huge injustice " .
He proved his innocence when it was discovered that his " murder victim " was serving a jail sentence for theft .
Lawyers say the case is exceptional , even though false charges in criminal cases are often made in Pakistan .
Mock burial
The chief justice ordered Mr Mohammed 's immediate release and told a lower court to carry out an inquiry to identify those officials responsible for wrongly incarcerating him .
A court official told the BBC that the victim , Malkani Bibi , was believed to have been murdered during a property dispute between relatives a few years ago , and a case was registered against Malik Taj Mohammed .
The official told the BBC that the accused had been convicted by a lower court of murder , and had been languishing in jail for the past three years .
Mr Mohammed told the chief justice that his " opponents " had even gone so far as to perform a mock burial of Ms Bibi , the official said .
Mr Mohammed informed the court that the " murdered " woman had in fact been arrested in another case and is currently serving a sentence in a prison in the city of Gujrat .
The chief justice ordered to the police to present her before him , and she was located and brought before the court .
After verifying the facts , he ordered the release of Mr Mohammed with immediate effect , and said the inquiry should establish whether he was entitled to any compensation .
Human rights activists have welcomed the ruling .
Has technology , particularly citizen media , played any positive role in covering the the crisis in Kenya ?
This is what White African wrote about the role of technology in the crisis :
If anyone doubts the power of the internet in Africa , they need to look no further than what is happening in Kenya right now …
As of yesterday there was a media blackout .
The only way to get any up - to - date news for the past 24 - 48 hours has been through the blogosphere ( like Kenyan Pundit , Thinker ’s Room , Mentalacrobatics ) , Skype and Kenyan populated forums ( like Mashada ) .
The traditional media has been shut out and shut down for all intents and purposes .
If you visit Kenyan blogs aggregators , KenyaUnlimited and Mashada , you will see the point White Africa is trying to make .
Below is a round - up of conversations , information and news from Kenyan citizen journalists blogging about this unfortunate political and social crisis .
Blogger Panda Shuka describes the situation :
People are being burnt alive .
Homes are being torched in daylight .
Shops are closed .
TV and Radio have been in a blackout .
Kisumu City has been shut down by KPLC , no one can access Electricity .
Tomatoes are going for 20/= a single one in my estate .
Eggs are 15/= for a single one .
Buses are charging 100/ = for my usual 20/= journey .
My brother and sister have moved away from our upcountry home because they are scared .
Mum and dad are staying with policemen in the house .
My friends are asking for airtime in kakamega and Kisumu .
9 people were slaughtered near my upcountry home ….
and their cows taken !
Women are being raped .
Children have no food .
What the hell is going on ?
Latest from Kenyan Pundit :
Not much to report as yet .
– The president has called a meeting of all MPs at State House at 3:00 pm
– For those who are asking about a military intervention or the Karamajong militia in Eldoret – I have been unable to confirm those stories .
According to Kenyan Pundit , his life was under threat :
I do have it from reliable sources within the diplomatic community that Kivuitu ’s life was threatened leaving him with no choice .
There are also claims that Kibaki is under siege by his cronies and has no control over the situation .
– Been watching footage of the situation in Eldoret and keep wondering where the police , military are ?
You ca n’t get access to city mortuary because there are like 60 guys guarding it , but vigilantes have set up 30 roadblocks on the Eldoret road – what the hell is going on ?
Red Cross Kenya is asking for donations :
- How to help ?
Red Cross Kenya is asking for donations of food , blankets , and blood .
The chairman of the Electoral Commission of Kenya , Samuel Kivuitu , has admitted to announcing the results under pressure :
Kivuitu admits to acting under pressure .
The story was apparently up on the Standard website , but is no longer available there ( have n’t verified this ) [ edit – article available on the standard here , and on Youtube here ] .
Just in case , save the text somewhere .
How was he compromised ?
Why could n’t he have resigned ?
Why did n’t he just let them collect the certificate by force ?
When he was cracking jokes at the swearing in ceremony he certainly did not look like he was surprised or acting under duress .
This sounds like some serious backsliding of a man with a guilty conscience to me – he did not , for whatever reason , anticipate the magnitude of his actions or he was paid to throw this thing … who the hell knows , but this change of heart will not absolve him from the fact that he ( along with other so - called leaders ) abdicated his duties and has the blood of thousands of innocent Kenyans on his hands .
The conflict , which was initially described as Kikuyu vs. Luo has turned into something else :
For now it is critical to get the word out about the situation in Eldoret and Burnt Forest .
This is in the aftermath of the church burning .
Reports of armed men going into the forest coming through from various sources .
The conflict is more than just Kikuyu - Luo – has – widened into something that I do n’t even know how to describe .
Disturbing reports from Kenyan Pundit readers :
From a KP reader :
“ Approximately 40 - 50 K people are holded up at the compounds of ST .
PATRICKS CATHOLIC CHURCH and ARNESENS HIGH SCHOOLl , both in Burnt Forest .
There is no running water , food and ELECTRICITY has been cut .
THIS MEANS THAT PEOPLE CANNOT RECHARGE THIER CELL PHONES and soon we ’ll not be able to contact them .
Also , due to the chaos / anarchy in these compounds , means that people , especially women are not any safer than if they were out in the chaos .
There has been reports of rapes and molestations .
I ’ve also heard that the Eldoret highway has been closed by thugs an d that there is no transportion , hence people cannot leave this area .
My family in that area feels very helpless and we can only ask that we spread the world and try and get some security in the area . ”
Other ( unverified ) news from KP readers :
– Military set to take over tomorrow .
– Forced circumcisions in Buru Buru area .
About 20 so far .
5 people have bled to death as a result .
Good job Al Jazeera :
I really really have to commend Al Jazeera for their coverage of this situation .
I hope someone picks this up as a story about alternative media and coverage of Africa , and a story about Al Jazeera is redefining GLOBAL coverage .
They are millions of steps ahead of CNN and BBC with less resources .
From a good source , I hear that they are posting stories directly to Youtube so please check there for new stories as well .
Gathara writes ,
Who cares ? :
Q : What happens when an unstoppable demagogue meets with an immovable election thief ?
A : Kenyans die !
“ Kibaki will not survive this , ” writes Joseph Karoki :
It can truly be said that Kibaki and his clique of powerful , rich friends never anticipated the events that would unfold in the country as a result of their cumbersome 3rd grade rigging and subsequent swearing in at State House as if they were swearing in a house Prefect at Karagoyo Secondary School .
No foreign dignitaries , in the cover of darkness , no independent news media and a Chief Justice ready to initiate a ceremony without the results .
It has become clear to the world that this poorly orchestrated exercise was inevitable , a desperate act by a desperate man jostling to cling to a Presidency taken away by the people .
Kibaki will not survive this .
Is this the beginning of guerilla warfare in Kenya ?
There are unverified reports that Karamojong guerilla fighters have arrived in Eldoret to join the fight against Kibaki ’s regime :
GRACE EMAILED THIS TO ME ** UNVERIFIED ** BUT SOUNDS AUTHENTIC
This is a VERY important piece of information below .
I think we now now what the two C - 130 ’s that landed at Eldoret airport were carrying .
There were carrying Karamajong .. the ones who are herding the 70,000 people into Burnt Forest and doing all the killing .
Please see below …..
A contingent of Karamojong guerrilla fighters are reported to have arrived in Eldoret town to join the struggle against Kibaki dictatorship .
They are reported to have crossed Moi ’s bridge to join forces fighting in the region .
It is not yet clear how the guerrillas arrived in Eldoret but a source on the ground has told KSB that their arrival could signal the beginning of a guerrilla war - fare in Kenya to counter attacks by armed GSU forces which have been killing people .
“ People are getting frustrated and beginning to understand that on a long term , the anti-Kibaki war will not be fought with bare hands when security forces are armed ” , said the source .
“ Security forces also need to begin dying and this will not happen with bare hands ” , the source said .
The guerrillas are reported to be remnants of the Shifta militia which were fighting the regime of former dictator Daniel arap Moi during the eighties .
Andrius Kulikauskas from WorkNets has left a comment on one of our posts about a project they are working on to offer help in Kenya .

Lovely Money asks ,
Who will save Kenya ? :
“ From what ? ” I hear you ask .
The burning of women and children in a church in Eldoret makes it hard for anyone to ignore the going - ons in Kenya in the aftermath of the just concluded general elections .
For centuries communities in Kenya have lived in harmony , albeit with a few skirmishes .
Side by side we have built our nation into one of the most admirable and looked upon country in Africa
So what went wrong ?
What exactly is our problem ?
Why are Kenyans turning on each other .
Neighbor upon neighbor .
Our friends have turned into foes
Reading online comments and blog posts about the on - going election violence just shows how fragmented we are as a nation .
What has happened in the last few days cannot be wished away .
I 'm not sure how long it will take the nation to heal itself from the wounds of tribal bigotry .
The solution to this crisis lies in the hands of Kenyans themselves :
While everyone is looking up to the international community to resolve the impasse , I believe it is only Kenyans who can bring the situation to an end .
The US and the EU governments will not put to an end the tribal animosity that we are witnessing in Kenya .
Only Kenyans will save themselves from other Kenyans .
The outcome of the presidential elections will not matter after we have annihilated our compatriots .
Afromusing writes about the situation in Eldoret where people have been seeking refuge in churches and police stations :
- hi everyone , in Eldy , lots of tension though it has eased as it is daylight now , some people sought refuge in churches and police station last night and are still there this a.m saw some people carrying their belongings , will upload pics shortly if i can .
Yesterday , saw a mob of youth >300 crossing through farms , walking in a single file line .
They later walked back after a few hrs .
Later in Kapsoya there were screams and people milling around .
- Just received an SMS from Safaricom that reads
“ The ministry if Internal security urges you to please desist from sending or forwarding any SMS that may cause public unrest .
This may lead to your prosecution ”
- Continued media ban on live broadcasts
- Houses were burned in the last two days , things seem calmer now , though in Langas , people are still fighting and supposedly even more killed last night .
Talked to a guy who lives there , says the leaders need to come there , one rep of the following languages : Luhya , Kalenjin , Kikuyu , put up a white flag and appeal for peace .
“ Radio appeals do nothing to calm that particular part of Eldoret ” .
In addition people ’s heads are supposedly lying about and it is terrible .
Odeg blogs about the human face of statistics :
• so it seems clear that Raila got some 4.25 million votes to Kibakis 3.76 million .
those are statistics .
the reality is that Raila got 4.24 something million and my vote !
but Kenyans do n't seem to agree on any numbers .
even in eldoret some say 200 pple were burnt , others say 30 while some 50 .
in kisumu , the armed police , whom pple say are from uganda have shot dead more than 40 people .
still stats .
in mombasa 8 people were burnt to death in their houses .
stats stats stats .
but yesterday , i was able to put a face or faces to the stories .
i met real people whom had been affected by the violence occasioned by Kibaki 's robbery of the otherwise peaceful election .
the story was grim .
these guys were dragged out of their houses in the dead of the night .
they were told to choose to either join the ‘ revolution ’ or face death .
Bridges in some parts of Kenya have been blown , another blogger reports :
… another friend called me from lugari , she said the bridges in the area had been blown and so she could not get to eldoret from her village .
the village is one of the most cosmopolitan in the country since its a settlement scheme .
she said her neighbours , friends and even relatives whose IDs showed them belonging to either Kikuyu , Kisii or bukusu communities were asked to leave and go to central kenya .
their houses were then burnt indiscriminately .
in that area , the protestors are mainly kalenjin and pokots who as opposed to luos , have AK - 47s and in kisumu another very long time friend of mine escaped death by the breadth of a hair when a live bullet landed just a few inches from her feat .
she had missed the bullet when she fell out of fear .
and you wont believe where that was ; at the gate of St. Theresa 's cathedral church in Kibuye .
the poor lady had gone to church .
yesterday morning on new year she found several bodies right in front of her gate .
Jesse Masai reports heavy fighting in Uasin Gishu and Trans Nzoia :
• Heavy fighting in Uasin Gishu and parts of Trans Nzoia
– Aunt and family have been missing 3 days
– Information blackout terrifying .
Media friend says hands tied by government
– In Kiptoy , Mitoni Mbili , etc , in Cherangany , people locked in their houses overnight , some reportedly burning .
No security presence .
– Psalm 29:10 – The LORD sitteth upon the flood ; yea , the LORD sitteth king for ever .
The Kenyan Army needs to save the county , observes Mimmiz :
The Army needs to come out with a mission to save Kenya from anarchy .
I understand there are concerns about a divided army .
I do n't think this would come up unless their orders were anything but to enforce a curfew and apprehend anyone walking around armed with machetes or any such thing .
I strongly believe that just their presence should knock some sense into many deliriously angry people out in the streets causing chaos .
Kenya's army can very easily handle this situation .
She supports the media blackout :
As for the media blackout , I support it and I may be the only one .
The one thing that country does n't need right now is the media advertizing where crowds of violence are gathered so that other small crowds know where to merge and escalate issues .
If you have relatives in any potential danger , this may make sense to you .
In the future , Kenya must educate the masses .
About peace .
And about how to evaluate issues and options and how to fight effectively without being the ultimate loser ( mind wars vs bloody ones ) .
Africa tells the same story over and over again .
In the mid 1990s , the wealthy Rwandese were in Kenya and other viable African countries , their children in school with some of us .
Many of the wealthy got away even in that situation .
We claim we are fighting for the poor , but what happens is we cleanse ourselves of them and pick up with the same issues where we left off .
She calls on bloggers to write responsibly :
We the bloggers ?
Many who have become the source of information need to become very responsible with our posts .
It would be foolish to think that an already incited population is not picking on what we 're saying and that we 're not helping to fuel emotions .
Hopefully , we can all ( perhaps with the exception of one Gerald Baraza ) promote peace and helpfully suggest how that may be achieved .
Do you remember 1982 ?:
30 hours after I send a frantic SMS : “ Are you ok ? ” Finally , a phone call .
The line is unclear , my family sound as though they are underwater .
Suddenly , the idea of being “ drowned ” in violence sounds more than metaphorical .
My mother asks , “ Do you remember 1982 ? ” It ’s one of the few sentences I can understand .
I want to tell her no .
Or , that I was too young to understand .
But memories consist of more than facts .
I remember 1982 as dark and uncertain — as a threat that hangs over all my political imaginings .
To be national , I learned , was to live without certainty .
1982 always infantilizes me .
I answer , “ a little bit . ”
But , there is something different to this call .
Once , in the midst of other clashes , when I was still away , I wondered if she ’d leave the country , move somewhere safer .
Stubbornly , she replied that she could not leave a country for which her father had fought and been imprisoned .
Now , she tells me she is considering leaving , will know more in a few days .
More than anything , this scares me .
It terrifies me , a lot .
The Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs has called for a legal solution to the problem , but Kenyan Jurist sees the problem as both legal and political :
I have just watched Hon Martha Karua , the Minister for Justice and Constitutional Affairs give a press conference .
The fact that she is close to HE Mwai Kibaki seems to give an indication of what the GoK position is .
First , she is irked by the fact that some Commissioners could express doubt on the results as certified by the ECK .
Secondly , she is very clear that any dispute regarding election results should be resolved by the court and the courts alone .
In view of what I have stated previously , she is wrong to think that the solution to the current problem is only legal .
The problem is both legal and political .
It is about legality and legitimacy .
Its about justice .
The EU and Commonwealth Observers have cast doubt on the election outcome .
Some ECK Commissioners have also cast doubt on the whole process .
In court , there is always a winner and a lose .
The current situation needs no winner and losers and the court may be the institution least able to resolve the impasse if left to its own devices .
According to Kumekucha , the swearing in ceremony was organised before the results were known :
One of the things the first blundering Kibaki administration will always be remembered for is incompetence .
This clearly came out in the just concluded general election because the administration failed to even rig the general election competently without getting caught and left behind too much evidence forensic and otherwise .
It is now emerging that the swearing in ceremony was conducted minutes after the election “ results ” were read .
Meaning that it had been organized well in advance and guests invited and seated , even before the general election results were known .
There are even disturbing suggestions that it may have been done before the results were announced !
Those suggesting this point to the swearing in footage which was done outdoors in relatively broad daylight and yet the results were read late in the day as it was getting dark .
In 2002 the swearing in ceremony was done a day after the results were officially announced but this time there was a big hurry .
Update from Thinker ’s Room :
• More about the burnt church in Eldoret .
There are conflicting stories as to the number of people that were inside .
Numbers are ranging from 50 to 250
• There is looming fuel shortage in most petrol stations in Nairobi
• The unrest in Kenya is affecting Uganda as well .
( Uganda , being landlocked , gets a lot of its supplies from Kenya ) .
Fuel stations in Uganda are running out of fuel .
• Goods are being held at the port at the request of buyers for fear that they will be looted / destroyed en route .
• Samuel Kivuitu , ECK chairman has made some interesting comments on TV
1 . He was under intense pressure to make the announcement
2 . He contemplated resignation but felt that he would be perceived as a coward
3 . He claimed that the ECK had no legal standing to act on the objections of the political parties ( Which I do n’t buy , especially the discrepancy between results announced at constituency level and those at the KICC )
4 . He made an even more fascinating statement about presidency being very challenging , and then proceeding to say that the problem was some of the people around the presidency .
He culminated by saying that some of the people around the presidency should never have been born

January 19 , 2008
Day by day our civil liberties are eroded in a purposeful campaign to turn this country into a police state .
They start with pretending that seat belt laws are designed for safety , when it really just gives the police another reason to pull you over .
Same goes for cell phone laws .
Then they place cameras at red lights to generate revenue without applying any resources .
We all sit silent .
I have heard the flawed logic that says , “ Well , I do n’t break the law , so why would it bother me ? ”
The issue is not whether you feel you break the law , it is the power you concede to others to interpret if THEY feel you are breaking the law .
Perhaps the most egregious violations of our civil liberties happen every day when the very people we pay to protect us , instead are killing us .
The new weapon of choice is the Taser .
Designed to pump electricity into a human being , the Taser has been used inappropriately , and has resulted in the deaths of innocents across this country for far too long now .
It is time to remove this weapon from the arsenal of police officers who do not deserve to wear the badges they have .
I say innocents because even though the police have forgotten ; this country is based upon the concept that we are INNOCENT until proven guilty .
Thus ANY person killed while being arrested was killed while innocent and their death ensures they will be buried innocent as well .
Perhaps the flaw at the heart of this problem is that the police seem to operate on the opposite premise .
They presume that everyone is a perp ( perpetrator ) , until proven innocent .
They no longer work to protect the citizenry , but rather to ensure they are alive at the end of the day , regardless of whether we are or not .
Obviously , this is not meant as a broad brush stroke as generalizations are dangerous .
I am sure there are plenty of decent honest police professionals but their insistence to silence in the face of what their peers do makes them complicit .
It is time to put a human face on the death toll and the spin .
Mark Backlund was a 29 year old citizen of this country .
He had a family , parents , a sister , and a 2 year old son .
To my knowledge , he had no record of wrongs in his life .
He just was an American who had a bright future until January 15th of this year found him in a car accident during rush hour on a Minnesota highway .
By all reports the accident was nothing major but the state police who responded to it apparently did not like the way Mr. Backlund responded to them .
The exact quote from the police was that Mr. Backlund was “ uncooperative ” after the accident .
So they killed him .
I know that sounds harsh but the police in question decided that the best way to deal with an “ uncooperative ” citizen was to send electricity through his body .
He died later in the hospital when his heart stopped .
Even if Mr. Backlund was “ uncooperative ” ; did he deserve to be killed by the police ?
The man was simply on his way to pick up his parents from the airport and now he is dead .
Is mere disagreement or dissent with law enforcement required to be dealt with by killing the person ?
Here is another example of a citizen who merely disagreed with a state police officer ; this time in Utah .
Jared Massey is a 28 - year old telephone company worker who was stopped by the Utah State Police on September 14 , 2007 .
Here is a video taken from the dashboard of the offending officer :
http://youtube.com/watch?v=IMaMYL_shxc
The sheer arrogance of this officer is staggering and is a microcosm of the problem we are facing .
Even those being arrested have rights .
It appears that all Massey was trying to ascertain was why he was pulled over , which is his right as an American .
The officer tried to claim speeding but refused to offer what speed Massey was traveling at .
In fact , when he first addresses Massey , the officer clearly said that he “ felt ” he was traveling a bit fast .
Massey was correctly astonished when the officer pulled his taser on him and shot him full of electricity .
The officer than proceeds to terrorize the family in the car as well and tries to change the story to Massey “ not listening to him ” or “ not following his instructions . ”
Specifically , Massey was refusing to sign the citation for speeding because he did not believe he had been speeding .
For that , the brave officer shoots him with the taser and then brags about it to his partner later in the video .
Toward the end you can hear the officer saying “ he took a ride on the taser ” and then mocked Massey by saying , “ painful , is n’t it ? ”
Further explaining to his partner , the officer reveals what really caused him to taser this citizen , “ He wanted to be in charge . ”
His partner simply replies , “ Good for you . ”
He wanted to be in charge .
Guess the officer showed him who was in charge .
Massey is still pursuing resolution to the incident but at least he survived .
Mark Backlund was not so lucky .
Neither were many other Americans who have been tasered over the past several years .
You can do a simple Google search and find any number of horror stories of American citizens being tasered by an out of control police force .
The initial rationale for giving police these weapons was that they were allegedly going to be used to avoid having to use deadly force not to persuade or control behavior .
Well , the experiment has failed America and it has failed miserably .
If you doubt that , just review the video above where Mr. Massey was tasered because the officer felt he “ wanted to be in charge . ”
“ Taking a ride on the taser ” is what this brave officer said .
If you have any doubts , go ask the 2 year old child of Mark Backlund what he thinks now that his father has been killed by the very people paid to protect him .
Please , save me the sob stories about how difficult it is to be a police officer .
In researching this story I came across stories that would make your stomach turn even more .
A six year old boy being tasered .
A nine year old girl who was already in handcuffs being tasered .
A pregnant woman being tasered .
I would proffer that any officer that cannot figure out how to diffuse or subdue a child , a pregnant woman , or even an uncooperative man without tasering them , does not deserve to wear the badge .
If the job is that difficult for you , then find another job .
Further , the communities that pay the offending officers in these situations should demand justice .
Mark Backlund was murdered ; plain and simple .
Jared Massey faced attempted murder ; plain and simple .
The fact that the perpetrators wore uniforms should irrelevant .
They are supposed to adhere to the law as well .
They should be prosecuted and be sent to jail if convicted ; plain and simple .
Is the Surge Working ?
Ask the Data , Not the Politicians
One of the most important political questions of the day is whether the troop surge in Baghdad is working .
If you ask politicians , the answer you get to that question is very predictable .
Republicans say yes , Democrats say no .
What do the data have to say about this question ?
Michael Greenstone , an M.I.T. professor , good friend , and one of the best young economists in the world , has just released an incredibly thorough and thoughtful analysis of the impact of the surge .
He finds the answer is mixed .
On at least one dimension , there is strong evidence of progress .
The data clearly suggest that deaths of civilians in Baghdad have fallen , and there is no evidence that the crackdown in Baghdad has shifted violence to the rest of the country .
Coalition troop fatalities have been stable since the surge , which in some ways signifies progress since they were on a steady upward trend prior to the surge .
The surge does not seem to have helped in other dimensions such as the amount of oil produced or hours of electricity in Baghdad .
The most interesting part of Greenstone ’s paper is his analysis of the pricing of Iraqi government debt .
The Iraq government has issued bonds in the past .
These entitle the owner of the bond to a stream of payments over a set period of time , but only if the government does not default on the loan .
If Iraq completely implodes , it is highly unlikely that these bonds will be paid off .
How much someone would pay for the rights to that stream of payments depends on their estimate of the probability that Iraq will implode .
The bond data , unlike the other sources he examines , tell a clear story : the financial markets say the surge is not working .
Since the surge started , the market ’s estimate of the likelihood of default by the Iraqi government has increased by 40 percent .
I have a few thoughts after reading Greenstone ’s work :
1 . This paper shows how good economic analysis can contribute in a fundamental way to public policy .
Anyone who reads Greenstone ’s article will recognize that it is careful and thorough .
It is even - handed and apolitical .
It combines state - of - the - art data analysis techniques with economic logic ( e.g. , using market prices to draw conclusions about how things are going ) .
2 . Top economists like Greenstone virtually never write papers like this .
The simple reason is that this sort of work is not rewarded in our profession .
Academic economists are judged by the papers they publish in peer - reviewed journals .
The lag time between submission to these journals and publication is often two or more years .
By that time , no one will be interested in the surge , so editors wo n’t want to publish the paper .
Consequently , good economists do n’t think it is worth their while to do topical work like this .
3. Instead , this sort of analysis tends to be done by bad economists , or economists on the payroll of special interests .
These reports might appear informative , but instead are often pure propaganda .
To outsiders , it is difficult to determine what is careful analysis like Greenstone has produced versus the usual junk .
4 . The internet can potentially solve both problems ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) above , leading to an increased supply of good , timely analysis .
If people like Greenstone can immediately get their findings into the public debate through the internet , it gives a real purpose ( not just an academic one ) to doing the work .
In addition , there are now online peer - reviewed academic journals that have greatly sped the time from submission to publication , potentially increasing the academic payoff to someone like Greenstone .
With many respected economists now blogging , there is also a vehicle for these folks to weigh in on the quality of policy - related economic writings — like I am doing in this blog post .
Do Limbaugh 's followers share his despair for the GOP ?
Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday January 22 , 2008

Print This Email This Conservative talk radio pundit Rush Limbaugh has been finding it easier to identify candidates he dislikes in the Republican presidential primaries than anyone he might support .
Some analysts even believe that Mike Huckabee 's disappointing third - place finish in the Michigan primary was a result of Limbaugh 's constant claims that Huckabee is not a true conservative and that his nomination could destroy the Republican Party .
Now Limbaugh has gone a step further , telling his listeners that he's not too fond of McCain either and that " I can see possibly not supporting a Republican nominee " because " you do n't have a genuine down - the - list conservative . "
A political blog at the Los Angeles Times found reason for merriment in Limbaugh 's admission .
Blogger Andrew Malcolm wrote , " Across the country , people were dropping their coffee cups , choking on sandwiches , fainting and driving off the road .
The king of conservative talk - radio not supporting the Republican nominee ? ... ' And I never thought that I would say that in my life .
This stuff is very tough . '
No kidding .
Who'd a thought ?
It 's tough enough just listening to him go through this , let alone live it like he is . "
However , Limbaugh 's actual followers seemed far less fazed by his confession than liberals might have imagined .
One conservative blogger wrote approvingly of Limbaugh 's position , saying , " It s heartening to know that such a prominent conservative is willing to stand on principle and not act as a cheerleader for whoever the eventual GOP nominee is .
A pro-Romney blogger agreed with Limbaugh that both McCain and Huckabee " are trying to redefine Republican and Conservatism " and was delighted by Limbaugh 's statement that " it 's easier for me to support a Romney than a McCain , for example .
Because I believe his conversion is genuine . "
Even a blogger who took issue with Limbaugh 's position did so in temperate terms , merely complaining that " One doesnt have to pretend Romney or McCain or whomever is the second coming of Ronald Reagan to decide youd rather have him running the executive branch than Hillary Clinton . "
Limbaugh himself was not enthusiastic about any of the Republican candidates , even Romney , concluding that " it 's going to come down to which guy do we dislike the least . "
Police in the Tuscan city of Prato said the man shot his 82 - year - old wife , who had Alzheimer 's disease , three times in full view of medical staff .
The man told police he did it because he could not stand to see her suffer .
His wife had been diagnosed eight years ago with the degenerative and irreversible brain disorder , which causes dementia and eventually death .
It is estimated that 2 - 5 % of people over 65 years of age and up to 20 % of those over 85 suffer from the disease .
The man , whose name has not been released by the police , entered the hospital ward where his wife was being treated at around 1730 on Saturday , according to the Italian newspaper , La Stampa .
He then took out a pistol and shot her twice in the head and once in the chest .
Afterwards , he placed the weapon in the corner of the room and awaited the police , La Stampa reported .
++03 has a very limited set of tools for enforcing constraints on templates .
Consequently , templates code becomes messy , unintelligible , and buggy .
With the addition of concepts to C++09 , this unsavory state of affairs is about to change radically .
Learn what concepts are and they can simplify template design and implementation .
You 're designing a template , but can't find a simple and consistent way to specify usage policies and enforce constraints .
Consequently , your template code becomes cluttered up and bug - prone .
Use concepts to enforce usage policies on templates .
This will also allow the compiler catch usage violations earlier , and issue clearer diagnostics .
As leaders in Washington turn their attention to efforts to avert a looming downturn , many economists suggest that it may already be too late to change the course of the economy over the first half of the year , if not longer .
With a wave of negative signs gathering force , economists , policy makers and investors are debating just how much the economy could be damaged in 2008 .
Huge and complex , the American economy has in recent years been aided by a global web of finance so elaborate that no one seems capable of fully comprehending it .
That makes it all but impossible to predict how much the economy can be expected to fall before it stabilizes .
The answer could be a defining factor in the outcome of the fiercely contested presidential election .
Not long ago , the race centered on the war in Iraq .
But now , as candidates fan out across the country , visiting places as varied as the factory towns of Michigan and streets lined with unsold condominiums in Las Vegas , voters are increasingly demanding that they focus on the best way to keep the economy from slipping off the tracks .
Women have fought for decades to be treated as men's equals .
Yet today 's girls are being told that female empowerment simply comes from being ' sexy ' , according to a new book by the managing editor of the Harvard Law Review .
In Prude : How The Sex - Obsessed Culture Damages Girls , Carol Platt Liebau says popular culture is undermining girls ' sense of worth in their most vulnerable , formative years and glorifying destructive behaviour .
' The overwhelming lesson teenagers are now learning from the world around them is that being " sexy " is the ultimate accolade , trumping intelligence , character and all other accomplishments at every stage of a woman 's life , ' said Liebau , a political analyst and the review 's first female managing editor .
' The new female imperative is that it is only through promiscuity and sexual aggression that girls can achieve admiration and recognition . '
She cites films such as Cruel Intentions and Mean Girls , the music and videos of Britney Spears , Christina Aguilera and Lil ' Kim , and advertisements such as the dominatrix - themed campaign for the teenage fashion house bebe , featuring Mischa Barton .
' In a culture that celebrates Paris Hilton , thong underwear and songs like " My Humps " - where the female singer expounds the sexual magnetism of her breasts and buttocks - there 's scant recognition or respect for female modesty or achievement that is n't coupled with sex appeal , ' she adds .
' Girls are being led to believe they 're in control when it comes to sexual relationships , ' she continues .
' But they 're actually living in a profoundly anti-feminist landscape where girls compete for attention on the basis of how much they are sexually willing to do for the boys . '
Liebau 's book has won support from feminists , including Ariel Levy , whose book Female Chauvinist Pigs denounced what Levy termed a ' raunch culture ' that , she said , compels young women to ' compete to look like slags and sluts ' .
Although Levy was writing about women older than those concerning Liebau , she agrees that the age at which girls are being influenced by the raunch culture is falling .
' Even young girls are the willing , active and conscious participants in a tawdry , tarty , cartoon - like version of female sexuality , ' she says .
In Prude , to be published in Britain by Centre Street Books this month , Liebau questions how society has created a climate in which being raunchy is believed to make girls look cool and in which being called a ' slut ' is considered preferable to being labelled a ' prude ' .
' By most measures , young women have never had it better .
Given the breathtaking opportunities before them and the magnificent advantages they enjoy , it seems Western society has treated young girls with enormous generosity .
And in many ways , it has .
But not all the changes have been to the good , ' she adds .
' Today girls are forced to navigate a minefield more challenging , difficult and pressure - filled than ever before when it comes to sex .
Somehow , as society has been revelling the ubiquity of sex , the very real psychological , emotional and physical impact on young girls of giving too much , too soon , has been discounted , ' she said .
Michele Elliott , director of the children 's charity Kidscape , agrees .
She has launched a campaign against the toy makers responsible for items including a junior pole - dancing kit , thongs for young girls emblazoned with the phrase ' Eye candy ' and stationery sets stamped with the bunny logo of Hugh Hefner 's Playboy empire .
In her book , Liebau charts how the same ' creeping sexualising ' of young girls is endemic across a mass media which , she says , constitutes the main source of information about sex for 13 to 15 - year - olds .
' Over the last few decades , the West has experienced an incremental but aggressive sexualising of its culture , ' she says .
' Today there exists a status quo in which almost everything seems focused on what 's going on " below the waist " . '
Although her book has yet to be published in Britain , Liebau is keen to deflect any accusations of prudishness .
' This is about far more than short - term sexual mores , ' she says .
' Living in an overly sexualised culture takes a toll on girls .
The emphasis on sexiness , revealing fashions and the overvaluing of physical appeal creates pressure to measure up to bone - slim models or celebrities and leads to unrealistic expectations among young women about how their own bodies should actually look . '

HO HO HO !
Just like that , the holiday season is upon us !
This year , I intend to do most of my Christmas shopping during a three - week tour of Europe with my cousins .
We 're deliberately visiting as many Christmas markets as possible , so I hope to find a variety of interesting and unusual gifts for my family and friends .
( They need to be small , though .
I do n't have much space to carry things home . )
While I 'm buying new ( and possibly expensive ) gifts this year , that 's not normally my style .
I 'm a fan of keeping Christmas frugal .
Being a frugal shopper does n't mean you can't give thoughtful gifts though .
In fact , my experience has shown that it 's often more fun and rewarding to impose limits on gift - giving .
These limits breed creativity and inspiration .
“ Christmas on a budget ” does n't have to mean “ Christmas without fun ” .
This article contains some smart ways to save money on Christmas gifts while celebrating the season .
( These tips are great for Christmas , for Hanukkah , for Kwanzaa , for Festivus , or for whatever feast you celebrate this time of year . )
It 's an amazing frugal Christmas savings spectacular !
What Kids Really Want for Christmas
I have this idea in my head that kids become mercenaries at Christmas , demanding the newest , most popular toys .
I 'm not sure how I 've arrived at this notion because that 's certainly not how my brothers and I were when we were younger .
Sure , we wanted cool stuff , but we never made demands .
In fact , Dad used to tell the story of how ashamed he was one Christmas when he and Mom were going through a particularly rough patch .
They were always poor and struggling with money , but this year was especially bad .
They could n't afford Christmas presents for us three boys .
Rather than cry about it , we went through the toys we already had , wrapped them up , and gave them to each other .
I have only a dim memory of this myself , but Dad used to talk about it often .
This bit of personal family history reminds me of Unplug the Christmas Machine by Jo Robinson and Jean Coppock Staeheli .
This book urges readers to escape the commercialism of the holiday season , to make it a “ joyful , stress - free ” time for the family .
In a chapter entitled “ The Four Things Children Really Want for Christmas ” , the authors write :
One concern voiced by most parents is that of shielding their children from the excesses of holiday commercialism .
While adults can mute the TV when the ads get annoying , children are defenseless against the onslaught of ads .
As early as the age of four or five , they can lose the ability to be delighted by the sights and sounds of Christmas , only to gain a two - month - long obsession with brand - name toys .
Suddenly , all they seem to care about is how many presents they will be getting and how many days are left until they unwrap them .
Many parents find it a challenge to create a simple value - centered Christmas in the midst of all the commercial pressure .
But the task is made much easier when parents keep in mind the four things that children really want for Christmas .
Robinson and Staeheli argue that children do n't really want clothes and toys and games .
The four things they actually want are :
A relaxed and loving time with the family .
Children need attention .
During the holidays , normal family routines are temporarily set aside for parties , shopping , and special events .
It 's important to slow down and spend quality time with your kids .

An evenly paced holiday season .
The modern Christmas season starts months before December 25th , when the first store displays go up , then things end with a bang on Christmas day .
The authors suggest beginning the season late in the year .
Get out the Christmas music on December 15th , then get the tree on the following weekend .
Schedule some low - key family events during Christmas week .
Stretch the season to New Years Day .

Reliable family traditions .
When I talk to my friends about what Christmas was like when we were children , it 's not the gifts that we remember .
We recall the things we did as a family .
I remember sleeping next to the tree every Christmas eve , but never being able to catch Santa in the act .
I remember seeing the cousins .
I remember decorating the trailer house .
Your kids will remember the traditions , not the gifts .
Because I do n't have kids , I do n't have first - hand experience with their expectations around the holidays .
Other folks in the GRS community do , though .
A reader named PB , for instance , emailed some similar thoughts .
She writes :
We keep our children 's expectations realistic by following an old tradition — that Santa fills the stockings and only the stockings — nothing under the tree .
This limits the size and quantity of gifts .
Plus , because they 're all relatively sure what they can and cannot wheedle out of parents for tree presents , their expectations are kept in check .
We buy one new outfit for each , usually a special piece of clothing that they really want , and spent only about $ 100 per child .
I also shop all year long and get some real bargains .
We also emphasize doing a lot of things with our church — food delivery to the elderly , singing at nursing homes , and service to others .
Our ongoing tradition is a big Christmas eve dinner with lots of friends and then the midnight service , where we all play an instrument or sing in the choir .
This is what the kids talk about — not about what they receive .
It seems that the key to keeping kids happy at Christmas is to manage their expectations .
But what about exchanging gifts with other adults ?
Exchanging Gifts with Adults
Gift - giving among adults can be awkward .
If you spend too much on another person , they may feel uncomfortable .
Worse — and this has become more common the older I get — what if you give something and the other person does n't reciprocate ?
Or they get you something and you give nothing ?
Again : awkward !
Many people welcome the idea of doing away with gift - giving completely .
Some , like my family , establish specific rules .
We 've made a tradition of the $ 5 gift exchange .
We give larger gifts to the kids and to my mother , but the rest of us exchange gifts that cost no more than $ 5 .
It 's become a game to find interesting , thoughtful gifts for just five bucks .
( Or to find amusing , tacky gifts for the same amount . )
The first year we did this , the gifts were kind of lame .
But with time , we 've become more creative .
Once in an antique store , I stumbled upon an old photograph that I recognized as depicting some of my sister - in - law 's relatives , for example .
Other years , I 've discovered awesome gifts at garage sales .
Some people practice a variation of this .
They do a $ 100 holiday , where their entire budget for a particular group ( family , circle of friends , etc. ) is limited to $ 100 , and that money is divided as needed .
Others agree to only give presents to the children in the group .
This relieves the adults of the pressure to buy gifts for each other while still allowing the children to experience the magic of Christmas .
( Of course it could be argued that this is n't the sort of Christmas magic kids should be learning . )
The goal here is n't to be cheap for the sake of cheapness — it's to give thoughtful presents without breaking the bank .
( And , for me , to not participate in the mad rush of consumerism during the holiday season . )
One last important piece of advice : if your family ( or circle of friends ) agrees to gift - giving guidelines , do n't be the person who breaks them .
People feel resentful when one person takes it upon herself to give more than the agreed terms .
Stay within the rules and have fun .
Christmas Gifts That Don't Cost a Lot of Money
For most people , Christmas gifts mean shopping at the mall .
Or Amazon .
But it does n't have to be that way .
Many of the best gifts are n't tangible items purchased from a store .
Here are a few examples :
Give the gift of experience .
People are likely to forget about the things you give them .
They 're much more likely to remember gifts of doing .
Examples : sky diving , scuba lessons , hot - air balloon rides , cooking school , lunch with a hero , etc .
Personal gift certificates also make great gifts .
In essence , these are gifts of time .
Give new parents a gift certificate for a night of baby - sitting so that they can enjoy a night on the town .
Are you good with computers ?
Give your brother - in - law a gift certificate for free computer repairs .

Are you good with computers ?

Similarly , my ex-wife and I used to give each other love coupons .
Sounds sappy , I know .
But it was nice to be able to come home at the end of the day and redeem a coupon for a dinner out , or for a back rub , or for an evening watching a favorite movie .
My favorite gifts tend to be those that people have made themselves .
Homemade gifts demonstrate caring , creativity , and passion .
I 'm fortunate to have many crafty friends .
Every year , I 'm delighted to see what they create for Christmas gifts .
In the past , I 've given or received :
A hand - assembled collection of gourmet salts , complete with written description of each .
Ginger snaps .
Art . ( Do you dabble in photography ?
A framed print of your nephew is a great gift for your sister - in - law . )
Chocolate - dipped hazelnuts ( from a family with a filbert orchard ) .
Home - made jams and jellies .
Flavored liqueur brewed from vodka , sugar , and fresh herbs .
The best - home made gift I 've ever received ?
A couple of years ago , an old friend found a poem I had written for her when we were in high school .
It was a silly ode to a teddy bear scribbled on notebook paper .
She framed the page and gave me a cheap bear .
Believe it or not , that meant a lot to me .
( Yet it was , in essence , I gift I had given myself ! )
Homemade gifts are fun to produce , and are generally more valued by the recipient .
I 'd take a plate of PCCCs ( plain chocolate - chip cookies ) over some plastic gee - gaw any day .
Frugal Christmas Ideas from GRS Readers
This is Get Rich Slowly 's thirteenth Christmas .
Over the years , GRS readers have shared tons of great tips for saving money during the holidays .
Here are a few of my favorites .
First up , Samuel suggests :
Give your favorite things as gifts .
Find items you love and use everyday , then share these with others .
By giving favorite things , the focus is on sharing things you like rather than how much you spent .
For example , my “ favorite thing ” gift this year is a pizza cutter .
It 's an unbelievably useful kitchen gadget !
We use it to cut up everything , not just pizza .
It costs about ten bucks !
Like me , Pam prefers home - made gifts .
She thinks it 's even more fun when these home - made gifts can be personalized :
Do crafts that require the same basic supplies but still remain customizable to the recipient .
Homemade baking mixes are good for this , because with big bags of ingredients you have the bases for several different kinds of baked goods :
Aunt Julie can get oatmeal - raisin and Cousin Larry can get peanut - butter chip with a minimum of tweaking and few extra ingredients .
My all - time favorite , though , is marble magnets , which require absolutely minimal supply ( florist 's gems , silicon glue , a scissor or craft punch , old magazines ) , offer tons of opportunity for personalization ( I do cartoon images for my boyfriend , the letters of their names for my little cousins , and flowers for a garden - crazy friend ) , look great packaged in tulle or an Altoids tin , and get much , much cheaper when you make them in bulk .
RJ shares another creative way to keep costs down :
Sometimes when my partner and I exchange cards at Christmas , we 'll include a cut - out image or two of a really expensive gift that we might have liked to buy , but did n't .
For example , a couple of years , he inserted a pic of a $ 175 bottle of scotch , but gave me a perfectly wonderful and less costly ( ~$ 25 ) bottle of a different kind of scotch instead .
This year I 'm giving him a matchbook from a very expensive restaurant in town , though our holiday dinner will actually be at a friend 's house .
It 's our jesting way of reminding each other of the shopping insanity at this time of year , and it helps us appreciate what we do get for the little money we spend .
By now , you probably know that buying experiences tends to make people happier than buying stuff .
Does the same concept apply to gifts ?
Angie thinks it might .
She writes :
My husband and I have a tradition of giving each other experiences for Christmas , rather than more stuff .
This does n't always end up being the cheapest route , but it does keep our house from being cluttered up with extraneous stuff .
For instance , my husband had always wanted to try blowing glass .
An art glass studio opened up a few blocks from our house , and last year at Christmastime they held workshops where you could blow your own glass ornament .
I gifted him two sequential half - hour workshops , at $ 25 apiece — once so he could “ get the hang of it ” , and the second so he could better use his new skills .
( He 's that kinda guy . )
He came home with two beautiful ornaments he made himself , and he absolutely raved about how much fun he'd had .
I saw essentially identical blown - glass ornaments at the local art gallery for about $ 20 apiece .
For a $ 10 premium , I fulfilled his longheld wish and gave him a really awesome memory .
Now that 's a bargain !
Finally , Amberlynn says that the best gifts do n't have to cost anything at all :
My family draws names with a $ 20 limit , but we 're phasing that out for something even better .
We 're writing a chapter of our family history each year .
We pick a topic , and each family member will write about it .
One person plays “ editor ” , collecting the stories together for Christmas .
We 've written about our favorite Christmas ( seven differing perspectives on the same year ) , the house we grew up in , and this year we 're writing about how we met our spouse .
Last year , my Mom sent out her first draft of her entire life history .
This gift costs nothing .
It does take a little time if you want to contribute quality .
It will , however , carry a lasting value unmatched by any tangible gifts we 've exchanged , or even experiential gifts !
Frugality does n't take the joy out of Christmas .
In many ways , it adds to it .
It 's a great feeling to find a perfect gift for only five bucks .
Besides , when I think back to Christmases past , it 's not the gifts I remember , but the time spent with friends and family .
International travelers concerned about being labeled a terrorist or drug runner by secret Homeland Security algorithms may want to be careful what books they read on the plane .
Newly revealed records show the government is storing such information for years .
Privacy advocates obtained database records showing that the government routinely records the race of people pulled aside for extra screening as they enter the country , along with cursory answers given to U.S. border inspectors about their purpose in traveling .
In one case , the records note Electronic Frontier Foundation co-founder John Gilmore 's choice of reading material , and worry over the number of small flashlights he 'd packed for the trip .
The breadth of the information obtained by the Gilmore - funded Identity Project ( using a Privacy Act request ) shows the government 's screening program at the border is actually a " surveillance dragnet , " according to the group 's spokesman Bill Scannell .
" There is so much sensitive information in the documents that it is clear that Homeland Security is not playing straight with the American people , " Scannell said .
The documents show a tiny slice of the massive airline - record collection stored by the government , as well as the screening records mined for the controversial Department of Homeland Security passenger - rating system that assigns terrorist scores to travelers entering and leaving the country , including U.S. citizens .
The so - called Automated Targeting System scrutinizes every airline passenger entering or leaving the country using classified rules that tell agents which passengers to give extra screening to and which to deny entry or exit from the country .
The system relies on data ranging from the government 's 700,000 - name terrorism watchlist to data included in airline - travel database entries , known as Passenger Name Records , which airlines are required to submit to the government .
According to government descriptions , ATS mines data from intelligence , law enforcement and regulatory databases , looking for linkages in order to identify " high - risk " targets who may not already be on terrorist watchlists .
ATS was started in the late 1990s , but was little known until the government issued a notice about the system last fall .
The government has subsequently modified the proposed rules for the system , shortening the length of time data is collected and allowing individuals to request some information used by the scoring system .
The government stores the PNRs for years and typically includes destinations , phone and e-mail contact information , meal requests , special health requests , payment information and frequent - flier numbers .
The Identity Project filed Privacy
Act requests for five individuals to see the data stored on them by the government .
The requests revealed that the PNRs also included information on one requester 's race , the phone numbers of overseas family members given to the airlines as emergency contact information , and a record of a purely European flight that had been booked overseas separately from an international itinerary , according to snippets of the documents shown to Wired News .
The request also revealed the screening system includes inspection notes from earlier border inspections .
One report about Gilmore notes : " PAX ( passenger ) has many small flashlights with pot leaves on them .
He had a book entitled ' Drugs and Your Rights . ' "
Gilmore is an advocate for marijuana legalization .
Another inspection entry noted that Gilmore had " attended computer conference in Berlin and then traveled around Europe and Asia to visit friends .
100 % baggage exam negative ....
PAX is self employed ' Entrepreneur ' in computer software business . "
" They are noting people 's race and they are writing down what people read , " Scannell said .
It does n't matter that Gilmore was reading a book about drugs , rather than Catcher in the Rye , according to Scannell .
" A book is a book , " Scannell said .
" This is just plain wrong . "
The documents have also turned Scannell against the Department of Homeland Security 's proposal for screening airline passengers inside the United States .
That project , known as Secure Flight , will take watchlist screening out of the hands of airlines , by having the airlines send PNR data to the government ahead of each flight .
While earlier versions included plans to rate passenger 's threat level using data purchased from private companies , DHS now proposes only to compare data in the PNR against names on the watchlist , which largely disarmed civil libertarians ' opposition to the program .
That 's changed for Scannell now , who sees Secure Flight as just another version of ATS .
" They want people to get permission to travel , " Scannell said .
" They already instituted it for leaving and entering the country and now they want to do it to visit your Aunt Patty in Cleveland . "
The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment .
RICHMOND , Va. , Aug. 20 — Michael Vick , the star quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons , has accepted a plea offer from federal prosecutors in a criminal case stemming from a dog- fighting ring that was run from a property Mr. Vick owned .
Mr. Vick will probably face a sentence of at least a year in prison under the deal .
His future in the National Football League appears bleak .
Mr. Vick is expected to formally enter his plea on Aug. 27 .
The United States District Judge overseeing the case , Henry E. Hudson , announced the agreement at a status hearing in the case this afternoon .
Billy Martin , one of Mr. Vick ’s defense lawyers , said in a written statement : “ After consulting with his family over the weekend , Michael Vick asked that I announce today that he has reached an agreement with federal prosecutors regarding the charges pending against him .
Mr. Vick has agreed to enter a plea of guilty to those charges and to accept full responsibility for his actions and the mistakes he has made .
Michael wishes to apologize again to everyone who has been hurt by this matter . ”
« Amici for DC online | Main
Government files amicus -- on DC 's side !
PDF here .
Quick read :
Gov't says , yes , it 's an individual right .
BUT we join with DC in asking Court to reverse the DC Circuit , because it applied strict scrutiny to the DC law .
It should only have applied an intermediate standard .
That is , the legal position of the US is that DC CIrcuit was wrong , a complete ban on handguns is NOT per se unconstitutional , it all depends on how good a reason DC can prove for it .
Some quotes :
" When , as here , a law directly limits the private pos -
session of “ Arms ” in a way that has no grounding in
Framing - era practice , the Second Amendment requires
that the law be subject to heightened scrutiny that con -
siders ( a ) the practical impact of the challenged restric -
tions on the plaintiff ’s ability to possess firearms for
lawful purposes ( which depends in turn on the nature
and functional adequacy of available alternatives ) , and
( b ) the strength of the government ’s interest in enforce -
ment of the relevant restriction .
The court of appeals , by contrast , appears to have
adopted a more categorical approach .
The court ’s deci-
sion could be read to hold that the Second Amendment
categorically precludes any ban on a category of “ Arms ”
that can be traced back to the Founding era .
If adopted
by this Court , such an analysis could cast doubt on the
constitutionality of existing federal legislation prohibit -
ing the possession of certain firearms , including
machineguns .
However , the text and history of the Sec -
ond Amendment point to a more flexible standard of
review . "
: The determi -
nation whether those laws deprive respondent of a func -
tional firearm depends substantially on whether D.C.’s
trigger - lock provision , D.C. Code § 7-2507.02 , can prop -
erly be interpreted ( as petitioners contend , see Br. 56 )
in a manner that allows respondent to possess a func -
tional long gun in his home .
8
And if the trigger - lock pro-
vision can be construed in such a manner , the courts
below would be required to address the factual is -
sue — not fully explored during the prior course of the
litigation — whether the firearms that are lawfully avail -
able to respondent are significantly less suited to the
identified lawful purpose ( self - defense in the home ) than
the type of firearm ( i.e. , a handgun ) that D.C. law bars
respondent from possessing .9
To the extent necessary , further consideration of
those questions should occur in the lower courts , which
would be in the best position to determine , in light of
this Court ’s exposition of the proper standard of review ,
whether any fact - finding is necessary , and to place any
appropriate limits on any evidentiary proceedings .
Moreover , even if the existing record proved to be ade -
quate , initial examination of those issues is typically
better reserved for the lower courts . "
" CONCLUSION
The Court should affirm that the Second Amend -
ment , no less than other provisions of the Bill of Rights ,
secures an individual right , and should clarify that the
right is subject to the more flexible standard of review
described above .
If the Court takes those foundational
steps , the better course would be to remand . "
As I read this , the ( Bush ) Dept of Justice is asking that the Court hold it to be an individual right , but not strike the DC gun law , instead sending it back down to the trial court to take evidence on everything from how much the District needs the law to whether people can defend themselves without pistols and just what the DC trigger lock law means .
THEN maybe it can begin another four year trek to the Supremes .
That is , the DoJ REJECTS the DC Circuit position that an absolute , flat , ban on handguns violates the Second Amendment , and contends that it might just be justified , it all depends on the evidence .
There was a saying during my years in DC that the GOP operated on two principles : screw your friends and appease your enemies .
Yup .
· Parker v. DC
Yep .
And I have soooo had it with the Republican party because of crap like that .
It 's just the kind of thing that really pisses me off .
No !
You can't have it both ways .

Fred Thompson would put a stop to this anti-gun rights DOJ stuff , that 's for sure

It appears that there primary purpose is to protect their pseudo - ban on full auto and other ' destructive devices ' .
They make a good argument , to this layman .
But it falls apart where they argue on one hand that 2A was in part intended to prevent govt .
oppression and then on another that the govt can restrict dangerous arms from the people .
Perhaps our numbers are meant to counteract the standing army 's advantage in firepower ?
Oh and this argument is not intended as a vehicle for arguing the violent overthrow of the govt , but is meant in a purely philosophical manner for purposes of discussing the brief .
( ca n't be tagged as a homegrown terrorist now can I ? )

WASHINGTON - Three decades ago , at the dawn of municipal self - government in the District of Columbia , the city 's first elected mayor and council enacted one of the country 's toughest gun-control measures , a ban on handgun ownership that opponents have long said violates the Second Amendment .
All these years later , with the constitutionality of the ban now probably headed for a US Supreme Court review , a much - debated practical question remains unsettled :
Has a law aimed at reducing the number of handguns in the District made city streets safer ?
Although studies through the decades have reached conflicting conclusions , this much is clear :
The ban , passed with strong public support in 1976 , has not accomplished everything the mayor and council of that era wanted it to .
Over the years , gun violence has continued to plague the city , reaching staggering levels at times .
In making by far their boldest public policy decision , Washington 's first elected officials wanted other jurisdictions , especially neighboring states , to follow the lead of the nation 's capital by enacting similar gun restrictions , cutting the flow of firearms into the city from surrounding areas .
" We were trying to send out a message , " recalled Sterling Tucker , the council chairman at the time .
Nadine Winters , also a council member then , said , " My expectation was that this being Washington , it would kind of spread to other places , because these guns , there were so many of them coming from Virginia and Maryland . "
It did n't happen .
Guns kept coming .
And bodies kept falling .
Opponents of the ban , who won a March ruling in which the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit declared the law unconstitutional , said in a legal filing that the District 's " 31 - year experiment with gun prohibition " has been a " complete failure . "
Meanwhile , D.C. officials , who have asked the Supreme Court to reverse the March decision , say the ban is a legally permissible public - safety measure that has saved lives .
Which side is correct depends on whose social science research is accurate .
Although the city points to research indicating that street violence would have been worse without the law , opponents of the ban cite studies to the contrary .
" It 's a pretty common - sense idea that the more guns there are around , the more gun violence you 'll have , " D.C. Attorney General Linda Singer said .
" One of the difficult things is , you can't measure what did n't happen , " Singer said .
" You can't measure how many guns did n't come into the District because we have this law . "
But you can measure the violence that did occur , using the bellwether offense of homicide to chart the ebb and flow of crime in the District since the ban was enacted .
And the violence here over those years was worse than in most other big cities , many of them in states with far less restrictive gun laws .

Amnesty International on Tuesday called on Iran to abolish the " grotesque and horrific " practice of stoning people to death .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Amnesty International on Tuesday called on Iran to abolish the “ grotesque and horrific ” practice of stoning people to death .
Amnesty , which opposes the death penalty under any circumstances , said an Iranian man had been stoned to death in July last year for committing adultery , despite a moratorium being imposed on such executions in 2002 .
The woman he was convicted of committing adultery with still faces the threat of being stoned , a practice that involves the woman being buried up to her breasts in sand and then pelted with stones until she dies .
“ Amnesty International is calling on the Iranian government to abolish immediately and totally execution by stoning and to impose a moratorium on the death penalty , ” the rights group said in a 30 - page report on the practice .
“ Iranian law prescribes that the stones are deliberately chosen to be large enough to cause pain , but not so large as to kill the victim immediately ...
It is a particularly grotesque and horrific practice . ”
While stoning is used relatively seldom in Iran , it is the favored form of execution in cases involving adultery and has a disproportionate impact on women , according to Amnesty .
Iran has one of the highest rates of execution in the world .
In 2006 , 177 people were put to death , mostly by hanging .
Last year , that number was expected to be exceeded , with 124 people executed in the first seven months of the year .
As well as calling for the abolition of stoning and a moratorium on the death penalty , Amnesty also urged the Iranian government to decriminalize adultery , which is not illegal in the majority of countries .

Ed Henry is a CNN White House correspondent .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A few weeks ago , I ran into Dan Bartlett on Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House , and the former presidential counselor looked like the weight of the world had been lifted from his shoulders .
Former Bush counselor Dan Bartlett is more open now that he has left the White House .
He was tanned and rested from a long summer vacation , thrilled to be spending more time with his family and eager to start reaping the greener pastures of the private sector after leaving the White House in July .
The newly liberated Bartlett casually chatted about a range of subjects , unburdened by staff meetings and press calls , just standing near a Starbucks shooting the breeze .
But when I steered the conversation to questions about President Bush 's search for a new attorney general -- which was then in the final stages -- Bartlett politely clammed up .
" I 'm still on message , " he said , half - jokingly , of course .
Well , imagine my surprise this week to find the veil of secrecy is finally starting to be lifted .
Bartlett is now on the paid lecture circuit -- earning $ 10,000 - $ 30,000 per speech depending on the audience and location -- and the big dough has loosened his lips .
Bartlett 's speaking agent , Leading Authorities , posted video of one recent speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce online to drum up business .
But the video is also providing rare insights into key players like Vice President Cheney .
Bartlett talks about the 2000 Republican National Convention , when he and Ari Fleischer , who later became the White House press secretary , formulated a plan to sit down with Dick and Lynne Cheney to warn them that bringing their lesbian daughter , Mary , on the campaign trail would invite press scrutiny .
It was a delicate assignment , so Bartlett and Fleischer practiced the night before and decided Fleischer would break the ice when they met with the Cheneys during a motorcade ride .
" Ari was supposed to start , and Ari is like reading the newspaper , " Bartlett told his audience to laughter .
" I 'd keep looking at Ari and Ari 's not looking back . "
So Bartlett plunged ahead , telling the Cheneys in the back of the car : " Just want you to know the press is going to really focus on this .
They 're going to maybe intrude more into their lives than you would be prepared -- and Mrs.
Cheney is there too -- and darts just shooting through me left and right . "
The future vice president finally broke the silence .
" We wo n't be talking about my daughter , " Cheney said , according to Bartlett .
So the staffer said , " Okaaay , thank you very much . "
Then there was President Bush 's first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2001 in Slovenia , when they privately sparred over -- of all things -- U.S. chicken imports to Russia .
" You 're only sending us chickens from the bad chicken plants , " Putin railed at Bush , according to Bartlett .
" And Americans are getting all the good chicken plants . "
Bartlett noted that Putin repeatedly referred to " George " in the conversation .
" And when he gets really kind of uppity he would always , like , would pointedly say , ' George , ' " Bartlett said .
Bush was stunned by Putin 's wrong information , according to Bartlett , who then showed his audience a pretty good impersonation of Bush .
" He 's kind of like what the hell is he talking about ? " recalled Bartlett .
" ' Vladimir , if you want to come over to America , we can go to every chicken plant in America and eat as many chickens as you want !
Let 's go now ! " '
Bartlett said he used the anecdote to show how complex the U.S. - Russian relationship is now , adding that the Bush - Putin summits got more " bizarre " by the year .
These comments , of course , will only make the next Bush - Putin meeting that much more interesting .

This article appeared as part of a feature in the December 8 , 1995 issue of Executive Intelligence Review , and was circuclated extensively by the Schiller Insitute Food for Peace Movement .
It is reprinted here as part of the package :  Who Is Responsible for the World Food Shortage ? 
Kissingers 1974 Plan for Food Control Genocide
by Joseph Brewda
Dec. 8 , 1995 On Dec. 10 , 1974 , the U.S. National Security Council under Henry Kissinger completed a classified 200 - page study ,  National Security Study Memorandum 200 : Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests .
The study falsely claimed that population growth in the so - called Lesser Developed Countries ( LDCs ) was a grave threat to U.S. national security .
Adopted as official policy in November 1975 by President Gerald Ford , NSSM 200 outlined a covert plan to reduce population growth in those countries through birth control , and also , implicitly , war and famine .
Brent Scowcroft , who had by then replaced Kissinger as national security adviser ( the same post Scowcroft was to hold in the Bush administration ) , was put in charge of implementing the plan .
CIA Director George Bush was ordered to assist Scowcroft , as were the secretaries of state , treasury , defense , and agriculture .
The bogus arguments that Kissinger advanced were not original .
One of his major sources was the Royal Commission on Population , which King George VI had created in 1944 to consider what measures should be taken in the national interest to influence the future trend of population . 
The commission found that Britain was gravely threatened by population growth in its colonies , since a populous country has decided advantages over a sparsely - populated one for industrial production . 
The combined effects of increasing population and industrialization in its colonies , it warned , might be decisive in its effects on the prestige and influence of the West ,  especially effecting military strength and security . 
NSSM 200 similarly concluded that the United States was threatened by population growth in the former colonial sector .
It paid special attention to 13 key countries  in which the United States had a special political and strategic interest : India , Bangladesh , Pakistan , Indonesia , Thailand , the Philippines , Turkey , Nigeria , Egypt , Ethiopia , Mexico , Brazil , and Colombia .
It claimed that population growth in those states was especially worrisome , since it would quickly increase their relative political , economic , and military strength .
For example , Nigeria :  Already the most populous country on the continent , with an estimated 55 million people in 1970 , Nigeria 's population by the end of this century is projected to number 135 million .
This suggests a growing political and strategic role for Nigeria , at least in Africa . 
Or Brazil :  Brazil clearly dominated the continent demographically .
The study warned of a growing power status for Brazil in Latin America and on the world scene over the next 25 years . 
Food as a weapon
There were several measures that Kissinger advocated to deal with this alleged threat , most prominently , birth control and related population - reduction programs .
He also warned that population growth rates are likely to increase appreciably before they begin to decline ,  even if such measures were adopted .
A second measure was curtailing food supplies to targetted states , in part to force compliance with birth control policies :
 There is also some established precedent for taking account of family planning performance in appraisal of assistance requirements by AID [ U.S. Agency for International Development ] and consultative groups .
Since population growth is a major determinant of increases in food demand , allocation of scarce PL 480 resources should take account of what steps a country is taking in population control as well as food production .
In these sensitive relations , however , it is important in style as well as substance to avoid the appearance of coercion . 
 Mandatory programs may be needed and we should be considering these possibilities now ,  the document continued , adding ,  Would food be considered an instrument of national power ? ...
Is the U.S. prepared to accept food rationing to help people who can 't / wo n't control their population growth ? 
Kissinger also predicted a return of famines that could make exclusive reliance on birth control programs unnecessary .
 Rapid population growth and lagging food production in developing countries , together with the sharp deterioration in the global food situation in 1972 and 1973 , have raised serious concerns about the ability of the world to feed itself adequately over the next quarter of century and beyond ,  he reported .
The cause of that coming food deficit was not natural , however , but was a result of western financial policy :  Capital investments for irrigation and infrastucture and the organization requirements for continuous improvements in agricultural yields may be beyond the financial and administrative capacity of many LDCs .
For some of the areas under heaviest population pressure , there is little or no prospect for foreign exchange earnings to cover constantly increasingly imports of food . 
 It is questionable ,  Kissinger gloated , whether aid donor countries will be prepared to provide the sort of massive food aid called for by the import projections on a long - term continuing basis . 
Consequently , large - scale famine of a kind not experienced for several decades a kind the world thought had been permanently banished ,  was foreseeable famine , which has indeed come to pass .

Jim --
Can you please help me win a bet at work ?
A co-worker of mine says that WALL - E makes a brief cameo appearance in " Ratatouille . "

Dear Bernie --
I have to admit that the guys up in Emeryville do delight in doing stuff like that .
As in : Bringing characters from different Pixar projects together .
Take -- for example -- what happens to the logo for this animation studio in the opening portion of " WALL- E " 's international trailer .
Where first the light in the Luxo Jr. lamp blows out and then WALL - E rolls on - screen with a replacement bulb .

" So when did Pixar get started with making all of these in - jokes and / or self references to its own movies ? , " you ask .
My understanding is that this practice actually dates back to 1987 .
Where -- as staffers at this animation studio were rushing to complete " Red 's Dream , " the short that they planned on placing in competition at that year 's SIGGRAPH -- they realized that the circus center ring that plays such a prominent role in this film 's dream sequence was a bit on the bland side .
Sooo ...
Hoping to inject a little more color into " Red 's Dream , " Lasseter & Co. lifted the color , textures and designs featured on the rubber ball in " Luxo Jr. " and then made that the floor of their circus 's center ring .
Copyright 2007 Disney / Pixar .
All Rights Reserved
As the story goes , a few folks at SIGGRAPH 1987 told John that they thought that it was really clever that " Red 's Dream " had referenced Pixar 's first SIGGRAPH submission , " Luxo Jr . "
Which suggested that there was some sort of connective tissue between these two animated shorts .
Which -- let 's be honest here , folks -- was NOT what John Lasseter & his team of animators were trying to do when they were working on " Red 's Dream . "
Truth be told , these guys were just looking for a quick - and - dirty way to add some additional color to that film 's dream sequence .
But given they seemed to get extra points with the people at SIGGRAPH for trying to be clever ...
Well , in - jokes and self references then became a way of life at Pixar Animation Studios .
Which is why the gas station that Andy 's Mom pulls into in " Toy Story " ...

Speaking of bedrooms ...
Perhaps the most famous set of self references to ever appear in a Pixar picture occurred in " Monsters , Inc . "
Where -- as Sulley finally returns
Boo to the human world -- among the toys that we see scattered around this toddler 's bedroom are the ball from " Luxo Jr . " ( You can see it in the photo below next to the easel ) as well as a Jessie doll from " Toy Story 2 " ( On the white table to the left ) .

And then -- as the icing on the cake -- this cute little girl hands her favorite squeaky toy over to that blue - haired beast .

This particular in - joke launched a brand - new trend at that animation studio .
Where the animators would then fold in a somewhat discreet reference to an upcoming Pixar production .

I know , I know .
Not everyone is going to pick up on these somewhat tenuous connections between the various Pixar productions .
And that 's okay with that studio's animators .
Sometimes they actually prefer it when their in - jokes stay in - jokes .
Take -- for example -- how Linguini ...

Brad Bird 's very first feature for Pixar Animation Studios .
Given that Brad was something of an outsider when he first arrived in Emeryville , he did n't automatically buy into all of Pixar 's oddball traditions .

Where exactly in " Ratatouille " can you find WALL-E ?

To be honest , Bernie 's co-worker seems to deliberately be trying to trick his friend .
Given that the title character of this upcoming Andrew Stanton film does n't actually appear in the " Ratatouille " film .

" And where is WALL - E ? , " you ask .
Well ...

As for cutting me in for a share of your winnings , Bernie W ...
Tell you what .
Why do n't you hold onto that cash for a few days ?
For sometime late next week , I 'll actually be talking about a very worthy cause that I 'd like JHM readers to consider donating to .
The restrictions focus on foods high in salt , fat and sugar
Ofcom has concluded a consultation on its proposals for restricting ads for foods and drinks which are high in fat , salt and sugar , published in November .
Health campaigners had wanted a ban on junk food ads up to the 9 pm watershed .
But Ofcom has said the ban , which will be phased in , will cover any shows teenagers will find appealing , whenever they are aired .
Ofcom had already said there would be a total ban on ads during children 's programmes and on children 's channels , as well as adult programmes watched by a large number of children .
After the consultation , it has been decided that the timetable will be :-
1 April 2007 - ads for foods high in fat , sugar and salt will be banned during or around programmes made specifically for children or those which would particularly appeal to children aged seven to nine ,
- ads for foods high in fat , sugar and salt will be banned during or around programmes made specifically for children or those which would particularly appeal to children aged seven to nine , 1 January 2008 - junk food ads will banned in and around programmes aimed at , or which appeal to , children aged four to 15 ,
- junk food ads will banned in and around programmes aimed at , or which appeal to , children aged four to 15 , By December 2008 - Dedicated children 's channels will have to have phased out all junk food ads .
Review
It has been estimated the ban will cost broadcasters an estimated £ 39 million in lost advertising revenue .
We are hugely disappointed that they did n't take the ban a step further
Peter Hollins , British Heart Foundation
Ofcom also said there would be new rules governing advertising to primary school age children .
The use of celebrities and characters , such as cartoon heroes , free gifts and health or nutrition claims will also be banned .
Ofcom suggests the package would mean that , in households where children 's viewing includes a large number of programmes targeted at adults as well as those for children and young people , under - 16s would see 41 % fewer junk food ads .
A Food Standards
Agency ratings system will be used to assess which foods are too high in fat , sugar and salt to be advertised to children .
Ofcom will review the effectiveness of the restrictions in the autumn of 2008 .
But Ofcom 's plans have come in for criticism .
Peter Hollins , chief executive of the British Heart Foundation , said : " Despite all the evidence , Ofcom have turned their back on the right thing for the nation 's children .
" We are hugely disappointed that they did n't take the ban a step further in the first place .
" A pre-9 pm watershed ban is the best way to protect our kids and is what parents want to see happen1 .
It 's time for the government to step in . "
And Melanie Leech , director of industry body the Food and Drink Federation , said : " Ofcom notes TV advertising has a modest , direct effect on children 's food choices and is only one among many influences .
" So today 's decision will not , by itself , reduce childhood obesity ; there are no silver bullets that can be fired at this particular problem . "
She added : " We are disappointed that Ofcom has decided to extend the restrictions on advertising to cover young people .
" This is a disproportionate response given that the issue has always been about young children , and industry responded to Ofcom 's initial consultation on that basis . "

Then Admits , Use of Chemical Weapons in Iraq Late last year , the US military responded to allegations that it had used chemical weapons in Fallujah , Iraq , by outright denial .
In a State Department
The fighting in Fallujah , Iraq has led to a number of widespread myths including false charges that the United States is using chemical weapons such napalm and poison gas .
None of these allegations are true .
...
The United States categorically denies the use of chemical weapons at any time in Iraq , which includes the ongoing Fallujah operation .
Furthermore , the United States does not under any circumstance support or condone the development , production , acquisition , transfer or use of chemical weapons by any country .
All chemical weapons currently possessed by the United States have been declared to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) and are being destroyed in the United States in accordance with our obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention .
...
No Mark - 77 firebombs have been used in operations in Fallujah .
A recently aired Italian documentary called " Fallujah : The Hidden Massacre " shows the use of
The documentary , however , clearly shows the corpses of women and children burned to the bone .
White phosphorus , when used as an incendiary , burns through flesh often leaving clothing intact .
The documentary is available
The use of chemical weapons in general is forbidden by a treaty the US signed in 1997 .
In addition , a 1980 UN treaty makes the use of MK77 on civilians illegal .

Update :
The US military is currently claiming that phosphorus is n't a chemical weapon , yet
Update : I 've replaced an image previously included in this article with a new one .

Late last year , the US military responded to allegations that it had used chemical weapons in Fallujah , Iraq , by outright denial .
In a State Department missive ironically labelled as " Identifying Misinformation " , the administration claimed : A recently aired Italian documentary called " Fallujah : The Hidden Massacre " shows the use of white phosphorus , a highly toxic chemical that can be used as an incendiary , on Iraqi civilians .
It also airs statements by former US soliders that MK77 was used .
In response to the documentary , the US military first denied the use of white phosphorus as a weapon then changed its position to state that it did not use the weapon against civilians .
The documentary , however , clearly shows the corpses of women and children burned to the bone .
White phosphorus , when used as an incendiary , burns through flesh often leaving clothing intact .
The documentary is available here for viewing or downloading .

I ’m not talking about the protesters .
I ’m talking about the mayor and her staff .
In a month , the RPD has gone from being one of the most capable and capably led police departments in the country , to a rudderless hulk being swept to ruin in a current of incompetence and politics .
In a month , Lovely Warren has undone 20 years of leadership development and put the department in the hands of people completely incapable to the task .
That ’s a reality that the people of Rochester will have to deal with long after the mayor ’s scandal - ridden administration is done .
Here ’s where it was .
A month ago , the Rochester Police Department was led by a command group with a higher percentage of people of color than almost any other mid-sized metropolitan department in the country .
And those individuals were police officers of extraordinary ability and accomplishment .
That was n’t an accident .
That was the result of more than two decades of steady recruitment and encouragement .
Not a quota system or some sort of tokenism , but a culture of invitation and responsibility , in which talented people were invited to consider a career in law enforcement and then welcomed into an organization that highly valued individual growth and excellence .
That produced a core of leaders – overwhelmingly black men – who were true and principled professionals , a great asset to their city and highly respected by their subordinates .
Any one of them could , and probably would have eventually , served successfully as chief of police .
But they were all chased out by the mayor .
She created an ethical environment in which they could not stay .
Their integrity was the knife used to slit their professional throats .
And now she has announced her new command group .
Cynthia Herriott - Sullivan as interim chief , Moses Robinson as some undefined senior officer in the chief ’s office – he was nixed as deputy chief when it was realized that in 34 years on the job he had never once supervised anyone , and an obscure captain , Gabriel Person , as deputy chief of operations .
These are no doubt good people , and Cynthia Herriott - Sullivan is universally seen as a kind , good - hearted and well - liked person .
But they are not cop bosses .
And Cynthia Herriott - Sullivan and Moses Robinson are not people who are going to stand up well to public scrutiny of their personnel files .
If the newspaper continues its crusade of expose every cop ’s personnel records , it will find in their pasts actions and accusations ill - suited to senior position .
Some of the incidents are from a long time ago , and have been handled internally and confidentially because , in fairness , that ’s what they deserve .
But pushing these individuals into the public spotlight , months after the repeal of the 50 - A shield of police personnel files , sets them up for controversy , and ensures that the department will get more negative and embarrassing headlines .
It will also be disillusioning for younger officers whose careers have been lived in an era of higher standards and scrutiny .
God bless the new chief as she goes forward , but the deck has been stacked against her .
And the long knives will be out for her .
Anti-police activists on the streets and in City Council are n’t looking for new faces , they want to defund and dissolve the police department .
They do n’t want to improve its function , they want to stop its function .
And Cynthia Herriott - Sullivan will either by their ally or their victim .
She is either one of the wolves or she is a lamb being led to slaughter .
And that ’s on the mayor .
When the Monroe County grand jury rises on Friday , it is likely to hand down a felony indictment against Lovely Warren .
That will commence a desperate legal and political battle to try to save her political career and the faltering political organization of recently deceased Assemblyman David Gantt .
Her indictment , the failed effort of her faction to retain control of the Democratic caucus in the Monroe County Legislature , and the unsuccessful Assembly bid of ally Ernest Flagler - Mitchell are all body blows to the operation that empowered Lovely Warren .
While she scrambles to escape her likely political and legal doom , she is n’t going to give a damn about the police department , and will probably be tempted to use its dissection as a bargaining chip .
And that might be what this new command group is all about .
Whether she knows it or not , Cynthia Herriott - Sullivan ’s job as skipper of the RPD might be to sail it to the scrap yard .
A sacrifice to the failed administration of Lovely Warren .
( CNN ) -- Solid support from registered Democrats and women in New Hampshire were crucial Tuesday as Sen. Hillary Clinton rebounded from her third - place finish in last week 's Iowa caucuses .
Sen .
Hillary Clinton has spent the past few days saying she has the experience to change Washington .
She narrowly defeated Sen. Barack Obama in the New Hampshire primary , with 39 percent of the vote to Obama 's 37 .
" Last week , I listened to you , and in the process I found my own voice , " the New York senator said after her victory .
" Now let 's give America the kind of comeback that New Hampshire has just given me . "
Forty - three percent of self - styled independents said they voted for Obama , and 31 percent said they backed Clinton .
Independents made up 43 percent of all voters polled .
Addressing his roaring supporters after the race was called , Obama congratulated Clinton .
But he was a candidate determined to draw a distinction between Clinton and himself .
" But the reason our campaign has always been different , the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago , is because it 's not just about what I will do as president , " he said .
" It is also about what you , the people who love this country , the citizens of the United States of America , can do to change it .
That 's what this election is all about . "
But Clinton was ahead of Obama 45 percent to 34 percent among those who said they were registered Democrats .
Those voters made up a majority -- 54 percent -- of all respondents .
Clinton also claimed the majority of women 's votes , according to the polling .
That 's in contrast to last week 's Iowa caucuses , in which Obama surprised observers by stealing the female vote from Clinton .
Analysts say that shift among female voters was crucial to the Clinton turnaround .
" If I had a single word , the word would be ' women , ' " said CNN political analyst Bill Schneider .
" She got the women back . "
And Schneider said the support of union voters that put Clinton over the top .
" Union voters have her a 10 point lead , " he said .
CNN projected former Sen. John Edwards to finish third .
College graduates , who made up 29 percent of the electorate , opted narrowly for Clinton -- 38 percent to Obama 's 37 percent , according to the polling .
Those polled who called themselves very liberal , and moderate , went with Clinton over Obama -- although by less than 2 percentage points in each -- and those who said they are somewhat liberal were evenly split .
Pundits also were citing the role of former President Bill Clinton in helping his wife recover from what pre-primary polls were suggesting was a deficit of 9 percentage points to Obama in New Hampshire .
The former president spent Tuesday in Hanover -- home to Dartmouth College -- where Obama had been expected to win handily .
" They dispatched him to the area that Obama was surging , " said CNN analyst Donna Brazille , who managed former Vice President Al Gore 's campaign in 2000 .
" I think it had the effect of tamping down Obama support and giving Senator Clinton a real reason to come back in this race . "
New Hampshire was considered crucial to Clinton 's campaign .
If Obama had been able to sweep Iowa and New Hampshire -- after months of Clinton being considered the front - runner among Democrats -- it could have given him powerful momentum going into future primaries .
" Age is also playing a big factor -- older voters are overwhelmingly outnumbering younger voters -- a proportion that is clearly benefiting Clinton , " Schneider said .
" Sixty - seven percent of Democratic primary voters are over the age of 40 , and they are breaking heavily for Clinton over Obama . "
Over the past several days , Clinton has trumpeted her experience , saying that she has delivered change as both first lady and as a senator .
After losing to Obama in last week 's Iowa caucuses , it was unclear whether she could overcome what appeared to be Obama 's ability to electrify American voters who had previously taken a sour and skeptical view of politicians and the political process .
The duel between the Obama and Clinton campaigns grew especially testy Monday and Tuesday .
She said she had more experience than he , and was therefore more qualified .
He accused her of representing the status quo of Washington .
And on the eve of the New Hampshire primary , Bill Clinton criticized the media for not pressing Obama more fully on Iraq , and accused the Illinois senator of shifting his position to reflect changing attitudes about the war in Iraq .
Then , there was an issue unto itself -- Hillary Clinton 's almost - tears .
Clinton 's eyes welled up this week while responding to a voter 's question about her health and appearance .
Pundits and voters alike questioned whether Clinton 's emotions were sincere or faked as part of some strategy to diminish criticism that she is too steely , too cold .
In front of the crowd of mostly female New Hampshire voters , an admittedly fatigued Clinton responded to a question by saying : " This is very personal for me , it 's not just political , it 's [ that ]
I see what 's happening , we have to reverse it . "
Her voice broke , and she was then applauded by the crowd .
Polls indicated the show of emotions fared well with male voters , according to CNN 's John King , but turned off some female voters .
Edwards was followed in votes by New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich .

PORT WASHINGTON , N.Y. ( MarketWatch ) --
Housing will revive when prices come down to the point where demand rises enough to reduce the huge supply of unsold homes now overhanging the market .
That said , this point is a long way off .
Right now , there is at least a 10 - month supply of unsold homes at current selling rates .
This is twice the average for the nation as a whole .
In some markets the supply is even larger .
As a consequence , few new homes are being built .
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of new housing starts in the past two months was 1.21 million - two - thirds of last year 's average and the smallest for any two - month period in recent memory .
Needless to say , this slowdown in new - home construction is taking its toll on builders , suppliers , labor and sellers of home furnishings , to name a few .
And it 's not too difficult to see the ripple effects on a wide variety of industries , from retailing to finance .
To whittle this supply to more normal levels , demand has to rise .
That will happen when prices fall , since right now , housing prices are much too high relative to family incomes .
Today , median home prices are 3.5 times the size of median annual family incomes .
This may be down from the recent peak of 4.2 times incomes reached last year , but it's way above the 2.8 times that home prices averaged during 1984 - 2000 , when lots of homes were bought , sold and built .
And if you think 2.8 is low , check out the early 1970s .
That was when home prices were only 2.3 times median family incomes , and housing was selling like gangbusters .
One major homebuilder recently proved that people will buy if the price is right .
The firm slashed prices by 20 - 30 % one recent weekend - and wound up selling more than nine times as many homes as it did on previous weekends .
To get prices back to 2.8 times family incomes would require a drop of 20 % from today 's levels - and this does not take into account interest rates and lending standards .
To equal the affordability of the early 1970s , prices would have to fall a whopping 38 % .
Those who say such declines can't happen are ignoring how fast home prices rose in the first half of this decade .
In most parts of the country , housing prices doubled during this five - year period while incomes went up only a fraction as much .
Sellers could always hold the line and wait for family incomes to rise .
But this clearly wo n't happen overnight - and , besides , it 's a buyer 's market and no one wants to buy today knowing that prices might well be lower tomorrow .
After all , when it comes to housing prices , what matters most is not the cost of construction , nor what surrounding homes might be selling for .
Simply put , it 's affordability .
And until they are more affordable , houses wo n't sell .
A pretty gruesome game for those who wish there were a more Halloween season - appropriate word / spelling / guessing puzzle game .
Just when you thought the idea of hanging a stick - man stranger for your own vocabularical shortcomings was gruesome enough .
Thanks , armorgames !
( warning : stick person violence and paper - and - ink gore )
Personally , I think the timer is a nice stess - inducing touch .
I think I ’d fail less often if I was n’t all paranoid about that darn ticking .
The creation of Holodecks brings a new type of an addiction .
This addiction can be very serious , causing a person to disconnect himself from reality on the long run .
This is a guide that anyone should read before trying a standard issue Starfleet holodeck for the first time .
This will help you not become yet another fresh Holo - addict .
Avoid having sex on the holodeck at all cost .
After the first time you do it , you will find it is very hard to stop because you know that you can program the holodeck to make all your sex fantasies seem real .
The worst thing is to lose your virginity to a hologram .
Think about it .
The holodeck is not meant to be a hooker house .
People who love you and care about you would n't like to know that you waste your time in the holodeck fucking holograms .
Unfortunately , this is n't enforced right now , and until someone installs sperm emission detectors , we 'll just have to trust you .
Treatment : Create a program with a bunch of ugly naked people running after you in order to rape you .
Make sure the program wins and you get raped .
This will make you disgusted with sex on the holodeck for some time .

Do n't create holograms of your dead loved ones .
I know you are hurt , I know it is hard to lose someone .
It happened to me once .
Back then I thought about to run to a holodeck and create a fully AI copy of my best friend .
The reason I did n't do this is not because holodecks are not invented yet , it 's because I knew a hologram will never be a replacement for that person , and the happiness I 'll experience from being with the hologram will just disappear into more sadness when I 'll leave the holodeck .
Treatment : Create a program which recreates the moment you have last been with the person when he / she was alive , allowing you to properly say an eternal goodbye to him / her .

If you ever get to do this , make sure you do n't hang out with them too much and forget you have real friends .
If you do n't have real friends , I advise you to run a shrink meeting program on your next trip to a holodeck .

Restrict your time on the holodeck
Make sure that you consult with your parent , commanding officer , employer , or anyone who has command privileges , to enforce a time quota on your presence in the holodeck .
I recommend no more than 30 minutes a day for an healthy person .

Avoid going alone to the holodeck
Holodeck addictions sometimes can be prevented entirely if you enjoy the holodeck with more than one person .
This way it is easier not to lose touch with the real world , having real people with you .
In case all what is written above did n't help , you can contact the Holodeck Addiction Support Group using subspace ( not available until the 24th century , sorry ) .
Microsoft is succumbing to patent trolls today , as they 're being ordered to pay over $ 140 million for , get this , asking for two passwords .
The original award was ordered in April last year by a federal jury in Marshall , Texas , widely known as the friendliest court for patent trolls .
There Microsoft and Autodesk were saddled with $ 158 million ( plus attorney fees ) for asking users to " input two passwords during the process of activating newly installed software with the aim of deterring piracy . "
Somehow , two weeks ago , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the lower court 's decision in its entirety .
This begs two questions in particular .
Did Microsoft Save Money ?
Just setting aside the inestimable losses they took with their corporate attorneys , did they really stop the piracy of their software with the addition of an additional password ?
I 'm guessing not .
I can spend five minutes digging through Google and various crack sites and find a way to get a free copy of just about any version of Windows or any Microsoft product .
The extra password is n't fooling anyone .
The obvious answer , is no .
Not that I 'd ever pirate a Microsoft product , but from what I hear , its pretty rampant .
Need further proof ?
Look at Vista 's Chinese sales numbers .
Evidently , adding layers of annoyance does n't really prevent piracy , then ... which leads us to the other question :
Should the two password process of DRM be patentable ?
I 'm not a patent law expert , it seems to me that if the process is something a pre-schooler would come up with , it is n't exactly something particularly cutting edge .
As such , it should n't be patentable .
Microsoft spokesman David Bowermaster said , " Windows Vista and Office 2007 are not affected by the appeals court decision " and that " the company does not have to make any technical changes to Windows XP or Office 2003 . "
Clearly Microsoft came to the conclusion , based on the levels of piracy of previous software products , that asking for a second password did n't do much to curtail piracy ; they do n't even use that technology any longer ( if you want to use the term technology charitably here ) .
Z4 Technologies , the patent holder in this case , does not even offer any actual services or products that utilize their patents , making them a patent trolling company ( that is , a company who creates or acquires patents for the express purpose of suing companies that later use the ideas ) .
As such , they are a perfect illustration of why the patent and intellectual property system is completely broken in America .
Patents are supposed to encourage and promote technological advancement , not curtail them .
By granting fines payable companies that troll through the patent system in America , the barrier to entry for new technological participants is raised .
Part of what truly cutting edge tech companies must account for now is the legal fees they must pay to either defend their products or pay the patent extortionists who come behind them and try to milk them with overly broad patents .
[ via Silicon Valley ]
SAN FRANCISCO , Sept. 12 — In the annals of perks enjoyed by America ’s corporate executives , the founders of Google may have set a new standard : an uncrowded , federally managed runway for their private jet that is only a few minutes ’ drive from their offices .
For $ 1.3 million a year , Larry Page and Sergey Brin get to park their customized wide - body Boeing 767- 200 , as well as two other jets used by top Google executives , on Moffett Field , an airport run by NASA that is generally closed to private aircraft .
It is a perk that is likely to turn other Silicon Valley tycoons green with envy , as no other private jets have landing rights there .
But it may not sit well with a community that generally considers itself proud to have Google in its midst .
How did the two billionaires get such a coveted parking place for the jet , which is unusually large and rare by private jet standards ?
Officials at the Ames Research Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said the agency signed a unique agreement last month that allows it to place scientific instruments and researchers on planes used by the Google founders .
NASA gets to collect scientific data on some flights of those jets , which in addition to the Boeing 767-200 includes two Gulfstream Vs .
Lance Armstrong 's Daughter Takes Ashley Olsen for Show - and - Tell

When little boys and girls brought in things like dolls , rocks and pets ?
Not to be outdone , Lance Armstrong 's 6 - year - old daughter Isabella ( he has twins ) reportedly brought dad 's current playmate , 21 - year - old Ashley Olsen to her Texas classroom for show - and - tell .
According to a source , " celebrities do this all the time " and Lance Armstrong himself was once toted along for show - and - tell by ex-girlfriend Tory Burch 's son .

Hryhoriy put his long life down to the fact he never married
Hryhoriy at home
Mr Nestor died in his sleep on Friday night in the village of Stary Yarychev , in the western region of Lviv , the Kiev newspaper Segodnya reports .
He died before proof of his age was submitted to Guinness World Records .
The world 's recognised oldest living person is currently Edna Parker of the United States , who turned 114 in April .
He did n't find himself a mate because he was a short man and never had money
Oksana
Relative of Hryhoriy Nestor
Just a few close relatives and neighbours gathered for Mr Nestor 's funeral , Segodnya writes .
In accordance with his wish that there should be no crying , a hearty meal was served of his favourite dishes : warm potato and herring , and cabbage with home - made sausage .
Active life
Oksana , one of the relations with whom he lived , said he had led an active life to the last , helping around the house , whether it was making dumplings or tending the chickens .
WHEN HRYHORIY NESTOR WAS BORN ...
Average life expectancy in Europe was less than 50 Adolf Hitler was not even two years old Lviv was known as Lemberg and under Austrian rule Sarah Bernhardt and Tchaikovksy were both preparing to tour the USA
He was no different on Friday , though he doused his head with cold water that evening - something he had often done before , complaining of headaches .
" His death came as a surprise to us , he just did n't wake up again , " Oksana said .
" After his master 's death , his favourite cat Murchik did n't go into his corner like he usually did but lay down on his bed , " she added .
Born , according to family documents , on 15 March 1891 , Mr Nestor , a former farm labourer , put his long life down to the fact that he never married .
" He did n't find himself a mate because he was a short man and never had money , " Oksana believes .
He also led a healthy life , she says .
He loved to get outside and would run barefoot through the grass .
Vodka he drank in moderation , and his favourite food was simple country fare with his greatest luxury a slice of sausage in a bread roll .
Official probing Rove now under investigation himself Jason Rhyne

The federal official helming a probe into potentially illegal partisan political activities conducted by Karl Rove and other White House officials is himself the focus of a federal investigation .
Scott Bloch , the Bush - appointed head of the US Office of Special Counsel , is under investigation for the alleged improper deletion of emails on office computers , The Wall Street Journal 's John R. Wilke reports .
" Recently , investigators learned that Mr. Bloch erased all the files on his office personal computer late last year , " writes Wilke .
" They are now trying to determine whether the deletions were improper or part of a cover - up , lawyers close to the case said . "
The inspector general of the Office of Personnel Management is examining the case at the urging of the White House .
The Special Counsel is also under scrutiny for claims that he used his position to retaliate against other employees , and that he " dismissed whistleblower cases without adequate examination . "
Investigation began in that case in 2005 .
The Journal reports that Bloch called the tech support service Geeks on Call for help deleting computer files instead of using his agency 's own in - house computer technicians .
That company " dispatched a technician in one of its signature PT Cruiser wagons , " according to Wilke , who adds that Bloch confirms contacting Geeks on Call but maintains it was part of an effort to " eradicate a virus that had seized control of his computer . "
" Mr. Bloch had his computer 's hard disk completely cleansed using a ' seven - level ' wipe : a thorough scrubbing that conforms to Defense Department data - security standards , " the report continues , describing a process which makes it " nearly impossible for forensics experts to restore the data later .
Technicians were also directed to erase laptops used by Bloch 's former political deputies , Wilke adds .
" Geeks on Call visited Mr. Bloch 's government office in a nondescript office building on M Street in Washington twice , on Dec. 18 and Dec. 21 , 2006 , " according the paper 's review of a company receipt .
" The total charge was $ 1,149 , paid with an agency credit card , the receipt shows .
The receipt says a seven - level wipe was performed but does n't mention any computer virus . "
The manager of the Geeks on Call franchise involved told the Journal that the so - called seven - level wipe was not a typical remedy for a computer virus .
" We do n't do a seven - level wipe for a virus , " he said .
But Bloch told the Journal that no documents in connection to an investigation had been destroyed .
" He also says the employee claims against him are unwarranted , " according to the paper .
" Mr. Bloch believes the White House may have a conflict of interest in pressing the inquiry into his conduct while his office investigates the White House political operation . "
The Office of Special Counsel , which Bloch has headed since 2004 , is tasked with enforcing the Hatch Act , a law enacted in 1939 to prohibit public employees from engaging in partisan political activity .
That organization 's investigation into Rove and other White House officials , launched earlier this year , ironically includes a probe of missing emails .
The Office of Special Counsel is examining " the firing of at least one U.S. attorney , missing White House e-mails , and White House efforts to keep presidential appointees attuned to Republican political priorities , " according to the Los Angeles Times .
" We will take the evidence where it leads us , " Bloch told the Times in April .
" We will not leave any stone unturned . "
Earlier this month , a federal judge ordered the White House to save all of its emails in response to lawsuits from two private organizations , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Government , and The National Security Archive .
The groups allege that as many as five million White House emails are missing .

In reading the comments to my post yesterday , I see that many of you were confused about my positions .
Evidently all of you are brilliant , so I assume the problem is on my end .
With your indulgence , allow me to clarify .
1. I am not happy that Hitler killed your relatives .
2 . I do not support the killing of Americans
3 . I do not support nuclear annihilation of Israel
4 . I do not support the stoning of virgins in Iran
5 . I believe the holocaust happened
I also do n’t argue there ’s a moral equivalence between Iran and the United States , or Israel and the Palestinians , or anyone and anyone else .
Groups pursue their own perceived self interest .
Arguing relative morality is an idiot ’s game .
Pointing out similarities in policies , and shaking the box , is good clean fun .
Next , I believe that if Iran is in fact helping Iraqi insurgents harm Americans , it ’s an act of war , and a legitimate reason for attacking Iran in some fashion .
That does n’t mean it ’s in the best interests of the United States to do so , but I would view it as legitimate .
Likewise , if the Iranians really are developing a nuclear weapon with the intent of using it on Israel , and there was some way to confirm that other than suspicious translations of speeches , then attacking Iran makes perfect sense , and I would support it completely .
My problem is that I keep seeing patterns :
1. Iraq is helping Al - Qaeda
2. Iraq has weapons of mass destruction
3 . Al - Qaeda is operationally non-functional
4 . The surge is working
5. Iran is helping Iraqi insurgents kill Americans
I believe there ’s a good chance Iran is helping Iraqi insurgents kill Americans , simply because it might be in their perceived best interest to do that .
But I ’d be an idiot to believe it simply because the government told the media it was true and the media told me .
You can only fool me five or six dozen times before I start getting suspicious .
I think Iran would be foolish to let matters in Iraq unfold without trying to influence it .
It ’s in their best interest to meddle .
That does n’t mean I support it .
I prefer they did n’t .
But it ’s not a realistic option .
I presume the dark forces on our side are making sure any Iranian offenses are being met with consequences , and I ’m all for that .
I also support Israel ’s actions in pursuit of its self - interest .
I ’d be a hypocrite to do otherwise , since I also support the United States , despite what it did to the Native Americans a few hundred years ago .
At some point you have to release on the past and accept the present realities .
Israel won .
It is n’t going anywhere .
If Israel had an enemy that it could make peace with , then I might feel different .
But it does n’t , so Israel ’s best interests dictate keeping the neighbors too economically weak to purchase expensive weapons , and to control as much territory as possible .
I do n’t begrudge any country that makes rational decisions in support of its own safety .
I do n’t even begrudge Israel ’s influence on American foreign policy .
I respect them for how well they do it .
Still , the bulk of my sympathies are with whatever group suffers the most , regardless of how much of the problem is their own damned fault .
To feel otherwise would be inhuman .
Sometimes it feels as if the Palestinians are only one Gandhi away from fixing their problems .
But he ’d need to be bulletproof .
Here ’s your hypothetical question of the day :
If it ever happened that America attacked Iran because of alleged nukes , and later confirmed it had no nuclear weapons program , and we discovered that the administration knew it all along , would it be in the best interest of the citizens of the United States to overthrow their government ?
Arc is finally released as a ( by the sound of it ) wildly unfinished snapshot .
In his notes about the decision , Paul expounds on the rationale for his design decisions to do things like skip Unicode support 1 and write HTML libraries that output presentational tables .
Let ’s take two quotations and put them next to each other .
One is always a bit sheepish about writing quick and dirty programs .
And yet some , if not most , of the best programs began that way .
And some , if not most , of the most spectacular failures in software have been perpetrated by people trying to do the opposite .
So experience suggests we should embrace dirtiness .
Or at least some forms of it ; in other ways , the best quick - and - dirty programs are usually quite clean .
Which kind of dirtiness is bad and which is good ?
The best kind of quick and dirty programs seem to be ones that are mathematically elegant , but missing features – [ … ]
Arc tries to be a language that ’s dirty in the right ways . [ … ]
The kind of dirtiness Arc seeks to avoid is verbose , repetitive source code .
The way you avoid that is not by forbidding programmers to write it , but by making it easy to write code that ’s compact .
One of the things I did while I was writing Arc was to comb through applications asking : what can I do to the language to make this shorter ?
Clearly , the way to make programs written in the language shorter is to force them to deal with Unicode on their own .
He does make an effort to poison the well by saying that people who would care about these things probably would n’t like Arc much to begin with .
Maybe the fact that I happen to speak all of Greek , German and English means that I should n’t have an interest in Arc , then .
Note I ’m not saying it ’s necessary for the first unfinished cut of a language to have Unicode support ; but Paul seems to go rather beyond saying that .
Note further than I do n’t care one whit about his silly claims that presentational markup is the right kind of dirtiness : that can always be fixed by libraries .
Character strings , however , are something that you really do need to get right at the core language level .
You can not leave strings for the libraries to fix .
If you think that that ’s a viable route , I have a bridge to sell you .
And it ’s written in C ++.
Consider next that he mentions up front that it took Guido van Rossum the entire last year to rework Python ’s character string support because of back - compatibility issues .
( Other languages have had similar experiences . )
Leaving Unicode support in a language “ for later ” means you will spend a huge chunk of time sometime in the future to put it into the language – or you wo n’t , and then programs written in that language will forever be verbose when dealing with strings .
The right kind of dirty ?
Footnotes :
Yesterday , in a bid to reassure nervous investors , Federal Reserve chief , Ben Bernanke , announced that the central bank was going to try to put the toothpaste back into the tube .
The markets were n't impressed by Bernanke 's hint that the Fed is ready to cut half a precent off the Fed Rate at the end of this month .
There was a time , a couple of years ago , when the Fed could have made a difference , not by cutting rates , but raising them to cool the overheated housing market .
But the Fed ( and Federal banking regulators ) succumbed to pressure from the lenders , builders , Security dealers and Realtors who were feasting off the bubble easy credit had created .
Back then no one was interested in lectures from the Fed on sustainability or risk .
Then was the time to reel them in , kicking and screaming and accusing the Fed of driving the economy into the tank with higher interest rates .
If they had the market would not be in the tank , and heading into recession today .
Here 's why Fed rates cuts now will not -- cannot -- work .
First here are the only choices the Fed has to choose from now :
1 ) Avoid a recession by sparking inflation
2 ) Avoid inflation by causing a recession
3 ) Have both at the same time -- stagflation .
Option 1 ) The Fed could try to avoid a recession by lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply .
The idea would be to encourage more borrowing and another round of consumer spending .
That would do it , at least in the short run .
But that would just put things back where they were before the housing bubble burst .
Consumers are already burdened by more debt than they can manage .
And the combination of more borrowing and an economy awash in printed money would surely ignite raging inflation .
Once that happens everyone starts chasing their own tail .
Workers demand a raise to keep up with the cost of living .
Those higher wages spark more inflation .
Consumers can feel their cash losing value in their wallets and purses and therefore exchange ( spend ) them for " stuff " because " stuff " at least is increasing in value .
The demand for " stuff " thusly drives the price of " stuff " even higher .. and on and on it goes .
( Gold hit $ 900 an oz .
today , not because gold is intrinsically worth that , but because gold is the " stuff " of choice for investors when paper money starts losing value . )
Option 2 ) The inevitable surge in inflation would eventually force the Fed to increase interest rates .
But raising rates would drive already debt - burdened consumers even deeper into trouble .
Credit card companies tie their rates to benchmark rates , like the prime rate .
Then they add their usurious mark up to that .
So , when the Fed raises it 's rate it trickles through the entire system .
Credit card rates jump from an already unconscionable 20 % to $ 25 % .
Be one day late on paying your monthly minimum payment and that rate can soar above 30 % .
( Eat your heart of out John Gotti . )
And then there 's the already moribund housing market .
Higher interest rates now would be like trying to cure a guy with cirrhosis of the liver by putting him on a straight moonshine diet .
Option 3 ) Stagflation is often described as getting hit with the worst aspects of a recession and runaway inflation at the same time .
I lived through the last bout of stagflation , during the Carter administration .
His predecessor , Gerald Ford , had left things in quite a hash , and it only got worse during the Carter administration .
All Ford did was have a few lapel buttons printed up that read : W.I.N. -- which stood for " Whip Inflation Now ! "
Somewhere in the bowels of the Capitol or in a dark corner of the White House basement are boxes full of rusting and dusty WIN buttons .
At this point in time , stagflation this looks like the most likely outcome of the troubles that face the economy .
If we get out of this mess with just a three or four years of stagflation , we should consider ourselves lucky because , with Options 1 & 2 clearly not a solution , stagflation is the only option standing in way of an old - time depression .
The markets know that too .
Which is why Bernanke 's rate cut promise yesterday was met this morning with a resounding vote of no confidence from Wall Street .
That should be no surprise since Wall Street firms , having had a big hand in creating this mess in the first place , may be the only folks on earth who know where all the investment zombies they created are hidden .
As for Bernanke 's promise that the Fed is ready to do whatever it can to head off recession , it 's not that it 's too little , it 's that it 's too late .
Fed inaction when they really could have had a meaningful impact , had now made the Federal Reserve all but irrelevant .
Bernanke is now just another captive rider on the roll coaster with the rest of us .
I wonder if he 'll scream ?

Electrochemical DNA biosensors are a growing field and a new study published in PLoS Biology shows that the next generation in odor detection technology could involve artifical noses based on DNA .
The study demonstrates a previously unreported property of deoxyribonucleic acid ; single - stranded DNA molecules tagged with a fluorescent reporter and dried onto solid surfaces can respond to vapor phase odor pulses in a sequence - selective manner .
In the context of detecting chemicals in either the aqueous or vapor phase , two general biological approaches have emerged .
The first relies on individual , highly specific single receptors ( sensors ) , each tuned to detect a single molecular species .
Some examples include the receptors that mediate pheromone detection in insects , or those that function in neurotransmission .
The second approach , represented by the DNA sensors , is implemented by arrays of receptors with relatively broad responses .
Here , specificity emerges from a constellation of receptor types that recognizes the molecule of interest .
An example is the olfactory receptors in the main olfactory system of vertebrates .
This study not only highlights DNA ’s potential for use in a novel and powerful odor detection system , but it also highlights its potential to play other novel roles in vivo , for example as a small molecule receptor , well outside of its familiar one as the repository of information in the genome .

As part of our ongoing efforts to build a small classroom planetarium at our school , we have opted not to go with a package deal from a single vendor and instead assemble components from different vendors .
Along the way we ’ve discovered some interesting gear that might be of interest to some other developers of immersive projection systems for flight simulators , gamers , photographers , and others , so I thought we ’d share the current state of our project as a sort of preview , and I ’ll follow up later this year with a report on the actual installation when it is up and running .
The Screen
The short version for the non-astronomer is that we are basically building a giant hemispherical screen with a 180 degree computer projector in the center .
The projected image we plan to use will be a planetarium program such as Celestia or Stellarium , but if you succeed in installing a setup like ours you could also use it to project Quicktime panoramas , flight simulator screens , and , of course , video games .
Our “ screen ” is a hemispherical fiberglass dome manufactured by Astro - Tec of Canal Fulton , Ohio .
They make one standard size of such a dome , and it is fifteen feet in diameter .
For the purchase price we paid , approximately $ 22,000 , we expect to get a complete dome with a mounting frame underneath to allow us to tilt the dome forward instead of the more traditional horizontal arrangement .
The dome consists of gores like the slices of an orange with a cap for the top , which can be later sealed and painted to conceal them when in use .
Astro -Tec has been very good about communicating with us about the dome design , and we will hope to take delivery of the dome in a couple of months .
There is another manufacturer of small planetarium domes , MMI Corporation .
They were unable to assist us in mounting the dome in a tilted position , but otherwise they offer a similar product .
Their dome is slightly larger , but as far as I know there is no provision for “ sealing ” the seams .
We do plan to purchase a projector from MMI in the near future .
One thing we learned from this process is that you cannot use a blank white dome for this sorts of project ; glare from any bright projected object such as a full moon would light up the whole dome and spoil the effect .
Although the dome is light - tight , we ’re going to paint the surrounding room black to absorb stray light and then paint the interior of the dome some darker shade of off white , perhaps 40 % black paint mixed with 60 % white , so the glare is reduced .
As we ’ve noted in our inflatable Starlab planetarium , a gray surface actually looks great under dim lighting conditions – you simply cannot tell it is anything other than black when not lit , white when stars are projected .
As far as domes or “ spherical screens ” go , there are at least two other alternatives to the route we chose .
You could go with an inflatable dome , for which the industry standard is the well - known Starlab dome .
A dome with blower and no star projector can be purchased for about $ 6,500 .
If you are trying to be even more budget conscious , you could build a hemispherical projection screen from cardboard using our instructions posted at A Planetarium for Every Classroom .
It would be a relatively simple matter to create a dome nearly the size of most living rooms .
The cardboard triangles of the geodesic dome can be sealed with tape and painted to be nearly seamless .
We painted our original dome white , but we would use a darker shade than what we originally used given what we know now .
The Projector
Finally , for us , there is the primary electronic projector .
For this project I got several interesting bids for all - dome digital projectors .
Based on a tip from a reader of this column who works for Stanford University , we selected a projector from Elumenati , LLC .
They make a variety of wide - angle projectors with a base price of $ 7,900 for the most basic model , which we purchased .
The only other bids we received were on the order of $ 150,000 for a new projector – obviously for a higher quality device .
Unfortunately this exceeded our entire budget .
We tested the projector the other day in a darkened room , and the results seem promising .
The projector is called a HAL - 1200a and has the following specifications : XGA ( 1204 x768 resolution ) , 400:1 contrast ratio , 7.8 lbs .
Our model is not meant to be moved around much ; the model 1200 ( sans a ) is more portable but somewhat more expensive .
The important part for planetarium construction is that you need to have your dome people talk to your projector people so you can find out what specific shade of grey you want the dome to be painted .
We ’ve pretty much completed that process and will be awaiting our dome to be constructed and shipped later this year .
I ’ll write a followup with pictures as the project progresses , but one thing occurs to me – the dome can be used for other purposes .
I intend to load a QuickTime VR of the Parthenon in the projector and see how it looks ; there will probably be some distortion , but it ought to work as a proof of concept .
It ’ll be interesting to see some video games in the dome .
That would be an interesting way for traditional planetariums to increase foot traffic over the traditional rock - music - and - laser - show crowd , would n’t it ?

Democratic - led Ethics Committee drags their feet on Larry Craig John Byrne
Published : Wednesday November 14 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This The Senate Ethics Committee investigation of Sen. Larry Craig ( R - ID ) is moving forward .
In typical congressional fashion , the inquiry is moving at a snail - like pace .
None of the players have been contacted except Craig , according to Rachel Van Dongen , writing in the paid registration - restricted Roll Call .
The Idaho Republican 's legal saga began in June when he was arrested for what police said were attempts to solicit an undercover officer in a men's room at the Minneapolis airport .
He pleaded guilty to a reduced charge in an apparent attempt to keep the story of his arrest hidden .
In October , a Minnesota judge denied Sen. Larry Craig 's attempt to withdraw his guilty plea after he was caught up in a public - restroom sex sting .
Craig 's guilty plea to disorderly conduct was " accurate , voluntary and intelligent " and " the conviction is supported by the evidence , " the judge wrote .
The Idaho Senator said he wo n't leave the Senate , despite the fact he said he'd be stepping down in the weeks following the arrest 's revelation in late August .
" As in past Ethics probes , the committee could rely for its investigation on Craigs guilty plea and other public records in the Minnesota legal proceeding in which Craig is attempting to retract that plea , " Van Dongen writes .
" Despite initially stating his intention to resign , Craig has now vowed to remain in the Senate until January 2009 . "
" Regardless , it may be a long time before the secretive panels findings are made public as Senate Ethics rules dictate a long and largely opaque process . "
" According to those rules , a preliminary inquiry can last for as long as the chairman and ranking member of the committee desire and the committees progress may not be made public until the case is dismissed , a letter of admonition is issued or a broader inquiry is opened . "
The public affairs manager for the Minneapolis - St. Paul International Airport Kathleen Bangs told Roll Call that no one from the Senate panel has contacted the airport staff or the local prosecutor .
There 's " not been a single inquiry , " she told the paper .
A spokeswoman for Ethics Committee Chairwoman Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) said last week the probe is underway , " continuing to conduct its preliminary inquiry . 
Ranking Ethics Republican Sen. John Cornyn ( R - TX ) declined to comment .
Craig told the paper he had been contacted by the Committee but did not know the status of the inquiry .

KDE 4.0 Release Candidate 1
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
KDE Project Ships First Release Candidate for Leading Free Software Desktop , Codename " Calamity "
With the first release candidate , the KDE project would like to collect feedback to ensure the quality of KDE 4.0 .
November 20 , 2007 ( The INTERNET ) .
The KDE Community is happy to announce the immediate availability of the first release candidate for KDE 4.0 .
This release candidate marks that the majority of the components of KDE 4.0 are now approaching release quality .
While the final bits of Plasma , the brand new desktop shell and panel in KDE 4 , are falling into place , the KDE community decided to publish a first release candidate for the KDE 4.0 Desktop .
Release Candidate 1 is the first preview of KDE 4.0 which is suitable for general use and discovering the improvements that have taken place all over the KDE codebase .
At the same time , the KDE team releases the final version of the KDE Development Platform , which provides the needed libraries and applications the KDE Desktop is based on .
The KDE Development Platform , comprising the basis for developing KDE applications , is frozen and is now of release quality .
The sourcecode for the KDE Development Platform can be found in the " stable / " subdir on KDE 's FTP server and mirrors .
Building on this , the majority of applications included in KDE 4.0 are now usable for day to day use .
The KDE Release Team has recently underlined this by calling on the community to participate in reporting bugs during the time remaining before the release of KDE 4.0 in December .
Meanwhile , preparations for the KDE 4.0 release events are taking place , with the main event taking place in Mountain View , California in the USA in January 2008 .
Make sure you do n't miss it !
The first release candidate incorporates many improvements from previous Beta and alpha releases : Beta 4 , Beta 3 , Beta 2 , Beta 1 , Alpha 2 and Alpha 1 .
RC 1
With the first release candidate , the KDE developers hope to collect comments and bug reports from the wider KDE community .
With their help , we hope to solve the most pressing problems with the current KDE 4 codebase to ensure the final 4.0 release is usable .
We would like to encourage anyone who is willing and able to spend some time on testing to find and report problems to the KDE developers .
It 's advisable to have a current snapshot of the codebase handy .
That makes trying things easier , it also helps the process by not having to hunt down bugs that have already been fixed .
You can find some documentation on the pages of our Bugsquad and in other places .
There will be weekly KDE 4 Krush Days on Saturdays and everyone is invited to help out .
Having a recent SVN checkout ( follow instructions on TechBase ) is great , but using the regularly updated openSUSE KDE 4 Live CD or the Debian KDE4 Beta4 Live CD , while very easy , is also a big help to us .
Get it , run it , test it ...
For those interested in getting packages to test and contribute , several distributions notified us that they will have KDE 4.0 - rc1 packages available at or soon after the release .
The complete and current list can be found on the KDE 4.0 - rc1 Info Page , where you can also find links to the source code , information about compiling , security and other issues .
About KDE 4
KDE 4 is the next generation of the popular KDE Desktop Environment which seeks to fulfill the need for a powerful yet easy to use desktop for UNIX and LINUX workstations .
The aim of the KDE project for the 4.0 release is to put the foundations in place for future innovations on the Free Desktop .
The many newly introduced technologies incorporated in the KDE libraries will make it easier for developers to add rich functionality to their applications , combining and connecting different components in any way they want .

It seems like malware pushers have found another avenue to delivery their payloads , Embassy websites .
Which makes sense as they are probably not maintained well nor updated often meaning the chance they are easily compromised is quite high .
Plus a lot probably use off the shelf CMS software , which when not updated is a playground for hackers .
Add embassy websites to the growing list of hacked internet destinations trying to infect visitor PCs with malware .
Earlier this week , the site for the Netherlands Embassy in Russia was caught serving a script that tried to dupe people into installing software that made their machines part of a botnet , according to Ofer Elzam , director of product management for eSafe , a business unit of Aladdin that blocks malicious web content from its customers ’ networks .
In November the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia and Ukraine Embassy Web site in Lithuania were found to be launching similar attacks , he says .
Again it just goes to show that a lot of malicious attacks are based around human elements , in this case trust .
People will naturally trust an Embassy website , so if you embed it with a message to download some kind of protective software …a lot of people will do it .
Frequently , the compromised websites launch code that scours a visitor ’s machine for unpatched vulnerabilities in Windows or in applications such as Apple ’s QuickTime media player .
Such was the case in two recent hacking sprees that affected hundreds of thousands of sites , including those of mom-and - pop ecommerce companies and the City of Cleveland .
But in the case of the Netherlands Embassy , the attackers simply included text that instructed visitors to download and install the malware .
Of course , no self - respecting Reg reader would fall for such a ruse .
But sadly , Elzam says , because the instruction is coming from a trusted site , plenty of less savvy users do fall for the ploy .
Saps .
Again we can just educate and spread the news , tell people not to trust any web sites if possible , use md5 hashes , use trusted sources , scan for the viruses etc . .

Yesternight witnessed the first new Daily Show episode that has aired since early November …sans writers .
Yes , that ’s right .
The much publicized return of the Daily Show seemed to be missing a key component : the Emmy award winning writers that actually make the show funny .
In case you missed it the episode can be found here .
I hope you recognize the irony of being able to watch the episodes online ( I almost missed the enormous mastercard ad while I was researching for this post ) .
I think that the highlight of the night was maybe John Stewart ’s “ Solidarity Unibrow ” that he grew over the past few months to show support for his striking brethren .
The sad part is that the unibrow stunt happened in the first few seconds of the show and only went downhill from there .
Overall , the episode could only be described as no less than uncomfortable .
John completely dropped his disarming tone and spoke about the strike and labor issues in general with a completely sarcastic tone .
He was put in a very awkward position , though , it obviously showed .
The WGA refused to make a side deal with Stewart because the Daily Show is owned directly by Viacom , which is one of the WGA ’s main foes .
Sources say that Stewart was furious with the WGA for refusing to make a deal and because he was forced to start his show again by Viacom we are left with a sketchy version of the Daily Show that Stewart aptly named “ a ” Daily Show .
Meanwhile , the strike is coming up on its third month and has marked its first major casualty .
The Golden Globes have been officially cancelled !
That ’s right , actors invited to attend the ceremony simply refused to attend .
This puts a lot of pressure on the studios for later on down the road when the cash whore Oscars come around in late February .
My guess is that the studios will be a little more flexible and be willing to make a deal once they realize that the Oscars being cancelled is at all a possibility .

Meritocracy
Table of Contents
Prev : Refactoring
I ’ve noticed a pattern in software development that very frequently there is a perception that code is code : if you hire somebody that has written code before , then they should be able to write code for you .
It strikes me as being reasonably similar to hiring somebody that speaks English for a job that requires speaking English .
Both a newscaster and a teacher talk as a primary part of their job , but they are certainly not interchangeable .
The same is true in software development .
All tasks have a domain knowledge component .
Sometimes it is large and sometimes it is small .
The larger it is , the larger the risk of problems if someone without the requisite domain knowledge is assigned tasks in that domain .
The biggest risk associated with changes made by somebody who is not a domain expert is that most domains have aspects which are counterintuitive .
Code that looks “ obviously ” wrong can be completely correct and conversely code that seems right can be completely wrong .
Changes to that code may seem to work because they pass the test suite .
It is often useful to look at an extreme version of an issue to discover a robust solution .
In this case , an extreme example would be a code base that is maintained by volunteers and that anybody in the world is welcome to volunteer for .
The volunteers may or may not provide a resume , they may use a pseudonym , and you might only know them via e-mail .
How can you operate in such a situation ?
This example should sound familiar .
It is the Open Source Software ( OSS ) development model as practiced by OSS development projects such as Apache .
Apache handles this problem via a system that they characterize as a “ meritocracy . ”
Basically , you start out with read - only access to the system .
You can propose changes via patches , and if you propose a change which is approved , your credibility increases in the area that you contributed .
Over time , you can earn write access to more and more of the system and can eventually become one of the people doing the approvals .
Meritocracy allows developers to contribute outside of their traditional areas , to build trust in their capabilities , and to allow them to naturally gravitate to the areas where they are the most effective .
An efficient way to implement meritocracy is to allow developers to create branches where they can implement their ideas .
If they are successful in implementing their idea and the result is accepted , it is then a simple matter to incorporate the change into the development process .
This is currently the last page of the on - line version of the book .

A recent headline indicates a number of disturbing American trends : Father Kills Bear Charging At Son With Log .
First of all , who 's giving these animals logs ?
There 's nothing in the world a respectable bear needs with a log .
If that bear has a log , he has it for one reason : to kill somebody .
It 's clear to any American reader that our animals are going bad .
Every day there 's some story about out - of - control wildlife : Mother Kills Pit Bull Mauling Son With Spatula .
Or : Lover Kills Shark Swimming Towards Daughter With Spear Gun .
Or : Son Stops Mountain Lion Attacking Dad Using Judo .
What are these people thinking ?
Who gives a pit bull a spatula or a shark a spear gun ?
What kind of idiot enrols a mountain lion in a judo class ?
Oh , wait , hang on .
I just went back and read the article .
Turns out the father used the log , to kill the bear .
Actually , that 's what 's wrong with our country : sloppy journalism .
That headline , properly written , would have read : Father Uses Log To Kill Bear , Bear That Was , At That Time , Sans Log Or Any Kind Of Weapon , Charging Son Of Man .
Although that makes it sound as if the bear was charging Christ .
Which - I mean , the article gives no indication that this was the case .
In my opinion , a bear would not last a minute versus Christ .
Especially if you gave Christ a log .
Anyway : sloppy writing , that 's our problem .
Also failure to fact - check .
Look at this one : Man Discovers Picasso Painting In Attic . Hello !
Picasso's dead !
If not , he 's , like , 200 years old , and I doubt he can 1 ) climb the stairs into some dude 's attic or 2 ) paint once he gets there .
In addition to poor fact - checking : bad journalistic ethics .
Take this one : World 's Tallest Man Saves Drowning Girl With Extremely Long Arm .
Why do we need to know the length of the poor girl 's arm ?
If she had a weird voice , would we say , World 's Tallest Man Saves Drowning Girl Who Is Terrible Singer ?
What 's next ?
Fireman Saves Baby Who Looks Exactly Like Yoda ?
What bothers me about that bear story is this American tendency to step in and do everything for our kids .
It would have been better if the father had just handed the kid the log , and said , " Son , throw this , hard , at that bear .
Or you 're dead . "
That way , the kid learns something .
I 'm sure we 've all heard the biblical proverb , " If you teach me to fish , I fish for ever ; if you kill my fish with your log , next time I 'm hungry , I 'm just going to come walking up to you with a log and a live fish . "
Now I just need a title for this column .
Ah , I 've got it : Writer Proves Stupidity Of Americans With Guardian Column .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling has called on Roger Clemens to give up four of his Cy Young Awards if he cannot clear his name after allegations in the Mitchell report that he used steroids .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
While Clemens has denied allegations detailed by former Sen. George Mitchell ’s report into doping in Major League Baseball , Schilling wrote in his blog ( 38 pitches.com ) that he believes Clemens must take legal action to prove his innocence .
“ Roger has denied every allegation brought to the table , ” Schilling wrote .
“ So as a fan my thought is that Roger will find a way in short order to organize a legal team to guarantee a retraction of the allegations made , a public apology is made , and his name is completely cleared .
“ If he does n’t do that then there are n’t many options as a fan for me other than to believe his career 192 wins and three Cy Youngs he won prior to 1997 were the end .
“ From that point on the numbers were attained through using PEDs ( performance enhancing drugs ) ... if that is the case with Roger , the four Cy Youngs should go to the rightful winners and the numbers should go away if he cannot refute the accusations . ”
PROFOUND EFFECT
Clemens , 45 , who was 6 - 6 last season for the Yankees after joining them midway through the campaign , has won seven Cy Young Awards overall as best pitcher in his league and has a career total of 354 wins , eighth on the all - time list .
Schilling , 41 , a 20 - year veteran , has compiled 216 career wins and claimed Most Valuable Player honors from the 2001 World Series and from the 1993 National League Championship Series .
He said he had always looked up to Clemens .
“ Roger had a profound effect on my career from a very early point .
His ‘ undressing ’ of me and lecture were a major turning point , ” Schilling wrote about advice he received early in his career from Clemens .
“ I ’ve always respected his career accomplishments and regarded him as the greatest pitcher to ever play the game . ”
To perform their tricky job , speed cameras sometimes resort to camouflage ...
The pictures are telling .

No pictures available of the Australian ones , but check out what the South Australian Government says about the new garbage speed radars :
Acting Transport Minister Paul Holloway says police and Transport SA will begin trialling the wheelie bin cameras in locations where it is too dangerous to mount a speed camera in a car .
Mr Holloway says the State Government 's aim is to reduce the road toll .
" We do have a particularly poor record [ and ] we were the worst of all the states when this Government came to office , " he said .
" We do need to continue to work and look , this new trial of putting a camera in a wheelie bin is just one way in which we can add to the armoury of police . "

JavaScriptをより深く知りたい人のための当連載、前回のイントロダクションに続き、今回が実質的な第一回目です。今回は、本格的にプログラミングテクニックの話に入る前に、JavaScriptの歴史や現状のお話をしてみたいと思います。
昔「何となく 」 でJavaScriptを書いていたころは、私もJavaScriptについての背景などあまり興味がありませんでした。しかし、当連載で今後扱うようなJavaScriptの高度な機能を知るにつけ「これって他のブラウザでも使えるのか？」などの疑問が生じ始めました。そこで詳しく調べていくと、ECMAScriptという標準規格があったり、ブラウザ以外でも動作する環境があったり、ということを知ったわけです。
JavaScriptはこれからも大きく発展する可能性のある技術です。そうした進化に追随していくためにも、まず現状をしっかり把握してみましょう。
JavaScriptの簡単な歴史
JavaScriptは、1995年にリリースされた、Netscape Navigator 2.0に初めて搭載された言語です。動的なWebページを簡単に作成できることから、非常に人気を博しました。その後Internet Explorerに搭載されるようになると、ブラウザ間でのJavaScriptの互換性が問題となりました。
そこでECMAインターナショナルと言う標準化団体により、JavaScriptの核となる言語仕様が標準化されるにいたりました。それがECMAScriptです。きちんと標準化した仕様が存在するようになったことで、ブラウザ間の互換性もある程度担保されるようになったのです。
ECMAScript自体の仕様は、1999年に標準化されたバージョン3 ( ECMA-262)以来ほとんど変わっていません。このように、言語仕様自体が成熟して落ち着いていることも、現在のJavaScriptの隆盛に一役買っているといっていいでしょう。
ECMAScriptとJavaScript
JavaScriptという実装からECMAScriptへの標準化が行われたという経緯がありますので、両者には異なるバージョン番号が振られています。
現在のブラウザの多くが対応しているECMAScriptのバージョンは3で、JavaScript 1.5と呼ばれることも少なくありません。
ECMAScriptは現在バージョン4が仕様策定中で、後方互換性を保ちつつも非常に広範な機能強化が行われる予定です（あまりに強化が多すぎて、ブラウザがきちんと追随するかどうか不安なほどです）。Mozillaは、ECMAScript4に対応したJavaScriptのバージョンを「2.0」とする予定だとしています。
余談ですが 、Flash Player上で動作するActionScriptという言語では、ECMAScript
4の仕様をいち早く取り入れて実装しています。クラスや継承、インターフェースなどの機能を試してみたい方は、一度ActionScriptを触ってみるとよいでしょう。

とはいえ、要素が多すぎて一見して全体像をつかむのは難しいですね。以下にポイントを説明しましょう。
In his article in The Atlantic , Jonathan Rauch really hit the nail on the head with his description of introversion :
Do you know someone who needs hours alone every day ?
Who loves quiet conversations about feelings or ideas , and can give a dynamite presentation to a big audience , but seems awkward in groups and maladroit at small talk ?
Who has to be dragged to parties and then needs the rest of the day to recuperate ?
Who growls or scowls or grunts or winces when accosted with pleasantries by people who are just trying to be nice ?
If so , do you tell this person he is “ too serious , ” or ask if he is okay ?
Regard him as aloof , arrogant , rude ?
Redouble your efforts to draw him out ?
If you answered yes to these questions , chances are that you have an introvert on your hands — and that you are n’t caring for him properly .
It ’s embarrassing to be one of the last to know .
I ’m 51 and I ’ve always prided myself at taking the time to learn about the inner workings of human cognition .
My own way of processing information should not have so easily slipped under my own radar .
Further , over the years , hundreds of people have plainly told me that my way of thinking is “ different ”
Without really understanding why , I ’ve developed dozens of ready - to - roll reasons for declining social gatherings , especially where I suspect that chit- chat ( gossip , television & movies , sports ) will prevail .
When I ca n’t get out of such gatherings , I commonly feel the anxiety building .
I ’ve never tolerated gatherings of people ( especially large gatherings ) as well as most others .
I do need people , though , and I seek them out , but only in measured doses .
I ’ve known and used the term “ introvert ” for many years , but I ’m only now beginning to understand the full consequences of being an introvert .
Until recently , I merely understood that I am not as comfortable spending time with people .
I did n’t realize ( as Rauch details in his article ) , that introverts can pay a huge price , psychologically and physiologically , if they socialize beyond their limit .
The effects of their introversion also go far beyond socializing .
Recently , I ’ve taken a few tests to see whether I ’m introverted ( see below ) .
It turns out that I ’m off - the - charts introverted .
Hence , my compelling interest in this topic .
I ’ve recently read some other materials on “ Introversion . ”
It ’s been incredible to learn that experts on introversion , people who have never met me , understand me so well .
It feels like decades of my frustration have been explained .
Then again , “ explanation ” is a loaded word .
Despite my recent foray into some serious literature on introversion , I do n’t really know why I ’m an introvert .
Instead , I ’ve merely come to realize that many other people ( apparently 25 % of the population ) respond to gatherings of people much like I do .
Though I do n’t really know why I am the way I am , I know that this “ thing ” is a commonly - encountered constellation of traits , emotions and impulses .
I now realize that what I have is one of the many forms of normalcy .
Howard Gardner touched on this issue of introversion when he included inter-personal intelligence as one of his multiple intelligences .
Extroversion does , indeed , seem to be a specialized set of skills that qualifies as a distinct form of intelligence .
People who excel at math do n’t necessarily have proficient social skills and vice - versa .
Marti Laney , a self - described introvert , dug deeply into this topic of introversion , resulting in her 2002 book , The Introvert Advantage : How to Thrive in an Extrovert World .
Although Laney ’s advice is sometimes a bit too predictable , her descriptions of introversion are insightful and detailed .
She notes that many introverts struggle when they judge themselves to the numerous extroverts in their homes , schools and workplaces .
They end up criticizing themselves for their own introverted qualities .
When they take the time to learn about introversion , they end up relieved to hear that their brains are merely different ( not inferior ) to those of the extroverts and that their way of thinking even offers some advantages over the techniques usually used by extroverts .
They also learned that their introversion will affect numerous areas of their life .
They learn that their introversion might well be the cause for the common experience of feeling “ drained and over - stimulated . ”
Here is Laney ’s description of introverts :
The strongest distinguishing characteristic of introverts is their energy source : introverts draw energy from the internal world of ideas , emotions and impressions .
They are energy conservers .
They can be easily over - stimulated by the external world , experiencing the uncomfortable feeling of “ too much . ”
This can feel like antsyness or torpor .
In either case , they need to limit their social experiences so they do n’t get drained .
However , introverts need to balance their alone time with outside time , or they can lose other perspectives and connections .
Introverted people who balance their energy and have perseverance and the ability to think independently , focus deeply , and work creatively .
( p. 19 ) .
Laney makes it clear that introverts are “ energized by the internal world–by ideas , impressions and emotions . ”
She warns , however , that introverts are not necessarily quiet :
their focus is inside their heads .
They need a quiet , reflective place where they can think things through and recharge themselves .
. .. introverts enjoy complexity when they can focus on one or two areas , without pressure .
But if they have too many projects , they easily feel overwhelmed .
Just being around people can be overstimulating to introverts .
Their energy is drained in crowds , classes , or any noisy or invasive environment .
They may like people very much , but after talking to anyone , they usually begin to feel the need to move away , take a break , and get some air .
This is the reason for their mind / vapor - lock experience .
. . .
When overstimulated , the introvert ’s mind can shut down , saying , “ no more input , please . ”
It goes dark .
Introverts like depth and will limit their experiences but feel each of them deeply .
Often , they have fewer friends but more intimacy .
They like to delve deeply into topics and look for “ richness ” more than “ muchness . ”
This is why it ’s necessary to limit their topics to one or two , or they can become overwhelmed .
Their mind absorbs information from the outside environment and then reflects on it and expands it .
And long after they have taken in the information , they are still munching and crunching it–a little like cows chewing their cud .
Extroverts think and talk all at one time .
It is effortless to them .
In fact , things become clearer as they speak out loud .
Introverts , on the other hand , need time to think and do n’t speak with spontaneity unless it ’s a familiar subject .
Introverts can appear cautious or passive to extroverts .
Introverts , Jung wrote , conserve their energy , have fewer children , have more ways of protecting themselves , and live longer .
Because they appreciate a simpler life , make intimate attachments , and plan and reflect on new ways of doing things , they encourage others to be prudent , develop self - reflection , and think before acting .
Laney recognizes that introverts are often confused , that they sometimes enjoy socializing and noisy and overcrowded groups , while at other times , they are overwhelmed and depleted .
This is not unusual , in her research .
Introverts can do quite well in social situations , at least for relatively shorter intervals than extroverts , as long as they have a chance to get away from people to recharge and rest .
Starting on page 163 of her book , Laney offers numerous suggestions for getting out of social occasions or limiting one ’s participation in such gatherings .
Laney strongly encourages introverts to come clean with their extrovert friends and co-workers .
This will avoid misunderstandings and facilitate working relationships , in her view .
Laney is n’t the only person riding on this topic , of course .
Nor does she speak for everyone else who writes about those people like me who get overwhelmed in social situations .
Elaine Aron would prefer to characterize introverts as a common type of a person who is highly sensitive .
A Highly Sensitive Person ( HSP ) “ has a sensitive nervous system , is aware of subtleties in his / her surroundings , and is more easily overwhelmed when in a highly stimulating environment . ”
On her website , Aron offers a test for determining whether you ’re a highly sensitive person .
Here are some of the characteristic behaviors of highly sensitive people :
Are you easily overwhelmed by such things as bright lights , strong smells , coarse fabrics , or sirens nearby ?
Do you get rattled when you have a lot to do in a short amount of time ?
Do you make a point of avoiding violent movies and TV shows ?
Do you need to withdraw during busy days , into bed or a darkened room or some other place where you can have privacy and relief from the situation ?
Do you make it a high priority to arrange your life to avoid upsetting or overwhelming situations ?
Do you notice or enjoy delicate or fine scents , tastes , sounds , or works of art ?
Do you have a rich and complex inner life ?
When you were a child , did your parents or teachers see you as sensitive or shy ?
According to Aron , not all highly sensitive people are introverts .
But then again , Aron and Laney have much overlap in the people they are attempting to assist and the type of advice they are offering :
[ I ] n the past HSPs have been called “ shy , ” “ timid , ” “ inhibited , ” or “ introverted , ” but these labels completely miss the nature of the trait .
Thirty percent of HSPs are actually extraverts .
HSPs only appear inhibited because they are so aware of all the possibilities in a situation .
They pause before acting , reflecting on their past experiences .
If these were mostly bad experiences , then yes , they will be truly shy .
But in a culture that prefers confident , “ bold ” extraverts , it is harmful as well as mistaken to stigmatize all HSPs as shy when many are not .
I have a long way to go in reviewing this literature of people that remind me of myself .
Stumbling upon this topic has been a real eye - opener for me .
I am sharing it now , in this form ( not thoroughly chewed like cud ) , with the hope that there are others like me out there who could use a little reassurance and encouragement regarding the way your mind works .
It ’s that “ thing ” that makes your life , in equal parts , more frustrating and enriching .

CBS :
After six years , the liberation of Afghanistan has become a triumph without victory .
The fighting is the greatest it has been since the beginning of the war and more civilians are dying .
In fact , 60 Minutes was surprised to hear this : while the enemy has killed hundreds of civilians this year , a similar number of civilians have been killed by American forces .
With relatively few troops there , the U.S. and NATO rely on air power .
The number of civilians killed in air strikes has doubled .
60 Minutes wondered whether civilian deaths are undermining the effort to win the Afghan people .
You think ?
This is the part that stood out :
" There 's this macabre kind of calculus that the military goes through on every air strike , where they try to figure out how many dead civilians is dead bad guy worth , " says Marc Garlasco , who knows the calculus of civilian casualties as well as anyone .[.. ]
" Our number was 30 .
So , for example , Saddam Hussein .
If you 're gonna kill up to 29 people in a strike against Saddam Hussein , that 's not a problem , " Garlasco explains .
" But once you hit that number 30 , we actually had to go to either President Bush , or Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld . "
Garlasco says , before the invasion of Iraq , he recommended 50 air strikes aimed at high - value targets -- Iraqi officials .
But he says none of the targets on the list were actually killed .
Instead , he says , " a couple of hundred civilians at least " were killed .
The full video and transcripts are available on CBS 's website .

Correction appended .
When Hillary Clinton is good on the Sunday talk shows , she is really , really good .
But when she is bad , she ’s atrocious .
When she talks about policy , she will dazzle you .
When her own ambitions are on the line , it ’s time to reach for the sick bag .
On “ Meet the Press ” Sunday , it was the latter .
Clinton refused to admit any real errors .
She implied that Barack Obama is unfit to be president , without ever honestly taking responsibility for what she actually believes .
She broadcast her own humility : “ You know , I ’m very other - directed .
I do n’t like talking about myself . ”
She also described the central role she plays in the lives of all living creatures in the universe : “ The Iraqi government , they watch us , they listen to us .
I know very well that they follow everything that I say . ”
But Clinton ’s real problem is that she is caught in a trap , which you might call The Identity Trap .
Both Clinton and Obama have eagerly donned the mantle of identity politics .
A Clinton victory would n’t just be a victory for one woman , it would be a victory for little girls everywhere .
An Obama victory would be about completing the dream , keeping the dream alive , and so on .

Columbia , S.C .
The political mantra this year is “ change . ”
But South Carolina , where the Confederate flag still flies on the grounds of the State Capitol , is a disturbing example of how difficult it is for people of good will to dispose of the toxic layers of bigotry that have accumulated over several long centuries .
On Saturday , in a cold , steady rain , voters turned out for the Republican primary .
Nearly all of them  close to 100 percent  were white .
At a dinner here Saturday night , I was reminded ruefully by one of the guests : “ It used to be the Democratic Party that was the white man ’s party in South Carolina .
Now it ’s the G.O.P .
The black people vote next Saturday . ”
They still honor Benjamin Tillman down here , which is very much like honoring a malignant tumor .
A statue of Tillman , who was known as Pitchfork Ben , is on prominent display outside the statehouse .
Tillman served as governor and U.S. senator in the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
A mortal enemy of black people , he bragged that he and his followers had disenfranchised “ as many as we could , ” and he publicly defended the murder of blacks .
Tom Van Baak has set up an atomic - clock lab at his home in his Bellevue , Washington . *
Photo : Quinn Norton * View Slideshow BELLEVUE , Washington – Tom Van Baak 's spare upstairs bedroom looks like a cross between the control center of a remote polar outpost and the inner sanctum of a Victorian mad scientist .
In reality , it 's a home - built lab dedicated to the study of time .
One wall is stacked with a small museum 's worth of old nautical clocks , thin slabs of quartz , vacuum tubes of unknown purpose and a few metronomes .
Another wall is dominated by shelves overflowing with metal boxes sporting dials , knobs , flashing LEDs and constantly shifting digital displays .
A sealed metal cylinder resting on a paint - splattered stepladder bears the not - quite - reassuring sticker , " Cesium Device .
Not Radioactive . "
" If you have one clock ... you are peaceful and have no worries , " says Van Baak , fingering a length of cable connecting two of his machines .
" If you have two clocks ... you start asking , ' What time is it , really ? ' "
Van Baak is in a better position to answer that question than most .
He 's part of a community of about 400 geek hobbyists taking advantage of a glut of surplus precision timekeeping gear to pursue a serious interest in very precise timekeeping .
They call themselves Time Nuts , and they spend their spare cycles collecting , repairing , tweaking – and occasionally using – super - precise clocks .
With the end of the Cold War , and with telecommunications technology advancing rapidly , surplus stores and eBay have filled up with discarded precision time equipment once beyond the reach of all but governments .
Cesium clocks , rubidium clocks and even the occasional hydrogen maser can be had for less than a decent laptop .
A recent search on eBay turned up an HP 5061B cesium standard for sale for $ 2,000 , and you can get a telecom surplus rubidium standard for less than $ 400 .
Some of this equipment costs upwards of $ 50,000 new .
Their access to once - forbidden technology lets the time hackers play in a realm of precision that underpins the modern technological world .
A select few , like Van Baak , have started exploring the underpinnings of the universe .
A retired Unix kernel programmer , Van Baak began buying time instruments a decade ago , slowly building what today is probably the best - equipped , individually owned time lab in the world , exceeding the capability of many national labs .
His gear lets him perform some impressive experiments .
Two years ago , he realized he 'd acquired the capability to offer his children a demonstration of one of the effects predicted by Einstein 's general theory of relativity – a demonstration that Einstein himself could n't have performed with the equipment of his day .
The theory says time passes slowly for someone near a massive object , as measured relative to someone farther away .
On Earth , this effect is so small as to be undetectable to all but the most precise equipment , putting demonstrations beyond the reach of , say , a typical high school science fair .
Consequently , " kids grow up thinking relativity is only for really fast speeds or really heavy gravity , " says Van Baak .
He wanted his children to see that relativity is proportional .
So he loaded the family 's blue minivan with portable power supplies , monitoring equipment , and three HP 5071 cesium clocks .
Three , because time is always marked relative to other clocks :
More clocks mean more accurate time .
With his three kids and some camping gear in tow , he drove the winding roads spiraling up Washington 's Mt. Rainier and checked the family into a lodge 5,319 feet above sea level .
They hiked the trails , and the kids relaxed with board games and books , while in the imperceptibly lessened gravity , time moved a little bit faster than at home .
Van Baak found himself explaining to park rangers more than once why a minivan filled with inscrutable equipment was idling in front of the national park lodge for hours on end .
But the effort paid off .
When the family returned to the suburbs two days later , the cesium clocks were off by the precise amount relativity predicted .
He and his family had lived just a little more life than the neighbors .
" It was the best extra 22 nanoseconds I 've ever spent with the kids , " Van Baak says .
Existential thrills aside , the Time Nuts dabble in the practical as well .
John Ackerman , an attorney with a technology company , offers super - accurate time over the internet to anyone who wants it , courtesy of four of the most accurate NTP ( network time protocol ) servers in the world .
Located in a pegboard - lined basement in his Dayton , Ohio home , three of Ackerman 's servers use external sources : GPS and LORAN - C navigation broadcasts , and the WWVB radio station that broadcasts U.S. standard time from the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder .
His fourth machine , though , is the most impressive :
It has its own cesium clock .
A rack - mounted PC watches the cesium clock 's output and uses it to keep the other clocks in line during the microsecond chasms between broadcast pings .
Ackerman fell into the time rabbit hole while practicing his other hobby , ham radio .
Precise frequencies are important when trying to get to the right bit of radio spectrum , and from his pursuit of the perfect frequency it was easy to get drawn into clocks .
" It led me into buying all sorts of crap from eBay , " he admits .
It 's a hobby that feeds on itself : A good clock always needs a better clock to set it .
" You always have to have a reference frequency , " says Ackerman .
" If you get the next new good thing ... you have to measure it against something even better . "
It 's a source of pride to Ackerman that his four machines keep time within 100 nanoseconds of each other .
That fastidiousness is typical in both the amateur and professional timekeeping communities , where people are drawn first to the idea of finding precision in the physical world .
Consistently , they tell stories of an early fascination with looking ever closer at something , trying to understand its exact boundaries .
Fundamental to the field of precise time is that it will never be perfect .
With every new level of accuracy comes a new frame of reference for error .
Time has an intractable precision – you can spend your days always moving closer to the ever - unreachable now .
The time hackers ' commitment has earned them the respect of professional horologists , some of whom lurk on the Time Nuts mailing list to offer advice – or even unofficial tech support .
One participant , Rick Karlquist , is a celebrity of sorts in the group .
Now an electrical engineer for Agilent Labs , in the 1980s Karlquist helped design two of the precision clocks now showing up in the surplus market .
At Agilent 's Sunnyvale , California , campus , Karlquist shows off one of his inventions .
It 's a " hockey puck " – a silver discus on a circuit board the size of a PC card slot .
Inside is a quartz - crystal - based oscillator that can keep its accuracy through 100 - degree Celsius variations in temperature .
Originally designed for Qualcomm CDMA towers , this was the clock that could keep you talking from Barrow , Alaska , to Phoenix , Arizona .
Now , it 's a popular plaything in the hands of the Time Nuts , who appreciate its legendary indestructibility .
Karlquist 's other achievement is the HP 5071 cesium clock – the model Van Baak hauled up the slopes of Mt. Rainier .
" The 5071 was indisputably the best commercial clock that 's ever been made , " Karlquist says .
There 's consensus on this in the time community .
The 5071 is a damn fine clock , and a rare $ 30,000 find on eBay .
At one point , explains Karlquist , it made up 80 percent of the weighting of international atomic time .
On Agilent 's campus , though , the 5071 is literally a museum piece – an exhibit in a small museum of Agilent devices , most of them dating from when Agilent was Hewlett Packard 's R&D arm .
That 's why Karlquist feels a duty to the Time Nuts – it's how he keeps his creations alive .
" Most of the pro community has moved on , " he says .
" If I did n't support them , it would be impossible to get them to work ....
I can't resist coming in and sounding like an expert , " he says , laughing .
People like Karlquist built a backbone of time technology that stretches from obscure government labs to our mobile phones and e-mail servers .
For curious enthusiasts , the chance to explore and understand that hidden connection is now wide open , and cheap surplus .
" Precision time is the infrastructure on which most modern technology depends , " says Van Baak .
Unlock the black boxes of the computers , travel , telecommunications and transportation , he says , and you get clocks .

Part one of a two - part series .
Tomorrow :
At a government lab in Colorado , the future of precision - clock research is unfolding .
It 's no longer just about keeping accurate time .

Atomic Rulers of the World
Did Quake Speed Earth 's Spin ?
Anybody Really Know What Time Is ?
by Stacy Conradt , Laurel Mills & John Green
Those Disney endings where the prince and the princess end up blissfully married ?
Yeah , they do n't really happen in the original stories .
To make sure kids go home happy , not horrified , Disney usually has to alter the endings .
Read on for the original endings to a couple of Disney classics ( and some more obscure tales ) .
1. Cinderella
Do n't break out your violins for this gal just yet .
All that cruelty poor Cinderella endured at the hands of her overbearing stepmother might have been well deserved .
In the oldest versions of the story , the slightly more sinister Cinderella actually kills her first stepmother so her father will marry the housekeeper instead .
Guess she was n't banking on the housekeeper 's six daughters moving in or that never - ending chore list .
2. Sleeping Beauty
In the original version of the tale , it 's not the kiss of a handsome prince that wakes Sleeping Beauty , but the nudging of her newborn twins .
That 's right .
While unconscious , the princess is impregnated by a monarch and wakes up to find out she 's a mom twice over .
Then , in true Ricki Lake form , Sleeping Beauty 's " baby 's daddy "  triumphantly returns and promises to send for her and the kids later , conveniently forgetting to mention that he 's married .
When the trio is eventually brought to the palace , his wife tries to kill them all , but is thwarted by the king .
In the end , Sleeping Beauty gets to marry the guy who violated her , and they all live happily ever after .
3. Snow White
At the end of the original German version penned by the brothers Grimm , the wicked queen is fatally punished for trying to kill Snow White .
It 's the method she is punished by that is so strange " “ she is made to dance wearing a pair of red - hot iron shoes until she falls over dead .
4. The Little Mermaid
You 're likely familiar with the Disney version of the Little Mermaid story , in which Ariel and her sassy crab friend , Sebastian , overcome the wicked sea witch , and Ariel swims off to marry the man of her dreams .
In Hans Christian Andersen 's original tale , however , the title character can only come on land to be with the handsome prince if she drinks a potion that makes it feel like she is walking on knives at all times .
She does , and you would expect her selfless act to end with the two of them getting married .
Nope .
The prince marries a different woman , and the Little Mermaid throws herself into the sea , where her body dissolves into sea foam .
Now here are four more fairy tales you might not be familiar with , but you might have trouble forgetting .
1. The King Who Wished to Marry His Daughter
What It 's Like : Cinderella , with an incestuous twist
The King 's wife dies and he swears he will never marry again unless he finds a woman who fits perfectly into his dead Queen 's clothes .
Guess what ?
His daughter does !
So he insists on marrying her .
Ew .
Understandably , she has a problem with this and tries to figure out how to avoid wedding dear old dad .
She says she wo n't marry him until she gets a trunk that locks from outside and inside and can travel over land and sea .
He gets it , but she says she has to make sure the chest works .
To prove it , he locks her inside and floats her in the sea .
Her plan works : she just keeps floating until she reaches another shore .
So she escapes marrying her dad , but ends up working as a scullery maid in another land " ¦ from here you can follow the Cinderella story .
She meets a prince , leaves her shoe behind , he goes around trying to see who it belongs to .
The End .
2. The Lost Childen
What It 's Like : Hansel & Gretel meets Saw 2
This French fairy tale starts out just like Hansel & Gretel .
A brother and sister get lost in the woods and find themselves trapped in cages , getting plumped up to be eaten .
Only it 's not a wicked witch , it 's the Devil and his wife .
The Devil makes a sawhorse for the little boy to bleed to death on ( seriously ! ) and then goes for a walk , telling the girl to get her brother situated on the sawhorse before he returned .
The siblings pretend to be confused and ask the Devil 's wife to demonstrate how the boy should lay on the sawhorse ; when she shows them they tie her to it and slit her throat .
They steal all of the Devil 's money and escape in his carriage .
He chases after them once he discovers what they 've done , but he dies in the process .
Yikes .
3. The Juniper Tree
What It 's Like : Every stepchild 's worst nightmare
Cannibalism , murder , decapitation " ¦ freakiness abounds left and right in this weird Grimm story .
A widower gets remarried , but the second wife loathes the son he had with his first wife because she wants her daughter to inherit the family riches .
So she offers the little boy an apple from inside a chest .
When he leans over to get it , she slams the lid down on him and chops his head off .
Note : if you 're trying to convince your child to eat more fruits and veggies , do not tell them this story .
Well , the woman does n't want anyone to know that she killed the boy , so she puts his head back on and wraps a handkerchief around his neck to hide the fact that it 's no longer attached .
Her daughter ends up knocking his head off and getting blamed for his death .
To hide what happened , they chop up the body and make him into pudding , which they feed to his poor father .
Eventually the boy is reincarnated as a bird and he drops a stone on his stepmother 's head , which kills her and brings him back to life .
4. Penta of the Chopped - off Hands
What It 's Like : Um ... you tell us
These old fairy tales sure do enjoy a healthy dose of incest .
In this Italian tale , the king 's wife dies and he falls in love with Penta ... his sister .
She tries to make him fall out of love with her by chopping off her hands .
The king is pretty upset by this ; he has her locked in a chest and thrown out to sea .
A fisherman tries to save her , but Penta is so beautiful that his jealous wife has her thrown back out to sea .
Luckily , Penta is rescued by a king ( who is n't her brother ) .
They get married and have a baby , but the baby is born while the king is away at sea .
Penta tries to send the king the good news of the baby , but the jealous fisherman 's wife intercepts the message and changes it to say that Penta gave birth to a puppy .
A puppy ?!
The evil wife then constructs another fake message , this time from the king to his servants , and says that Penta and her baby should be burned alive .
OK , long story short : the king figures out what the jealous wife is up to and has her burned .
Penta and the king live happily ever after .
I can't really figure out what the moral of this tale is .
Chopping hands off ?
Giving birth to a dog ?
Help me out here , people .
OK , there must be a ton of other creepy fairy tales out there that you would never read to your kids to lull them off to a peaceful slumber .
Let 's hear them !
My father - in - law is absolutely fed up with telemarketers calling .
But rather than just hang up on them , why not try to get some money out of them ?
So he made a recording , to be played next time he gets a call :
Listen to this recording he made .
Ok , it ’s a long shot , but I think it ’s hilarious .
If it works , he can take himself off the Do Not Call Registry !

Family of dead teen to sue insurer that dallied on liver transplant David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday December 21 , 2007

Print This Email This California nurses group says insurer CIGNA has ' blood on their hands '
The family of a 17 - year - old California girl who died after being initially denied payment for a liver transplant is suing the teen 's insurance company , an attorney for the family said Friday .
Nataline Sarkisyan , who died Thursday night after her family removed her from life support , had been in a vegetative state for weeks due to complications following a bone marrow transplant .
Insurer CIGNA HealthCare had first denied a doctor - recommended liver transplant for Nataline , who suffered from leukemia , but had reversed course yesterday in the face of mounting public pressure .
The girl had been hospitalized since mid-November , but her condition had recently worsened due to a lung condition , reports the Los Angeles Daily News .
It was not immediately clear when Nataline entered a vegetative state .
Noted defense attorney Mark Geragos told reporters at a Friday news conference that the girl 's family will file a civil lawsuit against CIGNA , as well as urge a California district attorney to seek either manslaughter or murder charges against the company .
" CIGNA Health Corporation literally , maliciously killed her ... they conciously disregarded her life , " Geragos said of CIGNA .
" And they did that for one specific reason : they did not want to pay for her after - care . "
Doctors at UCLA determined she needed a transplant and sent a letter to CIGNA on Dec. 11 stating that patients in similar situations who undergo transplants had a six - month survival rate of about 65 percent .
The Philadelphia - based health insurance company denied payment for the transplant , saying the procedure was experimental and outside the scope of coverage .
On Thursday , about 150 teenagers and nurses protested outside CIGNA 's office in Glendale , Calif .
As the protesters rallied , the company rethought its earlier decision and said it would approve the transplant .
But the reversal did n't come early enough to help Nataline .
Liz Jacobs , a spokeswoman for the California Nurses Association -- one of the groups that had pushed for CIGNA to change its mind -- told RAW STORY that it was fair to hold the the insurer at fault .
" This is a tragedy that could have been prevented , " said Jacobs , who is a registered nurse .
" They have blood on their hands , they were responsible . "
Jacobs added that it was unfortunate that the family had to resort to outside efforts to convince CIGNA to grant the transplant .
" For them to have to go through what they 've had to go through , calling a press conference , a rally .
CIGNA was inundated ... people should n't have to go to these lengths " she said .
" We have dedicated our mission as nurses to advocate for patients -- and often , more and more , that means taking it beyond the hospitals and into the marble lobbies of the insurance companies . "
Despite their late change of policy , CIGNA said in an e-mail statement before the girl died that there was a lack of medical evidence showing the procedure would work in Nataline 's case .
" Our hearts go out to Nataline and her family , as they endure this terrible ordeal , " the company said . " ... CIGNA HealthCare has decided to make an exception in this rare and unusual case and we will provide coverage should she proceed with the requested liver transplant . "
In emotional statements at Friday 's press conference , Nataline 's father and brother spoke out against the insurance company .
" These CIGNA people , " said Nataline 's father , " they can not make people 's decision whether they 're going to live or die . " ( with wire reports )

Dear Dr. Behe
Reflecting on your previous post , and the current one , I would like to note that both your mutation rates ( 10 - 4 ) and effective population size ( 109 - 1010 ) are too high .
By a factor of around a hundred thousand .
The commonest estimates for HIV mutation rates are between 1x10 - 5 and 4x10 - 5 , with 2.5x10 - 5 the most common .
Well , what ’s a half log unit between friends ?
More serious is your population size estimate .
Here I ’d like to introduce you to the concept of effective population size .
Your number is the total population of viruses .
Now , not all members of a population reproduce .
In population genetics , the effective population size is defined as the number of adults in a population contributing offspring to the next generation ( yes , I know that viruses do n’t have “ adult ” reproducing stages , bear with me for a moment ) .
In a population of adults , some adults may not reproduce because there is a difference in the number of males to females .
Some may not reproduce because disease or heredity renders them sterile , so the number off reproducing members will always be lower than the total population .
In considering mutational effects , and generating new mutations , you need to consider the effective population size , not the total population size .
In HIV , this is important as viruses may replicate in immune cells that die or are cleared before the virus particles can become infective , or the HIV virus goes dormant .
As well , there is a very high replicative failure rate in HIV , many copies of the virus are defective and cannot make copies of them selves , or infect other cells .
So what is the effective population size of HIV ?
It ’s been estimated to be between 103 and 105 ( depending on the kinds of assumption you make [ 1 ] ) .
Even using the highest estimate , this is 10,000 to 100,000 times smaller than the figure you use .
You can immediately see that your estimates of the number of mutations available to HIV are concomitantly smaller .
It ’s not as if you could be unware of this , your own references show the the effective population sizes are smaller .
For example the Rodrigo paper ( PNAS , 1999 , 96:10559-61 cited in 15 , see page 290 of “ Edge of Evolution ” ) where they say :
It has been estimated that the total number of HIV - infected cells in a human host is between 107 and 108 ( 6 ) .
However , only a portion of infected cells produce viable viral particles that go on to infect other cells .
… [ estimates of infected populations ] place the value at around 103 infected cells
and then go on to give other estimates of up to 105 for HIV populations .
Same goes for Althaus CL and Bonhoeffer ( J Virol , ( 2005 ) , 79:1313572-78 , also listed under 15 in “ Edge of Evolution ” ) .
The viral population in an infected patient may indeed represent such a population limited in size , since current estimates of the effective population size range from 500 to 105 .
They point to some evidence from the rise of resistance in HIV that is consistent with a low effective population compared to the total population .
Coffin MJ ( Science , 1995 , 267:483-89 ) , is your source for the “ each and every possible single - point mutation occurs ” quote .
This old paper uses the total population only , they do not account for the effective population .
Well , it was an early report , and this incorrect use of the total population was pointed out in a subsequent comment ( Levy JA , et al. , Science .
1996 Feb 2;271( 5249 ) :670 - 1 ) noting that “ most of these viruses are not infectious ” .
All evidence points to the fact that double point mutations are not occurring once per day as you claim ( see also Seo T - K et al. , 2002 , cited in the references .
Your viral replication rates over a humans lifetime seem to be a bit off as well )
So , your comments about the ability of HIV to explore all of its mutation space in the course of a single infection is basically incorrect .
Also note that these estimates of effective population size are in contemporary populations , with highly evolved , very transmissible virus .
When the YRKL Glogi binding sequence and the Vpu viroporin evolved , this was in a much more weakly infective and replicative virus ( the high infectivity of modern HIV can be traced directly to these two mutations ) , in a much smaller population of humans .
So the proto -HIV , which evolved these allegedly “ unimpressive ” binding sites , was even more restricted in its exploration of mutations than the modern one .
You also continue to use your “ impressedness ” as an indicator of the reality of binding sites .
The haemoglobin S binding site is n’t particularly impressive , yet you use it as your own example .
Mutations in the LTR which confer survival by generating new binding sites are no less impressive than your own example .
But again , this is irrelevant .
Your claim is that it takes several simultaneous mutations to produce a protein - protein binding site .
The probability that two ( or three ) given mutations will occur simultaneously is completely independent of the function of the two proteins binding together , or how impressed we are by the function .
Whether the bound proteins make a molecular machine , or just glug together , the probabilities of a given two or three site simultaneous mutations is the same .
Not all new binding sites will make a flagellum , they are more likely to make something like the L - type calcium channel , where you have a core unit that functions okay in the absence of partner proteins , but works better when partner proteins bind to it ( RAMPS and adrenomedullins are similar , and my beloved imidazoline binding site may turn out to be a RAMP - like protein interacting with the LPA receptor ) .
The main point is that binding sites are binding sites , no matter how impressed you are with them , and you claim is that binding sites pre se are very improbable to evolve .
But it is clear from the Vpu example that they do evolve , and that they contribute significantly to the survival of the virus .
And that is just Vpu , there is also the LTR ’s , evolution of CXCR4 binding and binding that leads to upregulation of TRAIL .
And I have n’t exhaustively looked fro all possible examples of binding site evolution .
I do hope you will publish an erratum for your book .
Yours sincerely

Update 20-11-2007
I ’ve tided up some typos and taken the liberty of adding in a section dealing with the references from Dr. Behe ’s book .
A pair of state universities in the Pacific Northwest have refused to pass RIAA prelitigation letters along to students over concerns that the IP addresses in the letters can't easily be mapped to actual users of the computer in question .
Just as interesting as the universities ' refusal , though , is the fact that the story is now drawing national attention .
The University of Washington is one of the latest schools on the receiving end of the RIAA letters .
Such letters are typically shot off to school administrators along with requests that they be forwarded to the students associated with a listed IP address .
The RIAA asserts that the IP addresses in question have be detected swapping illicit material over P2P networks , but colleges and universities have started to raise concerns about linking IP addresses to students .
Even in student dorms rooms , it can be hard to know just who is using a computer at any given time .
Yes , please !
Based on these concerns , the University of Washington has decided not to pass along the RIAA 's letters until it has a better sense of the students who might be responsible for the alleged file - sharing .
UW spokesman Bob Roseth told the Seattle Post - Intelligencer , " What we want to do is verify that those students were actually ( at fault ) " before passing on the letters .
The message is clear : the University of Washington does n't accept the RIAA 's attempt to link IPs to real people as the basis for legal action .
Similar concerns were raised by the University of Oregon back in November ; the university objected that IP addresses could n't be mapped to students with any certainty even in cases where a computer accessed the university wireless network using a specific user name and password .
Without doing interviews and launching an investigation , the school said it had no way of knowing who had committed the alleged copyright infringement .
The Oregon case continues to gain exposure , in part because the state 's attorney general is helping to lead the fight against the RIAA 's subpoenas ( issued to schools if they refuse to turn over student information ) .
Writing in Monday 's New York Times , columnist Adam Liptak covered the case and pointed out another school in the state ( Portland State ) had turned over such information back in 2004 , but that it had done so on two roommates since the university could n't tell which of their computers had been used .
The RIAA tried to get the non-offending student to settle - for $ 4,500 .
The girl 's mother told Liptak that the process was " basically extortion . "
The lawsuit filed against the girl was later dropped .
Liptak 's own take on the situation is worth quoting because of what it indicates about mainstream reaction to the RIAA 's legal campaign .
" No one should shed tears for people who steal music and have to face the consequences , " he wrote .
" But it is nonetheless heartening to see a university decline to become the industry 's police officer and instead to defend the privacy of its students . "
The RIAA insists that its campaign is working , but it is certainly coming at a cost ; it makes the record labels look thuggish , even to those with who agree that swapping copyrighted songs is wrong .
In any event , the litigation pain train keeps a - rollin ' .
The RIAA sent out 396 prelitigation letters to 22 universities in December alone , hitting everyone from Western Kentucky to Gustavus Adolphus to USC .
Assuming those schools forwarded the letters to students , 396 Christmases were no doubt spent wondering whether to cough up the thousands of dollars to settle the case online ( at the wonderfully direct p2plawsuits.com ) or risk the expense of a court fight and possible losing outcome .
To students wondering why they 've been targeted , the RIAA has a simple answer .
" The unauthorized uploading or downloading of music is illegal .
It is just as wrong as shoplifting from a local record store - and the impact on those who create music and bring it to fans is equally devastating . "
The way out of the mess is equally simple : the group accepts MasterCard , Visa , and Discover ; the accused can even put their settlements on a " convenient " monthly payment plan .
Having sex in water sounds so sensual , does n't it ?
When you 're swimming in a pool or lake , you 're practically naked already , so why not slip off your bathing suit and get it on ?
But , wait : is it safe to have sex in water ?
Not exactly .
Lake , river , ocean , and pond water all contain bacteria .
Having sex can introduce that bacteria into your vagina , which could put you at risk for infections that you do n't want up there .
Pool water , on the other hand , contains chemicals that could irritate your lady business .
Aside from health risks , the logistics just are n't with you on this one .
Since lubrication is key when it comes to sex that feels good , you do n't want to end up all washed out ( literally ) .
The water dissipates your natural moisture , so you 're left with friction - filled sex that wo n't last long .
What 's worse is that if you 're using a condom , the friction could cause a tear , and you wo n't be protected from pregnancy or STIs if the condom breaks .
What about sex while taking a bath or shower together ?
Moving from smooching to screwing in the bath seems like a lovely plan , but the same lubrication problem you have in other bodies of water will arise in a bath , too .
So what about doing it in the shower ?
Again , the water will wash away the wetness you make naturally , and we know that sex without enough lubrication feels awful .
You could move to the end of the shower where the water is n't beating down , but you 'll just end up chilly and with sore muscles from trying to have sex while standing .
My advice ?
Sex + water = no fun .
So make love without the water .

This has been a terrible week for me .
My life got in the way about ten times over and as a result I ’ve been a pretty poor excuse for a blogger .
For instance :
I have n’t come close to posting regularly nor did I even bother to contact anyone and tell them why .
I did n’t surf new blogs or visit any of my usual blog haunts .
I ’ve sworn off social networking for the week .
Plus I have no clue what ’s going on in the world because I did n’t even read my feeds this week .
The kind of damage that I ’ve likely experienced this week may include losing readers , losing feed subscribers , and missing news stories .
Other damage a blogger can run into could be things like losing a blogging gig , having an editor become highly frustrated with you , and hitting a major blogging slump .
None of the above is good news .
However , there are some basic damage control techniques you can use when life gets in the way and you check out for a few days to a week .
Be a reliable blogger almost all of the time :
This is a tricky damage control method because this is n’t something you can implement on the fly .
If you were a reliable blogger with plenty of readers before your life crisis , than you ’ll bounce back quicker than a blogger who is flaky even when there ’s no crisis .

Before you ever have a crisis make some emergency posts that you can use during times like this .
I luckily had a back supply of posts for one blog I write which saved my butt this week .

During your bad week check in with your editors and readers : I know , above I said that I did not check in , but no one said to be like me .
Technically if you have an issue you should check in with your boss if you have a boss or editor and also leave a message at your blog or blogs for your readers that you ’ll be back in a few days .

Enlist the help of blogging friends :
If possible ask some friends to help you out with a guest post or two .
I ’m bad at asking people for posting help because I ’m ultra possessive of my blogs and my blog content .
However , a smart blogger might be less anal and just ask for help .
Chances are ; that cool blogger you like , will do a stellar job guest posting at your blog .
If possible ask some friends to help you out with a guest post or two .
I ’m bad at asking people for posting help because I ’m ultra possessive of my blogs and my blog content .
However , a smart blogger might be less anal and just ask for help .
Chances are ; that cool blogger you like , will do a stellar job guest posting at your blog .
Go blog surfing :
Once you do come back you ’ll likely feel behind and want to make a lot of posts to make up for your absence .
A better plan for damage control is to write one amazing post and then go visiting .
Visit all the blogs you normally visit during a good week and leave comments .
This lets people know you ’re back .
If they do n’t know you ’re back they wo n’t come visiting you .
You could argue that people will know you ’re back based on your feed but I would n’t rely on that .
Many people still do n’t subscribe to feeds and also it ’s just nice to go visit your blog friends .

Let people know you ’re back for good : Barring a chain of insane events occurring hopefully you are back so let people know .
The best way to do this is to say what ’s coming up at the end of your post .
Such as , “ Later this week look for a great post on such and such ” or “ Stay tuned because … ”

Catch up with the world :
If you write a news related blog you should back read your feeds ; at least a couple of days .
You may have missed an ongoing story that your blog can still jump on .
Am I worried about my own bad week ?
Not too much .
I love my blogs a lot and I ’m normally a reliable blogger ; I ’m counting on this along with some heavy damage control to pull me through the next week and then the rest of December will be chill .
We all get sick or have bad weeks from time to time but it does n’t mean we have to lose what we ’ve worked so hard for at our blogs .
What are some of your ideas for blog damage control when life gets out of control ?
When Jennifer Chait is having a good week you can visit her at blogs like Offbeat Homes , 7 Babes A Blogging , and Tree Hugging Family .

Over three tons of coke , folks .
It appears Clyde O'Connor 's Cessna 210 is N210TM , which flew from Halifax Int'l to St. Johns Int'l on Thursday night , and then Ponta Delgada , in the Azores , the next morning .
N210 TM is registered to Mellon Investments Corporation , located at 3511 Silverside Road , Suite 105 , Wilmington , Delaware .
This is the address of Delaware Registry , Ltd. , a company that sets up Delaware corporations .
In 2003 , N1116G , an aircraft owned by One Leasing , a corporation with the same address as Mellon Investments , crashed in Columbia with 4 people on board that were allegedly CIA employees .
3511 Silverside Road , Suite 105 , Wilmington , Delaware
Al Qaeda
Many thanks must go to those readers who have tried to solve the strange case of the cocaine - laden crashed jet -- the one with the CIA history .
( For earlier stories , see here and here and here . )
Friends to this blog have done some remarkably good Sherlock Holmesing .
Now I must play the part of Dr. Watson , as I transform their sleuthing into a linear narrative .
Toward the end , I 'll describe my own recent detective work .
As you may recall , on the very day that our now - infamous Gulfstream II flew off to destiny , ownership was transfered one Clyde O'Connor -- a rather wild Florida businessman who started a multi-million dollars aviation firm after declaring bankruptcy .
Hissilent partner is a guy named Greg Smith .
O'Connor 's firm is , or was , called Execstar ; it is , or was , based in Fort Lauderdale , Florida .
Smith runs something called Global Jet Solutions .
According to Palm Beach reporter Bob Norman , O'Connor was allowed to walk around free for a couple of weeks , even though Mexican authorities found three tons of coke in the wreckage of his jet .
His liberty stunned everyone else in local aviation circles .
Norman 's piece appeared on October 11 .
The very next day , O'Connor flew off to Canada , and from there to the Azores .
I suspect that if Norman had never published , O'Connor would still be enjoying the sights and sounds of Spring Break City .
Think about it .
Suppose you loan your car to your nephew , and suppose that the cops stop him and find a few ounces of weed .
You stand a good chance of having your vehicle impounded , do n't you ?
Yet nobody stopped O'Connor from flying away in his Cessna .
When O'Connor landed in Halifax , border guards asked him if he had any firearms .
He said no .
They checked anyways , found two handguns , and gave him a fine .
A Canadian border services spokesperson says that O'Connor was " very cooperative " -- and that he was traveling with an unidentified woman .
( I suspect that the lady may be a wife named Raisa . )
Incidentally , his partner Greg Smith refuses to talk to reporters .
No word , yet , as to whether the cops consider him worthy of interest .
One of this blog 's commenters , a man who calls himself LoganCale , contributed this rather startling information :
That Guatemalan crash was , you may recall , a rather big deal , since the CIA guys fell into the hands of FARC guerrillas .
Mellon investments is , of course , a rather fragrant name .
The most notorious member of the ultra-rich Mellon clan is Richard Mellon Scaife , the Darth Vader of the anti-Clinton movement .
Scaife has long made hazy claims of a CIA association .
This interesting confluence of data prompted me to research that address :.
Lots of companies have used this service to set up corporations in a state where the tax - man is less welcome than elsewhere .
Many of the companies using this mailing address appear to be benign .
And quite a few are not .
This article about the planespotters who uncovered the rendition scandal tells the tale : A surprising number of aircraft used in the CIA 's program belonged ( on paper ) to businesses " headquartered " at that same office in Wilmington : 3511 Silverside Road , Suite 105 .
And guess which other noteworthy organization used that address ?
Recently , I ’ve been asked on a number of different occasions to recommend software for Mac OS X to people who have just bought a new Mac .
To save time the next time someone asks me , I put together this list of shareware that I use all the time .
This does not include standard stuff like iTunes or commercial software like Photoshop .
It ’s just the little nuggets of cool stuff from around the web .
If you ’re looking for a type of software that is n’t listed here , try Free Mac Ware , Open Source Mac , another open source Mac site and VersionTracker .
If you ’re the type of person who , unlike me , likes a lot of custom menu bar doohickies , check out Jeweled Platypus .
This page makes no attempt to recommend Dashboard widgets .
If you want to make a suggestion for or comment on this page , drop it here .

Last updated : 26 February 2008 .
Freeware
This software may be downloaded and used for no cost at all .
Some of these titles are “ donationware ” , software that the author makes available for free , but asks for donations to fund his efforts .
Active Timer http://osiris.laya.com/projects/activetimer/
Free .
This application tracks how much time running applications spend in the foreground .
It ’s not really an everyday workhorse , but using it for a few days can be an eye opener .
Adium X http://www.adiumx.com/
Free .
A multi-protocol instant messaging client .
Extremely customizable .
I think it is much nicer than iChat .
AppFresh http://metaquark.de/appfresh/
Free ( for the moment ) .
AppFresh scans all the apps on your machine and lets you know if there is a more recent version .
If asked , it will attempt to download and install updates .
It does this by auto - navigating web sites , so the process is n’t foolproof , but it does a pretty good job .
It also can sync with iusethis.com , keeping your choices up to date .
If the authors decide to charge for the application , I do n’t think I ’d continue using it , but it can be useful .
AppleJack http://applejack.sourceforge.net/
Free .
You may never actually need AppleJack , but when you do , it will save your ass .
AppleJack is a boot - time , command - line tool that can do things like disk repair and so on , without needing a second startup disk .
It ’s also much easier to use than similar tools I ’ve seen .
It operates in single user mode ( which , as I continually forget , is accessed by holding down command and s while booting ) .
Camino http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/
Free .
One of the only Mac browsers that can print worth a damn .
Apart from that , it ’s also stable , fast , standards compliant ( built using Gecko , the same HTML engine in Mozilla and Firefox ) and built specifically for Mac OS X .
Although still more Mac - like than Firefox , it is starting to lose its edge to the latter , because Camino ’s plugin support is not as wide or as slick ( it is still a struggle to set it up to use Firebug or work with del.icio.us as well as Firefox can , for example ) .
Chicken of the VNC http://cotvnc.sf.net/
Free .
A client to connect to machines running VNC servers .
This allows you to see an image of the remote machine and control it .
This appears to be one of the only free , feature rich VNC clients for the Mac still under active development .
( Also see OSXvnc , below . )
Chmox http://chmox.sf.net/
Free .
It is rare that you actually need to be able to read a Microsoft help archive file ( a *.chm file ) on a Mac , but occasionally you find some good reference material in that format .
This reader can open and display such files , all in a Mac - like way .
Simple , but effective .
ClamXav http://clamxav.com/
Free .
Viruses have never been that big of a problem on the Mac .
Up through Mac OS 9 , there were only a handful of known virii , only a couple of which were dangerous .
So far , there have n’t been any that effect Mac OS X. Still , Macs can hold files that contain virii from other platforms ( such as the tens of thousands of them that can affect Office documents on Win32 machines ) and pass them on .
Your Win32 friends will thank you not to send them any , and this program can find and kill them .
Watching this scan your junk mail folder is educational .
Disk Inventory X http://www.derlien.com/
Free .
A pretty decent tool for graphically investigating what is taking up your hard drive space .
There is now a Mac version of Filelight , which has a more intuitive method of showing the same information , but the current version is more of a proof of concept rather than a fully functioning application , so this program will do just fine in the meantime .
Eclipse http://www.eclipse.org/
Free .
Widely regarded as just a Java IDE ( a task at which it is unrivaled , in my opinion ) , Eclipse is really more of a platform into which functionality can be plugged .
The Java plugins happen to be bundled with the download , but there are others that extend Eclipse to be much more , such as write and debug Perl and manage databases .
I ’m also pondering using it as a platform for various role - playing plugins .
File Merge http://developer.apple.com/tools/macosxtools.html
Free .
A gem hidden among the Mac OS X development tools , this is a slick text file comparison application .
Almost as good as the one built into CodeWarrior , but free .
Downloading the dev tools requires a free registration with Apple .
Fink http://fink.sourceforge.net/
Free .
Provides downloading , installation and management of nearly 5000 open source Unix programs , compiled and tested under Mac OS X .
If you are an Linux or Unix user looking to get your favorite tool onto your new Mac , check out Fink first .
Most likely , someone has already gone through the pain of porting it for you .
GIMPshop http://www.gimpshop.net/
Free .
Like a fair amount of shareware , the GNU Image Manipulation Program ( GIMP ) acts a freeware alternative to successful commercial application ( in this case , Adobe Photoshop ) .
While GIMP is now fairly powerful , it suffers from an insurmountable flaw : its interface is absolutely hideous , to the point of unusability .
Fortunately , being open source , it is possible for anyone to improve on this interface .
One such attempt is GIMPshop , an application based on the GIMP code base , but with menus and other interface elements intended to mimic Photoshop as closely as possible .
You might find that Seashore , ImageWell or Pixelmator fits your needs better .
Gizmo http://www.gizmoproject.com/
Free .
In spite of the dumb name , this is an excellent voice over IP package .
I should probably use this instead of long distance phone calls more than I do .
There is also a Skype client for the Mac , but it is a real hog .
HandBrake http://handbrake.fr/
Free .
The only DVD ripper you ’ll ever need .
Though it has every tweakable setting you ’d ever want , it hides this power under a simple interface , with presets for iPods , AppleTVs and so on .
It can also handle multiple audio tracks , subtitles and so on .
IP http://www.astrok-software.com/
Free /$ 5 . Adds a menu that displays your current IP address ( es ) and MAC(s ) .
Selecting from this menu copies the address to the clipboard .
The freeware version is as useful as I need it to be , but paying the author $ 5 will give you a code that unlocks additional features , such as better customization and automatic e-mailing of IPs .
Ishido http://iangilman.com/software/ishido.php
$ 13 .
A good portion of the 1990 ’s was spent attempting to master this game .
Finally , a version that runs on Intel Macs is available , allowing me to scratch the itch that never went away .
Alas , the graphics in the Tom Tom version are not as good as in the original .
LiquidCD http://www.maconnect.ch/
Donation Requested .
OS X has the power to burn folders into CDs or DVDs out of the box , but to get more ( like selecting specific files from a tree and saving that selection for reuse , or supporting other platform formats ) , you used to have to spend a hundred bucks for the endlessly upgrading Toast .
Not any more .
LiquidCD can do most of what Toast does , but for free .
It ’s also a bit nicer to use .
MacSniffer http://personalpages.tds.net/~brian_hill/macsniffer.html
Free . A GUI front end around the tcpdump packet sniffer .
Allows you to view all traffic going over your network connection .
Tools like Packet Peeper may also be of use .
Minuteur http://www.phg-home.com/index_mac.html
Free .
If you happen to have an iMac in your kitchen , you sometimes need a cooking timer .
This one is better than my previous recommendation , featuring full screen countdowns , louder alarms and other features .
NeoOfficeJ http://www.neooffice.org/
Free .
A version of OpenOffice built with a native Mac look at feel .
While not quite as polished as MacOffice , this app is file compatible with it , and infinitely cheaper .
NodeBox http://nodebox.net/code/
Free .
A strange little application for programatically generating graphics .
Being basically Python coding , this wo n’t be everyone ’s cup of tea , but can make some neat looking images .
Onyx http://www.titanium.free.fr/pgs2/english/onyx.html
Free .
A general purpose utility for setting various ( otherwise hidden ) options in Max OS X , such as dock “ pinning ” and drop shadows , permission repairing , logs , etc .
It is similar to Cocktail , but free .
OSXvnc http://www.redstonesoftware.com/vnc.html
Free .
A full featured VNC server providing remote access to the GUI , keyboard and mouse using any VNC client ( such as Chicken of the VNC , above ) .
VNC is not all that complicated , but this server seems particularly easy to use .
Note that since the release of Leopard , OS X has a VNC server built into it as part of its screen sharing feature , so you may not need this .
Quicksilver http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/
Free .
I resisted using Quicksilver for a long time , because the hype surrounding it is the irritating kind .
After using it for a week I became , sorry to say , a convert .
Quicksilver is a bit hard to describe , and it has much more power than I ever use .
The basic idea is that you use a hot key combination ( cntl - space , by default ) to pop up Quicksilver ’s main window , then type a few characters to do all sorts of stuff .
It sounds really pointless , I know , but now I can barely stand working on machines that do n’t have it .
Between Quicksilver and Witch ( see below ) I barely use the dock at all .
It is best examined by installing it and trying it out .
Renamer4Mac http://www.power4mac.com/renamer/
Free .
Allows you to do search and replace on filenames , including support for regular expressions .
Sure , you could do similar things with the command line , but this is easier .
The $ 10 FileXaminer also can perform such feats , as well as others .
Seasonality http://www.gauchosoft.com/Software/Seasonality/
Free .
If you do n’t care about the weather , you do n’t need this software .
If you only care a little about the weather , you do n’t need this either .
If , however , you ’d rather tell if it ’s raining by looking it up on the net instead of looking out the window , this is the software for you .
SiteOrbiter http://www.siteorbiter.cc/
Free .
While not an essential tool , this " web site cartography " application can be useful for getting reigning in out of control web sites .
This app can also be used to build site maps for search engines .
Solitaire XL http://lavacat.com/sol_one_zero.html
Free .
The most used Win32 application is Solitare .
This app allows switchers who need their fix experience solitaire the Mac OS X way .
Spotlaser http://members.optusnet.com.au/frovil/spotlaser.html
Donation Requested .
Finding that Spotlight lacks the power to make complicated search queries ?
Spotlaser is the answer , exposing the power that is actually within Spotlight ’s programming , but not shown by Apple ’s interface .
Spotlaser can to date searches , all / any / exact searches , filename only searches and more .
As it ’s web page says : do n’t search , find .
Those looking for something perhaps more powerful ( but a bit less elegant and potentially more costly ) might find FileSpot worth a look .
Terragen http://www.planetside.co.uk/terragen/
Free for non-commercial use .
Terragen creates 3D scenery using fractal terrain .
Its interface is n’t as slick as something like Bryce , but it is n’t as complex or expensive either .
Transmission http://www.transmissionbt.com/
Free .
One of the more recently updated ( and better ) BitTorrent clients available on the Mac .
It is not quite as feature rich as Xtorrent , but is free , which seems to be more in the spirit of BitTorrent .
Vienna http://www.opencommunity.co.uk/vienna2.php
Free .
Vienna is a very simple RSS feed reader that does just enough for me .
I used to use NetNewsWire Lite , but their new corporate face leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
VLC http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
Free .
A video player that can play more formats than the default QuickTime installation provides ( including AVI and divx ) .
Has lag problems on occasion , but can play most formats .
Witch http://www.petermaurer.de/nasi.php?section=witch
Free. OS X has a built - in feature ( cmd-tab ) to cycle between application , similar to alt - tabbing on Win32 .
This preference panel adds a more sophisticated version ( wired to opt - tab by default ) that lists active windows as well as applications .
X Resource Graph http://www.gauchosoft.com/Software/X%20Resource%20Graph/
Free .
A funky , good - looking resource monitor .
Also monitors stocks and the weather .
Geeky , but useful .
Shareware
Shareware is software that asks you to pay a fee if you like it .
PCalc http://www.pcalc.com/
$ 10 .
After searching for some time , I finally found a Mac calculator that handled reverse polish notation ( RPN ) , hexidecimal , conversions ( lbs. to kg ) , and lists of fundamental constants .
It is also wide displayed , programmable and great looking .
SideTrack http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/sidetrack/
$ 15 .
Nearly a requirement for older laptops , SideTrack enhances a laptop trackpad , mapping taps on the pad to various things ( e.g. right - clicks ) and turning the side of the pad into a “ scroll wheel ” .
Until registered , it periodically nags you to do so .
SideTrack does n’t support all models and you might find that Free Focused Scroll works better for you ( though it does n’t for me ) .
Crippleware
This software may be downloaded and used , but either has key features disabled until you pay for it or has a time limit for free use .
I dislike the crippleware philosophy ( and do not use it for software I write ) , so when I recommend crippleware , it is either because I do n’t miss the crippled features or because it is better than most software out there .
1 Password http://1passwd.com/
$ 30 .
This password manager has replaced my earlier recommendation for password tracking ( Safe Place ) , even though it is more expensive .
It works a bit differently than other software of its type ( see the video on their site for a good intro ) .
I was n’t sure I ’d like it at first , but it won me over .
It also has a read - only Palm app , to which encrypted copies of your data can be exported .
This is n’t full syncing , such as that offered by SplashID , but has a much better Mac interface .
ArtRage http://www.ambientdesign.com/artrage.html
$ 25 .
I ’m not crazy about the wacky interfaces this company produces ( the same crew that makes Kai ’s Power Tools ) , but the natural media art program is fairly interesting , encouraging tracing , so even non-artists can produce cool stuff .
It comes in a free " starter " edition that is fairly powerful , but lacks some of the tools of the full edition .
On the plus side , even the full version does n’t cost $ 200 , like Painter .
Coda http://www.panic.com/coda/ $ 79 .
Until Coda , there were two basic methods of creating web sites .
One way was to use a WYSIWYG tool like iWeb or RapidWeaver .
The other was to do hand coding using a mix of various tools , like text editors , file transfer programs , CSS editors and various browsers .
Coda attempts to change this ( and succeeds pretty well ) , providing a tool for the " hand markup " set that vastly streamlines workflow , and essentially obsoletes about a half - dozen other tools .
Panic Software allows a 30 - day trial before requiring payment , with a small discount if you own other Panic titles .
Delicious Library http://www.delicious-monster.com/
$ 40 .
For the anal - retentive in you , this tracks collections of books , DVDs , CDs and games .
Integrates with a bar - code scanner , if you happen to have one ( such as a hacked CueCat ) .
Also allows you to use a video camera to scan barcodes .
Can enter ISBN or USP numbers and will lookup information on item on the net .
Library allows only 25 items to be entered unless you pay for it .
Duover http://interfacethis.com/duover/
$ 20 .
Easy to use backup / synchronization program .
Unlike many , it knows how to properly mount a remote volume automatically .
It can also launch itself on a schedule .
Escape Velocity : Nova http://www.ambrosiasw.com/games/evn/
$ 30 .
A role - playing / space combat game that is sort of hard to explain until you play it .
The makers of this game , Ambrosia , completely rule .
If this genre is not your cup of tea , I guarantee that they have another game ( some of which , alas , only run in Classic mode ) that will have you addicted within minutes .
If you like this game , you might also try Vendetta , which is very similar in concept , but uses 3D first - person combat and requires on - line play with thousands of other players .
GraphicConverter X http://www.lemkesoft.de/en/graphcon.htm
$ 30 .
Capable of reading and writing nearly any graphic format , this program also has slide show capability and a great directory - based image browser .
iConquer http://www.kavasoft.com/iConquer/ $ 13 .
A very sexy Risk game , somehow more addictive than the hordes of other Risk clones .
It allows network play , but only 10 games before you have to pay for it .
i Photo Library Manager http://homepage.mac.com/bwebster/iphotolibrarymanager.html
$ 20 .
If you ever need to merge two different iPhoto libraries into one or switch back and forth between multiple libraries , do n’t even bother trying to do it yourself .
It should be easy to do but , inexplicably , is n’t .
Just pony up the cash for this program .
You might also want to grab iPhoto Diet to remove some of the bloat iPhoto creates .
Life Balance http://www.llamagraphics.com/ $ 80 . A unique to - do manager with Palm synchronization .
Their web site explains it better than I can .
Takes a little getting used to , but is the best to - do system I ’ve ever used .
After a 30 - day trial , save stops working unless you pay for it .
There is also a Win32 version , if you ’re into that sort of thing .
Expensive , but unique .
It ’s also one of the few instances I ’ve ever paid more than $ 20 for shareware .
Little Snitch http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/
$ 25 .
Brings up an alert any time your computer attempts to make a network connection to the outside world , allowing you to accept or deny the attempt .
It can be trained to ignore things ( like your web browser , chat client , etc. ) .
It will only run for three hours at a time unless you pay for it .
This is good enough for me , as I tend to run it only when installing new software .
( Some software “ phones home ” to its creating company , transmitting who knows what . )
MacFamilyTree http://www.onlymac.de/html/stammbaum4en.html $ 40 .
A bit pricy , but the best family tree software I ’ve seen for the Mac .
I ’m still playing with this one , as I ’m not sure it ’s worth the cost .
Nothing can be saved until paid for .
Missing Sync for Palm OS http://www.markspace.com/missingsync_palmos.php $ 40 .
If you have a Palm device , do n’t even bother downloading the " Palm Desktop " application that Palm makes for the Mac .
It ’s garbage .
Instead , get this application .
It syncs the Mac way , using things like iCal and Address Book on the Mac end .
OmniGraffle http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/
$ 80 -$ 150 .
Switchers itching for something like Visio should look no further than the professional version of this app .
It does some things a bit differently than Visio would , but generally " differently " here means " better " .
Visio , notable as one of the few products whose interface radically improved once bought by Microsoft , could steal quite a few lessons from the guys at Omni .
A limit is placed on the number of nodes you can have in a file until this software is paid for .
oXygen http://www.oxygenxml.com/
$ 48 .
Pretty much the only decent XSLT editor / debugger / transformer for the Mac ( or any platform , really ) .
As a bonus , you get an Eclipse plugin version with the cost .
Allows 30 days free use before payment needed .
Path Finder http://www.cocoatech.com/pf4/ $ 35 .
Though not for the faint of heart , Path Finder is extremely powerful and may be right up your alley if you think the Mac ’s standard Finder interface lacks power .
You can even set up this application to completely replace the Finder .
One drawback is that it is fairly bleeding edge , with a tendency to exhibit odd problems when new major system revisions are released .
( There is also a newer entry into the " Finder replacement " market called Leap but I have not yet used it . )
Project X http://www.projectx.com/
$ 200 .
Some switchers need a replacement for Microsoft Project , and this seems closest to fitting the bill .
I no longer use project management applications regularly , so I have not used this heavily , but after some time where this genre was unonccupied in the Mac world , this seems to have outpaced several competitors .
And a " best of show " award from MacWorld is nothing to sneeze at .
Some other possibilities in this space are OmniPlan , iTaskX , Merlin or , for something slightly different , Curio .
Snapz Pro X http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/
$ 69 .
The king daddy of Mac screen capture programs , with a long lineage .
Capture full screens , windows , selections to multiple formats .
Capture video .
Basically flawless , with a well - deserved five mice rating .
Snapz Pro X can be used for a limited time before requiring payment .
Sound Studio http://www.freeverse.com/apps/app/?id=5012
$ 80 .
While there are number of sound editors available on the Mac , most of them were pretty bad last time I looked at them .
This application does more of what I need it to , particularly with some features specifically to ease the importing of audio tapes .
Other applications in this space are Audacity , Fission and Wavepad .
Spaceward Ho !
http://www.deltatao.com/ho/ $ 40 .
A classic strategic space military / economy game .
It is a bit hard to explain , but is just the right mixture of complexity to make it fun , but not so much that playing a game takes days on end .
It ’s playable for free , but buying it provides smarter opponents , higher tech levels , larger boards , etc .
Steermouse http://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/
$ 20 .
The Mac is known for true plug and play support of all sorts of mice and other input devices , but sometimes the default support is n’t enough , particularly with unusual peripherals .
This driver supports a wide variety of devices , and allows much more customization than mortal man was meant to use .
It can be used for 30 days before requiring payment .
Transmit http://www.panic.com/transmit/
$ 15 .
The file - transfer protocol ( FTP ) client for the Mac. Pretty much perfect .
Until paid for , sessions can only last for 10 minutes and “ favorites ” can not be saved .
Unison http://www.panic.com/unison/
$ 25 .
Before the world wide web , there was Usenet , a vast collection of newsgroups .

Evolutionary Cognitive Neuroscience
Dual Use Discipline for Understanding & Managing Complexity and Altering Warfare
by John Stanton
John Stanton is a Virginia based writer specializing in political and national security affairs .

The Evolutionary Cognitive Neuroscience ( ECN ) discipline , and its associated fields , may produce tools that advance humanity 's ability to understand and manage itself .
Simultaneously , ECN may also yield brain - centric weaponry that drastically alters human warfare .
The United States Department of Defense ( DOD ) may marshal significant resources -- as it did during the 1941 to 1946 Manhattan Project to drive ECN research , development and testing .
DOD is the only entity in the United States with the capability to fully fund ECN programs .
The DOD 's Defense Science Board and the United States ' Intelligence Community has recently suggested research thrusts into ECN and the merging of data - heavy sciences and social sciences .
Success will ultimately depend on program directors and researchers ' acceptance of general Evolutionary Theory and , in particular , Evolutionary Psychology .
Failure to do this will result in a mosh - pit of studies based on dated science and methodology .
The Evolutionary Psychology and Neuroscience disciplines are set merge into a unified field known as Evolutionary Cognitive Neuroscience or ECN .
ECN may produce novel integrated micro , macro models of brain - behavior relationships based on the principles of general Evolution , Evolutionary Psychology and the findings of Neuroscience .
Applications may range from predictive human behavior models to neuroweaponry .
Social science literature and United States ' Department of Defense ( DOD ) documentation also suggests that the time is ripe for an even larger merger between the data - heavy sciences and the social sciences .
ECN may serve as both a conduit and foundation for this convergence particularly as the DOD recognizes its importance to national security .
However , the entire effort will fail if program directors and researchers exclude general Evolution and Evolutionary Psychology from their methodologies .
Complexity ( the number of ways - hows - and - whys a system can act ) may become an anachronism as novel research demystifies consciousness reducing human complexity to a deterministic system .
Biomachines that bypass time consuming conscious activity ultimately may be fielded by the DOD .
The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency ( DARPA ) is already working towards this end .
Through its Neurotechnology for Intelligence Analysts program , it has probed brain signals triggered when an analyst sees something interesting in a satellite image .
The analysts brain registers the discovery long before the analyst becomes cognitively aware of it .
 The brain can signal the discovery three times faster than the analyst can respond
My goal is to use these technologies to harness the speed of thought I know its possible , especially if we confront these challenges not just as problems of biology and neuroscience but problems of physics , math , materials science and microtechnology . 
The DOD has a very aggressive interest in understanding and adapting to the Human Terrain ( brain - behavior relationships in local , regional , national and global environments ) .
With a budget of approximately $ 1.2 trillion ( $ US ) , and the ability to obtain additional funding , the DOD stands alone in its ability to accelerate research and development ( R&D ) programs in ECN , as well as catalyze the fusion of the data - heavy and social sciences .
Such an effort may be as significant as the Manhattan Project ( Atomic Bomb ) or the development of Quantum Theory .
There is historical precedent for thinking as much .
 I think the military is the place to do it I think it is time for the Pentagon to do for human science what it did for chemistry in World War I , for physics in World War II and for computers in the post - Cold War era .
Im convinced that were fighting human wars now and that another stealth bomber , another battleship is not how to win these wars 
This DOD R&D effort may certainly revolutionize warfare .
In the process it may also transform the understanding and conduct of human affairs which in turn may present challenges to the legitimacy of long established , cumbersome institutions .
For example , from a policy and organizational perspective , the United States may find it necessary to create some sort of DOD - Plus organization : one centralized defense and foreign apparatus that has a comprehensive capability to anticipate and respond to evolving threats in local , regional , national , and global environments .
A secondary organization might be needed for post - response consequence and stability management .
Another side - effect of this R&D activity may be a significant shift in the way human beings view themselves nestled as they are on the outskirts of 1 of the estimated 125 billion galaxies in the known universe .
Already , papers such as Quantum Physics in Neuroscience and Psychology : A Neurophysical Model of Mind - Brain Interaction offer intriguing insights and prospects .
ECN encourages innovative thinking through progressive and tested science .
 Neuroscientists studying the connection of mind and consciousness to physical processes in the brain often assume that a conception of nature based on classic physics will eventually turn out to be adequate .
That assumption would have been reasonable during the nineteenth century .
But now , in the twenty - first century , it is rationally untenable .
Quantum
Theory must be used in principle because the behavior of the brain depends sensitively upon atomic , molecular and ionic processes , and these processes in the brain often involve large quantum effects .
The whole range of science , from atomic physics to mind - brain dynamics , has the possibility of being brought together into a single rationally coherent theory of an evolving cosmos that is not constituted by matter but by actions of agents .
In this conceptualization of nature , agents could naturally evolve in accordance with the principles of natural selection , owing to the fact that their efforts have physical consequences .
The outline of a possible rationally coherent understanding of the connection between mind and matter begins to emerge ... A shift to this pragmatic approach that incorporates agent based choices as primary empirical input variables may be as important to progress in neuroscience and psychology as it was to atomic physics . 
In the United States , the ongoing obsession with national security and the enormous funding necessary to soothe a national psyche of fear and war is a key driver for enhancing security thereby eliminating the uncertainty of daily living .
ECN may generate predictive and diagnostic biotechnologies to reduce tension .
Such a development could eliminate much uncertainty and concomitant drama in human affairs by providing leaders with assets to manage the complexities in brain - behavior relationships .
To get there though , reliable data on human beings , as they function as interconnected consumers , warfighters , enemies , refugees , diplomats , criminals , and citizens of their respective nations will need to be collected and assessed .
The entire effort depends on the application of general Evolution and Evolutionary Psychology .
A comprehensive knowledge base of planetary ecosystems and how humans interface with those ecosystems will have to be constructed and meshed with the findings of brain - behavior functions .
The dissection of the individual and global organism may lead to unprecedented forecasting capability
The ultimate outcome may be the creation of biomachine systems that suggest procedures and diagnostics with which to anticipate and / or minimize a wide range of human problems .
Biomachine tools that can suggest courses of action such as military intervention , diplomacy , containment , stability and consequence management operations , economic aid , covert operations , or a Pontius Pilate approach to nations that engage in internal self - destruction may become available .
Worldscape 2007 : Savannah 's and Jungles
The United States diplomatic corps has made general use of standard psychology , game theory , and related social sciences to engage in diplomacy on behalf of the United States .
Likewise , the Department of Defense ( DOD ) has used elements of the social sciences -- especially psychology -- to predict , for example , who will or will not earn pilots wings , or become a special forces operator .
Now , however , the DOD is moving far beyond its generalized use of the social sciences and is making a considerable effort to incorporate ECN and a bevy of related disciplines into its arsenal .
If approached correctly and conducted properly , this effort , and the technology and / or knowledge transfer from it , could be the catalyst for a certifiable revolution in human affairs .
At the very least , DODs surge into these fields may produce unmanned and autonomous intelligence biotechnologies , warfighting and medical biomachinery ( with civilian applications ) , along with thousands of terabytes of data on human behavior .
In any other time this might be termed acceptable progress .
Advancements in ECN and associated fields have changed what acceptable means .
Consider , for example , the Defense Advanced Research Agencys ( DARPA ) Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures ( BICA ) program .
 Recent advances in cognitive psychology and neuroscience have given us a much richer scientific understanding of how cognition works in the human brain .
The BICA program is developing a new generation of cognitive architectures and computational models of human cognition based on that new understanding .
One BICA team consists of scientists from the University of Michigan , MIT Media Lab , AlgoTek , Dartmouth , Johns Hopkins , Harvard University and Rutgers University .
They have developed TOSCA : A Comprehensive Brain Based Cognitive Architecture .
According to the researchers ,
 This organization [ TOSCA ] starts to answer the question as to where is the magic in human cognition 
The United States national security establishment has determined that the study of the brain - behavior relationships -- and its participation and interaction with the global organism -- is essential to national security .
Today , in the intelligence community , for example , the social sciences are being called upon to assist analysts in the development of new methods for educing information ( interrogation ) from prisoners of war and / or conflict .
Beyond contributions to United States  national security , ECN and associated disciplines may offer new approaches and solutions to minimize violence and ethnic conflict ; prevent or manage warfare , pandemics and poverty ; protect the global commons ; reduce income disparity ; and negotiate the allocation of finite resources and space amongst nations and / or groups .
New gear is required to help humanity manage that which is the source of its complexity : brain - human behavior relationships .
 We are at a crossroads of human existence :
We possess the technical knowledge required to provide for the material needs of all of humanity without systematic plunder and extermination of others : yet , systematic plunder and genocidal extermination continue to thrive .
 We used to wonder where war lived , what it was that made it so vile .
And now we realize that we know where it lives , that it is inside ourselves . 
Humanity is one of the many children of evolutionary forces .
ECN may play a key role in helping humanity relook its role on the planet .
ECN may convince humans that they are agents in an interconnected local to global organism .
The acceptance of this fact , this reality , may come just in time for humanity as it faces global instability .
Such knowledge and the practical application of it -- now seems critical to the survival , stability and prosperity of our species and those that support us .
A key feature of homo sapiens ' evolutionary design has been the ability to forecast ; to think ahead , to model and simulate multiple scenarios and outcomes for survival , stability and prosperity .
Evolution seems to be working its magic as sections of the government , commercial organizations , academia , and the worlds public recognize that survival , stability and prosperity are very fragile realities .
There seems to be a sense of urgency in developing new models to manage the future .
The human species faces global climate change ; ethnic conflict in geostrategic regions ; simmering immigration conflict in apparently stable democracies ; intermittent warfare ; disinformation ; income disparity and employment insecurity , the mobility of corporations to roam the planet in search of low cost labor ; the continued spread of weapons of mass destruction ; and significantly - - a new era of global economic competition between individual powers like China , Basil , India , Russia , the United States , and consortium 's like the European Union , the South American Community of Nations , and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization .
In local - to - global savannahs and jungles ; nations , and groups that want to form nations , now have many choices for international support , recognition , and economic and military assistance .
They can roam the globe via the Internet or by aircraft .
They can openly appeal to national governments , covertly appeal to a governments military - intelligence agencies and private security contractors , or to quasi - state groups for support .
They have far more maneuverability to pit the larger global economic competitors against one another to get the best economic package , thwart a military intervention , or simply buy time to purse a policy .
Iran , for example , in pursuit of regional influence , nuclear power and weapons capability , has conducted an impressive series of maneuvers that often match European Union , Chinese , Russian , Turkish , Pakistani and Indian economic needs against United States and Israeli interests .
Predators and Prey
On the flip side , larger nations can utilize smaller nations and quasi-state groups in an effort to pursue policies and destabilize competitors .
With its military supremacy , the United States , like any upstanding , self - interested predator , has consistently made life and trade difficult for many intransigent nations and groups .
But why do many nations prefer war ?
The phenomenon of removing the brakes on non-violent behavior and the promotion of war as a positive activity and economic engine is one of the most understudied issues in human history .
ECN may be useful in understanding the war phenomenon as it relates to creation of dehumanized others and violence in general .
According to the United States ' Federal Bureau of Investigation , approximately 16,000 people are murdered each year in the United States .
Nations and peoples around the globe are coping not only with crime , but with the fallout from conventional and guerrilla warfare in Iraq , Afghanistan , Pakistan , Somalia , Chechnya , Pakistan , Turkey , Iran , Sudan , Colombia , Gaza , the West Bank , Lebanon , Kashmir , Nigeria , and Saudi Arabia .
Refugees fleeing conflict , increased global fuel costs , the spread of disease , and the creation of slums that house next - generation insurgents are just a handful of the effects of todays conflicts .
The United States generic response to much of this international activity has been to restructure military commands and build more military bases , embassies and consulates around the globe to encircle and contain conflict areas .
In short , a sort of quarantine - based approach .
This is particularly evident with countries and regions rich in natural resources and in close proximity to sea and land - based choke points .
A recent example of this was the creation of a new Unified Combatant Command called AFRICOM .
Coincidently , the United States government announced AFRICOMs existence on February 6 , 2007 , in the midst of the Chinese governments 12 nation tour of Africa .
Global climate change , in the most severe scenarios , threatens to alter large portions of the planet and in the process either exterminate or relocate many of the humans , plants and other creatures that subsist on it .
With the most advanced predictive human behavior models available , humanity may still ignore data forecasting catastrophe .
Federal , state and local officials ' response to Hurricane Katrina demonstrated that even with ample warning and time to prepare for difficult outcomes , ignorance stymied success .
Severe weather events may continue to destabilize densely populated coastal regions resulting in refugee populations and disruption of commercial and national security enterprises .
Hurricane Katrina temporarily shut down United States  Navy contractor Northrop Grummans shipbuilding operations in Pascagoula , Mississippi .
Katrina has hampered Northrop Grummans ability to hire skilled workers and house them .
Hence , it is no surprise that global climate change has been determined to be an urgent national security threat to the United States by the influential Center for Naval Analysis in Alexandria , Virginia .
Just as global climate change is inevitable , so too is an increase in the worlds population .
By 2050 there will likely be 9 billion human beings occupying the globe with 60 percent of that number living in urban environments in close proximity to ocean littoral zones .
Approximately 1 billion of the 9 billion will be relegated to slum life or coerced to migrate as displaced human beings in search of improved economic opportunity .
One Thing Affects Everything
According to Robert Jervis ,  Garrett Hardin gets to the heart of the matter in pointing out that , contrary to many hopes and expectations , we cannot develop or find any highly specific agent which will do only one thing
We can never do merely one thing .
Wishing to kill insects , we may put an end to the singing of birds Seeking to protect the environment by developing nonpolluting sources of electric power , we build windmills that kill hawks and eagles that fly into the blades ; cleaning the water in our harbors allows the growth of mollusks and crustaceans that destroys wooden piers and bulkheads 
Jervis pointed out that its the same in politics .
 In politics , connections are often more idiosyncratic , but their existence guarantees that here too , most actions , no matter how well targeted , will have multiple affects . 
This dizzyingly interconnected environment has confused , perhaps even frightened , todays global leaders and their advisors whose worldviews were heavily influenced by the binary simplicity of the Cold War and the illusory post - Cold War dominance of the United States .
More problematic is local - to - global leadership that tends to consult antediluvian belief systems and mythical beings in their decision making processes .
Hence , leaders the world over particularly here in the United States -- are making decisions based on a Flatland approach , ignoring consequences , fallout , outcomes , and linkages .
This mode of thinking rolls downhill to infect local , regional , national and global populations .
For example , the United States involvement in Iraq and elsewhere on the Asian continent provides an obvious example of cloudy judgment by leadership and the subsequent disastrous fallout .
Additionally , once dominant institutions , and important tools of United States foreign and economic policy , are seeing their influence wane in the presence of simple geopolitical competition The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are two organizations whose reach has been shortened by the inflexibility and predictability of United States ' foreign policy .
The Chinese government has been courting alliances by disbursing large amounts of cash in the form of no interest loans and with minimal interference in the borrowers internal affairs .
This is in stark contrast to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund who demand painful economic reforms from their borrowers .
With $ 1 trillion ( US ) in cash reserves , and an energy - hungry economy , China is acting as one might expect : it is maximizing its prospects for survival .
stability and prosperity .
Exploring and Dissecting the Human Terrain
 The increasing global interdependence implies an increase in complexity .
However , the relationship that was discussed between this complexity and the internal structural changes that are taking place in social and economic systems provides us with an additional insight .
The change from hierarchical to distributed control implies that the complexity of collective behaviors is not only increasing , it is already higher than that of a single individual .
In this context , the traditional conflict between individual and collective good and rights should be revisited .
This philosophical and practical conflict manifested itself in the conflict between democracy and communism .
It was assumed that communism represented an ideology of the collective while democracy represented an ideology of the individual .
The transition to a complex organism implies that this conflict has been resolved , not in favor of one or the other , but rather of a third category an interdependent complex collective formed out of diverse individuals .
The traditional collective model was a model that relied on the uniformity of the individuals rather than diversity .
Similarly , the ideology of the individual did not view the individual in relation to the collective , but rather the individual serving himself or herself .
It should be acknowledge that both philosophies were deeper than their caricatures would suggest .
The philosophy of democracy included the idea that the individualistic actions would also serve the benefit of the collective , and the philosophy of communism included the idea that the collective would benefit the individual .
Nevertheless , the concept of civilization as a complex organism formed out of human beings is qualitatively different than either form of government .
There are two natural conclusions to be drawn from recognizing that human beings are part of a global organism .
First .
one can recognize that human civilization has a remarkable capacity for responding to external and internal challenges .
The existence of such a capacity for response does not mean human civilization will survive external challenges any more than the complexity of an organism guarantees its survival .
However , one can hope that the ability to prevent local disasters will increase Second , the complexity of our individual lives must be understood in the context of a system that must enable its components ( us ) to contribute effectively to the collective system
The merging of disciplines in the field of complex systems runs counter to the increasing specialization in science and engineering [ but ] it provides many opportunities for synergies and the recognition of general principles that can form a basis for education and understanding in all fields . 
In February 2007 , the Defense Science Board ( DSB ) released a little noticed report titled , 21st Century Strategic Technology Vectors .
In the report the DSB recommended that military planners explore the Human Terrain in which US warfighters operate .
To do this , the DSB suggested a radical approach : tap into the non-kinetic social sciences network for analytical data and marry future findings and applications to the militarys warfighting toolkit .
 Human , Social , cultural and behavior ( HSCB ) modeling pushes the boundaries of DODs comfort zone the farthest .
However , it is an area that DOD cannot afford to ignore .
The DOD needs to become much more familiar with the theories , methods , and models from psychology , sociology , cultural anthropology , cognitive science , political science and economics in order to be able to identify those with real potential to add value to DODs toolkit .
Coupling these to quantitative and computational modeling and simulation techniques from mathematics , physics , statistics , operations research , and computer science could lead to powerful new tools that represent complex human and social systems
One promising starting point for the application of HSCB models is to complement the more familiar physical network modeling with human / group behavioral models .
HSCB models are designed to help understand the structure , interconnections , dependencies , behavior , and trends associated with organizational entities .
Macro HSCB models address nation states , socio- cultural regions , economies , and political systems .
Micro HSCB models deal with religious and ethnic tribes , militias , insurgent and terrorist networks , and military units at the tactical level .
Integrated models try to tie together the macro and micro models .
A formidable challenge in modeling social and behavioral phenomena is to integrate and make coherent micro-macro models at multiple levels of data , granularity , and analysis , and across multiple disciplines of the social sciences , and to acquire and structure data that can be used to guide and test the models . 
Evolutionary Psychology : Some Basics
Evolutionary Psychology offers four linked , interdependent paths to understanding how brain - behavior relationships change over time in individuals and populations .
Change and / or adaptation happens biologically through molecular development that affects the genetic substrates of behavior ; psychologically through emotions , and conscious and unconscious mental activity ; culturally through social life ; and environmentally as behavior adapts to ecosystem and social system changes .
Evolutionary Psychology is an approach and a way of thinking .
The mind is seen as a set of information - processing mechanisms designed by natural selection to solve adaptive problems faced by our hunter - gatherer ancestors during the Pleistocene era .
There are five basic principles that form the foundation of Evolutionary Psychology .
1 . The brain is a physical system .
It functions as a computer .
Its circuits are designed to generate behavior that is appropriate to your environmental circumstances .
2 . Our neural circuits were designed by natural selection to solve problems that our ancestors faced during our species evolutionary history .
3 . Consciousness is just the tip of the iceberg .
Most of what goes in your mind is hidden from you .
As a result , your conscious experience can mislead you into thinking that our circuitry is simpler than it really is .
Most problems that you experience as easy to solve are very difficult to solve as they require very complicated neural circuitry .
4 . Different neural circuits are specialized for solving different adaptive problems .
5 . Our modern skulls house a stone age mind .
 Our species lived as hunter - gatherers 1000 times longer than as anything else .
The world that seems so familiar to you an mea world with roads , schools , grocery stores , factories , farms and nation - states has lasted for only an eye blink of time when compared to our entire evolutionary history
The computer age is only a little older than the typical college student and the industrial revolution is a mere 200 years old .
Agriculture first appeared on earth only 10,000 years ago , and it wasnt until abut 5000 years ago that as many as half the human population engaged in farming rather than hunting and gathering .
Natural selection is a slow process and there havent been enough generations for it to design circuits that are well adapted to post - industrial life . 
Evolutionary Cognitive Neuroscience : Problem Solving Tool
ECN fuses Evolutionary Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience into one unified theory of human behavior based on the foundations of evolutionary meta - theory .
The fruitfulness of ECN and , hence , the DODs R&D efforts to divine the Human Terrain , depends largely upon the willingness of participants and practitioners to accept and apply the general principles of Evolution and , most particularly , the basic tenets of Evolutionary Psychology .
 Like Pre-Darwinian psychology and other social sciences , cognitive neuroscience without evolution will have difficulty accurately describing the functional workings of the human mind A cognitive neuroscience approach to ultimate questions without evolutionary meta - theoretical guidance makes little sense
An evolutionary perspective provides a structure from which to guide empirical investigations and hypothesis generation about brain behavior relationships Evolutionary psychology assumes that an evolved psychological mechanism and its corresponding neural substrates is an information - processing module that was selected during a species  evolutionary history because it reliably produces behavior that solved a particular adaptive problem .
Evolved psychological mechanisms are understood in terms of their specific inputs , decision rules and outputs .
The filter of natural selection operates on psychological mechanisms that produce behavior .
Natural selection cannot operate on behavior directly , but on the genes associated with neural substrates that generate the psychological mechanisms that produce the behavior Evolutionary Psychology is not post hoc storytelling : its practitioners often use a deductive approach moving from theory to data
The majority of psychological mechanisms are presumed to be domain specific .
The mind is comprised of content - dependent machinery physiological and psychological mechanisms -- that is presumed to have evolved to solve specific adaptive problems .
Psychological mechanisms can also be expressed as cognitive biases that cause people to more readily attend to some pieces of information relative to others A domain , when referring to a psychological mechanism , is a selection pressure , an adaptive problem .
Domain , then , is synonymous with problem .
A domain - specific mechanism refers to a problem - specific mechanism a mechanism that evolved to solve a specific adaptive problem .
Although evolutionary and cognitive psychologists use the term domain - specific , perhaps some confusion could be avoided if the more accurate term problem - specific were employed .
Why is ECN important ?
Without evolutionary meta - theoretical guidance , cognitive science will fail to describe with anything but superficial accuracy the human and animal mind .
Cognitive science will simply explain proximate mechanisms ( i.e. , the how ) or brain - behavior relationships ( most often using theoretical models derived from standard social science models ) .
This is only half the equation .
The approach misses the ultimate ( i.e. ,  why ) questions of brain behavior relationships .
By adopting the ECN approach and directly addressing ultimate questions about brain - behavior relationships , scientists will be in a position to better describe the cognitive processes and the neural correlates that they investigate .
Likewise without cognitive neuroscientific methods , evolutionary psychology may not be able to adequately describe and understand the neurophysiological mediators to psychological adaptations and hence may never be able to accurately describe the evolved nature of the human mind .
Without peering into the brain with techniques such as modern functional neuroimaging , evolutionary psychological investigations can only describe the cognitive processing of human mental characteristics .
Evolutionary Psychology can describe function but is limited in its description of structure , and thus has no ability to relate function to structure which might be important especially in comparative investigations of cognitive evolution .
The relationship between structure and function is inherently a problem of evolutionary biology ; .i.e. , the genes that give rise to brain structure and its component nuclei and modularity , as well as its ability to process information , were the combined units of selection .
The need for an integrated science of the mind that utilizes evolutionary meta - theoretical guidance to cognitive neuroscience investigations is overdue , but beginning to flourish ...
By adopting an ECN approach , scientists will be in a position to think about uniquely human traits such as higher - level consciousness , theory of mind and self awareness .
It is likely that the most exciting advancements in technology for understanding the evolved mind are going to come from interdisciplinary collaborations ...
In fact , ECN might be the only approach that can give rise to such an understanding .
Evolutionary cognitive neuroscience might be the newest science of the mind . 
Applications
ECN may be used to inform current studies of human activity by providing insights as to how 21st Century humanity graduated from multiple hunter - gatherer bands , tribes , chiefdoms , and kingdoms to become nation - states .
This may provide insights to public policy makers of the future , particularly given that humanity may be now working its way from nation - state back to tribal - state as the accelerated global mobility of everything from insurgent groups and viral strains to ideas and corporations threatens slow - moving governing institutions .
Already , ECN has tackled matters as varied as water pollution and fetal development ; the role of women and men in society and conflict ; violent crime ; leadership styles ; terrorism , law and sentencing ; world government ; drug use , and an array of other issues falling into brain - behavior relationships .
In the end , humanity should be its own best resource for researching and solving complexity since humanity itself is the root cause of its problems .
ECN may lead humanity to figure itself out .
In that process there may be a possibility that this discovery will show that the species is really not as complex as it is egotistical and dualistic by evolutionary design .
Humanity may find that it does , indeed , occupy a special place -- not in the known universe or some mythical after - life , but right here at home .
Dangers
Neuroweapons may be an outcome of ECN R&D programs .
It is likely that DOD may classify as Top Secret programs that seek to turn the speed of thought into a weapon , or programs that blur the line between human and machine .
With classification , no one may ever know of the existence of such programs .
Some in the scientific community have suggested that , beyond the development of neuro - biomachinery and genetic manipulation , non-traceable neuroweapons with viral genetic payloads may be used to disrupt the brain and central nervous system .
As a result , the creation of neurosecurity advisory and / or ethics boards may be required to keep R&D and testing efforts in bounds .
I recently wrote to John Edwards ’08 and in my post on his blog I stated that he should start talking about the civil liberties that we have lost in this nation .
If anyone knows my writing , for almost four years I have been decrying the liberties that we citizen ’s have lost under this Bush / Cheney Neo -Con government .
I received a response on John Edwards ’s site that basically told me that John will be talking about the loss of our civil liberties when he is through with the caucuses .
I was told that he does n’t want to “ confuse ” the voters before the primaries .
Well , this is typical of the politicians in America .
It seems like even John Edward ’s just does n’t “ get it ” .
What people are calling the unrest and the disillusionment with the American political system is “ The Great Awakening ” .
People are seeing through the duopoly of the two - party system and demanding better .
They are tires of the “ same old , same old ” and they want someone that will actually do something to restore the rights of the people , to cut waste and spending by the Federal Government that is pushing the economy to the limit , and they want more than anything , to stop our hundreds of foreign involvements especially in Iraq and Afghanistan where we are borrowing over 2 Billion per day from China and Japan .
When John Edwards tells me that he will begin talking about civil liberties after the caucuses , he is basically saying either that it is n’t a priority , or that the American people are just too stupid to understand more than three things at once .
He is fighting against the corporacracy ( and I believe I was one of the first people to coin that word over five years ago ) , he is fighting for health - care for Americans , and that ’s just about it .
I have not heard him say that he will abolish the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 , nor have I heard him say that he will try to abolish the revamped Insurrection Act .
I have not heard him state that he will follow the Constitution and restore equal power to the three branches of our government , or completely leave Iraq and stop construction of the giant bases they are building there now .
While it may be politically expedient not to mention these things for fear of turning off voters that are inclined to vote for a Democratic hard - liner such as Hillary Clinton , he is not giving the American people much credit for being able to think on their feet with intelligence or integrity .
John Edwards is just behaving like every other politician that is running save two , Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul .
It ’s not Kuchinich that have attracted the people , its Paul .
The truth is that during this “ Great Awakening ” the people of this country have heard , and are listening to him .
He is speaking truth to power , and for a myriad of reasons , he is catching on like no other candidate I have ever seen in my lifetime , that includes John Fitzgerald Kennedy .
Americans are aching to get the powerful , well - connected politicians out of power .
They are demanding radical change and do n’t want to hear the same old rhetoric from the same old faces .
John Edwards may think that he knows just what he is doing , but I believe he misunderstands what the American people are demanding .
The ability to raise $ 18,000,000.00 + off of the internet by Ron Paul in a little over two days from private individuals speaks volumes .
This “ Great Awakening ” is a result of being lied to by our government , giving tax breaks to the wealthy that keep offshore tax havens , by the death and destruction we have wrought on innocent people , by bankrupting forces that threaten our very existence by borrowing to prolong this war , by the inaccurate and suspect investigations of 9/11 , and most of all by the insidious way this President has maneuvered to gain personal power .
It does n’t stop there , the “ tasering ” of protesters , the First Amendment Areas for protesters away from public view , the “ No - Fly ” lists for dissidents ’ , the requirement for passports to go anywhere , a “ National ID ” that will be required by May 2008 to prove that you are an American and have a right to be wherever you are , all these things look and smell like fascism .
I have always lived by these words ;
“ If it looks like a duck , quacks like a duck , it ’s probably a duck ” .
In this case , I see a duck , so does everyone else .
I have been censored on other websites for my views .
I am an American Veteran that has spent over 20 years in this country ’s military .
I am not a “ fringe radical ” yet my views are sometimes called radical .
I was actively against the war in Vietnam and suffered in the Army because of my views , never the less I was vindicated when what we predicted turned to become reality .
We were lied to then , and we are being lied to now .
Kuchinich and Paul are the only ones that are speaking “ Truth to Power ” .
For some odd reason , Ron Paul has managed to “ capture ” the people ’s hearts and minds .
Is this truly “ The Great Awakening ” ?
I believe it is , and it ’s about time !
That ’s the way I see it .
This is the first in a series of articles , discussing why many software rewrite projects end badly and what to do to avoid some of the ways I 've seen them go astray .
You ’ve got an existing , successful software product .
You ’ve hit
the ceiling on extensibility and maintainability .
Your project platform is
inflexible , and your application is a software house of cards that
ca n’t support another new feature .
You ’ve seen the videos , the weblog posts and the hype , and you ’ve decided you ’re going to re-implement your product in Rails ( or Java , or . NET , or Erlang , etc. ) .
Beware .
This is a longer , harder , more failure - prone path than you expect .
Throughout my career in software development , I ’ve been involved in Big Rewrite after Big Rewrite .
I suspect it ’s because I have an interest in learning eclectic computer languages , operating systems , and development environments .
Not being just - a- Java - guy or just - a- Windows - guy has led to me becoming a serial rewriter .
I ’ve been on projects to replace C , COBOL , PHP , Visual Basic , Perl , PLSQL , VBX ( do n’t ask ! ) and all manner of architectural atrocities with the latest and greatest technology of the day .
In many cases , these Big Rewrite projects have resulted in unhappy customers , political battles , missed deadlines , and sometimes complete failure to deliver .
In all cases , the projects were considerably harder than the projects ’ initiators ever thought they would be .
This is not a technology problem .
It ’s not at all Rails - specific , but being in the limelight these days , Rails implementations are both very likely to happen and very risky right now .
Why So Hard ?
So , why , in software rewrites , when you ’re traversing exclusively familiar territory are the results so often unpredictable and negative ?
For the next week , I ’ll post specific reasons I ’ve seen things go wrong .
The following is a list which will eventually be made into links :
Stay tuned .
Aug. 28 -- The FBI has quietly built a sophisticated , point - and - click surveillance system that performs instant wiretaps on almost any communications device , according to nearly a thousand pages of restricted documents newly released under the Freedom of Information Act .
The surveillance system , called DCSNet , for Digital Collection System Network , connects FBI wiretapping rooms to switches controlled by traditional land - line operators , internet - telephony providers and cellular companies .
It is far more intricately woven into the nation 's telecom infrastructure than observers suspected .
It 's a " comprehensive wiretap system that intercepts wire - line phones , cellular phones , SMS and push - to - talk systems , " says Steven Bellovin , a Columbia University computer science professor and longtime surveillance expert .

Snapshots of the FBI Spy Docs
DCSNet is a suite of software that collects , sifts and stores phone numbers , phone calls and text messages .
The system directly connects FBI wiretapping outposts around the country to a far - reaching private communications network .
Many of the details of the system and its full capabilities were redacted from the documents acquired by the Electronic Frontier Foundation , but they show that DCSNet includes at least three collection components , each running on Windows - based computers .
The $ 10 million DCS - 3000 client , also known as Red Hook , handles pen-registers and trap - and - traces , a type of surveillance that collects signaling information -- primarily the numbers dialed from a telephone -- but no communications content .
( Pen registers record outgoing calls ; trap - and - traces record incoming calls . )
DCS - 6000 , known as Digital Storm , captures and collects the content of phone calls and text messages for full wiretap orders .
A third , classified system , called DCS - 5000 , is used for wiretaps targeting spies or terrorists .
Together , the surveillance systems let FBI agents play back recordings even as they are being captured ( like TiVo ) , create master wiretap files , send digital recordings to translators , track the rough location of targets in real time using cell - tower information , and even stream intercepts outward to mobile surveillance vans .
FBI wiretapping rooms in field offices and undercover locations around the country are connected through a private , encrypted backbone that is separated from the internet .
Sprint runs it on the government 's behalf .
The network allows an FBI agent in New York , for example , to remotely set up a wiretap on a cell phone based in Sacramento , California , and immediately learn the phone 's location , then begin receiving conversations , text messages and voicemail pass codes in New York .
With a few keystrokes , the agent can route the recordings to language specialists for translation .
The numbers dialed are automatically sent to FBI analysts trained to interpret phone - call patterns , and are transferred nightly , by external storage devices , to the bureau 's Telephone Application Database , where they 're subjected to a type of data mining called link analysis .
FBI endpoints on DCSNet have swelled over the years , from 20 " central monitoring plants " at the program 's inception , to 57 in 2005 , according to undated pages in the released documents .
By 2002 , those endpoints connected to more than 350 switches .
Today , most carriers maintain their own central hub , called a " mediation switch , " that 's networked to all the individual switches owned by that carrier , according to the FBI .
The FBI 's DCS software links to those mediation switches over the internet , likely using an encrypted VPN .
Some carriers run the mediation switch themselves , while others pay companies like VeriSign to handle the whole wiretapping process for them .
The numerical scope of DCSNet surveillance is still guarded .
But we do know that as telecoms have become more wiretap - friendly , the number of criminal wiretaps alone has climbed from 1,150 in 1996 to 1,839 in 2006 .
That 's a 60 percent jump .
And in 2005 , 92 percent of those criminal wiretaps targeted cell phones , according to a report published last year .
These figures include both state and federal wiretaps , and do not include antiterrorism wiretaps , which dramatically expanded after 9/11 .
They also do n't count the DCS - 3000 's collection of incoming and outgoing phone numbers dialed .
Far more common than full - blown wiretaps , this level of surveillance requires only that investigators certify that the phone numbers are relevant to an investigation .
The Justice Department reports the number of pen registers to Congress annually , but those numbers are n't public .
According to the last figures leaked to the Electronic Privacy Information Center , judges signed 4,886 pen register orders in 1998 , along with 4,621 time extensions .
The law that makes the FBI 's surveillance network possible had its genesis in the Clinton administration .
In the 1990s , the Justice Department began complaining to Congress that digital technology , cellular phones and features like call forwarding would make it difficult for investigators to continue to conduct wiretaps .
Congress responded by passing the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act , or CALEA , in 1994 , mandating backdoors in U.S. telephone switches .
CALEA requires telecommunications companies to install only telephone - switching equipment that meets detailed wiretapping standards .
Prior to CALEA , the FBI would get a court order for a wiretap and present it to a phone company , which would then create a physical tap of the phone system .
With new CALEA - compliant digital switches , the FBI now logs directly into the telecom 's network .
Once a court order has been sent to a carrier and the carrier turns on the wiretap , the communications data on a surveillance target streams into the FBI 's computers in real time .
The Electronic Frontier Foundation requested documents on the system under the Freedom of Information Act , and successfully sued the Justice Department in October 2006 .
In May , a federal judge ordered the FBI to provide relevant documents to the EFF every month until it has satisfied the FOIA request .
" So little has been known up until now about how DCS works , " says EFF attorney Marcia Hofmann .
" This is why it 's so important for FOIA requesters to file lawsuits for information they really want . "
Special Agent Anthony DiClemente , chief of the Data Acquisition and Intercept Section of the FBI 's Operational Technology Division , said the DCS was originally intended in 1997 to be a temporary solution , but has grown into a full - featured CALEA - collection software suite .
" CALEA revolutionizes how law enforcement gets intercept information , " DiClemente told Wired News .
" Before CALEA , it was a rudimentary system that mimicked Ma Bell . "
Privacy groups and security experts have protested CALEA design mandates from the start , but that did n't stop federal regulators from recently expanding the law 's reach to force broadband internet service providers and some voice - over - internet companies , such as Vonage , to similarly retrofit their networks for government surveillance .
Meanwhile , the FBI 's efforts to keep up with the current communications explosion is never - ending , according to DiClemente .
The released documents suggest that the FBI 's wiretapping engineers are struggling with peer - to - peer telephony provider Skype , which offers no central location to wiretap , and with innovations like caller - ID spoofing and phone - number portability .
But DCSNet seems to have kept pace with at least some new technologies , such as cell - phone push - to - talk features and most VOIP internet telephony .
" It is fair to say we can do push - to - talk , " DiClemente says .
" All of the carriers are living up to their responsibilities under CALEA . "
Matt Blaze , a security researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who helped assess the FBI 's now - retired Carnivore internet - wiretapping application in 2000 , was surprised to see that DCSNet seems equipped to handle such modern communications tools .
The FBI has been complaining for years that it could n't tap these services .
The redacted documentation left Blaze with many questions , however .
In particular , he said it 's unclear what role the carriers have in opening up a tap , and how that process is secured .
" The real question is the switch architecture on cell networks , " said Blaze .
" What 's the carrier side look like ? "
Randy Cadenhead , the privacy counsel for Cox Communications , which offers VOIP phone service and internet access , says the FBI has no independent access to his company 's switches .
" Nothing ever gets connected or disconnected until I say so , based upon a court order in our hands , " Cadenhead says .
" We run the interception process off of my desk , and we track them coming in .
We give instructions to relevant field people who allow for interconnection and to make verbal connections with technical representatives at the FBI . "
The nation 's largest cell - phone providers -- whose customers are targeted in the majority of wiretaps -- were less forthcoming .
AT&T politely declined to comment , while Sprint , T - Mobile and Verizon simply ignored requests for comment .
Agent DiClemente , however , seconded Cadenhead 's description .
" The carriers have complete control .
That 's consistent with CALEA , " DiClemente said .
" The carriers have legal teams to read the order , and they have procedures in place to review the court orders , and they also verify the information and that the target is one of their subscribers . "
Despite its ease of use , the new technology is proving more expensive than a traditional wiretap .
Telecoms charge the government an average of $ 2,200 for a 30 - day CALEA wiretap , while a traditional intercept costs only $ 250 , according to the Justice Department inspector general .
A federal wiretap order in 2006 cost taxpayers $ 67,000 on average , according to the most recent U.S. Court wiretap report .
What 's more , under CALEA , the government had to pay to make pre-1995 phone switches wiretap - friendly .
The FBI has spent almost $ 500 million on that effort , but many traditional wire - line switches still are n't compliant .
Processing all the phone calls sucked in by DCSNet is also costly .
At the backend of the data collection , the conversations and phone numbers are transferred to the FBI 's Electronic Surveillance Data Management System , an Oracle SQL database that 's seen a 62 percent growth in wiretap volume over the last three years -- and more than 3,000 percent growth in digital files like e-mail .
Through 2007 , the FBI has spent $ 39 million on the system , which indexes and analyzes data for agents , translators and intelligence analysts .
To security experts , though , the biggest concern over DCSNet is n't the cost :
It 's the possibility that push - button wiretapping opens new security holes in the telecommunications network .
More than 100 government officials in Greece learned in 2005 that their cell phones had been bugged , after an unknown hacker exploited CALEA - like functionality in wireless - carrier Vodafone 's network .
The infiltrator used the switches ' wiretap - management software to send copies of officials ' phone calls and text messages to other phones , while simultaneously hiding the taps from auditing software .
The FBI 's DiClemente says DCSNet has never suffered a similar breach , so far as he knows .
" I know of no issue of compromise , internal or external , " DiClemente says .
He says the system 's security is more than adequate , in part because the wiretaps still " require the assistance of a provider . "
The FBI also uses physical - security measures to control access to DCSNet end points , and has erected firewalls and other measures to render them " sufficiently isolated , " according to DiClemente .
But the documents show that an internal 2003 audit uncovered numerous security vulnerabilities in DCSNet -- many of which mirror problems unearthed in the bureau 's Carnivore application years earlier .
In particular , the DCS - 3000 machines lacked adequate logging , had insufficient password management , were missing antivirus software , allowed unlimited numbers of incorrect passwords without locking the machine , and used shared logins rather than individual accounts .
The system also required that DCS - 3000 's user accounts have administrative privileges in Windows , which would allow a hacker who got into the machine to gain complete control .
Columbia 's Bellovin says the flaws are appalling and show that the FBI fails to appreciate the risk from insiders .
" The underlying problem is n't so much the weaknesses here , as the FBI attitude towards security , " he says .
The FBI assumes " the threat is from the outside , not the inside , " he adds , and it believes that " to the extent that inside threats exist , they can be controlled by process rather than technology . "
Bellovin says any wiretap system faces a slew of risks , such as surveillance targets discovering a tap , or an outsider or corrupt insider setting up unauthorized taps .
Moreover , the architectural changes to accommodate easy surveillance on phone switches and the internet can introduce new security and privacy holes .
" Any time something is tappable there is a risk , " Bellovin says .
" I 'm not saying , ' Do n't do wiretaps , ' but when you start designing a system to be wiretappable , you start to create a new vulnerability .
A wiretap is , by definition , a vulnerability from the point of the third party .
The question is , can you control it ? "

The turmoil in Pakistan might have one positive result : the need to strengthen the American presence in neighboring Afghanistan could narrow the White House ’s options and permanently derail plans to attack Iran .
Nevertheless , the likelihood of a war that will be a catastrophe for both belligerents , almost certainly for the entire Middle East , and possibly for the world at large , remains at a high level .
War might even be regarded as inevitable because it is the only option remaining for decision - makers in Washington , who have effectively closed the door on other approaches that might reduced the level of hostility .
Contrary to the repeated assertions by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , an endless series of threats emanating from Washington is not diplomacy .
The United States is refusing to negotiate with Iran , and the only obstacle to a war from the U.S. side is the resistance coming from Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and some military and naval officers , most notably the Central Command ’s Admiral William Fallon , who are heavily outnumbered by those in the administration and outside it who are pro-war .
Anti-Iranian resolutions pass by large majorities in Congress .
Both parties and nearly all the presidential candidates assert the necessity of war to disarm Iran and have placed no impediment on its initiation , the mainstream media is as acquiescent as it was in the run-up to Iraq , and the latest Zogby poll indicates that even a thin majority of the public has been convinced by the war hysteria and is supportive of conflict .
Powerful lobbying groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) continue to resist talks and urge a military resolution .
It may be that few in the White House and Congress actually want to pull the trigger on Iran because they are gun shy after the debacle in Iraq , but the danger of a larger war growing out of a relatively minor incident is very real , as is the possibility that a nervous Israel will play some part in initiating a major conflict that will draw the United States in .
One of the strongest constituencies supporting military action against the perceived Iranian threat is voters who describe themselves as politically conservative .
Most also identify as Republicans .
To a certain extent , this support derives from a desire to support " their president " rather than from any serious consideration of what the probable consequences of yet another war in the Middle East might be .
It also likely stems from a more general belief that the United States should have a strong and assertive defense policy in a troubled world , coupled with the irrational fear that " Islamofascism " is a global force that threatens national security .
Those who see an existential struggle join with the Christian Armageddonists to welcome an " end days " conflict that pits good against evil , but they are likely a small minority even among conservatives .
As is often the case , conservatives should look to the example of President Ronald Reagan to see how global conflict should be managed .
Reagan won the Cold War against a powerful nuclear armed adversary through calculated steps that increased bilateral cooperation on security issues while at the same time ratcheting up pressure on the shaky Soviet economy .
The radically different imperialistic foreign policy of the Bush administration is difficult to reconcile with the cautious internationalism embraced by Reagan and his Republican predecessors , which proceeded carefully and sought to avoid involvement in other people ’s quarrels .
Bush rarely exhibits other traditional conservative values , such as a preference for smaller and less intrusive government , fiscal responsibility , rule of law , and regard for the Constitution .
He has convincingly demonstrated that he is not an heir to the Reagan tradition .
George W. Bush , like his father before him , fraudulently claims the conservative label solely for his own political convenience .
Traditional Republican conservatives and foreign policy realists believe above all that war should genuinely be a last resort , not a first option , and that war must absolutely be in response to unambiguous threats to a vital national interest .
It is the White House ’s embrace of permanent war and nation - building in the Middle East that should be most troubling , as it has already meant the deaths of thousands of American soldiers .
Fiscally responsible conservatives should also be concerned about borrowing what will eventually amount to trillions of dollars to finance wars of choice .
This has resulted in a plummeting dollar , higher interest rates , and increased energy costs , which has given China the keys to the U.S. economy .
Concerning Iran , the United States intelligence community has yet to complete a National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) , though the report is scheduled to be issued by the end of this month .
Unlike other recent NIEs , it will not have key judgments released in unclassified form , which means that the public and even many government officials will not know what it says .
There is every indication that the delay in the preparation of the report was due to concerns by the administration that it was not " strong " enough .
The White House will undoubtedly seek to use the document to buttress its case for action against Iran .
From the conservative viewpoint , it would be far better if the administration were to use the NIE to undertake a careful assessment of the Iranian relationship and respond to that assessment realistically .
No one doubts that the United States and Iran have genuine differences that include possible nuclear proliferation , regional dominance , support of terrorism , and Iran ’s proper role as a neighbor of both Afghanistan and Iraq .
These differences cannot be resolved with a bombing campaign .
They should be dealt with through diplomacy , without any preconditions , and it is up to the United States to jump - start the process because the United States has more to lose from another war , most particularly in economic terms .
Far from an extreme or radical position , positive and comprehensive diplomatic engagement with Iran was a key recommendation of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group and was also endorsed recently by Efraim Halevy , the former head of Israel ’s Mossad intelligence service .
Conservatives should also eschew the demonization and disinformation campaign against Iran , which has muddied the waters and made negotiations more difficult .
Iran has a legitimate , elected government , like it or not , and it should be treated with respect .
The United States should step back and make a serious and dispassionate estimate of the genuine threat posed by Iran without using the words " Hitler " or " Nazis , " or mentioning the year 1938 .
Conservatives who believe that there must be a " casus belli " to justify a conflict or who are practicing Christians and believe a war must be " just " should particularly note the lack of evidence suggesting that Iran is preparing to attack anyone .
The intelligence community believes that Iran might well have a secret nuclear weapons program , even though there is no evidence to support that suspicion .
But even if Iran is seeking nuclear weapons , there is broad consensus that the program is likely not far advanced , is suffering from technical problems , and is susceptible to internationally sanctioned steps to slow it down further as long as the United States takes the lead and abandons the role of school bully .
Conservatives should also be skeptical about other claims , as much of what appears in the media is false or misleading .
Iran has a vested interest in stabilizing both Iraq and Afghanistan , and the accounts of Tehran ’s involvement in both countries , most recently described as " conducting operations in our battle space " in Iraq , have been grossly overstated and frequently based on dubious intelligence .
While Iran is undoubtedly both able and willing to make the U.S. presence in Afghanistan and Iraq uncomfortable , the allegation that it has been deliberately " killing our soldiers , " which is the latest congressional pretext for going to war , is not supported by hard evidence .
That Iran would have any interest or ability to provide a weapon of mass destruction to a terrorist group is speculation piled on top of speculation .
It is unsupported by evidence , and observers of Iran have frequently noted that the regime of the mullahs has consistently behaved cautiously in support of its perceived national interest and is not suicidal .
Even if Iran does obtain one or two crude nuclear weapons , it is difficult to imagine how Tehran could pose a serious threat to the United States in the near term , because it can be both deterred and contained .
Finally , conservatives should believe that America comes first .
They should insist that the United States ’ interaction with Iran be based on our national interests , not Israel ’s , Saudi Arabia ’s , or any of the other countries ’ in the region , though those interests and concerns can be instrumental in shaping U.S. policies .
Any serious analysis of the growing conflict with Iran will reveal that there are serious issues between Tehran and Washington , but the " existential crisis " that has been fueling the talk of war is largely false in nature , a concoction of outside interests , including lobbies , interest groups , the media , and the military - industrial complex .
And Representative Carolyn B. Maloney , the New York Democratic who is vice chairwoman of the Joint Economic Committee , said she was glad that President Bush “ now recognizes the severity of current economic conditions ” and was not linking the stimulus package to permanent tax cuts .
“ But is not yet clear that he would agree to targeting a plan toward people most in need , ” she said .
At the White House , with members of his economic team flanking him , Mr. Bush said , “ We ’re in the midst of a challenging period . ”
But he said the American economy remains remarkably resilient and has overcome big challenges before .
The president said he based his overall optimism on the virtues of American workers , who “ have shown time and again that they are the most industrious , creative and enterprising people in the world . ”
Mr. Bush again urged Congress to pass legislation to modernize the Federal Housing Administration and enable it to provide additional help for struggling homeowners .
Mr. Bush tried to dispel any sense that the White House was shocked into action by the drumbeat of bad economic news over the past few days .
He said that , in fact , he and his economic team had begun a “ thorough assessment ” of conditions before he left for his trip to the Middle East .
But there was no mistaking the importance the White House attached to the president ’s remarks .
He was originally expected to deliver them at a plant in Frederick , Md. , which he visited this afternoon , but his remarks were rescheduled for late morning at the White House .
In his visit to the plant in Frederick , Mr. Bush said , “ We need to get this deal done and get it out , ” The Associated Press reported .
Treasury Secretary Paulson , in a briefing after the president ’s White House remarks , said : “ The cost of not acting has become too high .
We must act now . ”
Mr. Bush also offered a reminder that economic volatility is to be expected .
“ In a vibrant economy , markets rise and decline , ” he said .
“ We can not change that fundamental dynamic .
As a matter of fact , eliminating risk altogether would also eliminate the innovation and productivity that drive the creation of jobs and wealth in America . ”
James
Hudson moves warily through this car - choked city , looking over his shoulder , bracing for the next tense face - off or retaliatory attack .
He ’s one of 350 often - harried civilian officers who perform what many motorists consider an outright act of war :
He hands out parking tickets .
Especially in the congested Financial District , summons writers like Hudson are often considered urban predators , loathed for lurking shark - like on bicycles or in street buggies , employing such stealth tactics as chalk - marking tires and wielding prewritten tickets .
As a result , officers now deal with the sidewalk version of freeway ferocity : parking - ticket rage .

In 11 years on the job , Hudson has been cursed , had his foot run over , been shot with a pellet gun and had his knee whacked by marauding drivers .
Colleagues have been spit on and assaulted , one with a baseball bat .
For Hudson , such violence comes with the job : “ Some people do n’t know how to control their anger . ”
But officials are fighting back .
After a rise in attacks , the city is pushing stronger protection for officers , such as requiring all parking - control vehicles to be equipped with Mace and cameras .
A bill being introduced in Sacramento would also make it a felony to strike any parking control officer in the state .
Currently , penalties range from fines to community service .

“ It ’s a public safety issue , ” said Assemblyman Mark Leno ( D - San Francisco ) , who is sponsoring the bill .
“ Nobody takes a traffic ticket with a smile . ”
Assaults on parking control officers in San Francisco rose from 17 in 2005 to 28 last year .
During one week last November , four parking officers were attacked .
Two of them were hospitalized .
A male officer was repeatedly punched and his car window broken .
A female officer suffered a concussion and dislocated shoulder .
A 30 - year - old suspect in the latter attack faces three felony counts .
A judge raised her bail from $ 70,000 to $ 100,000 .

Parking problems have sparked violence between motorists as well .
In September , a 19 - year - old man was stabbed to death in an altercation over a parking spot .
In Los Angeles , the number of attacks against the city ’s 668 parking officers has also risen slightly , with 33 in the last fiscal year ending June 30 .
“ Thirty - five years ago , when I was writing parking tickets , which cost two bucks apiece back then , irate motorists either questioned my heritage or my intelligence , ” said Jimmy Price , chief of parking enforcement and traffic control in Los Angeles .
“ Now our officers face shootings , robbery , carjackings and physical assaults where a motorist had either a closed fist or a weapon .
People have been hurt , with a lot of work time lost . ”

The Los Angeles City Council soon will consider a proposal similar to the state ’s to stiffen penalties for violence against parking officers .
San Francisco has 365,000 registered vehicles and 320,000 on - street parking spots , supplemented by 280,000 spots in public and private garages and off - street lots .
The daily influx of 35,000 commuters can make snagging an on - street parking space in a busy area a frustrating roll of the dice .
Still , Dist .
Atty .
Kamala Harris has a warning for ticketed drivers : Keep your cool .
“ People ca n’t go turning their rage on a parking control officer who is simply doing his or her job , ” she said .
“ If you want to fight a ticket , go to Traffic Court .
Do n’t beat up the officer .
If you do , we ’re going to prosecute . ”

Like many of her colleagues , the 28 - year - old officer injured in November said she rarely eats in restaurants without wearing a jacket to cover her uniform .
After the attack on her , dozens of parking control officers rallied to demand better protection .
“ Nine out of 10 people we meet on our jobs are angry , ” said the officer , who asked not to be identified .
“ People have quit , the abuse is so bad . ”
Lawanna Preston , staff director of Local 790 of the Service Employees International Union , which represents Bay Area parking control officers , said that in seven years as a Berkeley parking officer , she was harassed by doctors , lawyers and college students .
“ People see you as an opportunity to sound off about the system , ” she said .
“ They ’re mad about the ticket , but it ’s also about how the government is always ripping them off . ”

In San Francisco , the 1.9 million citations issued last year generated $ 50 million -- the third - highest revenue source behind the airport and port districts , Preston said .
Yet the parking officers make only $ 40,000 a year .
“ They generate lots of money , but they do n’t get paid that much , ” she said .
“ The money is not going into their pocket . ”
Hudson , 46 , takes the verbal abuse with a Zen - like calm .
One recent morning , he chose not to ticket a motorist who had double - parked on a busy street while dashing into a store to buy coffee .
Instead , he gave the man a verbal warning .
The motorist drove off , telling Hudson to “ get a real job . ”

“ He gave me a few cuss words , ” Hudson said , shrugging .
His beat takes him past industrial garages and worn storefronts south of Market Street .
Dressed in a blue sweater jacket , pants and badge , he carries -- along with his Mace -- a hand - held computer and a mini- printer that enable him to write a summons in less than a minute .
On most shifts , he issues 80 or more tickets .
Sometimes he walks .
Sometimes he rides a hybrid bike or city - issued scooter .
But one part of his job stays the same : insults from motorists .

In a one - hour span recently , Hudson wrote half a dozen tickets .
But he also gave a few warnings -- such as the one to the window washers who parked their truck at a meter whose gauge had been obscured with gray paint .
Later , he called for a car parked in a loading zone to be towed .
Then he spied a car already sporting a ticket on its windshield .
After a check , Hudson saw that that car had not been moved in the 90 minutes since the first ticket was written .
So he issued a second $ 50 expired - meter summons .
“ This is not a punishment , ” he said .
“ It ’s a learning curve . ”
Nearby , he spied a van parked on the sidewalk .
Hudson tried to locate the driver , calling into an apartment building nearby .
Then he wrote the vehicle a $ 100 citation .

Within moments , plumber Jeremy Baldwin , 36 , emerged from the building , walking toward his van with a dazed look .
He admitted that he was a repeat scofflaw , one year collecting $ 7,000 in tickets .
He said he rarely buys a vehicle worth more than $ 1,000 because so many have been towed for nonpayment of fines .
“ Hey , ” he said , “ if I ’m an idiot , I ’m an idiot . ”
Baldwin stuffed the ticket into his shirt pocket .
The fine , which would be taken out of his check , meant he would not make any money that day .

“ It ’s a total wash , all my hard work , ” he sighed .
But Baldwin was n’t the type to blame the messenger .
“ No hard feelings , ” he called out to Hudson .
“ You ’re just doing your job . ”

More than 60 Christian , Jewish and Muslim leaders have signed a call to the American government and the religious authorities in Iran to open direct negotiations and stop planning for war .
The statement , “ A Pax on Both Our Houses ” ( “ pax ” is Latin for “ peace ” ) says the war in Iraq demonstrates how war wastes lives and resources , and violates human rights .
The statement was released Wednesday in Des Moines , to remind the presidential candidates and reporters now crisscrossing Iowa that many religious constituencies are still focused on foreign policy , organizers said .
The full text of the statement is available on interfaithpeacecommittee.org .
The Washington State Legislature held a hearing today on a bill urging Congress to impeach President Bush & Vice President Dick Cheney .
Hundreds of people crowded the rooms and halls during the hearing .

About 3 years ago we got into a distressing situation with a Best Buy in Chattanooga , TN .
We purchased a big screen TV from them and paid an additional $ 60 for having it delivered .
We waited anxiously all week to have it delivered .
However , when it was , it did n't work .
So , we called Best Buy and told them .
They said they 'd send somebody out , which they did .
The person came , looked at the set , and said , " It does n't work " .
Duh !
We said we'd be okay with them bringing us another set , so we waited another week and received the delivery of yet another non-working set .
I called Best Buy and told them to come and get it and reimburse us for the money we 'd paid in .
When we received our money , it was less the $ 60 for delivery .
I called to object .
The girl I talked to said , " We never give back delivery charges . "
I told her that they had n't delivered a working product to us , so they should n't charge us for delivery .
She replied , " But we DID deliver the set to you , therefore the delivery charge . "
I objected that the set did n't work , but she said that was n't her problem .
I finally lost my temper , and she hung up on me .
I called an asked to talk to the store manager .
I got some guy who I later found out was n't a manager at all , but he pretended to be .
He kept giving me the same drivel the woman had given me earlier .
I do n't know how many people I talked to at Best Buy .
I even tried e-mailing the company headquarters but got no response .
Finally I sought help from the Better Business Bureau who managed to get our " delivery charge " reimbursed as it should have been in the first place -- do n't you think ?
WASHINGTON , Sept. 23 — Dozens of world leaders are to gather at the United Nations on Monday for a full agenda of talks on how to fight global warming , and President Bush is skipping all the day ’s events but the dinner .
His focus instead is on his own gathering of leaders in Washington later this week , a meeting with the same stated goal , a reduction in the emissions blamed for climate change , but a fundamentally different idea of how to achieve it .
Mr. Bush ’s aides say that the parallel meeting does not compete against the United Nations ’ process — hijacking it , as his critics charge .
They say that Mr. Bush hopes to persuade the nations that produce 90 percent of the world ’s emissions to come to a consensus that would allow each , including the United States , to set its own policies rather than having limits imposed by binding international treaty .
“ It ’s our philosophy that each nation has the sovereign capacity to decide for itself what its own portfolio of policies should be , ” said James L. Connaughton , the president ’s chief environmental adviser .
HREF Considered Harmful " Let me tell you about ... " by Avi Bryant

Bill Clementson posts that although a lot of people are interested in the use of continuations for web applications programming , nobody has yet come up with an elevator pitch explanation of their benefits .
My pitch usually goes something like this : " Continuations bring precisely the same benefits to traditional web development that subroutines bring to GOTOs " .
Julian Fitzell and I had to expand on this for a tutorial we gave at Smalltalk Solutions .
Here 's the first part of the abstract : Dijkstra may have taught us 45 years ago that GOTO was a bad idea , but web development has barely caught up .
In the CGI model of web applications , each link that is followed triggers an entirely new execution of the program .
Building complex control flow out of these abrupt transitions can lead to a tangled and brittle mess of interdependent pages .
Modern frameworks such as WebObjects and Struts may remove many of the difficulties of CGI scripting , but they do not escape the web 's inherent GOTO : moving from one page to the next , whether through anchors , actions , forms , or forwards , is still a simple one - way jump .
Seaside is a framework for developing web - based applications that insulates the developer from the HTTP request / response loop , presenting the illusion of a continuous interactive session with the user .
Each page or form acts much like a subroutine , which returns a value to its caller based on user input .
Complex , conditional or looping workflows can be described in a single piece of straightforward Smalltalk code as a sequence of calls to individual pages .
The benefits this brings to the reusability and maintainability of web applications closely mimick the advances made by structured programming long ago .
Bill Clementson の投稿で 、 " たくさんの人 が Webアプリケーションのプログラミングにおける継続の使いかたについて、関心を持っているにもかかわらず、いまだに、その利点を手に取るようにわかりやすく説明したものにはお目にかからない " といわれている。
それには、私は、こんなふうな説明をすることにしている。" 継続が従来のWeb開発にもたらす利点というのは、ちょうどサブルーチンがGOTOにもたらした利点のようなものだ"と。
Julian Fitzell と私は、このことを主旨として 、Smalltalk Solutionsでのチュートリアルに使った。以下はそのアブストラクトのはじめの部分である。
Dijkstra は45年前にGOTO文は有害だと提唱したというが、Web開発もようやくそれに習うことができるようになった。WebアプリケーションのCGIモデルでは、リンクをたどるたびに、プログラムが起動されている。
こんな細切れの遷移では、制御の流れが複雑になるにつれて、だんだんこんがらがって、たくさんの独立したページ群を脆く寄せかためたようなものになってしまう。現代的なフレームワーク( WebObjects や Struts ) は、このよう なCGI スクリプティングの難点を取り払ってくれるようだが、Webの本質であるGOTOからは逃れられていない。あるページから次へいくときは、何を使うにしろ(アンカ、アクション、フォーム、フォワードなど)結局は単なる一方向のジャンプである。
Seasideは 、Webベースのアプリケーションを開発するためのフレームワークであり、開発者に、HTTPのリクエスト/レスポンスのループを意識させずに、まるで、ひとつながりにユーザとインタラクティブにセッションしているような錯覚を見せてくれる。それぞれのページやフォームはまるでサブルーチンのように振る舞い、呼出し元にユーザの入力を値として返してくれる。複雑で条件分岐やループのあるワークフローも、継ぎ目なく連続した
Smalltalk のコードとして、まるで個々のページを順番に呼出すように、記述できる。これがWebアプリケーションの再利用性、保守性にもたらす利点は、大昔に構造化プログラミングがもたらしたものと、うりふたつである。
Circle Line ( the company that runs the ferry service to the statue of liberty ) has unveiled a state - of - the - art solar and wind powered hybrid electric ferry named Miss Statue of Liberty that they predict will join their Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island fleet and will bring a green revolution to waterborne transportation in New York Harbor .
The solar and wind powered hybrid vessel , uses a “ solar sail ” covered in solar panels to collect energy from both the sun and wind .
The boat will emit almost no noise , vibration or fumes .
“ This is the first vessel of its kind and represents the very latest in environmental and nautical technology , ” said JB Meyer , President and CEO of Circle Line – Statue of Liberty Ferry , Inc . “ Miss Statue of Liberty will quite simply revolutionize how we move on water .
With its exceptional comfort for passengers , and the fact that it emits zero emissions while docking , it will change the nature of transportation in New York ’s harbor forever . ”
“ It ’s inspiring design , or as we call it ‘ dock appeal , ’ is sure to attract guests and visitors from across the world , ” continued Meyer .
I would be inclined to agree this boat looks sharp .
The solar vessel is being constructed in partnership with Australia ’s Solar Sailor Holdings , Ltd .
The vessel is like a hybrid car that you can “ plug in ” and so has the ability to recharge its batteries over night .
Like the hybrid car when high speeds are required it uses fossil fuels in an efficient way .
It will not only reduce water pollution , but will reduce overall air emissions and give zero emissions at slow speeds and at the wharf .
“ Unique features of this vessel design make her the ideal craft for water transit in New York City .
When Ms. Statue of Liberty docks her shallow draft and vectored electric thrusts mean minimal disturbance to the silt at the bottom of the Hudson River .
Because of her hybrid electric system she does not emit the noxious black smoke that is so common among other ferries in the harbor , ” said Dr. Robert Dane , CEO of Solar Sailor .
The vessel will be able to achieve a maximum speed of 13 knots , roughly the same speed of many of Circle Line ’s current ferries , and will be able to seat as many as 600 passengers .
Pay Per Click Advertising
Does Using Smaller Ad Groups Increase Impressions ?
( Image courtesy of The Marmot )
Are you struggling to get enough ad impressions in your Google AdWords pay - per - click campaigns ?
We have a magic bullet for you .
Okay , it is not REALLY a magic bullet .
It is more like a Nerf football but this tip might help you .
Create a bunch of small ad groups instead of a single giant one .
Why ?
Test this yourself as your mileage may vary but here is a real - world example .
One of our campaigns on the content network originally had 1092 keywords all in a single ad group .
I decided to start splitting the keywords up into smaller groups and here is what happened :
With 1 ad group it got 14,085 impressions in the thirteen days from December 1 through December 13 .
in the thirteen days from December 1 through December 13 .
With 14 ad groups it got 73,632 impressions in the thirteen days from December 14 through December 26 .
Using the same keywords , ads , and bids , we got a 400 % increase in impressions .
All I did was cut keywords out of the original ad group and paste them into several smaller , new ad groups .
The group sizes ranged from 7 keywords at the smallest to 672 at the largest ( because I am still not finished splitting up the original group ) .
We thought it was a fluke at first but even the individual keywords consistently show more impressions now .
It does not make sense to me why this should matter but it did for this campaign .
I did a small bit of research but did not find much supporting or refuting these results .
Has anyone else seen this ?

from lynching to chauvinism :
10 Awful Words and the People They 're Named For
by Mark Peters
We all want to live forever .
But , chances are , you 'd rather forego a legacy altogether than have your name be synonymous with a goofy flub like a spoonerism or a dim - witted word like " dunce . " 
For the following 10 eponyms , we ask :
Did these word - inspiring folks really deserve their drag through the linguistic mud ?
1. dunce
Dictionaries do n't play fair , and John Duns Scotus is proof .
The 13th / 14th - century thinker , whose writings synthesized Christian theology and Aristotle 's philosophy , was considerably less dumb than a brick .
Unfortunately for Scotus , subsequent theologians took a dim view of all those who championed his viewpoint .
These " Scotists , "  " Dunsmen , "  or " Dunses "  were considered hairsplitting meatheads and , eventually , just " dunces . " 
2.( slipping a ) Mickey
Lynching , shrapnel , chauvinism , the original Mickey and more all after the jump ...
When you have to drug somebody against their will ( hey , you gotta do what you gotta do ) , it just would n't sound right to slip 'em a Ricardo , a Bjorn , or an Evelyn .
It 's gotta be a Mickey .
At the turn of the 20th century , Mickey Finn was a Chicago saloon owner in one of the seediest parts of town — and he fit right in .
Finn was known for serving " Mickey Finn Specials , "  which probably included chloral hydrate , a heavy sedative .
After targeted customers passed out , Finn would haul them into his " operating room "  and liberate them of all valuables ( including shoes ) .
Never a Host of the Year candidate , this Mickey seems to have thoroughly earned his legacy , so do n't hesitate to use it the next time you drug and rob your own customers .
3. spoonerism
Reverend William Archibald Spooner ( 1844 " “ 1930 ) was famous for his muddled one - liners .
And though it's hard to know which ones he actually said , lines such as " I have a half - warmed fish "  and " Yes indeed , the Lord is a shoving leopard "  still prove that the sound - switching flub is pretty charming as far as mistakes go .
The spoonerism has even been used as a literary technique by poets and fiction writers , giving Spooner little reason to roll over — or otherwise inarticulately protest — in his grave .
4. lynch
Although several Lynches ( not including David ) have been investigated by inquisitive etymologists , Virginia native Charles Lynch ( 1736 " “ 1796 ) is most likely the man behind the murderous word .
Lynch was a patriot , a planter , and a judge .
But when he headed a vigilante court to punish Tories ( British loyalists ) during the American Revolution , he decided to play the roles of jury and executioner , too .
Lynch has more than earned his besmirched name .
In fact , he did half the besmirching himself by egotistically referring to his actions as " lynch law "  and " lynching . " 
5. shrapnel
While battling Napoleon 's army , English General Henry Shrapnel ( 1761 " “ 1842 ) noticed that original - flavor cannonballs just were n't massacring enough enemies for his liking .
So , to get more shebang for his shilling , he filled the cannonballs with bullets and exploding charges .
These " shrapnel shells , "  or " shrapnel - barrages , "  were pretty darn effective , and later designs proved even more successful in World War I.
Shrapnel did n't get much credit for the " innovation "  during his lifetime , but he ultimately contributed to enough death and misery that he pretty much deserves to be synonymous with a violent , metallic byproduct of combat .
6. draconian
A Lexis - Nexis news search shows that folks are still talking about " draconian policies , "  " draconian penalties , "  and , most frighteningly , " draconian sex rules . " 
Though Athenian lawgiver Draco is not entirely confirmed to have existed , if he were real , then around 621 B.C.E. , he instituted two time - honored traditions : 1 ) writing laws down and 2 ) making laws that were batcrap - insane .
They include ascribing the death penalty to such atrocities as being lazy , whizzing in an alley , and stealing an apple .
Apparently , he justified his measures with a sort of non-logic along the lines of , " Jaywalkers deserve to die , and I can't do anything worse to mass murderers .
So what 're you gonna do ? " 
7. Boycott
In a nutshell ?
Boycott got boycotted .
Charles Cunningham Boycott ( 1832 " “ 1897 ) was a retired English army captain who claimed his unwanted fame in 1880 when the Irish Land League decided to punish him for not lowering his rents .
This then - new strategy , which was a mere paragraph in the Russian - novel - size saga of Irish land reform , was a kind of systematic shunning in which Boycott was cut off from servants , supplies , mail , and lifestyle free of death threats .
He might have been an evil landlord , but if Boycott could see just how successful his name became , he 'd probably be a very sad , regretful , evil landlord .
8. bogart ( the joint )
In his films , Humphrey Bogart smoked enough cigarettes to choke a chimney , so it 's no surprise he inspired an eponym that usually means " to monopolize the marijuana . " 
More specifically though , the word referred to Bogart 's style of smoking — letting each cigarette dangle off his lips for a long time .
The term has some flexibility though , ever since Homer Simpson uttered one of the most notable non -drug - related uses of " bogart "  in recent memory .
To defend Marge from the advances of amorous bikers , Homer said , " My wife is not a doobie to be passed around !
I took a sacred vow on my wedding day to bogart her forever . " 
Mmm " ¦ bogart .
9 . Tawdry
The story of St. Audrey ( also known as St. Etheldreda ) is a classic example of how bad names happen to good people .
St. Audrey was the daughter of the king of East Anglia ( then the Norfolk section of Anglo - Saxon England ) , who lived a monastery - founding , self - abdicating life .
But , when she died of the plague in 679 , she was sporting a pretty nasty - looking tumor on her neck , which gossipmongers blamed on her penchant for wearing audacious necklaces in her youth .
After her death , silk scarves called " St. Audrey laces "  were sold in her honor at Ely 's annual St. Audrey 's Fair .
Then the British tendency for dropping letters and syllables took over , and Audrey became " tawdry . " 
It was a short trip from there to the dictionary , and tawdry has been synonymous with gaudy ever since .
10 . chauvinism
Nicolas Chauvin was an early 19th " “ century French soldier who was so patriotic and nationalistic , he gave patriotism and nationalism a bad name — or at least a new name .
A slave to the cult of Napoleon , Chauvin shed his fair share of blood for the emperor .
How did Napoleon show his appreciation ?
By giving Chauvin a ceremonial saber , a ribbon , and a pittance of a pension .
Later , however , French dramatists began basing Ã¼ber - patriotic characters on Chauvin , which paved the way for the soldier 's ultimate reward : a dubious spot in the English language .
The head of the Office of Special Counsel who is currently leading an investigation into allegations against Karl Rove is taking fire over allegations that he improperly and illegally disposed of documents and files .
Since this is the sort of nonsense that only makes sense if you live inside the Ultimate RDF generator ( i.e. , inside the Beltway ) , I 'll take a moment and break things down .
The Office of Special Counsel ( OSC ) is an independent federal agency tasked with protecting the rights of whistleblowers or other complainants that work for the federal government , investigating whether or not government employees have properly followed restrictions on their political activity , and defending the reemployment rights of returning war veterans .
On April 23 , 2007 , Scott Bloch , the head of the OSC , launched a wide investigation into the political activities of Karl Rove .
Allegedly , Rove , as well as other White House aides , had violated federal law by giving partisan political presentations to government employees that explicitly encouraged them to find ways to support Republican candidates .
The investigation is ongoing .
Scott Bloch , however , has n't risen to his current position without controversies of his own .
Although no findings of fact have been released as of this writing , Bloch has been under investigation since 2005 for improperly dismissing issues brought to the OSC 's attention by whistleblowers and then failing to protect said employees from retaliation .
Where things get interesting from a technical standpoint is when Bloch contacted an outside company , Geeks on Call , for help with a technical issue nearly a year ago .
Bloch claims that he believed his computer was infected with a virus that was corrupting or deleting his files .
According to the Geeks on Call receipt , technicians visited Bloch and performed various services — including what the company refers to as a seven - level hard drive wipe .
A seven - level wipe ?
As you may know , simply deleting data off a drive or performing a high - level format does very little to prevent data from being recovered off the drive in question by experts .
There are programs and utilities that overwrite data on the drive with random patterns , making it more difficult to recover — but not necessarily impossible .
A seven - level wipe program ( such as the one used on Bloch 's system ) would overwrite an entire hard drive with randomized ones and zeros , but would go through the entire process seven times , thus theoretically eliminating any hope of restoring the original data .
Paying for such a procedure does n't exactly jive with virus removal , and the Washington Post states that Bloch also scrubbed the laptops of two of his aides in a similar fashion .
It 's impossible to know whether these new investigative findings against Bloch are politically motivated or not , and the ongoing investigation into his behavior has yet to produce conclusive evidence against him .
At the same time , however , the government does have strict rules and policies in place regarding how information is to be stored , archived , and deleted .
Attempting to irrevocably delete the data on his hard drive may have prevented certain materials from becoming public ( assuming no backup copies exist ) , but doing so only raises questions about what , if anything , Bloch might have been trying to protect — and why a virus would require such a thorough hard drive wipe in the first place .
Given that there 's no reasonable excuse for wiping a drive in such a fashion for the ailments
Bloch claimed to have had , one of two things appears to have happened here : either Bloch was taken to the cleaners by Geeks on Call , or Bloch is covering something up .

Animals like bears rely on pink salmon
Wild pink salmon around the Broughton Archipelago are declining rapidly and will die out within 10 years if no action is taken , say researchers .
They say the data , published in Science , raises serious concerns about the global expansion of aquaculture .
Sea lice from farms are known to infect wild salmon , but until now the impact on wild populations has been uncertain .
" The impact is so severe that the viability of the wild salmon populations is threatened , " said lead researcher Martin Krkosek from the University of Alberta in Edmonton , Canada .
Modelling studies
Dr Krkosek and colleagues compiled data on the numbers of pink salmon in rivers around the central coast of British Columbia .
It means that the probability of extinction is 100 % and the only question is how long it is going to take
Dr Martin Krkosek
They compared populations of salmon that had come into contact with salmon farms with those that had not been exposed , from 1970 to the present day .
Using a mathematical model of population growth rates , they show that sea lice from industrial fish farms are reducing the numbers of wild pink salmon - a Pacific salmon species - to the extent that the fish could be locally extinct in eight years or less .
Dr Krkosek said the population growth rate was " severely depressed " .
" It means that the probability of extinction is 100 % and the only question is how long it is going to take , " he told BBC News .
Natural parasites
Scientists say commercial open - net salmon farms are a " haven " for sea lice - naturally occurring parasites that attach to the skin and muscle of salmon .
Mature fish can survive being infested by a few lice but tiny juvenile salmon are particularly vulnerable to attack .
They come into contact with sea lice when they swim past fish farms on their migratory routes from rivers to the sea .
" Salmon farming breaks a natural law , " explained study co-author Alexandra Morton , director of the Salmon Coast Field Station , located in the Broughton Archipelago .
" In the natural system , the youngest salmon are not exposed to sea lice because the adult salmon that carry the parasite are offshore .
But fish farms cause a deadly collision between the vulnerable young salmon and sea lice .
They are not equipped to survive this , and they do n't . "
Scientists say there are a number of solutions to the problem , including moving farms away from rivers used by wild salmon or putting farmed salmon in pens that are completely sealed off from the surrounding environment .
" The most obvious thing to do is to move the farm out of the way of the wild fish , " Dr Krkosek told BBC News .
" Do n't put them on the migration route , and do n't put them near the spawning rivers .
Another option is to move to closed containment technology where the net pen is replaced with a physical barrier that prevents the exchange of parasites - that would solve the problem too . "
National treasure
Dr Krkosek said the impact of fish farms on wild salmon has been " an emotionally , politically and economically charged debate " in Canada .
" Salmon are considered a natural treasure to Canadians , but salmon farming has a lot of economic opportunity - we really need economic activity to supplement coastal economies where fisheries and other resource centres are not doing as well , " he explained .
" So there are economic benefits to having salmon farms , but the way that it is currently being done is very damaging to the environment and there are better ways of doing it . "
The report in Science has implications for other parts of the world where salmon is farmed , such as Norway and Scotland .
Other species of salmon are known to become infected with sea lice , but they vary in their ability to withstand this .
Sid Patten , chief executive of the Scottish Salmon Producers ' Organisation , said the Canadian research bore " little resemblance to the situation in Scotland " .
He said fish farmers , wild fish interests and the Scottish government had been working together for many years around the north - west coast and islands to develop local area management plans " for the benefit of both wild and farmed salmon " .
" I am delighted to report that there are very positive results coming from this process such as increased numbers of wild salmon returning to some rivers , " he said .
" This summer , the Scottish government presented our work to the Canadians who were very interested in exploring a similar model for Canada . "
DENMARK , Finland and New Zealand are the least corrupt countries in the world , according to Transparency International 's annual Corruption Perceptions Index , published on Thursday September 27th .
The index uses surveys of businessmen and experts to determine the perceived level of abuse of public office for private gain in 180 countries .
The poorest nations tend to be the most corrupt .
Myanmar and Somalia are bottom , with conflict - ridden Afghanistan and Sudan also languishing .
Several African countries , including Namibia , Seychelles and South Africa , have improved their scores since the last survey .
Austria and Thailand are among those with lower scores .

Race , class divide extends to cleanup
Published Nov 20 , 2005 11:52 PM
Contractors who have brought in hundreds of workers to clean up flood - ravaged buildings in New Orleans are profiting handsomely by keeping wages and expenses low .
One such contractor is called BMS Cat , short for BMS Catastrophe .
Large groups of workers in navy blue T - shirts or sweatshirts with “ BMS CAT ” on the front can be seen in downtown New Orleans .
BMS
Cat got its employees from three labor providers that function as temporary agencies : Construct Corp. , Command Center and — no kidding — Pot of Gold .
BMS
Cat and companies like it are “ storm chasers , ” making profit off other people ’s tragedies .
When the cleanup began in October , many hotels and motels were not up and running .
Available rooms were at a premium .
These companies made an arrangement with Alvin Callendar Field , a naval air station with many acres to spare across the river from downtown New Orleans .
On an old runway , hundreds of pup tents were erected on wooden pallets in closely spaced rows .
The supervisors and managers got campers and trailers .
The workers were almost entirely Black and [ email protected ] , the managers mostly white .
At its peak this encampment held 420 people .
Serving as intermediary on the base is Kellogg , Brown and Root ( KBR ) , the well - known military supplier and subsidiary of Halliburton — which used to be headed by Dick Cheney , now Bush ’s vice president .
The shower facility consisted of a makeshift building with plywood walls and Astroturf on the floor .
The walls could not be properly disinfected and the carpet harbored visible mold .
There were only 10 shower heads for men and another five for women , with knobs that only turned on and off , rather than allowing the temperature to be adjusted .
Used water flowed out the back of the building directly onto the ground .
Ten showers for 360 men
Let ’s do the math .
When you subtract the supervisors and managers , who had their own showers , and the 20 women workers , that left about 360 men .
They had to shower at the end of long days of cleaning up materials laden with bacteria and molds , and possibly contaminated with asbestos and lead .
These showers were n’t just for personal hygiene .
They should be thought of as mandatory decontamination after asbestos and lead exposure .
If each man were allowed only a 5 - min ute shower , that still would be only 120 men per hour — or three hours for them all to shower .
But their workday went from 4:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m .
So some might have to wait until 9:30 p.m. to get clean .
Late showers and early morning showers were unrealistic for workers who had to leave the labor camp at 4:30 a.m .
The workers also suffered an inadequate supply of portable toilets .
Imagine the lines at the 15 porta -potties to urinate in the morning .
The hand - washing stations lacked hot water and anti-bacterial soap , so crucial when a large number of people share toilets and also have been disposing of rotting food during the workday .
Workers complained there was no time in the workday to buy personal hygiene supplies , especially since very few drug stores had reopened .
Dirty clothes could be dropped off at the laundry on base , to be returned in 48 hours .
This sounds like a good plan — until you realize that it required the workers to have three complete sets of clothes with them in order not to wear contaminated clothes two days in a row .
Hand - washed underwear could be seen laid out to dry in the tent city .
The only saving grace is that the camp is now down to 58 employees as operations move elsewhere , including Florida .
When confronted with the need to rebuild the shower building , the project manager said he would condemn the building and transport the workers to shower facilities elsewhere on base .
He was willing to do this only once , at 7 p.m. , with no option to shower later .
This gross travesty in failing to provide sanitation for the workers is a direct result of greed on the part of BMS Cat and lack of oversight by KBR .
But they have even more despicable ways of lining their pockets .
Fire fighters doing security on this portion of the base stated that some workers had been told to show up at a particular bank to get their pay .
When they arrived there , they were greeted by immigration agents who arrested undocumented workers .
The labor agency was able to simply pocket their pay .
The deplorable conditions of the labor camp were well hidden on a large military base , with security checkpoints controlling access .
Thus do the military and the corporations function hand in hand .
Organizers and activists need to be on the lookout for BMS Cat and others of its ilk and expose the way they treat workers .
We can be “ storm chasers ” of a new kind , chasing the companies that take on workers for cleanup after storms .
They must be held accountable for their racism and their super - exploitation of workers .

This morning 's Chris Matthews
Show rendered few surprises , but I could n't let David Brooks off the hook on this one .
No longer seen as a maverick to Democratic and Independent voters , McCain is now viewed as a pandering disappointment , but Brooks does n't appear to have gotten the memo .
David fawns all over McCain , giving him glowing reviews using the one issue that has been more repellent to Americans of all political stripes than any other -- his staunch support for George Bush and his surge in Iraq .
To believe that any demographic outside the hardcore , far right wing of the Republican party will vote for McCain in any significant numbers borders on delusional -- but what else can we expect from this guy ?

With the untimely tragic death of Heath Ledger , movie industry watchers are predicting that the profits of the upcoming Batman movie , The Dark Knight , will ultimately go through the roof .
The release of the new Batman posters , showing Ledger as the Joker , has the actor “ gruesomely made - up ” and there was a lot of positive buzz about his performance .
However , news of Ledger ’s death has prompted suggestions that anticipation of the movie “ is likely to intensify with fans morbidly curious to watch Ledger ’s posthumous final screen performance . ”
Is it just little old sensitive me or is it highly distasteful to pay to watch a movie just because a recently - dead actor appears in it ?
I will be watching The Dark Knight as a fan , not someone who will gasp in wonder when Ledger appears on - screen as the Joker for the first time .
The death of Ledger has also got Warner Bros re-considering their marketing and promotion for the Batman movie .
Several news sources including AFP and the Wall Street Journal are reporting that Ledger may be removed altogether from the promotional posters to be replaced instead by Christian Bale .
The studio is concerned that leaving him on the posters will lead to accusations they are trying to cash in by exploiting Ledger ’s demise .
Decline of the Religious Right ?
It is plain that the Religious Right ( that group of ultra-Conservative Christians who push for rightwing politics , usually in a “ Christian Nation ” ideology and sometimes with theocratic - leaning impulses ) has lost ground since 2004 .
( The decline is noticeable in the inability of even RR leaders to unite around any one GOP presidential candidate . )
I am NOT claiming that it is dying or dead .
The death of the Religious Right has often been predicted since 1980 and each time the funeral was premature .
But , at the very least , it has lost momentum and this might herald a decline if trends continue .
What factors have led to this apparent decline ?
Without claiming scientific or exhaustive precision , I think the following factors have brought this loss of momentum and , if they continue , will end the influence of the Religious Right for some time .
Increasing pluralism in the U.S. population .
This demographic trend started long ago and shows no signs of letting up , which may be why so many in the Right are anti-immigration .
The U.S. is now home to numerous religions , more every day .
I live not in New York City , Chicago , L.A. or Orlando , but in Louisville , KY–a medium sized city at the intersection between the Old South and the Mid-west .
Louisville was never completely the White Anglo - Saxon Protestant enclave that such a geography would suggest .
Catholics helped to settle Kentucky in the 18th C. when they were still a small minority in the nation at large .
And Louisville has had a strong Jewish community since the mid-19th C. But today we have enough Muslims for 2 mosques .
We have a Buddhist temple .
There are Wiccans , Hindus , and others : 3 Unitarian churches ; a Friends Meeting , a Women - Church gathering , and more .
All this in a city that has a large ( and , since 1994 , fundamentalist ) Southern Baptist seminary , a Presbyterian seminary , 2 Catholic universities , and is the headquarters of the Presbyterian Church , USA .
The largest mosque in the nation is in IOWA .
Think how diverse the major metropolitan areas of the country are !
And that diversity is growing and penetrating even to the rural communities of the South and the Mid-West .
If trends continue , Christians of all denominations may soon be a plurality rather than a true majority in the U.S.A. – which makes theocracy harder to impose , to say the least .

Aging and passing of Religious Right leaders .
Jerry Falwell is dead and the Moral Majority disbanded .
D. James Kennedy had died quite recently .
The Televangelism scandals of the ’ 80s dethroned Jim Baker and Jimmy Swaggert from positions of leadership .
Pat Robertson ’s syndicated TV show still reaches millions , but his influence has been in sharp decline since his failed run for the U.S. presidency in 1996 .
No one mentions Donald Wildmon , Phyllis Schafly , or Gary Bauer anymore .
The only one of the first generation of Religious Right leaders to still be in full swing is James Dobson , once simply a Nazarene psychologist with conservative parenting tips and he is aging and seems to be losing influence .
There are , of course , newer leaders such as Richard Land ( of the Southern Baptist Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission ) and R. Albert Mohler , Jr. ( who is my age and has destroyed my alma mater with his presidency of The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary ) , but they do n’t seem to have the clout that the previous bigwigs did .

The following generations of conservative evangelical pastors do not seem as interested in following in the Falwell & Co. shoes .
Even conservative mega-church pastors like Rick Warren are not using that influence in the same way .
This goes hand - in - hand with the broadening of moral concern among Evangelicals and Catholics in the U.S. Abortion and “ homosexuality ” are still concerns for the majority of both groups , but attempts to maintain these issues as the only valid moral concerns in political elections seem to have failed .
Evangelicals and Catholics are now the biggest swing groups in the country –neither Party can automatically count on their votes .
They are concerned with environment ( few are still calling Global Warming a hoax ) , with universal health care , especially for children , with war and peacemaking , with torture , with the growth of private prisons , etc .

Probably aided by the spector of violent religious fanaticism among some Islamic groups , American citizens have begun noticing similarities in spirit ( and sometimes , as in abortion clinic bombings , in action ) among Christian fanatics .
This is producing an aversion to religious extremism and an appreciation for secular , religiously - neutral , democratic government .
The secular parts of the U.S. heritage are being celebrated by many .
( Susan Jacoby got in on the ground floor with her book , Freethinkers , highlighting the heritage of Thomas Paine , Thomas Jefferson , Abraham Lincoln , Benjamin Franklin , H. L. Mencken , and others . )
The exteme edge of this is the U.S. part of the “ angry atheists ” publishing boom as a series of famous atheists and skeptics in the U.K. , Australia , and North America blame religion for everything .
I am not a fan of the angry atheists and I think if their noisy anger continues they could trigger a backlash of sympathy for the Religious Right –which thrives on a false sense of persecution .
But all these angry atheistic books becoming bestsellers does show a broader disenchantment with religious fanaticism .
At the same time , there has been revival among what might be called the Religious Center and Religious Left .
The re-emergence , particularly , of an Evangelical Left ( eclipsed since 1980 ) contributes to the decline of the Religious Right–at the very least by giving the public more spiritual options than skepticism or fanaticism .
Prominent Democrats have been more vocal about their personal faith ( and some Republicans like Fred Thompson have admitted being lukewarm churchgoers and uninterested in speaking about religion ) which has , at least , lessened the Right ’s propaganda line that the GOP is “ God ’s Only Party . ”
There may be other factors , too .
Tell me if you think of any .
Now , please remember that any of these things could change ( although the first one is unlikely to change ) .
The Religious Right still is trying to accomplish things I do n’t consider helpful for either the church , the nation , or the world : Such as Al Mohler ’s campaign to have a mass Christian exodus from the public schools–or even the dismantling of public education altogether .
Such campaigns must be opposed .
We cannot simply ignore the Religious Right .
Every time centrists and liberals have tried the “ ignore them and they ’ll fade away ” strategy in the last 30 years , the Religious Right has come roaring back and done great harm .
But these trends have given a space for other , more helpful , forces such as the reinvigoration of the Religious Center and the Religious Left .
If we take advantage of this breathing space , it is possible that a rich and plural civic life will flourish .
I think that is the kind of opportunity offered by groups like The Interfaith Alliance ( with its Walter Cronkite Faith and Freedom Awards ) and by resources like the Baptist Center for Ethics ’ Golden Rule Politics DVD .
I hope many more such campaigns flourish .
Slated for discussion today with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is the nomination of Sam Fox to the Ambassador post for Belgium .
Who is Sam Fox ?
Well , according to WhiteHouseForSale.org , Sam Fox is a Bush Ranger , responsible for millions of dollars of donations to both the Bush / Cheney campaigns and the Republican Party .
He 's also a charter member of the Libby Defense Fund .
In other words , this guy is neck deep in the Bush / Cheney circles .
But Bob Geiger points out that some of Fox 's support really can only be categorized as unsavory :
( W ) hat 's especially interesting is that if you really look under the hood of where this guy 's political heart is at , you find that in late 2004 he gave $ 50,000 to no less solid citizens than the Swift Boat Liars who made it their mission to discredit a highly - decorated Vietnam Veteran in John Kerry .
Now if that wo n't buy you an ambassador 's post from George W. Bush , nothing will .
Here 's the entry from PoliticalMoneyLine .
Com : [..]
And he made this donation after the Swift Boaters had been entirely discredited .
What should make this hearing even more profound today is that sitting on the panel questioning Fox , will be Senator Jim Webb -- who is a Vietnam Veteran -- and one ....
John F. Kerry .
I hope that Kerry 's learned his lesson about not responding ...
UPDATE : Kerry DID learn .
Whether it has an effect remains to be seen .
GOP 's Last Man Standing
WASHINGTON -- Sen .
John McCain , given up for dead a few weeks ago as he ran a cash - starved , disorganized campaign , today is viewed by canny Republican professionals as the best bet to win the party 's presidential nomination .
What 's more , they consider him their most realistic prospect to buck the overall Democratic tide and win the general election .
Indeed , if Mike Huckabee holds on to actually win the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses , the road forward could be clear for McCain .
Mitt Romney 's lavishly financed , meticulously organized campaign always has operated with a thin margin of error based on winning Iowa and then the New Hampshire primary five days later .
If Romney loses to Huckabee in Iowa , he becomes vulnerable to McCain in New Hampshire .
If McCain wins there , he will be favored to sweep through subsequent primaries despite meager finances and organization .
This scenario does not connote a late - blooming affection for McCain among the party faithful .
Indeed , he remains suspect to them on global warming , stem cell research , tax policy and immigration controls , not to mention his original sin of campaign finance reform ( with authorship of the McCain - Feingold Act ) .
Rather , his nomination would result from him being the last man standing , with all other candidates falling .
Rudy Giuliani's baggage is getting too heavy to carry .
Fred Thompson never got started .
Huckabee 's Republicanism is even less orthodox than McCain 's and seems unviable beyond Iowa .
Romney is burdened with anti-Mormon prejudice and the accusation he is " plastic . "
McCain 's return from oblivion also suggests a personal determination that was demonstrated during six years of torture and solitary confinement in a communist prison .
Beginning the year as the GOP 's putative establishment candidate , McCain presided over a spendthrift , ineffective campaign .
His decline climaxed , however unfairly , when he came over as the apostle of immigration amnesty .
Despite a free fall in the polls and the inability to raise funds , McCain has impressed the political community with six months of tireless grass - roots campaigning .
He never has been popular inside the party , even when it seemed he might be its anointed candidate .
He is still bitterly opposed by conservative activists Grover Norquist and Ralph Reed and is anathema to Cato Institute members and other libertarians because of campaign finance reform .
His opposition to earmarked pork and his demolition of the corrupt deal between Boeing and the Air Force have not enchanted fellow Republican politicians .
Transcending ideology , he draws opposition because he will turn 72 next August .
But when Republicans get together privately , they tend to agree that McCain is the Republican most likely to defeat Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama .
Even while some consider the old naval aviator as cranky and hot - tempered , he has not exhibited those negative characteristics in debates .
Rather , he exudes a heroic aura that goes beyond managing New York City or the Utah Olympics .
That quality is shown in his Christmas card television ad depicting a North Vietnamese prison guard making a cross in the dirt .
McCain has managed to support the invasion of Iraq while criticizing President Bush 's management of the invasion , and he maintains his fiscal integrity in a pork - driven , spendthrift Republican Party .
Having fallen behind Huckabee in Iowa , Romney has concluded he must stop McCain in New Hampshire .
He launched daily attacks on McCain last week after having ignored him for months .
Apart from assailing McCain for not being a team player , Romney deplored his votes against Bush 's tax cuts .
McCain has admitted to me that those votes were a mistake , as Romney confesses he made a mistake in his former support for abortion rights .
The difference , Romney insiders insist , is that their man freely acknowledges error .
That faint distinction may not be sufficient to stop McCain in New Hampshire if Romney loses Iowa .
That is why McCain is praying for the former governor of Arkansas on Jan .
3 . The GOP nominee can be determined by how many Iowa social conservatives that night support a high - tax , big - spending opponent of school choice who is called a member of the religious left by critical Southern Baptists .
The Republican Party 's internal competition has become as peculiar as the Democrats ' used to be .
The article below gave details about the Freecycle website which aims to prevent reusable household goods being needlessly discarded , and reported that some people ' make a decent living gathering things from Freecycle and selling them at car boot sales ' .
We should make it clear that Freecycle requires that anyone intending to sell goods must declare so .
Our article might have been interpreted as encouraging people to take goods from Freecycle and sell them , but this was not the writer 's intention .
We live in the most watched - over society in Europe .
Exposure , especially in The Observer , has done little to hold the state and private sector in check .
Phone records have become police records , as Henry Porter pointed out in this paper last week , and CCTV camera records are now fed into the automatic registration number computer .
Credit and store - card records have become marketing records and our email addresses are points of entry for all sorts of crime and spam .
It 's time to fight back using all the legal means at our disposal .
We need to duck under the radar of government surveillance , credit - checking agencies , internet and mobile phone companies or the DVLA .
I have been learning how to keep the info - snoopers at bay .
My research has led me into a world of middle - aged hoodies , who cover up in shopping centres to avoid the CCTV cameras ; of young computer users who keep their names off spam lists and out of reach of the megacorps ; and people who live off - grid , out of sight of the system and unplugged from the utility companies .
So , here 's is a survival checklist for the information age .
1 Buy an untraceable mobile phone
Travel to a town you have never visited before , to an area with no CCTV cameras and ask a homeless person to buy a pay - as - you - go mobile phone for you .
That way no shop will have your image on its CCTV .
You will also have an anonymous mobile .
In order to keep your anonymity , top it up in a shop with no CCTV outside .
Or dispense with the phone altogether and return to the humble payphone , now the preserve of tourists and the super - poor .
Even if you stick to your traceable phone , leave it switched off whenever possible to avoid having your movements tracked .
Many phones are still traceable , so you need to take the battery out to be certain .
If you have a Bluetooth phone , keep the service switched off because this is now being tested for advertising and other marketing activities .
2 Safeguard your email
If you use one of the free , web - based services like Gmail , your communications are being stored to build up a picture of your interests .
Instead , you can use a service called Hushmail to send encrypted emails .
Or work out a private code with friends you want to communicate with .
You do not need an email address of your own .
One hacker I spoke to sends emails from cybercafes via The Observer website , using the service which allows anyone to send any article to a friend .
He embeds his message into the covering note which goes with the article .
Others with their own computer use the free XeroBank browser ( in preference to Explorer or Firefox ) , which includes several privacy - enhancing add - ons and sends all data through a network ' cloud ' which hides most of the data you normally give away as you use a computer , but at the cost of reduced speed ( http://xerobank.com/xB_browser.html).
3 Safeguard your computer and your files
There is sophisticated software that deletes all traces of your activities from your computer .
Assuming you do n't have access to this , it is still worth remembering the data about you contained inside each file .
Many digital photos , for example , contain within them the serial number of the camera that took them .
Word documents contain the name of the author as well as traces of previous drafts .
4 Be invisible to CCTV cameras
Steve is a middle - aged IT consultant who lives in a bungalow on a smart private estate in south west London .
He has never committed a criminal act .
When he goes to business meetings , he wears a suit and tie , but when he walks around his local high street , he dons a hoodie .
He does it on principle .
' I do n't disapprove of the technology in its rightful place , ' Steve told me , ' but we have an unregulated mess .
It has n't reduced crime in any real sense - it 's displaced it in some cases . '
Media reports always say there are 4.2 million CCTV cameras in the UK , but they have been using that figure for the past two years .
So it 's a safe bet we have at least six million by now , and there is no central register .
You can use the Data Protection
Act to request a copy of your own image from any particular camera , but that is simply a way of harassing CCTV owners , not safeguarding your identity .
5 Stay off spam mailing lists
Each time you submit your email address to register for a new website , create a special address , either on a free webmail service or on your own email server so you have control over it .
Then , if the company later sells your email address or loses it through poor security , you will know exactly who to blame .
And you will be able to close the account or block all email to that particular address .
Again , Hushmail is useful for this .
You can set it up to create these aliases for you .
6 Prevent supermarkets knowing your shopping habits
Swap your supermarket loyalty card with a friend or acquaintance every few months , after having cashed in any points you have accumulated ( treat Oyster and other local transport cards the same way ) .
You lose no benefits and it prevents tracking of specific purchasing patterns ( or journeys ) tied to your name and address .
Use cash more often - save your credit card for emergencies .
7 Avoid utility companies ' marketing departments
Live off - grid , unplugged from the system with solar panels and rainwater harvesting .
There are tens of thousands of people living without mains power , water or sewerage , in isolated cottages , behind hedgerows in caravans or in groups of yurts in country fields .
And this is not just a movement for tree huggers and climate campers .
Many live on boats in towns and cities , and if you live in a flat or house , you can still unplug .
8 Keep your car off the automatic number recognition system
The simplest way is to leave the car at home and use a bicycle .
But if you must drive , do n't go into a congestion zone at any time .
There are other legal ways to hide your registration number from the cameras - swap the light above the rear numberplate for an infrared bulb and that will flood the video - camera which operates at near infrared frequency .
9 Safeguard your NHS data
If you are born in this country , then your NHS records are inescapable .
But you can choose to store them with your GP to keep them off the central computer , and this should reduce the chances of the medical records being sold ( legally ) to drugs companies or ( illegally ) to private detectives or being snooped on by the 300,000 ' authorised users ' of the system , without affecting medical care .
There is no need to worry about , for example , records of your blood group not being available to medical staff after an accident - doctors no longer rely on paper or computer records .
The automated diagnostic blood group tests are done by the ambulance crew on the way to hospital .
You can get a form letter to send to the NHS from nhsconfidentiality.org .
10 Shop outside the system
The website Freecycle ( freecycle.org ) could provide many of your needs .
It consists of hundreds of short announcements from people trying to give away stuff they no longer need : beds , TVs , bookcases , the whole of human life is there in return for the cost of picking it up from the donor .
There are local Freecycle groups all over the country ( and the world ) , each with their own local web address .
Some people make a decent living gathering things from Freecycle and selling them at car boot sales .
There are full - time scavengers living off food retrieved from supermarket bins , because vast amounts of produce are simply thrown away on the eve of their sell - by date .
Another way to avoid buying food is to barter for it .
The car park of the pub in the centre of Longframlington village in Northumberland has been a barter centre for decades .
On any Friday night between April and October , locals arrive and flip down the backs of their 4x4s laden with the week 's produce , whether its chanterelles , venison , pheasant , line - caught salmon or the latest crop of beetroots and lettuces .
Technically , this innocent activity is tax evasion .
' It 's all very rustic and encourages a paper - free environment , but this can underpin what can only amount to potential income tax , corporation tax or VAT non-disclosure , or even fraud , ' said accountant Julie Butler .
But does Alistair Darling really want to take another bash at the delicate fabric of the countryside ?
It may seem almost comical to go to these lengths , but the ways companies and the public sector can misuse data is n't a joke .
We cannot trust them to safeguard our data or use it ethically , so we must provide our own safeguards .

Doune Castle appears as Castle Anthrax in the 1970s film
The 14th Century keep was made famous as Castle Anthrax in the 1975 classic film Monty Python and the Holy Grail .
Tickets have been restricted to 500 for the event near Stirling , which sees fans taking to the castle 's battlements to enact scenes from the famous film .
Aficionados will also have the chance to take part in the coconut conga or the Python Idle talent contest .
The first Monty Python Day was held at Doune Castle , six miles north - west of Stirling , in 2005 to mark the 30th anniversary of film .
The film provided the inspiration for the hit musical Spamalot
Pilgrims attending this year 's event are being promised a few surprises from organisers .
Nick Finnigan , Historic Scotland events and filming manager said : " The event has been a sell - out for each of the past three years and this year has been no exception , with all 500 tickets snapped up weeks in advance .
" As well as all the old favourites , we have introduced some special new activities to the line - up including a Monty Python Hall of Fame featuring photos from past Python events .
" There will also be a few surprises on the day itself . "
The title should be enough to explain what this is .
In case it is n’t , it ’s a flying stick with a camera !
Rub it between your palms to get some kinetic energy stored up .
Then release and the Flying Stick automatically takes pictures at set intervals .
You know what they say , everybody looks 5 lb lighter when photographed from above .
No mention of specs like camera resolution or memory but hey it ’s a concept .
If anything , it ’s supposed to get your mind thinking , not criticizing .

WENDELIN WIEDEKING , Porsche 's chief executive , earned an estimated € 60 m ( $ 88 m ) this year .
Hairdressers in some parts of Germany make less than € 3 an hour .
The gulf between them has been filled with a deafening outcry .
Chancellor Angela Merkel , who is positioning her Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) as the party of the political centre , has now joined in : her denunciation of the corporate “ wage spiral ” got the biggest applause during a speech to the party 's convention in Hanover on December 3rd , held under the slogan of Die Mitte ( The Centre ) .
AFP
Work makes you poor
But it is pay at the bottom end that politicians are seeking to change .
On November 29th Ms Merkel surrendered to demands by the Social Democrats , the CDU 's junior partner in the “ grand coalition ” government , for a minimum wage for postal workers .
There is talk of extending that to ten other low - wage industries , including landscaping and meat - processing .
Germany , one of the few rich countries without a minimum wage , may be undergoing a slow - motion revolution .
Liberal Britain and 19 other members of the European Union have economy - wide minimum wages .
Most of the rest have collectively negotiated contracts broad enough to provide , de facto , a floor for salaries .
Germany prides itself on letting unions and employers hammer out contracts without interference from the government .
But such “ wage autonomy ” is under pressure .
Industry - wide contracts cover fewer workers , real wages have slipped and fear of “ wage dumping ” by competitors from China and eastern Europe haunts German workers .
The answer , say unions that represent low - paid service workers and their Social Democratic allies , is to impose minimum wages , ideally across the economy , with higher minimums for specific sectors such as postal services .
The CDU , which hopes to re-elect three state governors next year , and Ms Merkel as chancellor in 2009 , dares not resist too strenuously .
It says yes to sector - specific floors , but no to a statutory minimum wage .
Many German economists find it scandalous that full - time workers can still be poor .
Minimum wages , they argue , can save money on welfare spending .
In their absence , recent pay awards have been lower in Germany than elsewhere , says Peter Bofinger , a member of the government 's committee of economic wise men .
The idea that Germany 's labour markets are too rigid to cope with minimum wages is “ nonsense ” , he says , given that Germany is creating many temporary jobs .
To critics , however , minimum wages are a blunt tool for fighting poverty ; they stifle competition and could destroy jobs .
“ A minimum wage , especially if it's too high , would be very damaging , ” says Patrick Adenauer , who heads an association of family - run companies .
The early response to the postal minimum wage has increased such fears .
The employers ' association , dominated by Deutsche Post , a former state monopoly , in September signed a contract with ver.di , the main service - sector union , mandating wages of € 9.80 an hour in western Germany and €9 in the east .
The agreement extends to firms that plan to deliver letters when the postal service is opened to competition on January 1st .
But on December 3rd Dutch - owned TNT Post and Hermes of Hamburg froze plans to start a delivery service for private and small - business customers .
Moreover , PIN , which belongs to the publisher Axel Springer , said it would dismiss 1,000 workers .
Only the ex-monopolists at Deutsche Post can be pleased , which many suspect was the point of the wage agreement .
German unions are demanding a minimum wage of € 7.50 an hour , about € 1,250 per month .
This is lower than in France but higher than in Austria ( see chart ) .
But , according to a study by two economists , Joachim Ragnitz and Marcel Thum , such a wage imposed across the economy would wipe out 1.1 m low - wage jobs — 3 % of employment in western Germany and more than 6 % in the east , where productivity is lower .
A minimum wage in the construction sector that has been in effect since 1997 has had little effect on employment in western Germany but has destroyed jobs in the east , according to a paper published by the research institute of the Federal Labour Agency .
Along with easterners , it says , the young are especially vulnerable .
If reducing poverty is what the politicians are seeking , minimum wages are not the answer .
Less than a fifth of workers with low wages live in poor households .
The welfare system is supposed to provide every German who needs it with enough income to get by .
Even though it might boost the incomes of some working poor , a minimum wage might also throw others out of jobs , making them poorer .
The move to minimum wages is part of a piecemeal retreat from the Agenda 2010 reforms which the Social Democrats enacted in 2003 and 2005 , when they led the government and about which they have had misgivings ever since .
The idea was to push unemployed people who had few skills into jobs by cutting the benefits available to the unemployed along with giving them an incentive to work .
“ Dropping wages was part of the strategy to create more employment , ” notes Holger Schäfer of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research .
More than 1 m Germans are reckoned to supplement their welfare benefits with ( mostly ) part - time jobs .
Last month the number of unemployed Germans dropped to 3.4 m , the lowest figure for 14 years .
Is that success now at risk ?
Not if a low minimum wage is set by experts rather than by politicians , perhaps with an even lower rate for young workers , as in Britain .
The danger , though , is that Germany will instead succumb to pressure for ever - higher wage floors for individual sectors , leading to a workers ' wage spiral that will be more damaging , if more popular , than the pay rises of fat cats .
In their quest for votes , Germany 's leaders are courting economic danger .
It was ever thus .
We all have our childish moments .

WHEN Gershwin's “ Rhapsody in Blue ” had its première in 1924 , at a concert in New York that was billed as “ An Experiment in Modern Music ” , the audience included Rachmaninov and other big names from the classical world .
By all accounts , the experiment was a success .
It established that jazz could be worthy of the concert hall .
Four years later in Europe , Gershwin met more of his new admirers , including Stravinsky , Ravel , Prokofiev and two composers of the revolutionary Second Viennese School , Schoenberg and Berg .
Awed by Berg , Gershwin hesitated at the piano one night , nervous about playing his catchy songs before one of the deconstructors of conventional harmony .
Berg sternly encouraged him : “ Mr Gershwin , music is music . ”
If only it were that simple , writes Alex Ross , the New Yorker 's music critic , in his history of music in the 20th century .
He notes that musical life in the past 100 years has “ disintegrated into a teeming mass of cultures and subcultures , each with its own canon and jargon . ”
The cultures may sometimes meet on affable terms , but the results can be comic in their incongruity .
In the 1930s , when much of the European artistic elite was holed up in Hollywood , Fanny Brice , a comedienne , strolled over to Schoenberg at a dinner given by Harpo Marx : “ C'mon , professor , play us a tune . ”
It would be hard to imagine a better guide to the maelstrom of recent music than Mr Ross , who worked on this book for a decade .
He has an almost uncanny gift for putting music into words .
No other critic writing in English can so effectively explain why you like a piece , or beguile you to reconsider it , or prompt you to hurry online and buy a recording .
And his reporter 's nose and exhaustive research result in more telling vignettes and notable anecdotes per chapter than any reader has a right to expect .
Mr Ross notices that Gustav Mahler , who came from a Jewish background , was at the podium when Adolf Hitler saw Wagner 's “ Tristan and Isolde ” in Vienna on May 8th 1906 , an experience that prompted Hitler to decide to study opera direction and painting in Vienna .
( Unfortunately , that career - plan did not work out . )
He notices that some photographs of Hitler 's oratorical poses show a suggestive resemblance to Mahler 's conducting style .
And he notices that a prisoners ' orchestra that played for SS officers in Auschwitz in 1942 , and captivated Josef Mengele , was led by Mahler 's niece , Alma Rosé , who died in the concentration camp .
War and politics visibly intertwined with music in the 20th century , under totalitarianism and after it .
As Mr Ross documents , classical music blared constantly in the choreographed background to Nazi life .
For a time , the classical repertoire was deemed to have lost its moral stature because of the Nazis ' embrace .
This was one reason why some composers tried to scrap classical forms and explore the alternatives , leading to the dissonant pandemonium of experimental music in the 1950s .
Theodor Adorno , a left - wing sociologist and musician , wrote in 1949 that preserving tonality betrayed a fascist mentality .
Under Stalin , Soviet art was rigorously policed to ensure that it reflected Soviet ideology .
Shostakovich was accused of “ formalism ” : Soviet - speak for any style that seemed too close to Western modernism .
He was one of the few censured Soviet artists to survive the purges .
Post - war democracy had its ( less pernicious ) musical agenda , too .
The psychological - warfare unit of America 's occupation government in Germany and Austria worked to minimise the influence of tainted composers , such as Richard Strauss , who had unwisely thanked God when Hitler came to power : “ Finally , a Reich chancellor who is interested in art ! ”
Sibelius 's “ Finlandia ” was banned , in case it rekindled feelings of Nordic supremacy .
American music , such as the work of Aaron Copland and Virgil Thomson , was encouraged .
In the early 1960s , when America wanted to show that capitalism and high culture were compatible , music became a weapon in the cold war .
As Mr Ross puts it , the arms race expanded into a science race and then a culture race .
Much of the impetus for the millions of dollars spent on cultural infrastructure came from the Kennedy administration — although Jacqueline Kennedy once quipped that the only music that the president really liked was “ Hail to the Chief ” .
Mr Ross says that his aim is to provide a history of the 20th century through its music , not just a history of the music itself .
In this he succeeds magnificently , at least for classical music and its closest cousins .
Yet , as he knows , a large part of the story of the past century belongs to pop and rock , which get only walk - on parts here , albeit excellently drawn ones .
He is especially adept at describing the cross-fertilisation of genres — how classical minimalism affected popular music through such intermediaries as Lou Reed and Brian Eno , for example .
There are tantalising hints that he has much to say about the classical - popular divide .
Classical composers , he writes , are now looking for the place between the life of the mind and the noise of the street .
They may never match the instant impact of pop , but “ in the freedom of their solitude , they can communicate experiences of singular intensity . ”
If only he would tell us more .
This is not a complaint , but a request for an encore .
This past week Exxon Mobil announced the closure of their operating coal mine in Illinois , and their departure from the coal business .
For those who worry most about greenhouse gas emissions this might seem to be a step forward , and , while I will likely write about that issue some other time , I would rather express a different concern today .
Electric power is a fundamental part of our everyday life .
Outside of the impact of the occasional storm , we expect that when we flip a light switch , the light will go on .
Yet few give much thought to the power station that is generating that power .
In recent years the new power stations that have been built have largely got their power from natural gas .
But if the world oil is within that zone that we will , in future years , refer to as the peak plateau , the state of US Natural Gas is in a much more perilous position .
The Barnett Shale is estimated to have a trillion cubic feet of natural gas every 7 square miles .
The average gas in place in the Barnett Shale is 160 billion cubic feet of gas per square mile .
The expanded play now has well over 2,000 successful commercial wells with very few disappointments and marginal wells , attributable to the low - risk , blanket nature of the productive formation .
Driven by technological advances in fracturing techniques and horizontal drilling , natural gas production from the Barnett Shale has now reached levels exceeding 900 m cubic feet per day .
One of the most productive recent developments for the production of natural gas ( NG ) has been the Barnett Shale , and it has been followed by the development of the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas .
If one reads the prospectus of a company working in the Barnett Shale , for example Truestar Petroleum they will tell you that
And , more germane to the topic today
The wells initially produce for about 1 m cubic feet of gas per day but experience a 50 % decline in the first year .
Then the wells stabilize and produce for an average 20 years , with expected life in excess of 30 years .
Re-fracing a well after 5 years or so of production can add another three quarters of a billion cubic feet of gas to a well 's overall production .
. .
In general , horizontal drilling has resulted in significant and material improvements in initial production rates over vertical wells ( 300 - 400 % ) with only a 40 - 50 % increase in drilling costs .
. .
Ultimate expected recoveries have improved due to the flattening of the vertical well hyperbolic decline curve , to a much flatter exponential decline curve .
Ultimate expected recoveries are anticipated to be in the range of 3 - 5 Bcf per well over the 30 - 40 year anticipated productive life , which should include initial fracture stimulation and at least one re-frac .
Now you read that , you look at the number of wells that are producing and the thought does arise , that maybe we are being a bit pessimistic since , with all those wells producing at that rate over that amount of time , maybe the problem is n’t going to be upon us that quickly .
But then I remembered that article that I had read in World Oil about the economics of the wells being drilled in the Fayetteville Shale .
The article is a useful one to source , since Arthur Berman has included estimated drilling costs for both vertical wells ( at $ 650 k ) and horizontal wells ( at $ 2.6 million ) ( an interesting ratio given the Truestar numbers ) , as well as anticipated production numbers , before concluding that
Based on data from 187 Fayetteville wells provided by IHS and the Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission , I find little economic justification for the play at present .
None of the vertical wells that I analyzed will recover drilling and operational costs .
Only 3 of the 136 horizontal wells will be economic in the most - likely case , and only 13 in the optimistic case .
Further , I cannot substantiate per-well reserves that approach the levels claimed by operators .
.
Now in his subsequent column in the October edition of the magazine , he corrected some of the initial article , having been given access to proprietary information on well production .
As a result he concluded that slick - water fracture stimulation can make a well profitable , some of his estimated charges were high , and the hyperbolic decline model does predict somewhat higher production and well life than he had originally assumed .
However , he then went on to discuss the difference between hyperbolic and exponential decline models , and ended with the following :
There were a few readers who objected to using a four - year average well life in the economic model that I presented .
One reader even suggested that I should have used 30 - year well lives for the Fayetteville Shale .
The longest production history in the Fayetteville play is 25 months and the average well has been producing for under seven months .
I , therefore , investigated longer well histories from the Barnett Shale where 320 horizontal wells have been producing gas for at least two years ( the longest production history is 68 months ) .
The three longest - lived of these are currently producing at rates that are below lease operating costs .
Erk !
And now Arthur Berman has revisited the Barnett Shale , in his most recent article concluding , after looking at close to 2,000 wells , that
approximately 28 % of Barnett
Shale wells should realize revenues that meet or exceed drilling , completion and operating costs in the most likely case based on assumptions incorporated into a 10 % net present value ( NPV 10 ) economic model .
Again , the article contains a fair amount of underlying data that provides useful information , including an estimate of $ 3 million for the drilling and completion costs of the wells .
Currently he does not see the economics of the operation changing , nor does he anticipate any short - term changes in the market that will lead to an increase in gas prices .
Yet I go back to his earlier article and the line “ the three longest - lived of these are currently producing at rates that are below lease operating costs . ”
Those wells are around 5 years old .
If , in fact their effective operational life is around 4 years or so , and they are typical of the wells in the field , then the longer term future of production has got to provide more concern that folks are currently exhibiting .
That appears to be that we have no immediate problem and so . . . . .
Beginning to sound a bit familiar is n’t it .
The current complacency over the longer term natural gas supply extends to the lack of viable replacement sources , and to what will need to be done to supply us , in the short - term , with the power that puts the light on , when I flip that switch .
The other problem , of course , is that you do n’t change power station fuel sources at the drop of a hat , and if , concurrently , we are hesitating to build the stations that we anticipate will be needed to match future growth , then the supply issue on the other side of that switch may give us concern sooner than we think .

An investigation ordered by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki into Blackwater ’s September 16 shooting in Baghdad , in which 17 civilians were killed and another 24 were wounded , has determined that the company ’s operators opened fired indiscriminately and without provocation .
The official Iraqi report on the incident demands that the U.S. government pay $ 8 million in compensation to each of the victims ’ families and sever all Iraq - based contracts with Blackwater within the next 6 months .
It also demands that the Blackwater operators involved in the shootings be handed over to Iraqi authorities for possible prosecution in Iraqi courts .
It ’s unclear if the U.S. government will comply and perhaps even more unclear if it could meet the Iraqi government ’s demands even if it wanted to .
Civilian employees of the State Department rely on Blackwater for protection .
If the company were banished from Iraq , U.S. diplomatic operations would be paralyzed , at least until another private contractor could be hired for the job .
Even if this were to happen , it ’s doubtful that booting Blackwater would make much difference .
More than likely , its operators would quickly find work with competitors like Triple Canopy and DynCorp , who would have to fill the Baghdad security void in Blackwater ’s absence .
The private security sector is a small one after all .
Even Andrew Moonen , the Blackwater operator who got drunk in the Green Zone last Christmas Eve and murdered one of the Iraqi vice president ’s security guards , found a new job with Combat Support Services Associates , which put him back to work in Kuwait just two months after the shooting .
So , will Blackwater survive this latest scandal ?
It ’s impossible to know for sure , but there ’s little reason to believe otherwise .
The company , which started as a small - scale provider of firearms training in 1998 , has grown into a billion - dollar Goliath , complete with an army of lobbyists and sympathetic politicians to press its agenda on Capitol Hill .
Guided by its reclusive founder , Erik Prince , the company , over its short history , has deflected controversy with ease , all the while simultaneously expanding its reach into new markets and generating ever more profitable government contracts .

US military guzzling 340,000 barrels of oil daily Mike Aivaz and Jason Rhyne

The skyrocketing price of oil is n't just a burden for American drivers at the gas pump -- it's also a potentially crippling problem for the US military , the nation 's number one energy consumer .
The combined branches of the American military burn through a whopping 340,000 barrels of oil a day , reports CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr .
" If you think it 's expensive to fill your gas tank , " Starr told Situation Room host Wolf Blitzer , " just consider what the military is going through right now . "
With the already high price of oil still on the rise , military expenditures on energy are increasing dramatically .
" And with oil near $ 100 a barrel , " Starr reports , " the Pentagon estimates each $ 10 a barrel increases in oil costs the military -- and the tax payer -- an additional $ 1.3 billion a year .
To pay the tab , money is sometimes borrowed from other vital military programs . " " If they were a country , they'd be the 38th largest consumer of oil , " Lawrence Korb , of the Center for American Progress , told CNN .
" If you look at in total , you 're getting close to $ 20 billion a year that the Pentagon has to spend on oil . "
The military 's single biggest user of oil is the Air Force , whose oil - hungry ships and planes account for $ 8 billion a year in fuel .
That figure represents more than half of the Pentagon 's total energy bill .
To mitigate at least a portion of the expense , the military is taking some steps to go " green , " CNN reports .
In September , the Air Force will debut a bomber that eschews oil power in favor of a coal - based fuel system .
And at the Naval Air Weapons Station , in China Lake , Calif. , the Navy is operating a geothermal - powered generating station .
One military location , Nevada 's Nellis Air Force Base , even has December plans to draw a third of its power from solar energy .
" But with rising oil prices , energy savings are eaten up , " Starr continued .
" In 2005 , the military used 14 million barrels of oil less that what it used two years earlier -- but paid $ 3 billion more for it . "
A May study ordered by the Pentagon found that oil costs threatened to seriously hamper US military capabilities , making it 's commitments around the world " unsustainable in the long term . "

In a direct challenge to Congress and the way it does business , the White House on Wednesday unveiled an online list of all the pet spending projects lawmakers tucked in the federal budget for the 2004 - 05 fiscal year .
The Internet database details spending known as earmarks , funds that lawmakers funnel to projects , programs and sometimes even specific recipients without going through the normal budget review -- such as the $ 25 million provided to California spinach farmers in the recent Iraq spending bill .
The amount of earmarked money has tripled in the last decade .
And in early January , just as Democrats were taking power , President Bush challenged Congress to halve the number and amount of earmarks , from a record $ 19 billion in fiscal 2005 .
“ You did n’t vote them into law .
I did n’t sign them into law .
Yet they are treated as if they have the force of law , ” Bush said in his State of the Union address .
“ The time has come to end this practice . ”

The database , which allows the public to search for earmarks by state and by agency but not by name of the sponsoring lawmaker , is the most comprehensive list produced by the government .
But Democrats pointed out Wednesday that it did not include the earmarks the president and his administration requested .
The list includes 13,496 earmarks , of which 1,182 went to California recipients for a total of $ 1.7 billion , the most of any state .
Beneficiaries included Los Angeles - based nonprofit companies -- such as Fashion Business Inc. ( $ 50,000 for workforce training ) and the Jewish Vocational Service ( $ 198,000 to train certified nursing assistants ) -- and Arcata - based Internews Network , which got nearly $ 8 million , mostly for training Indonesian journalists .
Other top recipients included Alaska , which got earmarks for agricultural research on northern climate crops ( $ 1.6 million ) and seafood waste ( $ 1.2 million ) .

The website is the latest effort on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to shine light into the hidden realm of earmarks .
For years , a few lone congressional protesters -- Arizona Republicans Sen. John McCain and Rep. Jeff
Flake to name two -- attempted to halt the rampant growth of earmarks , which soared during the years Republicans were in control of Congress .
Members of both parties defend earmarking as a way for Congress to put attention on local concerns when executive - branch agencies are unresponsive .
They are also important to congressional leaders in building their power as well as luring campaign contributions .
But in 2005 , earmarking became a public concern .
It emerged at the center of the case against former Rep. Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham ( R - Rancho Santa Fe ) , now in prison for securing federal funding for individuals who provided him personal benefits .
It was also the basis for much of the wealth amassed by lobbyist Jack Abramoff , who was convicted of bribery and a bogus casino deal .
He referred to the House Appropriations Committee as “ the favor factory . ”

Flake hailed the database as a step forward .
“ Whenever any members of Congress can basically write a check to a group at home without any real oversight , and when people in Congress basically will look the other way if you ’ll offer them the same courtesy when they offer earmarks , you ’ll have something ripe for abuse , ” Flake said .
“ We should n’t be surprised when we have a Duke Cunningham . ”
The congressman , who puts out a weekly e-mail spotlighting the “ egregious earmark of the week , ” said the database “ should help those of us who think this process is really short - circuiting the traditional authorizing , appropriating and oversight function of Congress .
I think when taxpayers take a look , they ’ll be quite upset at how their dollars are being spent . ”
When Democrats took power , House and Senate leaders created rules that will identify sponsors of earmarks and require them to certify that they have no financial interest in the earmark .
“ It was a missed opportunity to get rid of earmarks altogether , ” said Beth Daley , head of investigations at the Project on Government Oversight , a nonpartisan nonprofit .
Daley calls earmarks “ the funding stream for the lobbying profession . ”

The database , at www.whitehouse.gov/omb, lacks some information considered vital by activists .
It is only for fiscal 2005 and does not give the name of the lawmaker behind the earmark .
It also does not include any earmarks requested by the administration .
As a result , it contains fewer earmarks than some other sources .
For example , the Congressional Research Service found $ 48 billion in earmarks in its review .
Some of those deficiencies will be addressed next year when congressionally authorized earmark disclosure data are released .
“ This is a treasure trove of information that [ the Office of Management and Budget ] has made available to the public , ” said Steve Ellis , a vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense , a group that developed its own earmark database in years past .
“ We would like to see more , but this is far more than anyone else has had to date . ”

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks slipped Monday afternoon as investors welcomed the White House 's pledge to aid subprime mortgage holders , but continued to bail out of housing and financial stocks on worries about the economy .
GM ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) shares fell 4 percent after the automaker reported a drop in November sales versus forecasts for a rise , while other auto sales were mixed .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( Charts ) lost 0.3 percent with around 2 hours left in the session .
The broader S&P 500 ( Charts ) index lost 0.5 percent .
The tech - fueled Nasdaq ( Charts ) composite lost 0.5 percent .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , speaking at the National Housing Forum Monday , said the United States is aggressively pursuing relief for struggling subprime mortgage holders .
Paulson outlined steps the government is taking to help troubled homeowners , but did n't provide more details on plans for freezing interest rates at the lower levels .
The comments seemed to help settle stocks after morning declines , but investors showed reluctance to push stocks much higher on the first trading day of December .
Stocks gained last week after comments from Federal Reserve officials suggested the central bank will cut rates again at its policy - meeting on Dec. 11 .
But the gains occurred at the end of an unusually rough November on Wall Street in which stocks got slammed on worries that the housing and credit market crisis will push the economy into recession .
Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren said U.S. economic growth will be well below its long - term rate over the next two quarters , according to news reports .
Rosengren is a voting member of the Fed 's 2007 policy committee .
Investors are hoping that Federal Reserve officials , meeting next week , will cut a key short - term interest rate by at least a quarter - point , if not a half - point , so as to speed up the flow of money through the economy .
In economic news , the Institute For Supply Management 's manufacturing index for November eased to 50.8 in the month , the group reported , versus forecasts for a slip to 50.5 .
The index stood at 50.9 in October .
Any reading over 50 signifies economic expansion .
Reports are due later in the week on factory orders , consumer sentiment and the big monthly jobs report .

1864 : Union troops under Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman burn the heart of Atlanta to the ground and begin their March to the Sea .
By the time they 're done , the tactics of warfare will be changed forever .
After driving the Confederates out of Atlanta , Sherman entered the city in early September and remained until Nov. 15 .
Sparing only the churches , courthouse and the city 's private residences , Sherman 's troops cut the telegraph wires and burned everything else of consequence : warehouses , train depots , factories .
Then the army set off , four corps divided into two columns , on its march to the sea .
In a 62 - day campaign of destruction , the 62,000 - man Union force cut a ruinous , 60 - mile - wide swath through Georgia : tearing up railroads , firing factories , destroying bridges , burning plantations , seizing livestock and freeing slaves .
The army lived off the land , sacking the unfortunate homesteads and plantations that lay along the line of march .
After Savannah fell on Dec. 22 , Sherman paused only long enough to secure the seaport before swinging north into the Carolinas .
The destruction wrought by the Federals in South Carolina – the first Southern state to secede from the Union – was even worse than it had been in Georgia .
Vengeance aside , the real objective of Sherman 's march was to cut the Confederacy in two , cripple Southern industrial capacity , destroy the railroad system and compel an early Confederate surrender .
It was also intended to break Southern morale – in Sherman 's words , to " make Georgia howl . "
Sherman was vilified for his barbarism , but the Union commander was a realist , not a romantic .
He understood as few of his contemporaries seemed to that technology and industrialization were radically changing the nature of warfare .
It was no longer a question of independent armies meeting on remote battlefields to settle the issue .
Civilians , who helped produce the means for waging modern war , could no longer be considered innocent noncombatants .
Hitting the enemy where he ate and breaking him psychologically were just as important to victory as vanquishing his armies in the field .
Sherman grasped this and , though he was n't the first military proponent of total war , he was the first commander to deliberately strike at the enemy 's infrastructure .
The scorched - earth tactics were effective .
The fragile Southern economy collapsed and a once - stout rebel army was irretrievably broken .
Meanwhile , the marshals of Europe watched Sherman 's progress with fascination .
And they learned .

Companies are always trying to sneak advertisements into our daily lives .
Not surprisingly , advertising based games ( or advergames ) have been around almost as long as the video games themselves .
Here are some of the more notable examples .
1. Cool Spot
This game , based on 7 - Up , was praised for its smooth graphics and challenging levels , despite the fact that the main character was the then - mascot for the company in a Sonic the Hedgehog - style environment .
The sequel , Spot Goes to Hollywood , went flat pretty quickly , and Spot was retired as the company mascot shortly after .
But he still hangs out between the 7 and U on the soda label .
2. Yo ! Noid !
Though the 1989 DOS and Commodore 64 game Avoid The Noid had players delivering pizzas and dodging the annoying Domino 's Pizza mascot , this 1990 game for NES let the player act as the monstrosity .
Noid traversed through New York using a yo - yo to battle his evil duplicate , Mr. Green .
Yo !
Noid was essentially a modified duplication of another Capcom game from Japan called Kamen no Ninja Hanamaru ; the game play remain unchanged , but different facades were applied to the locations .
In case the pizza eating contests at the end of the levels did n't make the player hungry , the game came with a whopping dollar - off coupon for Domino 's Pizza .
But back in the early 90's that was , like , a dollar fifty .
3. Kool Aid Man
This game , for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision , had very little to do with busting through walls and disturbingly revolved around drinking from a swimming pool full of Kool Aid that also served as Sir Punch 's life bar .
The object of the game was to quench the thirst of thirty " Thirsties " using the pool of life matter .
Confused ?
So was everyone who ever played it .
4. Chester Cheetah : Too Cool to Fool and Wild Wild Quest
The Joe Camel of the snack food world received not one , but two of his own video games for SNES and Genesis , respectively .
Neither game was well received ; the game play was considered complicated and boring , and the instruction manuals contained bad rhymes that were very poorly translated from Japanese , such as " As is Chester Cheetah way , is one - person play . "
5 . The King Games
That creepy King starred in three economically priced video games for X - Box in 2006 : Pocketbike Racer , Big Bumpin ' and Sneak King .
The games were extremely popular due to their low price and high fun content .
Burger King and its marketing company won several advertising awards for the campaign .
6. Chase the Chuck Wagon
Another low - fi Atari 2600 adventure , this game was a maze - based and required the player to guide a dog to attain the glorious chuck wagon .
The game was only available through proofs of purchase on the dog food bags .
Only a handful of customers took Purina up on their promotion .
Because very few copies made it into the hands of the public , the game is a prized collectors item .
7. M.C. Kids
Of course the marketing masters for McDonalds had to get involved in the video game world .
In this game , two teenage players enter the McDonalds Fantasy Land to chase after Ronald McDonald 's " fun bag " which has been stolen by Hamburglar .
McDonalds was not pleased with the final product , so they refused to promote the game .
The game was too difficult for most younger players , and older players thought that it was a ripoff of other popular games , like Super Mario Brothers 3 .
Caroline Donnelly is an occasional contributor to mentalfloss.com .
Mark Halperin , who tends to be more conservative or moderate in his commentary , Gave Edwards ’ Debate Performance an " A " :
Came Across As Presidential , Optimistic and Patriotic — Essential for a Winner . "
" Impressively he remained above the Clinton - Obama fray ( no " look at me " antics ) but swept in to best them while the media waited for the pair to duke it out .
Calm and cool , he went after Clinton on ( let 's face it ) character , and only occasionally seemed to be trying too hard .
Hit both his Democratic and Republican targets with acute precision and impact .
Appeared tough enough to perform well in a general election , with the kind of articulate passion he formerly demonstrated in the courtroom .
Came across as presidential , optimistic and patriotic - essential for a winner .
David Yepsen : John Edwards Emerged
As the Evening ’s Most Effective and Articulate Challenger to Clinton .
In a blog post titled , " Johnny Be Good , " Yepsen wrote :
John Edwards emerged as the evening ’s most effective and articulate challenger to Clinton .
She turned in an uneven , sometimes waffling performance ... Edwards came ready for the scrap and he helped his candidacy .
Then there is the NYT , who has practically declared a two - person race already , observed :
But for all the attention Mr. Obama drew to himself coming into the debate , he was frequently overshadowed by former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina , who — speaking more intensely and frequently — repeatedly challenged Mrs. Clinton ’s credentials and credibility .
‘ Senator Clinton says that she believes she can be the candidate for change , but she defends a broken system that ’s corrupt in Washington , D.C. , ’ Mr. Edwards said .
‘ She says she will end the war , but she continues to say she ’ll keep combat troops in Iraq and continue combat missions in Iraq .
To me , that ’s not ending the war ; that ’s the continuation of the war . ’
He added , ‘ I think the American people , given this historic moment in our country ’s history , deserve a president of the United States that they know will tell them the truth , and wo n’t say one thing one time and something different at a different time .
Even Georgie S on Good Morning America had to pay JRE his due :
" I think it was a good night for John Edwards .
I think one of his best nights of these debates so far .
He was very , very clear .
He did n’t back down at all .
He knew exactly what he wanted to say about Hillary Clinton , again , that she ca n’t bring about change .
( sorry no linky )
CQ ’s veteran correspondent Craig Crawford shared his impressions of Edwards ' performance with Chris Matthews :
Chris Matthews : " Who was ready to be her number one challenger between now and January ? " ...
Craig Crawford : " I thought it was Edwards ’ best performance so far . "
Crawford later wrote , " " John Edwards was truly passionate about taking on Clinton , targeting her centrist views as ‘ doubletalk ’ and accusing her of falling in line with hawkish ‘ neo - conservatives ’ on Iran .
Indeed , it was the former North Carolina senator ’s most forceful debate performance so far .
Crawford particularly liked this comment by JRE :
I thought Edwards made a good point when he said Republicans talk about you so much , because they want to run against you .
The Nation ’s Ari Melber held high praise for the candidate who presented himself as one of bold change :
John Edwards had the strongest showing , pounding Clinton as the status quo candidate .
‘ If you believe that combat missions should be continued in Iraq [ with no timetable ] , ’ he said , ‘ then Senator Clinton is your candidate . ’
Edwards repeatedly presented himself as the most credible ‘ change ’ candidate .
Another of The Nation ’s columnists , John Nichols , ( first reaction ) was effusive :
It was n't just a fight about Iran , however .
Edwards hit hard , and effectively , on every front .
After detailing the front - runner 's contributions from defense contractors and other corporate interests , he said .
‘ If people want the status quo , Senator Clinton 's your candidate . ’
That 's tough talk .
Blunt talk .
The sort of talk that Barack Obama seemed to suggest that he was going to deliver Tuesday night .
But it came from John Edwards , who ended the night as the candidate who had done the best job of defining himself as the alternative to Hillary Clinton .
Then Nichols added this later : Edwards , Not Obama , Hits Clinton Hardest , Smartest .
It was supposed to be the night Barack Obama took Hillary Clinton down .
But , when all was said and done , Obama was a bystander ... Where Obama was unfocused and ineffectual , John Edwards landed plenty of blows .
The former senator from North Carolina began by suggesting that ‘ it 's fair ’ to talk about essential differences between the candidates .
Then he highlighted a big one .
‘( Clinton ) says she 'll stand up to George Bush , ’ argued Edwards .
" In fact , she voted to give George W. Bush the first step to war on Iran ...’...
It was a smart , at times intense dialogue ... But Edwards owned the moment .
Accusing Clinton of voting for an Iran resolution that read like it was ‘ written literally by the neo-cons , ’ the 2004 vice presidential nominee declared , ‘ We need to stand up to this president .
We need to make it absolutely clear that we will not let Bush , Cheney and this administration invade Iran .
CBS ’s Jeff Greenfield , who is also not one to give out praise very easily , did so on the Earlhy Show :
On Iran , " But it was former Senator John Edwards who used the toughest language , at one point reacting with incredulity to her claim that a vote to brand the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as terrorists was a way of opposing the president .
NBC ’s Tim Russert on the Today Show this morning :
Meredith Viera : " So did Edwards emerge ? "
Tim Russert : " I think Edwards emerged as the most aggressive candidate against Hillary Clinton ...
But clearly , looking at their performance last night , Edwards was more aggressive , more on the offense than Barack Obama " .
Marc Ambinder sang the praises :
In this discordant symphony – ‘ A Clintonian Lament ’ -- John Edwards ’s instruments of persuasion were sharper and louder ; Barack Obama ’s were more resonant and more subtle .
In music terms , Edwards played the French horn ; Obama played the violin .
Or , as the New Yorker ’s Ryan Lizza told me during a commercial break , ‘ It ’s the difference between someone who goes to law school and becomes a prosecutor and someone who goes to law school and becomes a law professor .
ABC ’s Rick Klein :
It 's rare that a highlight comes this late in a debate , but Edwards picks up on that inconsistency on immigration : ‘ Sen .
Clinton said two different things in the course of about two minutes . ’
Obama : ‘ I was confused on Sen. Clinton 's answer
.
Then Klein added :
Hillary Clinton gave a truly bad answer at the end , on illegal immigration , one that feeds the argument Obama and Edwards were making all night .
Did Obama clear the bar he set for himself ?
Probably yes , but not with much room to spare .
Edwards still seems better , though , at finding compelling ways to set himself apart .
NBC 's Domenico Montanaro mused on the doubletalk :
Clinton Blurring the Lines AGAIN , Now on Illegal Immigrant Driver 's Licenses ... Edwards Called Her on It . "
" Is Clinton blurring the lines AGAIN , now on illegal immigrant driver 's licenses .
She said the plan makes sense , but can't commit apparently .
She said she did n't say she supports the plan , when Dodd said she did .
Russert tried to pin her on it , and she obfuscated again .
Edwards called her on it , evoking Bush - Cheney , saying Americans were tired of ‘ double talk . ’
Obama nodded and got called on and he got to chime in as well .
Does this become a problem for her ?
Can she directly answer a question ?
The Politico ’sBen Smith , not one of my favorite reporters , but he 's spot on the money with this commentary :
John Edwards kept up the pressure most skillfully on Clinton , putting his courtroom skills to use to build a case , at times mockingly , against the New York senator ...
Edwards drove his point home when she refused to say whether she supports New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer ’s plan to give drivers ’ licenses to illegal immigrants
.
CNN ’s Candy Crowley , who generally covers more the campaigns of Obama and Clinton , appeared on CNN ’s Anderson Cooper 360 , and said ,
John Edwards , who has never been shy about going after the frontrunner , stepped up his game , questioning her candor .
. Crowley earned a ear of corn for that one .
And we at the Daily Kos knew last night who the winner was .
John Edwards led the pack with 33 % of the 8,588 votes cast , followed by Obama at 21 % , and Clinton at 16 % .
I 'm happy to hear the praise of the critics , but it 's very clear none of them believed him when he said he has taken on the big interests before in the court rooms , and beat them at their game .
Doubletalk does n't work , and we do n't want the special interests making decisions in the White House .
Welcome to the Primary Season , Mrs. Clinton .
I would heed MJ Rosenberg 's words at TPM Cafe today : Edwards Won .
But , of the three heavyweights , I was most impressed by Edwards .
He combined toughness and vision .
Somehow I can imagine that Edwards ' agenda for America would have a name like " New Deal " or " Great Society " in other words a rubric that suggests that his program for America would be larger than just his persona .
I like that .
I 'm not so sure about the others .
I think Edwards will win Iowa and then we 'll have a real race , one with an almost level playing field .
It is not over .
That is the main thing I learned last night .
Not over by a long shot . "
I think Paul Bevanfrom
Time blogs , summed it best :
But it was Edwards who reached out last night to try and grab the mantle as the candidate Democrats can trust - and he seemed to do it somewhat effectively .
The reason the " trustworthiness " charge is so potentially potent is because it dovetails with - or cuts against , depending on your perspective - the argument for real change , which is what Democrats ( and Republicans , for that matter ) are yearning for this year .
Edwards ' accusation is that Hillary is an entrenched part of a corrupt and broken system , and that you simply cannot trust her when she says she 's an agent of change .
That is a powerful message that probably rings true to many Democrats and arouses deep - seated suspicions about her .
Furthermore , it makes her slogan -
You can't have change without the " experience and leadership " - seem like another example of hollow Clintonian parsing and triangulation .
Kossacks , here 's looking at the Future .
Sarah Wells makes an unlikely cyber-vigilante .
But the middle - aged mother in Virginia was outraged when she read a Saint Charles Journal article on Megan Meier , a 13 - year - old Missouri girl driven to suicide by relentless online bullying .
The fact that the bullying appeared to be instigated by the mother of one of Megan 's friends through a fake MySpace account enraged Wells all the more .
When Wells learned that the woman had filed a police report against the dead girl 's father – who had destroyed the woman 's foosball table in anger and grief – she resolved to take matters into her own hands .
The newspaper account did n't identify the perpetrator of the deadly hoax by name , but included enough detail to track her down through online property - tax records .
With a few minutes of sleuthing , Wells identified the woman as Lori Drew , of O'Fallon , Missouri .
After confirming it with someone in the O'Fallon area who she says was " in a position to know , " she posted the name to her blog .
" It was outrageous enough what she had done , but dragging ( Megan 's father ) into the courts , calling the police and bringing the charges against the family whose daughter had suffered a great deal because of her ... for her to do that , it was like , OK , it 's coming back to you , " Wells says .
Experts say the firestorm that followed illustrates what happens when the social imperative to punish those in a community who violate social norms plays out over the internet .
The impulse is human nature , say experts , and few can imagine an offense more egregious than a trusted adult preying on the emotions of a vulnerable child .
Shunning wrongdoers , especially in the absence of legal redress , helps maintain order and preserve a community 's moral sense of right – think church excommunications and the Amish tradition of Meidung .
But the drive for social shaming – to right a wrong and restore social balance – can run amok and create paradoxical consequences , especially on the internet where people instigate mobs in ways they would n't do offline .
" Internet shaming is done by people who want actually to enforce norms and to make people and society more orderly , " says Daniel Solove , professor of law at George Washington University and author of The Future of Reputation : Gossip , Rumor and Privacy on the Internet .
" The problem is that internet shaming actually destroys social control and makes things more anarchic , and it becomes very hard to regulate and stop it . "
Wells published only Lori Drew 's name , but her readers and other bloggers followed by finding and posting her husband 's name , the family 's address and phone number , a cellphone number , the name of the family 's advertising company , and the names and phone numbers of clients with whom they worked .
As Megan 's story raced across the internet and was picked up by national media , more people joined in the cause , including Wired News readers .
Many were outraged that Drew , a middle - aged woman with a teen daughter of her own , fabricated the MySpace identity of a 16 - year - old named " Josh Evans " to woo the emotionally fragile Megan , in order to learn what the girl was saying about her own daughter .
Once Megan was lured in , " Josh " turned on her , heaping verbal abuse until the teen went over the edge .
In retaliation , readers called Drew 's advertising clients to urge them to withdraw their business from her .
But it was n't long before there were death threats , a brick through a window and calls to set the Drews ' house on fire .
Police have reportedly increased patrols to guard the family against attack .
A peaceful protest is scheduled to occur on the family 's street this weekend .
Solove is n't surprised .
He points to a story two years ago about a man whose camera phone was stolen from his unlocked car .
The apparent thief took pictures of himself and friends , which automatically uploaded to the camera owner 's Sprint web account .
The owner discovered the thief 's name and posted it online with the photos .
Netizens superimposed the thief 's picture onto pornographic images and posted racist remarks about him .
After a Wired News story revealed that the alleged thief was 16 and that his mother claimed she'd bought the camera from a street seller , Solove says the owner regretted the fury he 'd unleashed and asked the online mob to back off .
Instead , the mob turned on him .
" When you have a bunch of people together all trying to achieve the same goal , the whole starts to take on a mind of its own , " Solove says , " and people start to act in extreme ways that they might not otherwise act . "
It 's no surprise that many people who posted Drew 's name and personal details online have done so under a cloak of anonymity , with the exception of Wells and a few others .
" People do n't mind doing ( this kind of thing ) as long as it does n’t cost them anything , as long as there 's very little risk of retribution , " says Robert Kurzban , professor of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of works on social exclusion and stigmatization .
" But when people actually have to pay a cost to punish other people , they prefer not to do that . "
Wells says she does n't condone calls for violence and has removed any that appeared on her blog .
There are many who agree that the punishment fits the crime in this case .
But online vigilantes have been known to react just as strongly to lesser grievances .
Two years ago a college girl in South Korea was harassed after her tiny dog defecated on the floor of a subway car , and she ignored passengers ' requests to clean it up .
Someone on the train snapped her photo and posted it online .
She was quickly dubbed Dog Poop Girl , and within days a cyberposse had discovered her name and was digging up information about her and her family .
The public humiliation reportedly led her to withdraw from her university , and the pictures of her and the feces are still online today .
Wells acknowledges that such a case can make it seem as if the internet is " a perpetual outrage machine , " where people are simply looking for the next injustice to get worked up about .
But she feels the reaction to Dog Poop Girl was unique to Korean culture and would n't have caused the same stir here , although Americans were as amused by the story as others around the world .
Still , she thinks the circumstances of Megan 's story dictated the depth of the reaction here .
The fact that it involved an adult targeting a child , and that Megan 's father – and not Lori Drew – was facing criminal charges , made it a clear - cut cause for cybermob outrage .
Kurzban agrees and disagrees .
He says it 's not really the details of a particular social violation that determine the strength of a community 's reaction to it , but the degree to which a community agrees in its perception of the violation .
In other words , if many people reading the same facts did n't believe that Lori Drew violated a social norm , then the response against her would have been more muted .
Indeed , a minority of people on the blogs said that Megan should have ignored the insulting messages , and that her parents should have monitored her online activity better .
But they were swiftly shouted down by the mob .
In this way , the stories of Poop Girl and Megan are wildly different on the surface , yet essentially the same , Kurzban says , since both involved actions that the majority of people in their respective communities reacted to in the same way .
For her part , Wells thinks Drew deserves to be a pariah .
" I think this should follow her wherever she goes , " Wells says .
" There should be pressure on her to be sorry and to do something to make it better . "
Wells herself felt the capricious hand of internet justice on Tuesday , when another blogger condemned her as a " vigilante " and posted her address and phone number online .
Even though methadone is an effective tool to fight heroin addiction , it is rarely used in prisons .
Researchers have found that giving inmates the controversial heroin - replacement pill along with psychological therapy makes them far less likely to spike up when they return to society .
Timothy Kinlock , the leader of the study , supervised the recruitment of over 211 volunteers from a pre-release facility .
Each had served over a year of hard time and were within six months of freedom .
He divided them into three categories .
All of them received counseling .
Some were also offered methadone , and the rest got a referral for methadone therapy upon their release .
One month after the prisoners were set free , the researchers collected samples of their urine for drug testing and gave them a survey .
The results of the study , which appear in the December issue of Drug and Alcohol Dependence , are quite compelling .
Not only did the methadone keep many of the ex-cons from picking up their old habits , but also it made them over eight times as likely to seek drug abuse treatment .
According to the report , this was the first formal clinical trial of methadone therapy in an American prison , but the heroin - substitute has been used successfully for years at New York City jail .
Kinlock and his colleagues at the Friends Research Institute plan to follow up with the former prisoners over the coming year to assess whether the drug has lasting benefits .
The following tips are what helped me get ahead in the corporate world .
They took me from a part time , entry level position to a sales management position and finally to top institutional sales manager for a large brokerage firm .
These are also things that I valued in my employees and that helped them to succeed .
Most of us have to work .
Why not enjoy it by giving it your all and excelling ?
When giving this advice , I ’m assuming that you like the company you work for , even if you do n’t like your boss .
If you do n’t like the company , do n’t quit , but do actively search for a company that you like better .
Or maybe you want to start your own business .
If you do like your company then read on .
1. Manage Your Time .
Think like a business owner , not an employee .
If you do this you will want to prioritize your work according to which activities best grow your business and profits .
Figure out what those type of activities are .
Get them done first and do n’t worry about the smaller things that do n’t have as big a payoff .
When you can , delegate appropriately .
2. Take Initiative .
Do n’t wait to be told to do things .
If you know it will help your company or team , do it .
Surprise your boss with extras .
Of course always be sure to get your most important work done first .
There ’s no point in failing the exam because you were working on extra credit stuff .
Ace the exam and then do the extra credit report too !
3. Politics : Understand
It and Make It Work for You .
Politics is not bad .
Politics is simply humans doing what they ’ve done since caveman days , working together .
Politics is “ You help me and I ’ll help you . ”
There ’s nothing wrong with that if your end goal is to grow business ethically and to grow your career based on good works .
The only thing bad about politics is ignoring it .
That will hurt your career .
Work on building a network of supporters .
Help others out with their projects and , like putting money in the bank , you ’ll be able to withdraw that support at a later date for your projects .
And be sure to seek out diversity in your supporters .
Be wary of simply focusing on your small circle of friends .
A broader base of supporters will give you more power to enact your great ideas in the future .
4. Make Your Boss Look Good .
Yes , even if you do n’t like him or her .
When your boss looks good , so do you .
Think ahead for your boss .
Anticipate his or her needs whenever you can and take action .
Actively promote the good works of your boss .
Do n’t be afraid of being labeled a “ suck - up . ”
The only people who will call you that are people who are not working on growing their career , who are too cool to stick their neck out , and whom you will surpass .
If your boss is a poor at his / her job , do n’t spend your time trying to sabotage him / her .
Just stay focused on doing great work .
If your boss is really bad , his / her superiors will eventually figure it out .
Stay above the fray and do your best to associate with positive top - producing colleagues .
5. Do n’t Gossip .
Try not to speak ill of others .
It does you no good .
It does no one any good .
Focus on your work and keep moving forward .
Gossip is a waste of time .
If you need to vent do so with your family at home .
6. Be a Good Leader , Follower , and Team Player .
You do n’t have to be in a leadership position to take on a leadership role .
You can be a thought leader and an action leader .
Do both .
The same is true with being a good follower .
Be willing to check your ego at the door even if your title says that you are the designated leader .
Be open to new ideas from people below you in rank .
And never fear their success .
Embrace their success and you win too .
Try to squash their ideas and success out of fear , you will look weak , and you will lose respect .
Being a good team player means facilitating the involvement of everyone on the team according to their strengths .
7. Take Smart Risks .
Forge a new path .
Seek out involvement from others to make your venture more successful .
8. Pick Your Battles Carefully .
You ’ve probably heard this one before , but I was always surprised how some people continually want to fight for every idea , and thereby undermine their own power to get anything done at all .
If you are going to throw down a challenge , ask yourself if this is going to truly make the company more successful .
Be able to explain how it relates to the goals that are measured .
Will you have support from others and how much influence do they have ?
Will you be making someone who holds power over your career look bad ?
Is your company in a tight fiscal mode or is the cash free flowing ?
What is at stake and is it worth it ?
If you ’re not sure , ask someone that has success with getting their ideas implemented for some guidance .
9. Details .
Find the right balance .
Do n’t forget the details of your job and do n’t drown in them either .
Establish systems or seek out support to help you .
If administrative help is not in the budget , perhaps consider swapping tasks with a colleague .
10 . Work Smart , Work Hard .
Be efficient with your time .
Stay focused on activities on which you are measured .
And , although “ The Four Hour Work Week ” touts success with only 4 hours of work per week , the truth is that most of us need to put in a good chunk of time to be successful .
And , really , if you love what you do , that ’s not such a bad thing .
Hard work is what makes play so pleasurable .
So make it a point to enjoy the work too .
11 . Be Positive and Enthusiastic .
Do n’t think you have to be serious all the time .
People want to be around happy positive people .
Be one of those people .
See the good .
Speak positively .
And encourage everyone !
Watch how it comes back to you !
12 . Seek Out Mentors .
If you see someone who is successful that you admire , go ahead and contact them .
You ’ll be amazed at what happens when you just ask .
Offer to help them in some way .
And in return hopefully you ’ll be able to build a relationship with that person and learn from them over time .
Just like building your support base , seek diversity in your mentors .
You might have a couple of mentors that approach things very differently or maybe they work on completely different things .
Learning from people with diverse experience will benefit you greatly .
13 . Manage Your Career .
Do n’t wait for your boss to send you to training .
Do n’t wait for your boss to set your quarterly objectives .
Do n’t wait for your boss to write your reviews .
Do n’t wait for your boss to give your career coaching .
Take the bull by the horns because often these things do n’t happen .
Your boss might not be a bad boss , but in the age of downsizing , they may simply be overloaded with responsibilities .
Do n’t spend your time critiquing your boss and lamenting the lack of coaching .
Realize that you are the only one who can make it happen .
Set your own goals .
Bring them to your boss .
Make it easy for your boss to review you by handing him or her all of your accomplishments from the past quarter .
And seek out coaching all the time from lots of different people .
14 . Understand the Big Picture .
It ’s very easy to fall into tunnel vision with your own career or with your work - group .
You may think that corporate headquarters is not giving you the resources you need .
News bulletin : everyone always feels that way .
It ’s the human condition to always want more .
That ’s fine , but learn to make it happen on your own and to make due with what you have available .
Try to understand where the company is headed in the long term and how your team fits into the overall picture .
Again do n’t spend precious time whining about corporate headquarters .
Instead think about how your team can be a model for supporting the company ’s overall goals and think about how you can be a leader on that front .
15 . Learn How to Motivate People to Take Action .
This is a leadership skill .
If you can influence people to do things you will be able to implement your ideas to improve the company and make a difference for clients , which , in turn , will grow your career .
How do you do this ?
You start by understanding what is important to any given person or work group you are trying to enlist for help .
You must offer them some benefit that ties into those things that are most important to them .
Speak in their language .
And act with integrity .
Fulfill your promises to build trust .
16 . Always Be Learning .
Seek out training and education .
Take night courses .
Read business books and trade magazines .
Learn from your mentors , heroes , and enemies .
And learn from your mistakes .
Make a habit of reflecting on what you learned each day .
And be creative with what you learn .
You may learn something completely unrelated , but perhaps there is a parallel that fosters a new idea to grow business .
Look for these kinds of opportunities .
17 . Self Promotion .
It ’s important to let people know about the good things you are accomplishing .
Do n’t think that by just working hard that you ’ll get noticed .
You need to let people know .
Higher - ups like to know these things because they can’t know everything that is going on , so speak up !
18 . Focus on Excellence .
In everything that you do , do it well .
Dress well .
Be on time .
Deliver on your promises .
Produce high quality work .
In turn your career will manifest in accordance with your focus on excellence .
19 . Recognize Moments of Truth .
Every day you have moments of truth .
The only problem is that there is no dramatic movie music to spur you on to do the right thing .
You must learn to listen to that little angel on your shoulder .
Often no one is watching at a moment of truth .
Do you make those sales calls even though your boss is at an offsite meeting , or do you take the opportunity to leave early and go golfing ?
Which one is going to further your career ?
Do you contact that Vice - President to offer your great idea or do you talk yourself out of it ?
Do you take the additional 30 minutes after work to prepare extra well for an important meeting or do you decide to wing it since you ’ve done this kind of thing before ?
When you consistently do the right thing at many moments of truth , they will add up to a massive positive impact on your career .
20 . Make Others Feel Good .
It ’s the Golden Rule .
Encourage , praise , and support those on your team , and everyone for that matter .
Do n’t fear other people ’s success .
Celebrate it .
Be sincere and demonstrate that by being specific in what you say .
What have been your keys to success in your career ?
Please share !
We ’d love to hear from you !

It 's sad , really sad , to see so many Americans work hard and play by the rules without ever getting ahead .

Firefighter : Giuliani 'ran like a coward on 9/11 ' David Edwards and Adam Doster
Published : Tuesday January 22 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This Families of firefighters killed in the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the World Trade Center rallied in Orlando Tuesday in anticipation of the state 's upcoming Republican primary .
Unfortunately for Presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani , the firefighters are not in his corner .
" We want America to know that [ the Giuliani campaign ] is lying to America and to the American pubic , " said Jim Riches , a deputy chief in the New York Fire Department , " telling all of Florida that the New York City Fire Department backs him , when that 's another lie . "
Firefighters and their families vowed to dog the former New York mayor at all of his Florida campaign stops because the state figures prominently in Giuliani 's big - state primary strategy .
The protesters think that Giuliani was aware that firefighters who responded to the World Trade Center attack were carrying defective radios and did not hear the order to evacuate .
" He did n't prepare us before , during , or after , " says Riches .
Giuliani has campaigned strongly on his leadership during the attacks on New York , claiming he is the best suited to prevent an " Islamic terrorist war against us . "
But the firefighters were quick to question that courage .
" Yeah , the decision he made was , which direction he was going to run , " says Riches .
" And he ran north , and that 's all he did . "
The Giuliani campaign labeled the display a misleading , partisan attack .
The former mayor is also emphasizing his ability to deal with the economy , distancing himself from the 9/11 pitch .

Coal - fired power stations , airport expansions and new road schemes could all be put on hold following a decision by Gordon Brown that ministers must in future take account of the true economic cost of climate change damage .
Ministers have been instructed to factor into their calculations a notional " carbon price " when making all policy and investment decisions covering transport , construction , housing , planning and energy .
That price - which will increase annually - is intended to frame all day - to - day policy and investment decisions for the next 30 years .
As a result carbon - free or clean technologies , including nuclear power , have been given a significant boost as they will now become relatively less expensive than polluting technologies .
The " shadow price for carbon " , representing the cost to society of the environmental damage , has already been agreed for every year up to 2050 by government economists .
It will be set at £ 25.50 a carbon tonne for 2007 , rising annually to £ 59.60 a tonne by 2050 .
The climate change minister , Phil Woolas , said : " This will have huge implications for [ the ] government .
If for instance a new power station is due to cost £ 1bn , but it will add £ 200 m worth of carbon emissions , we will decide that the cost of the power station is £ 1.2bn , even though its cash price is £ 1 bn .
We are creating a new currency . "
In theory the carbon price will create a bias against roads and carbon - emitting coal stations and make new " zero carbon " building regulations appear more economic .
Decisions about investments in new nuclear power stations will be made exclusively by the private sector , but the social carbon price is likely to affect the role of regulators and make them more willing to back nuclear as opposed to other more carbon emitting energy technologies .
It has also been agreed that every major Whitehall policy and investment decision will be monitored over the next year to check that policymakers are actually incorporating the shadow price of carbon .
Woolas said : " This is far bigger than people realise .
It is intellectually thought - through and very tough .
Gordon Brown may not ride a bike , but by god he is showing a lead . "
Tony Juniper , the head of Friends of the Earth , said the " carbon price " could change economic calculations around issues such as a third runway at Heathrow .
He added : " At the moment there are gaping holes in government policy with them professing concern for climate change on one hand , and rushing to expand airports and widen roads on the other .
If this helps to fill in that gap then it has to be a step in the right direction .
Whether it works or not will depend on whether they have set the carbon price high enough . "
The price has been set at a level calculated to ensure the government can meet its major policy target of stabilising carbon emissions at between 450 and 550 parts per million carbon , the figure recommended by the review conducted for the Treasury by Sir Nicholas Stern .
The review found that the costs of addressing climate change now will be cheaper than the costs of doing so later .
The shadow price is partly drawn from new modelling on the scale of the threat posed by climate change and partly by economic work undertaken by McKinseys and the Stern review on behalf of the Treasury on the economic costs of failing to address climate change .
The price is intended to take into account the full global costs of the damage carbon causes over the whole of its time in the atmosphere .
Equivalent values will be used for other greenhouse gases .
A note setting out the government 's thinking prepared in part by the chief economist at the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs , Richard Price , says ministers must refer to the shadow price .
It states : " It is important that the shadow price for carbon is applied consistently and universally across decisions in government with significant implications for emissions of carbon and other greenhouse gases . "
How to build the 2007.12.03 standard workstation
buy the components of the standard workstation ,
assemble them into a working computer , and
install enough software to make the computer useful .
Collecting accessories
To install the operating system you will need a CD with ``ISO image '' ubuntu-7.10 - desktop-amd64.iso ( MD5 checksum 61c87943a92bc7bf519da4e2555d6e86 ) .
You can order this CD from Ubuntu for free ; or you can create the CD using a computer that has an Internet connection ( to download the ISO image ) , a CD burner , and a blank CD .
To configure and use the standard workstation you will need a keyboard , a touchpad / trackball / mouse , a monitor , and an Ethernet cable attached to the Internet .
Collect this equipment for later use .
If you have only one keyboard , mouse , and monitor , and you need those to operate an older computer , you have two options :
Buy a KVM ( keyboard , video , mouse ) switch to attach both computers to the same keyboard , mouse , and monitor .
Buy a new keyboard , touchpad / trackball / mouse , and monitor .
Main features to look for in a monitor : LCD ; both VGA and DVI inputs ( DVI allowing sharper displays ) ; resolution .
You can , for example , buy the Westinghouse L2046NV and a DVI - D cable for $ 230 including shipping .
The L2046NV is a 20 '' VGA / DVI LCD monitor with 1400x1050 resolution .

Variant : dual - core CPU .
The Core 2 Quad has four processing cores , like a 4 - CPU computer .
Switching to a two - core computer means spending less money on the CPU ( currently $ 233 instead of $ 279 ) .
Of course , this also reduces the computer 's speed for parallelizable operations .
Variant : less memory .
The standard workstation has 8GB of RAM ; you can save $ 180 by reducing 8 GB to 2GB .
Non-recommended variant : non-ECC memory .
Make sure to buy ECC DIMMs .
I have a separate page discussing the importance of ECC memory .
Variant : more disk space .
If you have more money to spend , the hard drive is one of the most obvious places to spend it .
For example , you can buy several drives , and store data with parity using software RAID level 5 .
( Parity is an easy - to - use automatic backup mechanism : your latest data is still accessible even if a drive dies .
Three disks with parity can store as much data as two disks without parity . )
Make sure you have enough connectors , cables , and space for your drives .
Non-recommended variant : tape drive .
Extra disks are a much better choice than tapes for backups .
Disks used to be substantially more expensive than tapes , but they 're now less expensive per gigabyte than almost all tapes .
The only exceptions ( 160 GB Super DLT II tapes , about $ 0.18 / gigabyte ; 200GB LTO Ultrium 2 tapes , about $ 0.13 / gigabyte ) require tape drives that cost over $ 1000 .
Even if you have so much data that you do n't mind the cost of a tape drive , investing in tapes is silly : tapes wear out much more quickly than disks ( a heavy - duty tape is rated for , at best , writing a few million gigabytes , which is equivalent to only about two years of disk use ) , and the replacement cost of disks is dropping much more quickly than the replacement cost of tapes .
Of course , disks are also much faster than tapes .

Reporting success
What can any of us do if we do not fully understand the scope of the problem that we are facing ?
If we do not realize the connections between everything monetarily and how economically they all combine to have dire effects for us , than we stand mute unable to speak the truth about what ’s happening .
The Nevada debate awarded to three of the five remaining Democratic candidates for president by General Electric had one thing good come out of it : a question was asked connecting foreign money to home foreclosures .
It brought forward slightly ( I believe ) the idea that outsourcing and offshore tax havens have had an effect on how loans are conducted in America .
It also linked those evasions of American policies to the scandal going on with the subprime loan industry .
It did n’t go any further .
It left Americans like me who are in the dark on the whole scope of the problem with the economy still thinking compartmentally .
It left us unaware that fixing home foreclosures can only happen if you reexamine bankruptcy laws .
It ignored taking a look at the credit card and banking industries , which graciously allow this mess to be wrought upon us all .
It ignored hedge funds , which to tell you the truth I wish I could look my father straight in the face and explain to you how those work but despite all my research , he does not know because I cannot coherently tell him what hedge funds do .
“ It ’s the economy , stupid ” was a fitting phrase during the 1990s and the age of Bill Clinton or Clintonomics .
Now , a better phrase might be , “ It ’s the economy , and I ’m stupid so … ”
And the dot dot dot or ellipses signifies a trailing of thought , a trailing that occurs because we are ashamed that we cannot fight this because we do not understand this and do n’t know how to understand this .
We do n’t know how to convey the scope of this problem to the American people because it is reported to the American people in fragments and connecting it all together makes everything seem like a conspiracy .
Conspiracies do n’t happen in America ( that ’s what the history books children get their education from would like us all to believe , right ? ) .
Without being able to comprehend the scope of the problems with our economy , how can we as a nation know who does and does not out of the field of candidates understand fully the subprime loan scandal and all the other issues with our economy ?
When they tell us they get it , how do we figure out if they do or do not ?
It 's a sad thing to suggest that we are incapable of electing the right man but it's a definite possibility that America has reached a point where we truly are blind to the defects of our leaders .
It 's even possible we do not know what defects look like in a leader anymore .
Having watched Chairman Dennis Kucinich run Domestic Policy Subcommittee hearings on urban America and discuss the economic turmoil we are in , which directly addressed the subprime loan scandal in America , I am almost there .
Having heard of hedge funds numerous times from him in speeches , I think I am getting closer .
And hearing about foreign investment in Dubai having effects here that are not good , I might be just shy of connecting the dots and producing a fine exposé for you all to read .
Connecting the dots via Google or however you seek to gain your information is the best thing we can do if we seek to fix the economic problems in this country .
I have the LexisNexis at my disposal since I am a college student .
Combined , there is no reason I cannot know of the filthiest and dirtiest dealings in America unless the powers that be have succeeded in keeping them hidden .
But for those who do not have Internet or LexisNexis access , where do they go ?
We ’ve uncovered the Poverty of Knowledge in America .
It combines with the Poverty of Understanding and Education in America to allow for mainstream corporate media to be the only source of information we tap into .
That poverty results in Americans not realizing they are n’t being told the full story or not hearing certain stories .
( I also know people who are afraid of the CIA or FBI harassing them if they knew the whole truth and so they are okay with being kept in the dark . )
My uncle did n’t know a New Hampshire recount was happening when it was reported on the Internet it had been awarded to Dennis Kucinich and Albert Howard who would each be paying for it from their campaign funds .
And yet , when I told him , it ’s not like he made the decision to never watch cable news again and just get information from the Internet or some public access television show like Democracy Now ! .
The Poverty of Knowledge and the Poverty of Understanding and Education is perhaps primarily generational but it is also financial .
Those struggling to get by have n’t the time or opportunities to muckrake --- to go through endless amounts of information and put the pieces together for people to think seriously about .
So , it becomes the duty of people like me and you ( if you write articles and get Diggs or Reddits ) to connect dots for them , write about it , and find ways to get our articles or ideas published in the mainstream corporate media .
In my connecting of the dots for others who cannot , I came across the idea that bankruptcy reform bills passed in the past seven years have brought forth this sub - prime loan scandal or made it way worse than it would have been .

The Bush Administration urged the Supreme Court Friday night to rule that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to have a gun for private use , but argued that the D.C. Circuit Court went too far in applying that personal right view .
The appeals court , the new brief said , seems to have adopted a “ more categorical approach ” to gun control laws than is proper .
In a move designed at least in part to protect federal gun laws from being struck down , the new brief urged the Justices to uphold an individual right to a gun and adopt a flexible standard for judging specific laws , and then return the pending test case from the District of Columbia back to the Circuit Court for another look .
Tellingly , the government ’s friend - of - court brief was not labeled as a supporting brief for either side in the case of District of Columbia v. Heller ( 07-290 ) .
The government brief can be downloaded here .
Filed by U.S. Solicitor General Paul D. Clement , the brief took no direct position on the constitutionality of the 1976 D.C. law that is at issue : a flat ban on private possession of handguns .
The Circuit Court , in a ruling last March , struck down the law , finding that it violates the Second Amendment on the understanding that the Amendment protects an individual , not a collective , right .
Clement did comment that the D.C. pistol ban “ may well fail ” if tested under the approach he recommended , but he did not argue that it would necessarily fail .
“ The Court , ” Clement summed up at the close of the brief , “ should affirm that the Second Amendment , no less than other provisions of the Bill of Rights , secures an individual right , and should clarify that the right is subject to the more flexible standard of review described above .
If the Court takes those foundational steps , the better course would be to remand [ to the Circuit Court} . ”
The “ more flexible standard of review ” the brief proposed is , according to the government , a form of “ heightened scrutiny . ”
Here is how it is spelled out :
“ When , as here , a law directly limits the private possession of ‘ Arms ’ in a way that has no grounding in Framing - era practice , the Second Amendment requires that the law be subject to heightened scrutiny that considers ( a ) the practical impact of the challenged restrictions on the plaintiff ’s ability to possess firearms for lawful purposes ( which depends in turn on the nature and functional adequacy of available alternatives ) , and ( b ) the strength of the government ’s interest in enforcement of the relevant restriction . ”
The brief added : “ Under that intermediate level of review , the ‘ rigorousness ’ of the inquiry depends on the degree of the burden on protected conduct , and important regulatory intgerests are typically sufficient to justify reasonable restrictions . ”
The D.C. handgun ban , the brief contended , is the kind of gun control that would call for the kind of “ close scrutiny ” being proposed .
That law , it said , bans “ a commonly - used and commonly - possessed firearm in a way that has no grounding in the Framing - era practice . ”
The Circuit Court , Clement commented , “ appears to have adopted a more categorical approach ” that he was advocating .
The Circuit Court decision , he said , “ could be read to hold that the Second Amendment categorically prohibits any ban on a category of ‘ Arms ’ that can be traced back to the Founding era .
If adopted by this Court , such an analysis could cast doubt on the constitutionality of existing federal legislation prohibiting the possession of certain firearms , including machineguns .
However , the text and history of the Second Amendment point to a more flexible standard of review . ”
The brief continued : “ Just as the Second Congress expressed judgments about what ‘ Arms ’ were appropriate for certain members of the militia , Congress today retains discretion in regulating ‘ Arms , ’ including those with military uses , in ways that further legitimate government interests .
Under an appropriate standard of review , existing federal regulations , such as the prohibition on machineguns , readily pass constitutional muster . ”
Some machineguns that are banned by federal law might meet the D.C. law ’s definition of a pistol , the brief said .
It was not at all surprising that the Administration brief supported the individual rights view of the Amendment ’s scope .
Although the Justice Department had taken no part in the lower courts as they weighed the D.C. gun ban , then - Attorney General John Ashcroft in 2001 publicly adopted the individual rights view .
And neither was it a surprise that the position the Department took was motivated at least in considerable part by the felt need to assure continued enforcement of some federal gun control laws .
Even though the government for more than six years has held the individual rights view of the Amendment , it has yet to take a position in a court case that a particular gun law was invalid under that view .
In arguing in the end that the case should be returned to the Circuit Court , Clement ’s brief said that there are factual and legal issues that the lower court did not consider in its March ruling .
It suggested that one issue that deserves further airing is the practical impact of another part of the D.C. gun law that requires that any other kind of firearm kept in the home be kept unloaded or with a trigger lock in place .
The local man who challenged the gun law has argued that the trigger lock provision may bar a resident of the city from even having a working shotgun or rifle at home .
Whether the law puts a “ functional firearm ” out of local residents ’ reach , the government brief said , may depend on whether the local law can be read to allow possession at home of a working long gun .
If the law can be read that way , there would then arise , Clement suggested , the factual issue of whether the guns that remained available are not as well suited to self - defense in the home as a handgun would be .
Those questions , the brief said , are better left , in the first instance , to the lower courts .
In a footnote at the end of the brief , Clement suggested that , if the Circuit Court ultimately held that some or all of the D.C. gun law ’s restrictions are unconstitutional , “ a remand will also give that court the opportunity to state more precisely the scope of its remedial holding ” — that is , just what parts of the law are being invalidated .
Friday was the due day for friend - of - court briefs by groups supporting the D.C. government ’s appeal in the case , or briefs by anyone joining in the case without taking sides with either the local government or with the gun law challengers .
As of Friday night , 19 briefs had been filed to support the District of Columbia appeal .
Briefs by the gun law ’s challengers , and friend - of - court briefs supporting that side , are due in about a month .
The case is expected to be heard by the Court in March .
In response to consumer complaints posted in the company 's official forum , Canadian ISP Bell Sympatico has admitted that it uses bandwidth throttling technologies to impose limitations on peer - to - peer ( P2P ) file - sharing during peak hours .
This revelation is further evidence that net neutrality — the principle of equal treatment for all traffic through a network — is eroding .
" [ W]e are now using a Internet Traffic Management to restrict accounts that are using a large portion of bandwidth during peak hours , " a Sympatico forum administrator wrote in response to a user complaint .
The forum administrator also provides a list of affected applications , which includes BitTorrent , Gnutella , Limewire , Kazaa , and other widely - used P2P applications .
Readers of Broadband Reports had been suspicious for some time that the ISP was throttling traffic .
" Bell Sympatico has launched a solution to enhance the online customer experience and improve Internet performance for all our customers during peak periods of Internet usage with the introduction of Internet Traffic Management , " another response says .
" There continues to be phenomenal growth of consumer Internet traffic throughout the world , and Bell is using Internet Traffic Management to ensure we deliver bandwidth fairly to our customers during peak Internet usage . "
The rhetoric issued by Sympatico in defense of bandwidth throttling resembles Comcast 's recent defense of similar practices .
The ISPs claim that bandwidth throttling leads to a better Internet experience for customers .
As numerous advocacy groups have pointed out in response to such claims , bandwidth throttling and other kinds of discriminatory content filtering fundamentally change the nature of the Internet to the detriment of consumers .
Selectively blocking transmission of content hardly constitutes a valid means of improving the Internet experience .
The bandwidth throttling practices used by these companies are made more egregious by the secrecy surrounding the precise nature of what gets blocked and when .
In the official Sympatico forum , the company representatives who admit that bandwidth throttling is occurring are declining to respond to questions about the extent of the throttling or the conditions that Sympatico uses to determine whose connectivity to degrade .
Some ISPs , like Comcast , actively punish employees for disclosing such information to the public .
P2P is thought to make up between 30 and 50 percent of all Internet traffic .
Many consumers who pay more for faster Internet connectivity do so because they want faster P2P service .
The increasing number of foreign and domestic Internet service providers that use bandwidth throttling is sure to provide ammunition to those who believe some sort of government intervention will be necessary to ensure that broadband subscribers have full and unfettered access to any application , any site , any time .
At just three weeks old these kittens have already been reserved
US biotech firm Allerca says it has managed to selectively breed them by reducing a certain type of protein that triggers allergic reactions .
The company says the animals will not cause the red eyes , sneezing and even asthma triggered by cat allergy , except in the most acute cases .
Despite costing $ 3,950 ( £ 2,104 ) , there is already a waiting list to get one .
Allerca first started taking orders for hypoallergenic cats back in 2004 .
No genetic modification
It tested huge numbers of cats trying to find the tiny fraction that do not carry the glycoprotein Fel d1 - contained in an animal 's saliva , fur and skin - which often prompts an allergic reaction in humans .
Those cats were then selectively bred to produce the hypoallergenic kittens now on sale , the company says .
The company 's Steve May told the BBC that it was a natural , if time consuming , method .
" This is a natural gene divergence within the cat DNA - one out of 50,000 cats will have this natural divergence , " he said .
" So candidates - natural divergent cats - were found and then bred so there is really no modification of the gene . "
The BBC's Pascale Harter says there could soon be a global market for the kittens - in the US alone 38 million households own a cat , and around the world an estimated 35 % of humans suffer from allergies .

People have been hunched over their PCs , firing rockets into the faces of their friends since Doom .
The ability to play a game against real human opponents via a network changed the face of the industry and helped shape the scene we are now a part of .
Over the years , we have seen the world 's largest network , the Internet , expand to phenomenal heights and with it , gaming too has grown in ways that were once never thought possible .
Gaming over the Internet is now a major part of the hobby we all hold dear , and as titles like Halo rose to bring more and more mainstream attention to multinational fragests , we have seen online gaming become one of the most integral facets of the industry .
With mainstream attention , it has also brought with an influx of new , fresh - faced gamers who have logged on with wanton abandon , unwitting of the rules that we have held dear as digital war veterans for millenias untold .
At least outside of the PC universe , online gaming is full of people who perhaps do not understand the ettiquete and courtesy that comes with the territory .
For these people , Destructoid has the answer .
If your copy of Halo just hit your mailbox , or even more urgently , if you started playing online years ago and have never even been through basic training , this is the guide for you .
Hit the jump to finally learn how to be an online gamer with these crucial rules .
A doorway into a world of elite playing pleasure is yours for the opening .
1 : Online gaming is serious business :
So , you finally got your game hooked up and are ready to play .
Now , you may be forgiven for thinking that online gaming is about having fun .
You are very wrong and you will learn this in due time .
Because we gamers are too physically weak to pick random fights in bars , we must assert our alpha male dominance another way -- by twiddling our fingers around on buttons until virtual representations of people we do n't know simulate death .
This is your life now , and you are connected , physically and emotionally , to your in - game avatar .
When they frag you , do you not bleed ?
Well , no you do n't but that 's not the point .
You will mourn him for every second of that respawn countdown .
His digital death just killed a little piece of you , and you will avenge with the fury of a thousand angry Gods .
In team games , if you are losing , remember to berate your teammates and tell them how much they suck .
You wo n't be making a fool out of yourself for ordering them around and reminding them that your side is losing and nobody 's helping you win .
Also , you must use words like " alpha , " all the time , just like you 're a real army man !
2 : Noobs are scum :
People who are new to a particular game are terrible vermin who you should not fraternise with .
These subhumans are known as noobs and they are the pariahs of online gaming .
You , however , were never a noob .
You were playing games online before the Internet was even invented .
In fact , you 're so awesome that you were playing Dizzy the Egg team deatchmatches on your Commodore 64 .
Make sure to check out the stats of anybody in a game with you .
If they have not been playing for long , then you must hurl insults at them because they are lesser human beings .
Laugh cruelly if noobs are your opponents , and grimace loudly if they are on your team .
Also , the term noob has such power that if you dislike someone 's actions in a game , you can say it to them as well .
Obviously , displeasing you is deadly enough to make them forget all their prior gaming experience and they actually revert back into children .
3 : If a feature in a game is popular / effective , it is cheap :
Be it the chainsaw in Gears of War , or snipers in any FPS ever made , there are a number of cool features and tactics in games that people not only find enjoyable to use , but are often highly effective methods of securing victory -- never use them .
If you do so , you are cheap and will become a noob .
You are a hardcore gamer now , which means you only use shotguns or anything else that 's really boring .
You hate all that is popular , and if you see anybody utilising the best / more useful features of a game , you are to get rid of them immediately .
If these pukes were good at the game like you , they would n't need to rely on such cheap tactics , would they ?
They'd be like you , running around with the shotgun , not having fun and despising everything everyone else is doing .
The fact that they have killed you so many times is proof of how bad they are at playing .
4 : If anything kills you at all , it is cheap :
Like the above rule , but applied to every potential threat in a game .
If someone shoots you to death using nothing but a pistol and with his eyes closed , he is being cheap .
Cheap is one of the most brutal insults after noob , and anybody who hears it will feel worse about the fact they are winning ten to zero .
It 's a hollow victory , because they are so cheap .
5 : If you are losing , it is because of lag :
Following on from the cheapness laws , you will soon get to learn that nothing is ever your fault when it comes to gaming .
Lag is a process whereby everyone in the game becomes better than you thanks to the Internet helping them become cheap .
The Internet does this a lot , but never affects the enemies you kill yourself , because you have skills .
Nearly every death you ever suffer in a game will be due to lag of some kind .
The Internet hates you that much , even though you are so good .
6 : If you are losing badly , it is because they are hacking :
Losing a little is one thing , that 's just lag conspiring to keep your ownage levels down , but lag can only help the noobs cheaply beat you so much .
If you are losing to such a point where not even your lag - pwning skill seems to be making a difference , well there 's only one solution , and it's not that they are better than you -- it 's that they are hacking .
People who appear to be doing a lot of killing and not much of being killed are hackers , plain and simple .
There is no way they 're that good without cheating .
Re-assure your team ( after calling them worthless ) that the enemy is clearly powered by nefarious undertakings and you are being penalized for your wholesome and pure ways .
Then remember to say alpha .
7 : Everyone is gay :
Before the Internet was invented , gay people were those in society who were attracted physically and emotionally to members of the same gender .
Since the Internet , everyone and everything is gay .
From the gun they use to kill you , to the voice they use to communicate with you , it is all gay , gay , gay .
Lag is gay , snipers are gay , noobs are gay , people from other countries are gay , the countries they come from are gay , the ocean the country is surrounded by is gay , the fish in the ocean are gay , all sealife is gay , life is gay , gays are gay , gay gay gay .
Gay .
Using the same one - syllable word to describe everything you do n't like might not be an indicator of a varied vocabulary , but who cares ?
Words are gay .
8 : Singing is awesome :
Communicating via a headset is great because it lets gamers sing , and that is one of the only reasons we buy headsets .
In fact , some people are known to log into servers just to hear poor quality , nasal renditions of the latest " phat tracks . "
One of the most original and beloved songs to sing is anything done by Rick Astley .
Try to sing as loudly and obnoxiously as you can into your headset before , during and after a game , only stopping when you need to step away from the mic to breathe .
Everybody will be impressed and will want to play with you again .
In fact , you 're so great at singing that the only reason you 're not on Broadway right now is that showbusiness is full of lag .
If you lack the raw sexual magnetisim and confidence that is required to sing during a game , you can always hold the microphone up to some speakers and play your favorite tunes for everybody .
Your fellow gamers really care what your musical interests are and will applaud your tasteful selection of tracks .
9 : Calling people naggers is both original and hilarious :
Racism online is bad , which is a shame because deep down everybody knows it 's actually awesome .
There is , however , a really witty workaround that allows you to say racist words while not actually saying them .
Remember that episode of South Park where Randy believed that the missing letter in " n - ggers " was an I ?
Then he said the full word and everyone was shocked because it was actually naggers and not that word ?
Well , here 's a pro tip -- nobody has EVER thought of calling people naggers online .
You are going to be so edgy if you capitalize on this opportunity .
Do it all the time and your popularity will skyrocket .
10 : Team members who score are kill stealers :
Kill stealing is one of the most abhorrent and despicable crimes ever committed , and is even listed in some modern Bibles as the eighth deadly sin .
Every opponent is a victim waiting to die by your hand alone , and if anybody dares shoot them before you , they are a kill stealer .
Only you may have the glory of the kill , and woe betide anybody caught shooting at the same target as you .
If they get the win , they clearly stole your kill .
Even if you and a team member are on opposite sides of the game map , they kill stole .
Obviously they did .
Probably thanks to a hack .
Just remember , of course , that you are not a kill stealer .
You are merely an opportunist .
Besides which , since all the enemies are your personal fodder anyway , you 're taking nothing away from the meat puppets who are only there to be noobs and bring down your score by sucking .
These are the ten golden rules of online gaming .
There are of course plenty of other important laws , but this should be everything you need to get started off on the right footing .
First impressions are crucial , and with these ten rules in mind , you will always impress .
Good luck pwning , my fellow online warriors .
May noobs fall at your feet and your sword cut through the mists of lag forevermore .
YANGON , Myanmar ( CNN ) -- Soldiers reportedly fired into crowds and beat Buddhist monks Thursday , and state media said nine people were killed as Myanmar 's military rulers continued its crackdown on anti-government demonstrations .
Witnesses ' accounts of other deaths , including a university student , could not be confirmed in this Southeastern Asian country formerly known as Burma , the site of massive protests this week led by Buddhist monks pushing for democracy .
One witness told CNN monks were at the front of a march in the capital , Yangon , as soldiers waded into it Thursday , while other reports indicated attempts to keep monks off the streets on Thursday .
An American witness said soldiers beat several protesters mercilessly , at least one of them to death .
" The police and military guys started coming toward the crowd , and all of a sudden started beating them and running after them , " said the woman , requesting anonymity .
She said she witnessed the violence from a nearby building .
" And in one corner they got around , maybe , five or seven people , and they started beating them so bad for almost five minutes , and then they took them and put them in trucks . "
The troops left one person dead on the ground , she said , and they returned a few minutes later to retrieve the body .
" It was a crowd of , I would say , around 2,000 people , between 2,000 and 3,000 people today , and they ... put 10 monks in front of them as a human shield .
But the police did n't care .
They just came and started even beating the monks , " she said .
She added the monks escaped to safety
But from his vantage point in Yangon 's western section , Swedish Embassy official Johan Hallenborg said he could not see any of the red-robed Buddhist monks who led demonstrators on previous days .
" What we heard was that the police and the military have gone in and have contained monks in their temples , " Hallenborg said .
" I can't confirm how many , but it seems the monks are arrested or confined in the pagodas . "
Opposition Web sites and blogs showed images of disheveled monasteries with broken windows and blood on the floor .
" This morning , around noon , we went around the city , and we saw that most of the monasteries were locked and we saw some of the monks inside , " the American witness said .
Democratic Voice of Burma reported that civilians blocked troops who returned to Ngway Kyar Yan monastery Thursday to arrest the abbot .
" The military is surrounding the monastery and firing warning shots to disperse the crowds , but people are standing firm , " said a bystander , according to the Democratic Voice of Burma .

Unconfirmed reports said five monks were killed during the day Wednesday .
The government imposed a 6 p.m. - 6 a.m. curfew and banned gatherings of more than five people , the U.S. Embassy said .
At 6 p.m. Thursday , streets that had been jammed with as many as 100,000 protesters were deserted , the American witness said .
" Right now it 's a ghost town .
... Everybody is so afraid , " she said .
" These people need help , " the woman said .
" It 's inhumane what 's happening here . "
Gunfire broke out when troops confronted thousands of demonstrators who had marched from Yangon 's center to its eastern Tamwe township Thursday afternoon , opposition Web site Irrawaddy.org reported .
Two contingents of troops sealed the huge crowds off and then opened fire , the report said .
A Japanese journalist was among those shot and killed Thursday , the Japanese Foreign Ministry and the man 's employer said .
An executive with Japanese news agency APF said Kenji Nagai , 50 , was in a crowd of protesters when he was shot .
His body was carried to a hospital , where a Japanese consular official confirmed his identity , said the executive , who got his information from the Foreign Ministry .
Nagai , an independent video journalist under contract with APF , entered the country Tuesday to cover the protests , the news agency executive said .
Japan 's Foreign Ministry planned to summon the Myanmar ambassador to appeal to the junta to halt the violence , the Kyodo news agency reported .
Aye Chan Naing , chief editor of the Democratic Voice of Burma , said Thursday " seems to be the most violent day throughout the demonstrations , " which unfolded in mid-August in response to higher gas prices in the country .

In a phone call from the heart of the protests , a Myanmar citizen who asked not to be named for security reasons described a deteriorating scene in the streets .
" People are shot and they are running .
The soldiers shoot the people .
...
Some people are walking on the street and shouting , " she said , adding she witnessed government troops shooting a man .
" No one can help us .
We have no weapons , " she said .
The military junta " have weapons , and they are doing what they want .
We have no rights . "
Meanwhile , on its state - run Web site , the government offered its own account of Wednesday 's protests .
" The members of the security forces fired some shots , employing the least force to disperse the mob , " the government said .
An " unidentified man , 30 , was killed " and three people were wounded and treated at Yangon General Hospital , the statement said .
Also , eight police officers -- including two senior officials -- sustained injuries , it said .
According to the government , security officials were provoked into violence after their attempts to disperse the crowd peacefully failed .
All About Myanmar • Yangon

“ DUMB and Dumber ” , one of the modern classics of American comedy , tells the story of an affable idiot , Lloyd Christmas , who falls in love with a classy beauty , Mary Swanson .
In one scene he asks her the chances of “ a guy like you and a girl like me ” ending up together .
The answer is “ Not good ” .
“ Not good like one out of a hundred ? ” asks Lloyd .
“ More like one out of a million , ” Mary replies .
Lloyd pauses for a moment , then shoots back , “ So you 're telling me there 's a chance ? ”
That is the American spirit .
Americans have traditionally been much more optimistic than Europeans , and happier too .
They believe that people determine their own destinies rather than being the mere playthings of fate .
They also believe that their children will have a better life than they do .
This helps to explain the dynamism of the American economy .
Americans regard failure — even bankruptcy — as a stone in the road rather than a damning verdict .
It also helps to explain the appeal of the American experiment .
“ The American , by nature , is optimistic , ” JFK once said .
“ He is experimental , an inventor and a builder who builds best when called upon to build greatly . ”
Europeans ask , “ Why ? ” Americans ask , “ Why not ? ”
But the past five years have produced a dramatic souring in the country 's mood .
Three - quarters of Americans now think that the country is “ on the wrong track ” .
The number of people who are hostile to trade and immigration has risen sharply , as has the number who think that America should engage less in world affairs .
Trust in government is half what it was in 2001 .
Both the president and Congress have bargain - basement approval ratings .
And people are increasingly pessimistic about the future .
Barely a third thinks that their children will be better off than they themselves are .
The reason why the man with the message of hope , Barack Obama , and the man who hails from Hope , Mike Huckabee , are doing so well is that people think hope is in short supply .
There are good reasons for this pessimism .
People are tired of the Bush administration , with its partisanship and incompetence .
The Iraq war has shattered America 's image of itself as a mighty but good - hearted giant .
Iraq means chaos and Abu Ghraib rather than the triumphant export of democracy .
The war may be going better of late , but the majority of Americans still think that it was not worth the fighting , and the bad news about the economy is burying the good news about the “ surge ” .
Americans are accustomed to thinking of their houses as pots of gold ( and pots of gold that can be remortgaged when you need a bit of extra cash ) .
The gold is now turning into lead .
This is creating a bull market in pessimism .
The likes of Bill O'Reilly and Lou Dobbs have transformed themselves into cable stars by ranting about cultural decay and “ broken borders ” .
Patrick Buchanan 's latest book is called “ Day of Reckoning : How Hubris , Ideology and Greed are Tearing America Apart ” .
“ We are on a path to national suicide , ” he says .
America is not just “ coming apart ” , but also “ decomposing ” .
There is certainly no shortage of bad news .
But coming apart ?
Decomposing ?
The current issue of Commentary — a magazine hardly noted for its sunny disposition — contains an excellent article , “ Crime , Drugs , Welfare and Other Good News ” by Peter Wehner ( a former senior White House aide ) and Yuval Levin , which shows why Mr Buchanan is talking through his hat .
Both violent crime and property crime have declined dramatically since 1973 .
New York City will probably notch up less than 500 murders this year , the lowest since the early 1960s ( the figure for 1990 was 2,262 ) .
Teenagers are cleaning up their act .
Teenage drug use has fallen by 23 % overall since the 1990s , and by 50 % for LSD and ecstasy .
Teens are drinking less , smoking less , having sex less and dropping out of school less .
The birth rate for 15 - 19 - year - olds has fallen by 35 % since 1991 .
At 10 % , the high - school drop - out rate is at a 30 - year low .
Welfare reform is working .
The welfare caseload has dropped by 60 % since 1994 .
A series of social evils — overall poverty , child poverty , child hunger — have all decreased .
Employment figures for single mothers have surged .
The number of abortions fell from over 1.6 m in 1990 to fewer than 1.3 m this year .
The divorce rate is at its lowest level since 1970 .
Education scores are up .
Things are not all hunky - dory .
The violent crime rate has ticked upward in the past couple of years .
Illegitimacy is at an all - time high .
But this is a very different world from the 1970s , when America 's leading cultural indicators all started to point towards Gomorrah .
American civil society , aided by sensible social policies , is gradually repairing the damage of the past few decades .
Lighten up , Pat
What about Mr Buchanan 's particular bugbear , immigration ?
For all the passion that this is igniting , America is blessedly free from the alienated immigrant populations that so trouble France and other European countries .
America still has a genius for employing and assimilating newcomers .
English classes are crammed and English - language tuition is a giant business .
And America 's ability to suck in and assimilate immigrants is part of a bigger and better story .
European economies face profound long - term problems because of their citizens ' reluctance to reproduce .
Americans have the highest fertility rate of any rich country .
That is a long - term vote of confidence in the country 's future .
In fact , Americans have always had a vigorous tradition of pessimism , in counterpoint to the optimistic one .
In 1819 John Adams worried about the duration of “ our vast American Empire ” .
In 1948 Richard Hofstadter complained that “ competition and opportunity ” had gone into decline and that Americans were looking “ wistfully back toward a golden age ” .
Much of today 's pessimism may prove as unfounded .
Americans should rediscover the spirit of Lloyd Christmas , idiot though he was .
At least 12 churches and prayer houses in rural areas were torched and a Congress parliamentarian 's house was attacked in violence for the fourth consecutive day in Orissa 's tribal - dominated Kandhamal district on Thursday .
Miscreants ransacked and torched over a dozen churches and prayer halls at G Udaygiri , Nuagaon , Brahmanigaon and Phulbani Sadar , while the residence of Rajya Sabha Congress lawmaker RadhaKant Nayak was ransacked in Dasingbadi , the police said .
Saffron activists and Kui tribals , opposing tribal status to Christians belonging to Scheduled Caste ' Pana ' group joined hands , with clashes breaking out at Brahmanigaon in Daringbadi area .
" Fresh incidents of arson and clashes were reported from Brahmanigaon and extra forces were sent to control the situation , " District Collector Bhabagrahi Mohapatra said .
Curfew was in force in Phulbani and Baliguda towns besides Daringibadi and Brahmanigaon areas , he said .
CM says situation is normal :
Claiming that the situation was improving in violence - hit Kandhamal district , Orissa Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik said over 24 persons had been arrested for rioting and arson .
" Action is being taken against the culprits , " Patnaik , who visited the Kandhamal district headquarters town of Phulbani early in the day , told reporters on his return to Bhubaneswar .
" I was informed that the situation is improving , " he said .
Three senior IAS officers , some IPS officers and other officers were stationed in the district to monitor the situation , he said .
Patnaik said one person had died in the clashes .
He , however , did not divulge how many churches or prayer houses were burnt in the last four days .
Patnaik denied that the government was taking a ' soft ' stand towards VHP activists allegedly involved in the violence .

White House scrubs site in attempt to make office ' exempt ' Nick Juliano

The White House has scrubbed its
Web site of evidence it has reversed its policies on allowing public access to information to which it is legally entitled .
However , a source told RAW STORY that the scrub would have no legal implications .
Sometime over the weekend , White House computer technicians removed from government Web sites any references to the Office of Administration or its previous compliance with Freedom of Information Act requests .
Where visitors once just found information about how to file public records requests or view annual reports on the Office of Administration 's FOIA compliance , the White House has appended the following admonition : " The Office of Administration , whose sole function is to advise and assist the President , and which has no substantial independent authority , is not subject to FOIA and related authorities .
However , these pages have been maintained due to the Presidential Records Act . "
Two other sites that previously listed the OA as subject to FOIA regulations have since been updated to reflect the opposite position , with similar stark denials of public accessibility at the top of each page .
The White House scrub has no legal implications , a source familiar with the case told RAW STORY .
The office previously had a set of FOIA protocols and handled FOIA requests , and the lastest changes do n't reverse those positions .
Besides , in the digital age , making information disappear down the Memory Hole is not as easy as the administration might like .
The move appears to be a direct response to claims first launched by a private watchdog group that the Bush administration is trying to subvert long - standing open - government policies in order to insulate itself politically .
The White House 's attempt to erase the policies was discovered on the same day Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington submitted a new brief in its FOIA lawsuit seeking information on five million missing e-mails sent by the president 's advisers on Republican Party - owned accounts .
CREW first documented the White House efforts Tuesday , and like Winston Smith 's protecting a photograph from the Memory Hole in George Orwell 's 1984 , CREW has maintained records of the White House 's previous policy .
A Justice Department Web site , which CREW previously pointed to as contradicting the administration 's claims , still lists a phone number for Office of Administration FOIA officer Carol Ehrlich .
RAW STORY 's attempts to reach Ehrlich were unsuccessful Tuesday .
After calling the number listed on the DOJ site , a reporter was transferred three times before being given a separate number that rang to Ehrlich 's voicemail .
A message was not immediately returned .
It is the greatest game in the history of chess .
The sheer number of ideas , the complexity , and the contribution it has made to chess make it the most important game ever played .
- Garry Kasparov ( World Chess Champion ) in a Reuters interview conducted during his 1999 game against the World
In 1999 , world chess champion Garry Kasparov , widely acknowledged as the greatest player in the history of the game , agreed to participate in a chess match sponsored by Microsoft , playing against “ the World ” .
One move was to be made each 24 hours , with the World ’s move being decided by a vote ; anyone at all was allowed to vote on the World Team ’s next move .
The game was staggering .
After 62 moves of innovative chess , in which the balance of the game changed several times , the World Team finally resigned .
Kasparov revealed that during the game he often could n’t tell who was winning and who was losing , and that it was n’t until after the 51st move that the balance swung decisively in his favour .
After the game , Kasparov wrote an entire book about it .
He claimed to have expended more energy on this one game than on any other in his career , including world championship games .
What is particularly amazing is that although the World Team had input from some very strong players , none were as strong as Kasparov himself , and the average quality was vastly below Kasparov ’s level .
Yet , collectively , the World Team produced a game far stronger than one might have expected from any of the individuals contributing , indeed , one of the strongest games ever played in history .
Not only did they play Kasparov at his best , but much of the deliberation about World Team strategy and tactics was public , and so accessible to Kasparov , an advantage he used extensively .
Imagine that not only are you playing Garry Kasparov at his best , but that you also have to explain in detail to Kasaparov all the thinking that goes into your moves !
How was this remarkable feat achieved ?
It is worth noting that another “ Grandmaster versus the world ” game was played prior to this game , in which Grandmaster and former world champion Anatoly Karpov crushed the World Team .
However , Kasparov versus the World used a very different system to co-ordinate the World Team ’s efforts .
Partially through design , and partially through good luck , this system enabled the World Team to co-ordinate their efforts far better than in the earlier game .
The basic idea used was that anyone in the world could register a vote for their preferred next move .
The move taken was whichever garnered the most votes .
Microsoft did not release detailed statistics , but claimed that on a typical move more than 5000 people voted .
Furthermore , votes came from people at all levels of chess excellence , from chess grandmasters to rank amateurs .
On one move , Microsoft reported that 2.4 percent of the votes were cast for moves that were not merely bad , but actually illegal !
On other occasions moves regarded as obviously bad by experts obtained up to 10 percent of the vote .
Over the course of the match , approximately 50,000 individuals from more than 75 countries participated in the voting .
Critical to the experiment were several co-ordinating devices that enabled the World Team to act more coherently .
An official game forum was set up by Microsoft so that people on the World Team could discuss and co-ordinate their ideas .
Microsoft appointed four official advisors to the World Team .
These were outstanding teenage chess players , including two ranked as grandmasters , all amongst the best of their age in the world , although all were of substantially lower caliber than Kasparov .
These four advisors agreed to provide advice to the World Team , and to make public recommendations on what move to take next .
In addition these formal avenues of advice , as the game progressed various groups around the world began to offer their own commentary and advice .
Particuarly influential , although not always heeded , was the GM school , a strong Russian chess club containing several grandmasters .
Most of these experts ignored the discussion taking place on the game forum , and made no attempt to engage with the vast majority of people making up the World Team , i.e. , the people whose votes would actually decide the World ’s moves .
However , one of the World Team ’s advisors did make an effort to engage the World Team .
This was an extraordinary young chess player named Irina Krush .
Fifteen years old , Krush had recently become the US Women ’s chess champion .
Although not as highly rated as two of the other World Team advisors , or as some of the grandmasters offering advice to the World Team , Krush was certainly in the international elite of junior chess players .
Unlike her expert peers , Krush focused considerable time and attention on the World Team ’s game forum .
Shrugging off flames and personal insults , she worked to extract the best ideas and analysis from the forum , as well as building up a network of strong chess - playing correspondents , including some of the grandmasters now offering advice .
Simultaneously , Krush built a publicly accessible analysis tree , showing possible moves and countermoves , and containing the best arguments and refutations for different lines of play , both from the game forum , and from her correspondence with others , including the GM school .
This analysis tree enabled the World Team to focus its attention much more effectively , and served as a reference point for discussion , for further analysis , and for voting .
As the game went on , Krush ’s role on the World Team gradually became more and more pivotal , despite the fact that according to their relative rankings , Kasparov would ordinarily have beaten Krush easily , unless he made a major blunder .
Part of the reason for this was the quality of Krush ’s play .
On move 10 , Krush suggested a completely novel move that Kasparov called “ A great move , an important contribution to chess ” , and which all expert analysts agree blew the game wide open , taking it into uncharted chess territory .
This raised her standing with the World Team , and helped her assume a coordinating role .
Between moves 10 and 50 Krush ’s recommended move was always played by the World Team , even when it disagreed with the recommendations of the other three advisors to the World Team , or with influential commentators such as the GM school .
As a result , some people have commented that the game was really Kasparov versus Krush , and Kasparov himself has claimed that he was really playing Smart Chess , Krush ’s management team .
Krush has repudiated this point of view , commenting on how important many other people ’s input was to her recommendations .
It seems likely that a more accurate picture is that Krush was at the center of the co-ordination effort for the World Team , and so had a better sense of the best overall recommendation made by the members of the World Team .
Other , ostensibly stronger players were n’t as aware of all these different points of view , and so did n’t make as good decisions about what move to make next .
Krush ’s coordinating role brought the best ideas of all contributors into a single coherent whole , weeding out bad moves from the good .
As the game went on , much stronger players began to channel their ideas through her , including one of the strongest players from the GM school , Alexander Khalifman .
The result was that the World Team emerged stronger than any individual player , indeed , arguably stronger than any player in history with the exception of Kasparov at his absolute peak , and with the advantage of being able to see the World “ thinking ” out loud as they deliberated the best course of action .
Kasparov versus the World is a fascinating case study in the power of collective collaboration .
Most encouragingly for us , Kasparov versus the World provides convincing evidence that large groups of people acting in concert can solve creative problems well beyond the reach of any of them alone .
More practically , Kasparov versus the World suggests the value of providing centralized repositories of information which can serve as reference points for decision making and for the allocation of effort .
Krush ’s analysis tree was critical to the co-ordination of the World Team .
It prevented duplication of effort on the part of the World Team , who did n’t have to chase down lines of play known to be poor , and acted as a reference point for discussion , for further analysis , and for voting .
Finally , Kasparov versus the World suggests the value of facilitators who act to channel community opinion .
These people must have the respect of the community , but they need not be the strongest individual contributor .
If such facilitators are flexible and responsive ( without being submissive ) , they can co-ordinate and focus community opinion , and so build a whole stronger than any of its parts .

The Iranian government wants to maintain Islamic values
The Ministry for Culture and Islamic Guidance said illegal studios would be closed and rap singers " confronted " .
An official condemned rappers for using very vulgar words , but it was not clear if the whole genre was being banned .
Rap music in Farsi is increasingly popular among young men in Tehran , with lyrics covering political , social and sexual themes .
Iranians wanting to record an album or stage a concert need to get official permission .
Some songs are approved by the ministry , but most are circulated through a growing underground market for rap .
The culture ministry official , Mohammad Dashtgoli , was quoted by the official Irna news agency as saying he wanted to " find a solution " to internet distribution of the music .
Iranian rappers are inspired by the Iranian exile community in Los Angeles - one of the main centres of American rap .
Young Iranian singers are trying to replicate the accents and subject material used by many US artists .
" Decadence " targeted
The campaign is the latest attempt by the Iranian authorities to stop Western values gaining ground at the expense of traditional Islamic morality , correspondents say .
Earlier this month Iranian newspapers printed a list of vices that the police would target , including " decadent " films , drugs and alcohol .
But their main focus appears to be women wearing make - up and using hats instead of headscarves .
In the last six months , tens of thousands of women have been warned or arrested because of their clothes .
The Iranian Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has publicly backed the police action .

A bloodsucking tropical worm could hold the key to combating allergies , scientists believe .
Hook worms are thought to produce a substance that calms the overactive immune response behind our allergies .
They are already being tested on asthma patients , to see if they can ease their symptoms .
And in time the half - inch - long parasites could be used to treat a range of diseases linked to flaws in the immune system , such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis .
Today , the therapy is still in the trial stage - and is not for the squeamish .
Attached to the arm with a sticking plaster , the worms burrow through the skin and move via the bloodstream and lungs into the gut .
Here they latch on to the wall and produce the substance , which is thought to be their way of switching off the parts of the immune system designed to get rid of them .
The Nottingham University scientists were inspired by years of work showing that those infected by hook worms do not suffer allergies .
They tested the parasites , commonly found in Asia and Africa , on at least 25 volunteers in two trials .
The first trial , in which volunteers had up to 100 worms wriggle into their gut , determined that ten worms could be given without sideeffects such as diarrhoea .
The second , involving hayfever sufferers , showed that the creatures do not increase breathing problems as they travel through the lungs .
The findings offer hope to the millions - of Britons who develop an allergy in their lifetime , as well the two million diabetics and 85,000 multiple sclerosis sufferers .
Researcher David Pritchard told the British Association Festival of Science in York : " I am keen not to oversell because it is still very early but the message so far is good . "
Successful trials could lead to allergy sufferers being given a dose of the worms every five years or so .
Hook worms usually make their way into our bodies through the soles of the feet .
They do not multiply inside the body and can be removed using worming tablets .
Eventually , it may be possible to create a drug that alters the immune system in the same way .
Muriel Simmons , of charity Allergy UK , said the study held out " real hope " , but warned that more allergy specialists are needed to ensure patients get the treatment they need .
Hook worms are not the only creepy - crawlies being tested as alternatives to modern medicine .
Recently scientists used maggots to clean sores contaminated with MRSA while leeches have been found to ease pain and inflammation for arthritis sufferers .
Is there enough evidence now , Ms. Pelosi , to proceed with impeachment against the president and vice president ?
I mean , these two have finally given it up to the world , which now knows how screwed up they are in the brain when President Butch says it does n't matter that we 've known for four years that Iran has no nuclear capabilities , we should still consider a pre-emptive strike to make sure it never gets them .
Huh ?
Frame two , of course , is the Vice Resident with his shotgun turned to the air , trying to shoot down something with , hopefully , more feathers than flesh .
This drugstore cowboy with a battery - powered heart and dung - powered soul feels the need to kill while the Chimp swings in his tire , continuing his incessant rant against the Middle East / Islam / anything without a Yankee - tinged Texas twang ˜ a hybrid redneck that translates " terror " into " terr-uh ; " " nuclear " into " newk - yew - lur ; " and other malapropisms that were always more dismal than entertaining .
These are sick people .
And , not just because they talk funny and look funny .
These are sick , mentally crippled science projects gone bad with an agenda to bring forth Armageddon so we can all enjoy the glory of the Second Coming .
Uh , that is if we are members of their elite club , which allows murder as long as it involves the death of somebody of a different color and oil is to be gained in the transaction .
You know , worshippers at the First Unified Church of the Petroleum Baptism .
I used to click on those George Bush / Dick Cheney / other idiots of the administration are the Anti-Christ Internet links and laugh .
Now , I 'm beginning to wonder .
Next time there 's a You Tube debate , I 'd like to see it go this way :
Andy Cooper : " And now , Gov. Huckabee , here 's a question from Rapture , Missouri . "
You Tuber : " Yes ...uh ... Governor ... I been readin ' my Scriptures and I wanna know ... do you believe George Bush is the Anti-Christ ? "
Huckabee : " We ought to shave the little bastard and search for the mark of the Beast ! "
Andy Cooper : " Gov. Romney ... your response ? "
Mitt Romney : " Uh ... Well ... let me see ... First , I must check with my theology experts to be sure .
See , I 'm not sure which Bible we 're talking about here .
The first one or the corrected version .
But ... well ...uh ... Well , it 's just not appropriate for a presidential candidate to make a judgment like that .
We 'll have to wait until after I 'm elected and then see what my experts say .
Only then can we be sure .
But , first , we must defeat Hillary and the liberal left , which is destroying this country 's values when it comes to abortion , gay marriage ... "
Andy Cooper ( cutting him off ) : " Thank you Governor ... And , what do you have to say , Mayor Giuliani ? "
Rudy : " Fuck you Andy !
Fuck you , CNN !
Fuck you , You Tube !
I'm America 's Mayor - President - Queen !
And do n't you ever fuckin ' forget it !
I saved you ALL from 9/11 .
If it was n't for me , Osama bin Laden would have had a tickertape parade in Manhattan .
Elect fuckin' Hillary and that 's what you 'll get ! "
Andy Cooper : " OK ... this next one 's for Mr. Tancredo . "
You Tuber : " Even though the intelligence shows that Iran cannot build a nuclear weapon , is the president correct in keeping a military option on the table ? "
Tancredo : " No , not at all .
He should take it off the table and start lobbing some of that Cold War arsenal into Tehran ... turn all that sand into glass ... ain't nothin ' over there but a buncha sand ... ( his microphone goes dead before he can finish . )
Andy Cooper : " Thank you . "
Tancredo : " I SAID , ai n't nothin ' ... " ( microphone goes dead again . )
Andy Cooper : " We get the picture . "
But , no , we do n't get the picture .
If we did , there would be a million or two people with a conscience swarming down on the White House this very minute , flittering around the vermin like bats feeding on full - bloodied mosquitoes on a hot summer night .
This insult to human decency would not be allowed to continue , should not be allowed to continue , do you hear Ms. Pelosi ?
We cannot take impeachment off the table unless ... yes , unless there 's another card you 're still holding up your sleeve .
Something , perhaps , like turning these baby - snuffing war criminals over to the International Court at the conclusion of this term ?
Perhaps on charges of inhumane treatment of prisoners of war ?
The use of torture on enemy combatants ?
The lack of human rights offered detainees in Gitmo , as the snazzy war pigs like to call it ?
An act of aggression on an innocent people / state ?
OK ... that 's cool .
Just let us know , please , when you 're ready to put President Butch and his Vice Resident on the perp walk down Pennsylvania Ave .
I 'd like to be there for a little payback .
And , it would be one hell of a story to cover .

Bankers and consumers are up in arms over Wal - Mart 's application for a limited banking charter .
Coming soon to a Wal - Mart near you ?
NEW YORK ( CNN / Money ) - First Wal - Mart conquered retailing .
Is retail banking next on its agenda ?
That 's certainly the fear among regional and community banks throughout the U.S. as bankers rushed in droves to protest Wal - Mart ( Research ) 's application to obtain a limited banking charter .
In late July , the company filed an application with the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to operate an industrial bank .
The company said the bank would process the company 's credit , debit and electronic check payments and save the company millions of dollars in fees that Wal - Mart currently pays out to other banking institutions .
Those savings will be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices , said Wal - Mart spokesman Marty Heires .
Heiers said the company has no plans to create branches or provide lending services to consumers .
He added that the bank itself , located on the sixth floor of a Salt Lake City building " will never be seen by consumers " and the company plans to continue to attract independent , community banks to open branches within its stores .
Wal - Mart currently has 1,100 branches in its stores .
But those assurances are doing little to appease critics .
The FDIC has received over 1,500 letters since Wal - Mart filed its application in July with the majority of respondents vehemently opposing Wal - Mart 's foray into banking , said FDIC spokesman David Barr .
Barr said the FDIC is analyzing the response and will consider requests to hold a special hearing to discuss the matter before any decision on the banking charter is rendered .
Given the enormous response and long analytical process ahead , Barr said that the FDIC wo n't be in a position to decide whether or not to approve Wal - Mart 's application before spring of 2006 .
Biting into community banks ?
Why the brouhaha over Wal - Mart 's banking aspirations ?
Critics fear that if Wal - Mart is given the chance to enter banking in any form , it 's only a matter of time before the carnivorous company sets its sights on clobbering smaller banking institutions to declare itself king of the community banks .
Wal - Mart already has the reputation of putting small businesses out of work when it enters a community by providing lower prices .
Detractors fear that Wal - Mart will use the same principle in banking if given the chance .
" Wal - Mart has a distinct cost advantage over local community banks , " said Bart Narter , senior analyst at research and consulting firm Celent LLC .
He said the company , which is " remarkably efficient " about costs , could offer consumers better savings rates and checking account deals than local community banks .
That could cause consumers to switch their money to a Wal - Mart bank .
With lower deposits , community banks may have a tougher time offering loans to consumers , which could put pressure on local businesses .
A number of the letters the FDIC received were from consumers .
One warned that Wal - Mart " represents a dangerous , unprecedented and unnecessary risk to the general welfare of the general public " while another asserted " please do n't let Wal - Mart take over everything . "
Despite Wal - Mart 's firm denial , Narter said the company has " already taken step after step in moving towards financial services " by cashing checks , issuing money orders credit cards and ATM debit cards .
And this is n't Wal - Mart 's first attempt to dip its toes into banking , Narter added .
In 1998 Oklahoma 's State Bank and Trust Co. -- a bank owned by the Walton family which also founded and controls Wal - Mart -- converted itself to a national thrift from a bank charter , opening the doors for unlimited branching opportunities .
The thrift planned to place its first branches in Wal - Mart .
This attempt was eventually halted by the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act in 1999 , which restricts the ability of a commercial entity to enter banking .
In 2002 , Wal - Mart attempted to purchase Franklin Bank of California but this was also blocked by the California legislature .
Wal - Mart at the time said the company was hoping to buy the bank to help reduce debit card fees .
Kevin Fitzsimmons , associate director at Sandler O'Neill , said while it's not surprising that " mom and pop banks " may view Wal - Mart as a competitive threat given its scale , he is n't expecting any major changes in Wal - Mart 's current business plan .
" A charter is n't necessarily a signal that Wal - Mart is getting into the nuts and bolts of banking overnight , " he said .
" They 've tried to go down that road before and regulators stopped it so I think this is probably more of a step to do some processing . "
Wal - Mart could expand after 3 years
While regulators did put the kibosh on its previous attempts , the company 's application with the FDIC is a first .
Specifically , Wal - Mart is asking permission to run an industrial loan company .
An ILC is n't a traditional bank and can't accept general deposits , open branches or make loans , said the FDIC 's Barr .
In Wal - Mart 's case , the company is asking for a backroom operation charter .
If its charter application is approved without any amendments or additional restrictions placed on it , Wal - Mart would have to refrain from providing any banking services outside of its debit and credit card transactions for 3 to 5 years , Barr said .
After that period , however , the company does n't have to come back to the FDIC for approval to change its business plan .
And that loophole is driving fear in the hearts of banking experts .
Celent 's Narter said that there are no guarantees that , if given the opportunity , Wal - Mart wo n't expand into retail banking after the 3 - year period is over .
He cited the company 's own application package in which Wal - Mart said it has no plans to relocate the main office within the first three years of its operations but makes no mention of its plans afterwards .
The application also said Wal - Mart will offer certificates of deposits to individual investors generated through deposit brokers -- another decidedly bank - like function .
But Wal - Mart spokesman Heires said the controversy is overblown .
" A lot of people are reading an awful lot into this very narrowly cast application , " he said .
" There is no threat here at all . "


A stormy eight - year relationship between Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Formula One ended Thursday with the announcement the international racing series would not return in 2008 .
IMS chairman Tony George and F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone could not reach an agreement on a sanctioning fee to continue the U.S. Grand Prix .
George had set Thursday as a deadline for a new contract .
" Unfortunately , and to my great disappointment , Formula
One will not be back next year , " George said Thursday at a news conference at IMS .
" And beyond that , Bernie Ecclestone and I have had several discussions that led us to this decision and announcement .
But we did agree it was prudent to leave the door open to the future . "
The announcement is a blow to Indianapolis because of the number of out - of - town visitors lured by the race .
Estimates put the economic impact at around $ 100 million .
" We are certainly disappointed in the loss of Formula One in Indianapolis , " Mayor Bart Peterson said in a statement .
" But it was a business decision between Tony George and Bernie Ecclestone .
I have full faith in Tony George and know that he will continue to do what 's best for the speedway and the city of Indianapolis . "
The relationship between Indy and F1 deteriorated dramatically after the 2005 race when only six cars competed because of safety concerns over Michelin tires .
The decision leaves the U.S. without an F1 event and follows failed attempts at other venues , including Long Beach , Calif. , Watkins Glen , N.Y. , and Phoenix .
Ecclestone has explored putting a race in Las Vegas but no agreement has been announced .
Billionaire developer Steve Wynn , who owns a Las Vegas casino , has been pushing Ecclestone for a race for at least a decade .
Las Vegas hosted grand prix events in 1981 and 1982 , with each playing to relatively small crowds .
The Speedway 's 2.6 - mile road course wo n't go unused next year .
MotoGP , the motorcycle equivalent of Formula One , is scheduled to visit in September 2008 .
George set the July 12 deadline in order to have ample time to prepare for 2008 .
The decision last year for the 2007 race , held June 17 , was not made final until Aug. 16 , which did n't help ticket sales .
A crowd estimated at 100,000 attended the race , won by British rookie Lewis Hamilton .
That number was consistent with the past few years .
The inaugural race in 2000 drew a crowd twice that size .
" The challenge is building on that , " he said , adding that more consistent national exposure and title sponsors should be a part of bringing F1 back .
" I think the future will depend on recognizing the fact that the United States is a bit different and to the extent it is important we 're going to have to figure how to work it out . "
Although Indy attracts one of the larger crowds on the F1 circuit , Ecclestone has complained that it is poorly promoted .
F1 has no American teams and only one American driver , Californian Scott Speed .
The field this year was minus two drivers popular in Indianapolis , five - time USGP winner Michael Schumacher ( retired ) and former Indianapolis 500 winner Juan Pablo Montoya ( moved to NASCAR ) .
Montoya will return to Indy in two weeks for the Allstate 400 at the Brickyard .
The failure to secure a deal in the U.S. could put Ecclestone at odds with several F1 teams .
During the USGP , representatives of the Ferrari , BMW , Toyota and Honda teams , among others , noted how valuable the U.S. market is to their companies .

The wait ( and hype ) is finally over .
After weeks of speculation and red herrings , Facebook ’s new ad system ( imaginatively titled " Facebook Ads " ) , has been revealed .
So , what is it ?
Put simply , it ’s an ad system that allows businesses to track users ’ activities on the web ( and on Facebook ) to deliver product referrals and targeted advertising .
If you ’ve ever wanted to use social networking to share extraneous information about your purchases and product endorsements , your time has come .
At its core , Facebook Ads has three primary components ( all of which launch tonight ) .
The first is straight forward enough — businesses are now able to create Facebook profiles .
Not much of a surprise here , but there ’s a twist .
Along with serving as a hub for the business ’ brand , the profile can also serve as the spring board for viral apps ( the second component ) .
These can manifest themselves as anything from brand - stamped casual games , or even e-commerce apps that track purchases on partner websites .
The real kicker is the third component .
It essentially collects the data from the first two components ( keeping user info anonymous , of course ) and provides it to a given business to assist in its targeted advertising objectives .
For instance , a user who goes to Coke ’s page and interacts with or installs its viral app ( " Sprite Sips " ) can pretty much expect to become a shill — inserting all sorts of branding messages and endorsements into friends ’
News Feeds .
So , what does this mean for Facebook users ?
For those that have wanted to use the site as the ultimate social networking / shopping hub , Facebook ’s all - star list of participating partners should n’t disappoint .
Blockbuster , CBS , Verizon , even Coca Cola — a lot the big guns are there .
( Disclosure : Wired News is owned by CondeNet , one of the advertising partners in the deal . )
For the rest of us , though ?
We suspect that Facebook Ads means more app spam … lots and lots of product - pushing app spam .

Blog Update ( January 6 , 2008 ) : Would You Know if Your ISP Tampered With Your Web Pages ?
Blog Update ( December 30 , 2007 ) : Harbinger of 2008 : ISPs Plow Forward with Internet Intrusion Plans
Blog Update ( December 14 , 2007 ) : Rogers Replies re Web Ambushing : White is Black , Up is Down , Ignorance is Strength
Update ( December 10 , 2007 3:30 PM PST ) : Rogers has now publicly confirmed the activities described below .
Greetings .
Please observe closely the image to your left , showing the home page for Google Canada ( click the image for a full - sized , full - resolution version ) .
Does anything seem a bit odd about the normally clean and pristine Google front door ?
What the blazes is all that ISP - related verbiage taking up the top third of the page ?
Why would Google ever give an ISP permission to muddy up Google 's public face that way ?
Well , as you 've probably already guessed , Google did n't give this ISP any such permission .
The ISP simply decided to modify Google on their own , demonstrating a real world example of ISPs Spying On and Modifying Web Traffic that I was discussing yesterday .
Just brought to my attention today by a concerned reader who chose Google for his example , what you 're looking at is reportedly an ongoing test by Rogers in Canada , scheduled for deployment to Rogers Internet customers next quarter .
In case you 're curious , " ISNS " on the test Google interception page apparently stands for Internet Subscriber Notification System .
For the morbidly curious , here 's the javascript and associated code that enables this procedure , which can presumably be applied to any http : ( unencrypted ) traffic .
While Rogers ' current planned use for this Deep Packet Inspection ( DPI ) and modification system ( reportedly manufactured by " In- Browser Marketing " firm " PerfTech " ) is for account status messages , it 's obvious that commercial ISP content and ads ( beyond the ISP logos already displayed ) would be trivial to introduce through this mechanism .
By the way , PerfTech is even using Google for one of its linked promotional examples on the PerfTech home page .
I wonder if they bothered to ask Google 's permission for that ?
Anyway , the fact that there 's an opt - out present for future account status messages on the Rogers page insertions hardly changes the extremely problematic and network neutrality unfriendly aspects of such situations , as I noted in yesterday 's blog item .
Question : Will
Web service providers such as Google and many others , who have spent vast resources in both talent and treasure creating and maintaining their services ' appearances and quality , be willing to stand still while any ISP intercepts and modifies their traffic in such a manner ?
I can't say for sure of course , but I suspect that a likely reaction might be discerned by paraphrasing Bugs Bunny : " Eh , he do n't know them very well , do he ? "

Cat 's eyes are no longer the only things about them that glow in the dark , after scientists cloned a fluorescent feline .
South Korean Kong
Il - Keun 's team cloned cats after modifying a gene to change their skin colour .
Scroll down for more ...
The two Turkish Angora cats now glow red when exposed to ultraviolet light .
The scientists believe the process could be used to develop treatments for human genetic diseases and could help reproduce rare animals .
To clone the cats , Kong 's team used skin cells of the mother cat .
They modified its genes to make them fluorescent by using a virus , which was transplanted into the ova .
The ova were then implanted into the womb of the donor cat .
Four kittens were born but two died during the caesarean section .
" This technology can be applied to clone animals suffering from the same diseases as humans , " the leading scientist , Kong said .
" It will also help develop stemcell treatments , " he said , noting that cats have 250 kinds of genetic diseases that affect humans as well .

South Korea 's bio-engineering industry suffered a setback after a much - touted achievement by cloning expert Hwang Woo - Suk turned out to have been faked .
The government banned Hwang from research using human eggs after his claims that he created the first human stem cells through cloning were ruled to be bogus last year .
For decades , the Victorian seen in the far left photo was a San Francisco landmark known as the Black House .
It was home to Church of Satan founder Dr. Anton LaVey from 1967 until his death in 1997 .
After falling into disrepair , the Black House was sadly demolished in 2001 .
The current owners of the property built three cheesy condominiums in its place that are just now up for sale .
My friend Greg Long snapped this photo of the new development last weekend .
I hope that a rich Satanist buys the condos and paints them black as a memorial .
Here 's what the Church of Satan said about the Black House in 1998 during their efforts to save the place :
Originally built in the 1880's , it survived the devastating 1906 fire and earthquake .
It 's been a speakeasy , a " spook parlour " and , when Dr. LaVey bought it in 1956 , it was owned by one of Mammie Pleasant 's girls , one of the most notorious madams in San Francisco .
Dr. LaVey made it world - famous when he performed history 's first Satanic wedding and baptism here ; his 500 - pound lion , Togare , was raised here .
Dr. LaVey was forced to sell the house several years ago because of a relentless civil suit .
That fight almost killed him , but this house meant a great deal to him .
He said it was part of his own personality – that its roots went all the way to Hell .

Updated : See full collection of University Video Collections on YouTube .
I heard rumors something like this was coming , and now it 's here .
YouTube has struck deals with major universities , creating dedicated channels from which schools can distribute their media content .
Not surprisingly UC Berkeley , always at the digital forefront , has taken the lead and launched an ambitious channel with over 300 hours of videotaped courses and events .
You can check out their channel here .
The other major university to sign on is USC ( University of Southern California ) .
Back in March , we lamented the sheer dearth of cultural content on YouTube .
( Listen to our radio interview here and also see our related blog post . )
Since its inception , the now Google - owned video service has been awash with home - brewed videos of guitar riffs , dormroom lip sync sessions , and pet tricks .
Meanwhile , videos of greater cultural substance have been harder to come by ( and that 's why we 've tried to flag the good ones for you .
See here , here & here . )
YouTube 's new university initiative begins to remedy that problem .
It shows a perhaps burgeoning commitment to higher - minded media .
But let 's not get too carried away .
When you go to YouTube , it 's not clear how users will find / navigate to these channels .
If you look under Categories , " education " is not an option ( although I think it used to be ) .
Perhaps YouTube has plans to tweak its navigation .
Or is this just a case of letting a tree fall in the woods ?
Let 's stay optimistic and we 'll check back soon .

The White House filled in some gaps to the official story related to this high - profile scandal .
In a federal court filing , the White House said it routinely ' recycled ' backup tapes that housed admin emails between 2001 and Oct 2003 , meaning it does not have a record of emails that may have been sent and received pertaining to the Wilson leak , the occupation of Iraq and other historic events for a period of two years .
That first device was the size of a modern mobile phone .
Right now , 2 million transistors could fit in the full stop at the end of this sentence .
Intel has just released its new Penryn processors , which have up to 820 million transistors , and soon the standard inch - wide microprocessor will have 1 billion transistors .
Combined with advances in programming , we will see single - chip systems such as hand - held translators , in - car collision avoidance systems , and a raft of devices that react to voice and touch .
It is extraordinary to reflect on how far the silicon revolution has come in such a short time .
Soon after Bardeen and Brattain made their breakthrough , William Shockley , also at Bell Labs , invented the first semiconductor transistor .
All three were awarded the 1956 Nobel prize for their efforts .
Justin Rattner , chief technology officer of Intel , calls the transistor " the fundamental building block of the information age .
It 's hard even to think of a single invention that is responsible for as much change - you 'd maybe have to go back to the Bronze Age , where a single invention changed the course of everything and had a lasting impact . "
But doubts are growing over how much further we can go with these technological building blocks of transistors and integrated circuits .
To improve speed and keep power and heat under control , transistors have been getting smaller and smaller .
Gordon Moore , co-founder of Intel , came up with an eponymous law , that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years .
But he believes his law is running out of steam .
At the Intel developers ' forum in September , Moore said that in " another decade , or decade and a half , we will hit something that is fairly fundamental " .
That fundamental problem was explained by IBM Fellow Dr Bernie Meyerson as " atoms do n't scale " .
The nanometre - one - millionth of a millimetre - is the unit used to measuring the tiniest elements of a silicon chip .
Intel , IBM and others have recently started production of 45 nm chips .
But the silicon atom itself is more than a tenth of a nanometre across .
Moore suggested there was a basic physical limit of five atomic layers .
Today , the oxide layer in transistors is a mere five to six atoms thick , leading to challenges with current leakage .
This is a quantum effect , where electrons " tunnel " through an insulating region instead of following their assigned path .
Mr Rattner is n't so sure there 's a brick wall ahead .
" Gordon always adds a footnote along the lines of ' of course , we 've never been able to see beyond about 10 years ' .
Typically we are seriously at work two generations ahead .
We are in production with 45 nanometre and well along with 32 and 22 nm . "
Glenn Wightwick , an IBM distinguished engineer and director of the Australia Development Laboratory , agrees there are issues to overcome but doubts innovation will slow .
" Until the late 1990s , the vast majority of the gains made have been the result of scaling - making things smaller .
When the lithography moved to 180 nm , 90 % of the relative improvement over the previous generation of semiconductor devices was derived from traditional scaling - that is , the application of Moore 's Law .
" Today , as we move from 65 nm to 45 nm and beyond to 32 nm , only 20 % of relative improvement is derived from scaling alone .
Innovation , in the form of novel materials , structures , processes and architectures delivers the rest .
This is why IBM invests so heavily in R&D . "
IBM 's researchers are experimenting with different materials and techniques to improve performance , such as copper in chips , silicon - on - insulator , strained silicon , multicore chips and air gap self - assembly .
The current crown jewel is IBM 's Power6 processor , which has 790 million transistors and runs at 4.7 GHz .
Dr Wightwick acknowledges that physical limits are being approached .
Mr Rattner concurs .
" We are reaching the limits of physics in some ways , " he says .
To achieve a 45 nm resolution , Intel had to use a new material - Hafnium - in the gates of the transistors .
" We ran right into a physical limit , " he says .
" But what 's happened again and again when you come upon the physical limits is we 've been able to advance around them , and I think that will continue for at least the next several generations . "
Already , the scale of the detail on the chip is smaller than the wavelength of the light ( 193 nm ) used to print it .
This bizarre result is thanks to the use of " clever maths " while patterning transistors , Mr Rattner says .
But this technique is going to reach a limit .
Intel is looking at ways to use light with much smaller wavelengths , extreme ultraviolet and X - rays , but it is a tricky undertaking .
" X - rays do n't focus in traditional ways - it 's all done with mirrors .
" But I think a couple of generations out we will have to make the transition . "
There could be an even bigger transition to come , once the scale gets below 10 nm .
Mr Rattner predicts that in a decade , the fundamental basis of electronics will change .
Instead of using the electrostatic charge of an electron , devices will depend on another quality of electrons , their " spin " .
Mr Rattner says : " Spin - based devices will be based on different materials such as titanium cobalt alloys that have the required appropriate magnetic domain .
When you get into the speculative area , then you are talking about molecular devices . "
Molecular devices are one of several new radical ideas around .
Dr Wightwick says many research laboratories are looking for new and novel devices that could replace transistors inside computers .
" Things like carbon nanotubes and molecular cascades .
There is a lot of interesting work being done in quantum computing . "
But when the basic building blocks change , the entire architecture of information processing , and the silicon industry itself , will undergo a revolution .
Already , says Dr Wightwick , the cost of a new " silicon foundry " is huge , driven by the cost of moving from one generation of lithography to the next .
This has led to dramatic consolidation across the industry in order to share these costs .
Moving to a whole new class of devices using different materials ( probably still on top of a silicon substrate ) will be even more difficult and costly .
That 's the bad news .
The good news is that it 's a bonanza in the making for users of technology .
Mr Rattner says that when the first 22 nm silicon chips appear - just two chip generations out - it will prompt a generation of single - system chips that make it easier to interact with technology .
" We are right at the start of the information age .
We think we are so sophisticated with our hand - held devices and internet access .
But we have asked an enormous amount from users to tolerate - why is it that my mother - in - law calls me up and says ' I 've got this error 22 message ' ?
" How do we soften those interfaces and make them more human ?
That 's a very important next step .
We are in that era of technology where we start to move away from machine imposed limitations .
" We were doing an internal talk on computer perception and we 've got a slide from Star Trek of Captain Kirk holding a universal translator and we ask , ' how far are we from that ? '.
I think it 's probably not more than a decade into the future when devices like that will be practical . "
Dr Wightwick also predicts a bright future .
" Creating new ideas , solving problems , inventing things and applying technology in new and novel ways , seems to be a basic human characteristic .
One of the things I love about computing . .. is that innovation has been so fundamental to this field .
I do n't see any slowing down of the rate of innovation .
In fact , I continue to see more innovation every day . "
Innovations that give us more processing power will spawn many other innovations , Mr Rattner says .
Google " took a very powerful piece of software and ran trillions of bytes of examples of English and Arabic and trained it to recognise language statistically .
It knew nothing about Arabic or English , though .
" We have spent decades on artificial intelligence thinking we could do everything with rules .
" The new thinking is statistical - which is how the brain works - and making use of access to a massive amount of training information from the internet .
" This move to machine learning is going to open up a broad class of applications such as machine translation and continuous speech recognition .
" That technology will move very quickly and then you begin to combine that with robotic technology and you move into the age of personal robots . "
Early next decade Mr Rattner envisages car companies developing autonomous vehicle technologies geared at collision avoidance that can take over control of the car , if the driver dozes off , and bring it safely to a stop
" This is not so far fetched and not so far into the future . "
The next 60 years look set to be just as exciting a ride as the first .

The birth of integration Ivan P. Kaminow , adjunct professor at University of California , Berkeley , joined AT&T 's Bell Labs in 1954 , during the decade when the transistor was slowly taking over from valve - based electronics .
He is now a respected pioneer of photonic integrated circuits - circuits that work on light instead of electricity .
During a talk last month at the University of Melbourne , organised by the national research institute NICTA , he reflected on his early years at Bell .
" I have learnt the lesson that if you try to predict the future you have to expect the unexpected .
My first job was in the transistor circuit department ( at Bell Labs ) , only seven years after the transistor was invented .
What they had me do was take a vacuum tube circuit used to test telephone lines and convert it to a transistor circuit .
It had an aluminium chassis where the vacuum tubes were plugged in .
The transistor came in a little can , a few millimetres on the sides , with three wires coming out .
It was pretty simple to convert the circuit .
I went home and told my wife the transistor probably would n't amount to very much .
The reason was that these transistors cost $ 50 and these vacuum tubes cost only a dollar .
I was only 24 , so you can forgive me for making that dumb mistake but I can't forgive Bell Labs for missing the idea of integrated circuits .
I can see two reasons .
Yields ( the amount of working transistors in a batch of silicon ) were poor , so if you have a 10 % yield and put two ( transistors ) on the same device the yield would be 10 % of 10 % .
That was a short - sighted way of looking at things ; also , the guy who was in charge of this was pretty arrogant .
About 1958 ( electrical engineer Jack S. )
Kilby , a new hire at Texas Instruments during summer vacation when everybody was out of the labs , decided to put several transistors on the same chip .
And that was the origin of the integrated circuit .
He connected them with resistors and capacitors with external wires , so it was n't really fully integrated .
A few months later ( Robert ) Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor , which later became Intel , he made an integrated circuit where the wiring was integrated on the chip .
Since then there have been quite a few surprises .
According to Gordon Moore , in the 1990s , more transistors were made each year than raindrops in California .
I 'm sure that 10 years later you can multiply that by several orders of magnitude .
Ten to the 18th ( power , that is , a billion billion ) transistors are made each year , more than existed at the beginning of the year .
That 's 10 to 100 times the number of ants on Earth .
So all these advances are based on a design for transistors . "
This is a short , edited extract of Professor Kaminow 's talk .

I read an interesting article linked from DZone today , proposing a naming approach for database tables and fields .
What was a little startling to me , though , is that it was clearly a carefully - considered approach , but I disagreed with almost every single conclusion he drew .
I ’ll review the main points and outline my approach along the way .
Identifying the Problem
From the article :
Perhaps the most common practice in database naming is to use all one case ( upper or lower ) with words separated by underscores , and heavily abbreviated .
Fixed case names have become the standard because database systems are traditional case - insensitive in table and field names ( or required fixed case ) . [… ]
Separating words with underscores is a natural result of fixed case names and also is commonplace in academia .
The heavy use of abbreviations is a holdover from the days of dBase and other systems where there was a stringent limit on table and field name length .
We ’re agreed at the starting point — personally , some of my most frustrating development experiences have been working with inherited AS / 400 databases ; I ’m not sure what the table & column name character limits were — 10 ? — but particularly when every abbreviations seemed to have been made up on the fly ( “ customer ” could be cst , cust , cus , cstm , cu , etc. ) it ’s simply hell .
They also tended to try to prefix column names with some shorter abbreviation of the table name as well ( leaving even fewer precious characters for the actual field name … ) .
The databases were nearly impossible to use .
I also want to point out that almost any naming standard is better than none , or a random mixture of standards depending on who was adding the particular table — if I were working with one of the databases designed using his standard , I ’d stick to it ( though I ’d probably gripe about it ! ) .
On to his scheme .
His first solution is to use all mixed case names :
Solution # 1 : Mixed case ( vs. Underscores )
I use mixed case names .
I do not use underscores .
Mixed - case makes underscores unnecessary and once you are used to omitting them , they look ugly and it is easier not to type them .
The first problem here is that databases are more or less still case - insensitive , not just “ traditionally ” .
Try googling for database table names mixed case and see how many times you see words like bug / issue / defect / HELP !
associated with how many different databases … people looking for workarounds because Oracle , DB2 , MySQL , PostgreSQL , etc. are chewing up their mixed - case table names .
I know I ’ve had to recreate schemas before because of table name case issues .
Second , are underscores actually harder to read ?
Example : a column holding the date of the last order :
Plain English : last order date Underscores : last_order_date Mixed case : lastOrderDate
If the mixed case were significantly faster to read & easier on the eyes , it might be worth it to push against the database case - insensitive history & ongoing issues ( I imagine you can get around the problems by quoting all table name references , for example ) .
I ’m not seeing the benefit , though .
Solution # 2 : Table type prefix to table name
I prefix table names to indicate one of three different types of tables .
I ’m a bit more understanding on this one — I also used to be a hardcore fan of Hungarian notation in code , though I found as my code got better I fell back to a much laxer standard , only keeping prefixes to flag incoming method arguments and constants .
Prefixes help by grouping tables by type automatically when they ’re in alpha order and providing a bit more info than the base name ; the downside is added ugliness and distraction when you do n’t need the added info .
His prefixes : tbl for regular data tables , link for many - to - many relationship tables , and pltbl for “ picklist ” tables — lists of valid values for columns elsewhere .
First off… “ pltbl ” ?
That makes me think more of dinner table scenes from Calvin & Hobbes than anything else .
But beyond that , I do n’t use these , and probably wo n’t start ; I get more value out of just constructing table names carefully so that order - related tables all start with “ order ” , etc. — instance - specific prefixes .
But if I were , I ’d drop the “ tbl ” prefix entirely ( since that ’s the majority of the tables ; why clutter up the name for no added info ? ) and change “ pltbl ” to “ lookup ” or some meaningful , single word .
Solution # 3 : Consistent singular ( vs. plural ) table names
He sticks with singular ( e.g. , customer vs. customer s ) .
I agree on this one — then I can have a table customer with a PK customer_id , for example .
It just works out cleanly .
Solution # 4 : Table - name prefix on column names
I prefix field names with a three letter code to indicate which table owns the field .
Disagree completely .
This is what table aliases are for in joins … and you can leave them out when you ’re selecting from a single table , and aliases wo n’t play hell with mapping a result set to object fields .
Also , when ( for example ) order IDs are referenced from multiple tables , I want them to use the same column name , because they ’re the same data !
It should be clear that you can join activity_log.order_id to order.order_id … whereas if those columns are named actlOrderId and ordOrder Id that ’s not obvious anymore .
Reason # 1 from the article :
When you join tables together that each contain fields of the identical name , you need to clutter your SQL statements with a bunch of AS clauses to make the resulting field names unique .
This confused me at first — take the “ order_id ” example above — why would I select from both order_id columns ?
They ’ll have the same data .
Then I noticed that he ’s selecting * from all of the joined tables in his example .
That ’s why ….
I pretty much never select * when I ’m joining multiple tables , partly as a self - check ; if I have to change the columns in a table ( renaming , removing , etc . )
I do n’t want queries working normally , only to find later that an essential piece of data is no longer making it into my objects ; if it ’s wrong , the sooner it breaks and makes some noise , the better .
Reason # 2 :
It makes it more difficult to interpret certain error messages .
For example , suppose you are using traditional naming and you get the error “ Field cust_id not found . ”
If you have multiple tables with a cust_id field , you may not immediately know which table generated the error .
This is an error - reporting shortfall ; if the exception handling captures enough data ( at a minimum , the faulty SQL statement ) , this is never an issue .
Solution # 5 : Never use spaces in field names
This one ’s hard to argue with ; it makes for horrendous SQL .
But my feeling is that you can get almost the same readability using underscores anyway ( see above ) .
Solution # 6 : Avoid duplicating column names in different tables
From the article :
For example , your customer table may have a notes field for notes about the customer and your order table may have a notes field for notes about the order .
Using my prefix system , you may be inclined to name them this way : cusNotes
ordNotes
You can see here how using prefixes to indicate the owner table is already convenient to distinguish order notes from customer notes on a join operation .
However , I recommend this method : cusCustomerNotes
ordOrderNotes
This is where the downsides of this approach start to be really clear : his “ solutions ” have given him column names such as cusCustomerNotes — that ’s 11 characters you have to parse before you can find the 5 character actual name .
And how much useful data is actually in those 11 characters ?
Almost none .
It ’s basically 70 % noise and 30 % data .
The problem he ’s addressing is valid — I ’ve had special cases where overlap like this is obviously going to present a problem , so I ’ll choose column names carefully to avoid it .
But the special cases are n’t common .
Look at the example — how often are you going to be selecting both a customer ’s notes and one of his order ’s notes into a single object ?
It ’s much more likely that you ’d have a Customer object , then separate list of Order objects .
Hence , no overlap & no conflict , and 11 characters just muddling things up without adding anything .
A related issue that he does n’t cover ( but you should ) is naming of common field types —
I ’m not talking about Hungarian notation here , but common datatypes that you ’re using everywhere and which tend to include the type in the name somehow , like dates , timestamps , PK values , and true / false values .
Take the boolean example : if you do n’t set a standard , you ’ll have some developers using ‘ T ’ / ’ F’ in char ( 1 ) fields , others using ‘ Y ’ / ’N’ or ‘ T ’ / null or empty string in the same fields , others using 1/0 values in number ( 1 ) fields … with column names including things like is_active , active_flag , active_tf , active_bool , and so on .
I would n’t insist on what approach to take exactly , but do think it over , pick an approach , and stick with it .
Solution # 7 : Use GUID strings as primary keys , not integers
He advocates using a 36 - character long , randomized string instead of the standard auto - incremented numeric value for primary keys .
I actually worked with a database that took this approach recently , and since we were migrating it anyway , we switched the approach in the process to use a numeric PK — it was just too frustrating to work with !
He lists performance as the first downside — though I do n’t know that he actually benchmarked this ; personally I do n’t think it would make a big difference .
Then he does mention the main problem — these IDs are simply hard to work with :
While integers are messy in that they do n’t tell you much about the object , during the development process , it is much easier to tell a colleague that there is a problem with customer number 3452 than to tell him that there is a problem with customer CUS:005 bf43a-01ca-454a-996c-2c73621ceeb6 .
In my development , GUIDs have proved somewhat inconvenient when trying to figure out why the application cannot find customer CUS:005 bf43a-01ca-454a-996c-2c73621ceeb6 or trying to find the corresponding foreign key value in a database .
It can be done , but looking at columns and rows or GUIDs for any length of time can give you a serious headache !
Exactly — even an integer up in the millions is far easier to copy & paste , when you ’re writing ad - hoc SQL , debugging , etc . .
So , that ’s the cost , but he thinks it ’s generally outweighed by the benefits :
Benefit # 1 : Merging databases ; i.e. , you do n’t have to worry about overlap between different data sets .
Well , this situation does n’t come up often , of course , but if it does , if you ’re following my approach of giving the same data the same column name irrespective of table ( e.g. , order_id everywhere , not cusOrder Id and ordOrderId ) then it ’s pretty trivial to migrate — just add a fixed offset to those incoming columns , update your sequences when you ’re done , and you ’re all set .
Benefit # 2 : Knowing the PK before adding the record .
Maybe we ’re just dealing with different databases , but I definitely do not need to follow all of the steps he outlines to search for a row I ’ve just written to retrieve the auto - incremented ID .
AFAIK modern major databases do not have this problem .
For example , in Oracle you can either retrieve the next ID from a sequence on your own ( before writing the record ) or you can build it into the insert statement like this :
insert into order ( order_id , customer_id ) values ( order_id_seq.nextVal , 12 ) ;
… then retrieve the just - added ID from the sequence like this :
select order_id_seq.currVal from dual ;
No searching , selecting , etc. ; it does n’t even have to hit the disk to give you this info .
Benefit # 3 : Web database key values in the URLs
If you ever write a database application for the web , one thing you probably want to avoid is to use consecutive integers as your primary key values .
This is because most database - driven web sites at some point display a key field in the address bar of the web browser .
Any enterprising hacker can simply increment or decrement the key value and potentially see data that they should n’t .
By using GUIDs as primary keys , it is much more difficult for the hacker to penetrate the inner workings of the site by this method .
This is another case of trying to hack a solution to a problem using SQL when the problem is elsewhere .
GUIDs are absolutely not an excuse for leaving your webapp wide - open .
Substituting IDs in URLs does n’t even take an “ enterprising hacker ” … anyone can try it , and eventually someone will get it .
If you do n’t implement any security to prevent people from accessing data they ’re not supposed to see , you ’ve got a much bigger problem that this can solve .
Benefit # 4 : You ’ll never run out of GUIDs
The maximum numeric column value in most databases is more than large enough for anything I ’ve ever run into … it ’s 38 digits in Oracle — whatever actual number that translates to , it ’s big .
Summary
Well , that ’s the gist of it .
The important thing ( I think we ’d agree ) is that you put some thought into the usability of the table and column names you choose , in the situations where you ’ll be using them most — and make some kind of standard that you can follow consistently for the life of the database .
What you do will depend partly on your tools , your development language (s ) , your database , your coding habits , and so on — just make sure you are making your choices based on your real everyday usage , not based on the “ cleverness ” of an idea or because of imagined issues that are actually minimal risks .

Scientists at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif. , have obtained the first images of asteroid 2007 TU24 using high - resolution radar data .
The data indicate the asteroid is somewhat asymmetrical in shape , with a diameter roughly 250 meters ( 800 feet ) in size .
Asteroid 2007 TU24 will pass within 1.4 lunar distances , or 538,000 kilometers ( 334,000 miles ) , of Earth on Jan. 29 at 12:33 a.m. Pacific time ( 3:33 a.m. Eastern time ) .
" With these first radar observations finished , we can guarantee that next week 's 1.4 - lunar - distance approach is the closest until at least the end of the next century , " said Steve Ostro , JPL astronomer and principal investigator for the project .
" It is also the asteroid 's closest Earth approach for more than 2,000 years .
" Scientists at NASA 's Near - Earth Object Program Office at JPL have determined that there is no possibility of an impact with Earth in the foreseeable future .
Asteroid 2007 TU24 was discovered by the NASA - sponsored Catalina Sky Survey on Oct. 11 , 2007 .
The first radar detection of the asteroid was acquired on Jan. 23 using the Goldstone 70 - meter ( 230 - foot ) antenna .
The Goldstone antenna is part of NASA 's Deep Space Network Goldstone station in Southern California 's Mojave Desert .
Goldstone 's 70 - meter diameter ( 230 - foot ) antenna is capable of tracking a spacecraft traveling more than 16 billion kilometers ( 10 billion miles ) from Earth .
The surface of the 70 - meter reflector must remain accurate within a fraction of the signal wavelength , meaning that the precision across the 3,850 - square - meter ( 41,400 - square - foot ) surface is maintained within one centimeter ( 0.4 inch ) .
Ostro and his team plan further radar observations of asteroid 2007 TU24 using the National Science Foundation 's Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico on Jan. 27-28 and Feb.
1 - 4 . The asteroid will reach an approximate apparent magnitude 10.3 on Jan. 29 - 30 before quickly becoming fainter as it moves farther from Earth .
On that night , the asteroid will be observable in dark and clear skies through amateur telescopes with apertures of at least 7.6 centimeters ( three inches ) .
An object with a magnitude of 10.3 is about 50 times fainter than an object just visible to the naked eye in a clear , dark sky .
Scientists working with Ostro on the project include Lance Benner and Jon Giorgini of JPL , Mike Nolan of the Arecibo Observatory , and Greg Black of the University of Virginia .
NASA detects and tracks asteroids and comets passing close to Earth .
The Near Earth Object Observation Program , commonly called " Spaceguard , " discovers , characterizes and computes trajectories for these objects to determine if any could be potentially hazardous to our planet .
The Arecibo Observatory is part of the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center , a national research center operated by Cornell University , Ithaca , N.Y. , for the National Science Foundation .
JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena .

Restore Habeas Corpus - Act Now !
Posted by Pile ( 6198 views ) [ E - Mail link ]
Awhile back , the creatures in Congress thought that it was no big deal to take away our basic rights , such as the right to being told what we 're charged with if we 're arrested , and not being detained indefinitely .
A new bill has been introduced , the " Habeas Corpus Restoration Act " which promises to restore these basic rights that were taken away .
Do your political representatives support this law ?
You might be surprised .
UPDATE : Thanks for doing your part !
It really helped .
What ?
You did n't contact your representative ?
Well that explains why the measure failed .
By the way , if you think there 's no difference between Republicans and Democrats , think again .
Every single Democrat supported restoring Habeas Corpus .
All but six republicans ( Hagel ( R- NE ) Lugar ( R - IN ) Smith ( R - OR ) Snowe ( R - ME ) Specter ( R - PA ) Sununu ( R- NH ) ) voted against it .
All politicians may be slime , but the Democrats clearly seem to have a little more respect for the Constitution and citizens ' rights - Let's NOT FORGET THIS COME ELECTION TIME !
Become A Citizen Co-Sponsor :
This week , we have a critical opportunity to restore habeas corpus .
The Habeas Corpus Restoration
Act gives us a chance to reverse one of the Bush Administration 's many assaults on our civil liberties .
We all want to make America safe from terrorism , but becoming a nation that sanctions the unlawful detention of its own residents -- detaining and jailing them without the chance to appear before a judge -- does not make us safe .
Instead , it violates a value that we have held dear for centuries -- safeguarding our individual freedom before arbitrary state action .

I did n't see this until after the vote , but ...
How do you not understand that Democrats are just as morally bankrupt , debased , and disinterested in our basic civil rights as Republicans are ?
They put on a dog - and - pony show so that you are lulled into thinking they are an " opposition party " whose supposed opposition amounts to jack squat .
Wake up Americans !
It is not Dems vs Repubs .
It is The People vs The Government .
Freedom vs Control .
If the Dems were n't just mirrors of Repubs , playing the same cheating game from the other side , Impeachment proceedings would already be underway .
Hell , they'd have been finished , and the entire Executive branch replaced years ago .

We hold these truths to be self - evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness .
( Note : the original hand - written text ended on the phrase " the pursuit of property " rather than " the pursuit of Happiness " but the phrase was changed in subsequent copies in part because it was broader .
The latter phrase is used today ) .
That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .

Los Angeles , CA – Actor and Internet personality , Wil Wheaton , has been indicted by federal prosecutors on charges of promoting and hosting a robot fighting ring .
Prosecutors allege Wheaton kicked and electrocuted robots that were n't performing well , as many as fifteen robots .
" He just blew their circuits , " said US Attorney Bob Schrumpkin .
Was his affection for Data just an act ?
The news shocked fans of Wheaton's , many of whom are robot owners themselves .
Christie Cho of Simi Valley said , " I have an Aibo and a Poo - Chi and I love them .

Wheaton contends that nobody gets hurt in robot fighting , and that people just do n't understand .
" It 's deeply ingrained in the geek culture .
We see nothing wrong with it , " said Wheaton .
" We get together , drink a few Red Bulls and watch the robots fight it out .
I do n’t see what the big deal is . "
Violet Tamagotchi , President of People for the Ethical Treatment of Robots ( PETR ) , picketed outside Wheaton 's home .
She does n't buy the " part of our culture " argument .
" Asimov said robots can't hurt us , so why does Wheaton hurt robots ?
I thought Wil embraced technology , not destroyed it , " she said .
Protest signs urged the Screen Actor 's Guild ( SAG ) asking to suspend Wheaton from the actors ' union .
" We 're surprised and saddened by this news on Mr. Wheaton .
While there is a long history of abusive behavior by actors , it 's usually with production assistants and not robots .
This goes beyond anything we 've ever seen , " said a representative from SAG .

DANIEL ELLSBERG : Covering Up the Coverage – The American Media ’s Complicit Failure to Investigate and Report on the Sibel Edmonds Case
In an Exclusive BRAD BLOG Op - Ed , the Legendary ‘ Pentagon Papers ’ Whistleblower Calls on the Media to Perform Their First Amendment Obligations , on Congressional Leaders to Perform Their Oversight Duty , and for Insider Sources to Come Forward to the American Public …
— Guest BRAD BLOG Op - Ed by Daniel Ellsberg
For the second time in two weeks , the entire U.S. press has let itself be scooped by Rupert Murdoch ’s London Sunday Times on a dynamite story of criminal activities by corrupt U.S. officials promoting nuclear proliferation .
But there is a worse journalistic sin than being scooped , and that is participating in a cover - up of information that demands urgent attention from the public , the U.S. Congress and the courts .
For the last two weeks — one could say , for years — the major American media have been guilty of ignoring entirely the allegations of the courageous and highly credible source Sibel Edmonds , quoted in the London Times on January 6 , 2008 in a front - page story that was front - page news in much of the rest of the world but was not reported in a single American newspaper or network .
It is up to readers to demand that this culpable silent treatment end .
Just as important , there must be pressure by the public on Congressional committee chairpersons , in particular Representative Henry Waxman and Senator Patrick Leahy .
Both have been sitting for years on classified , sworn testimony by Edmonds — as she revealed in the Times ’ new story on Sunday — along with documentation , in their possession , confirming parts of her account .
Pressure must be brought for them to hold public hearings to investigate her accusations of widespread criminal activities , over several administrations , that endanger national security .
They should call for open testimony under oath by Edmonds — as she has urged for five years — and by other FBI officials she has named to them , as cited anonymously in the first Times ’ story .
It ’s a measure of how far the New York Times and Washington Post have fallen from their responsibilities … since I gave them the Pentagon Papers in 1971 .
They printed them then .
Would they today ?
And this is the time for those who have so far creditably leaked to the Times of London to come forward , accepting personal risks , to offer their testimony — and new documents — both to the Congress and to the American press .
I would say to them :
Do n’t do what I did and waste months of precious time trying to get Congressional committees to act as they should in the absence of journalistic pressure .
Do your best to inform the American public directly , first , through the major American media .
But perhaps today the alternative media and the international press are a necessary precursor even to that .
It should n’t be true , but if it is , it ’s a measure of how far the New York Times and Washington Post have fallen from their responsibilities to the public , to their profession and to American democracy , since I gave them the Pentagon Papers in 1971 .
They printed them then .
Would they today ?
It ’s impossible to believe that they — or Rupert Murdoch ’s Wall Street Journal — could not have acquired documents and testimony that Murdoch ’s London paper reports on today .
Now the challenge to them is to end their silence on that reporting and do their job .
Otherwise , like the now - Democratic - controlled committees , they are complicit in cover -up .
That ’s not what these institutions should be doing .
It ’s not that “ the cover - up is always worse than the crime ” : that favorite media mantra is itself a cover story .
The criminal cover -up by the FBI revealed by Edmonds and the Times ’ documents is , as often the case , to conceal extremely serious crimes endangering our security , and to protect the official perpetrators .
But if “ freedom of the press is mainly for the people who own presses , ” it is time for those owners to stop using that freedom to help conceal official wrongdoing .
And the people who own computers should be using them to light a fire under the owners of presses and television networks .
In support of the official cover - up , various American journalists in the last weeks have reportedly received calls from “ intelligence sources ” hinting that “ what Sibel Edmonds stumbled onto ” is not a rogue operation by American officials and Congressmen working to their own advantage — as believed by Edmonds and some other former or active FBI officials — but a sensitive covert operation authorized at high levels .
If there is any truth to that , we clearly have another prize candidate — giving us , as blowback , the Pakistani Bomb and nuclear sales — in the category of “ worst covert operation in U.S. history , ” rivaling such contenders as the Bay of Pigs , Iran - Contra , and the secret CIA torture camps abroad .
If “ freedom of the press is mainly for the people who own presses , ” it is time for those owners to stop using that freedom to help conceal official wrongdoing .
In the first two of those , the American press gullibly responded to official warnings of “ sensitivity ” and sat on information they should have reported ( as did the New York Times , for a year , on the illegal NSA surveillance program ) .
If the Washington Post had heeded such warnings and demands with respect to the covert torture camps , they would have missed a well - earned Pulitzer Prize and the camps would still be torturing .
Many , if not most , covert operations deserve to be disclosed by a free press .
They are often covert not only because they are illegal but because they are wildly ill - conceived and reckless .
“ Sensitive ” and “ covert ” are often synonyms for “ half - assed ” or “ idiotic , ” as well as for “ criminal , ” as the pattern of activities revealed by Edmonds would appear to be if it were truly presidentially authorized .
These activities persist , covertly , to the point of national disaster because the press neglects what our First Amendment was precisely intended to protect and encourage it to do : expose wrongdoing by officials .

The Iowa caucus is only a few days away and the nation 's attention will be directed to the results , which signify the beginning of the U.S. presidential race .
But does anyone watch who tallies the results of the Iowa caucus ?
The Iowa caucus results were tallied in 2004 by a company that is headed by a man whose company was bought by Elron Electronics , the Israeli defense firm .
I suspect that it will be the same this year .
Do n't expect to see any grassroots political activists doing the tally in Iowa .
The Israeli defense establishment takes care of that part of the American " democratic " election process .
VOXEO
In the summer of 2004 , I first learned that a foreign and out - of - state company using Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) technology tallied the Iowa caucus results .
The system used to tally the 2004 Iowa caucus results was provided by a company called Voxeo , which was apparently based in Orlando , Florida .
( Yellow flag goes up in the mind of those familiar with Orlando and electronic vote fraud history .
See Bollyn article on Wang below . )
The calls from the nearly 2,000 caucus centers in Iowa went to a Voxeo call center in Atlanta , Georgia .
On January 31 , 2005 , I wrote to Michelle Bauer , Iowa 's Secretary of State with some questions about the use of Voxeo , a foreign company located in Florida , to tally the results of the Iowa caucus : Subject : How was the Iowa Caucus Tallied ?
Dear Sirs ,
When I visited the headquarters of the Democratic Party in Des Moines last summer , I learned that the tally of the Iowa caucus had been " out - sourced " to a company in Atlanta , Georgia .
What this means is that the tallying of the Iowa caucus results was done over the telephone , using the touch - tone buttons , to enter the results from each caucus locationS
I am interested in how this was done , and why .
Why did the Democratic Party allow the crucial tally of the caucus results to be done by a company in Atlanta ?
Do n't they trust their own math skills ?
Can any of you provide any information about this matter ?
Kind regards , Christopher Bollyn A person named Mike Milligan wrote back on behalf of Secretary of State Bauer : Mike Milligan wrote : Dear Christopher : The Secretary of State forwarded me the email you sent to then on Monday , January 31 , 2004 [ sic ] regarding the Iowa Caucuses .
Unfortunately , you either received some incorrect information in your travels or are confused .
The Iowa Democratic Party completed all of the caucus night tabulations in Iowa , in the Des Moines / Polk County Convention Center , which was the Caucus night HQ .
In fact , our tech staff wrote the software that tabulated the results .
To answer your second to last question , we feel we have a comfortable grasp of mathematics .
Sincerely , MWM Mike Milligan , Executive Director Iowa Democratic Party ( 515 ) 244-7292 ex. 676 I wrote this note back to Mr. Milligan : Dear Mr. Milligan , I am responding to you about how the caucus results for the Iowa Democratic Party were tallied on the night of the nation 's first caucus .
After checking my sources , I can assure you that it is correct that an out - of - state telephone / computer system tallied the Iowa precinct results .
The system used was provided by Voxeo Corporation based in Orlando , Florida .
The calls went from Iowa to a call center in Atlanta , Georgia .
See : http://www.voxeo.com/
This information was first provided to me last August by John McCormally , Communications Director for the Iowa Democratic Party in Des Moines , Iowa .
Today I called Voxeo ( 800 ) 305-5771 in Orlando and although I did n't go into detail , the receptionist confirmed that Voxeo had conducted the telephone tally of the Iowa Democratic Caucus results .
How is it that you do n't know that ?
McCormally told me that chairmen were selected in all 1,993 precincts and these chairmen called in on touch - tone phones and after giving their PIN number , were able to enter the results from their precinct using the touch - tone number pad .
I 'm not going to go into great detail at this point , but this procedure of using an out - of - state computer company to tally the precinct results for the Iowa Democratic Caucus lacks the transparency and openness that one might expect in this exercise in grass - roots poll .
Clearly , if someone wanted to adjust the results , it would be the easiest thing to do to do it through this computer system in Orlando , Florida .
The Democrats in Iowa would never be aware of it , regardless of their math skills , unless the paper results were carefully audited in an open and honest manner .
Christopher Bollyn THE ISRAELIS & VOXEO
Now , who really is Voxeo , and why are the Iowa caucus results tallied by them ?
I do n't know if the 2008 Iowa results will be tallied in the same way , but I would n't doubt it .
Voxeo is headed by Jonathan Taylor , who is the company 's President and CEO .
This is what his Voxeo webpage says about him : Jonathan combined his experience in both business operations and technology innovation to found Voxeo in 1999 .
Under his guidance , Voxeo has seen triple - digit revenue growth for four consecutive years and has been profitable since January , 2004 .
Prior to Voxeo , Jonathan founded and helped bring three additional software and infrastructure service companies to profitability .
" From 1995 to 1997 , Jonathan was the founder and President of InterResearch and Development Group ( IRdg ) , Inc. IRdg created and licensed iPost - the first internet powered OEM unified messaging solution - to leading telecommunications providers including Ericsson , Motorola and Unisys .
IRdg was acquired by Elron Electronic Industries ( Nasdq : ELRN ) subsidiary MediaGate in 1997 . "
There you have it .
Jonathan Taylor 's company , which he founded , was taken over by Elron Electronic Industries , the Israeli defense high tech company :
In its early days , Elron focused on defense , particularly electronics and avionics , as well as the emerging medical and technology sectors .
In 1966 , Elron founded Elbit , which combined the expertise of the Ministry of Defense - Research Institute in special computer design with Elron 's experience in electronic product design , manufacture and management .

This is important information that Americans need to know and which they will not find in the Zionist - controlled media in the United States .
It needs to be understood that the entire election process in the United States is a fraud .
More than that , it is a fraud that is being perpetrated by the Israeli defense establishment on the naïve and gullible American public .
The sine qua non of an honest and transparent election process is the open counting of the votes by the voters themselves in each polling station in front of the open eyes of other citizens and members of the media .
Any compromise in this most fundamental and essential process which acts to remove the citizenry from the vote - counting process simply cannot be accepted .
This is what Americans MUST get back to , in every polling station in the nation : paper ballots that are hand counted in front of the public .
Nothing else will do to protect their democratic franchise in the United States - NOTHING .

Comment Betreff 1 - 1- 8 Reporter Chris Bollyn Proves Why WE Must Watch and PUBLISH Iowa Count !
December 31st
This article focusus on the DEMOCRATIC PARTY process in 2004 , which probably explains how John Kerry went from no where to " winner " in the Iowa Caucus that year .
Bollyn's article is shocking , and he and his family are now in hiding outside the USA after being tasered for no reason by two Homeland Security - trained plain clothes policemen in Hoffman Estates , Illinois ( near Chicago ) in 2006 .
Also see Bollyn's article , " How a Private Company Counts our Votes on Election Night " linked on the home page of votefraud.org in the lower left hand blue box .
This excellent reporting underscores why all Iowans and NH voters must support Watch the Vote 2008 and the newly up tally board at : www.LibertyBroadcastNetwork.org --
In - home correspondents will be listed for each county in Iowa .
Now all we need is for the Iowa Caucus goers to do one more thing before they go home on Jan 3 , Iowa Caucus nite : make a cell phone call to the in - home correspondent assigned to your county at www.LibertyBroadcastNetwork.org -- and report the eye - witness results you saw at your caucus .
This is how to checkmate any chicanery in the GOP Iowa Caucus ( or the Democratic ) .
( The list of in - home correspondents assigned to your county should be up anytime on LibertyBroadcastNetwork.org .
There will also be an open nationwide conference call on Iowa Caucus nite so people can call in and ask questions anytime throughout the nite if there is any uncertainly on what to do or who to call on the actual Caucus nite . )
It is important to note that Liberty BroadcastNetwork.org has set up a system that goes live IMMEDIATELY on the internet , with updated tallies .
The plan announced by Ron Paul HQ in Iowa appear useless , as Drew Ivers and the other decision makers there are planning to keep the tally secret .
Without going public -- what keeps the Iowa GOP and the Big TV Network consortium ( now called National Election Pool , formerly Voter News Service ) honest ?
A former US Department of Justice ( DOJ ) ethics adviser has joined leading members of the US legal community in calling on Congress to investigate the destruction of tape recordings of interrogations carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) .
Jesselyn Radack  who came to prominence as a whistleblower after she objected to the government ’s treatment of John Walker Lindh , the " American Taliban " captured during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan  told a news teleconference last week that the destroyed tapes are " part of a pattern . "
She said , " There are some five million missing White House e-mails .
No one knows where the hit lists are from the US Attorney massacre .
And now the CIA interrogation videotapes have been erased .
This is criminal . "
" Remember when the Justice Department prosecuted Enron and Arthur Anderson for destruction of evidence and obstruction of justice ?
Now the Justice Department is trying to block congressional oversight and legal proceedings involving this latest scandal , " Radack added .
Radack ’s comments came during the launch of a new campaign , " American Lawyers Defending the Constitution . "
The effort is backed by a statement signed by more than 1,300 lawyers and law students around the country , including former New York governor Mario Cuomo , former Reagan administration official Bruce Fein , leaders of legal organizations and more than 100 law professors in the US .
Their statement calls on House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers and Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy to hold wide - ranging hearings to investigate " unconstitutional and potentially criminal activity by the Bush Administration . "
The " TapeGate " furor erupted after the New York Times revealed in early December that the CIA in 2005 had destroyed at least two videotapes documenting the interrogation of two al - Qaeda operatives in the agency ’s custody , " a step it took in the midst of Congressional and legal scrutiny about its secret detention program , according to current and former government officials . "
The CIA subsequently announced the program .
The videotapes showed agency operatives subjecting terrorism suspects  including Abu Zubaydah , the first detainee in CIA custody  to severe interrogation techniques in 2002 .
In a message to his staff , CIA Director General Michael V. Hayden reportedly said the tapes were destroyed in part because officers were concerned that the video showing harsh interrogation methods could expose agency officials to legal risks .
He also said the tapes no longer had intelligence value .
The destruction of the tapes has raised questions about whether CIA officials withheld information from Congress , the courts and the Sep. 11 commission about aspects of the program .
The CIA program that included the detention and interrogation of terrorism suspects began after the capture of Zubaydah in March 2002 .
The CIA has said that the DOJ and the executive branch reviewed and approved of the use of a set of harsh techniques before they were used on any prisoners , and that the DOJ issued a classified legal opinion in August 2002 that provided explicit authorization for their use .
Other participants on the telephone press conference included Michael Ratner , president of the Center for Constitutional Rights , a legal advocacy group , and Marjorie Cohn , president of the 6,000 - member National Lawyers Guild .
Ratner , whose organization has played a major role in providing defense lawyers for detainees in Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere , underscored the importance of congressional action .
" For far too long Congress has been the handmaiden of the Bush administration ’s undermining and subversion of basic constitutional rights .
The right to be free from torture ; warrantless wiretapping ; jailing without habeas corpus ; and disappearances into secret sites .
Principles going back to the Magna Carta are at stake , " he said .
Ratner called on Congress to " do its job : defend the Constitution from its enemies . "
" Its enemies are the Bush administration , " he stressed .
" Just announcing that investigations will be held and subpoenas will be issued is terribly insufficient unless Congress is willing to enforce the subpoenas by issuing contempt citations , " Ratner said , emphasizing that , " Congress has a constitutional duty to oversee the activities of the executive branch , and our entire system of government is threatened when Congress simply folds before an obstinate executive . "
Cohn , author of the recently published book , Cowboy Republic : Six Ways the Bush Gang Has Defied the Law , told IPS , " From the illegal war in Iraq , to the illegal torture of prisoners in US custody , to the illegal destruction of evidence by the CIA , the Bush administration has become an institution of lawbreakers .
Congress must hold hearings to investigate this lawbreaking , and should authorize the appointment of an independent prosecutor since Michael Mukasey cannot be counted on to conduct an impartial investigation . "
Radack rose to prominence as a major whistleblower in the Lindh case .
In the course of Lindh ’s criminal prosecution , the court ordered all documents associated with his interrogation to be turned over .
After some documents were turned over , Radack was asked about the existence of more documents .
At that time , she looked through the files and discovered that the bulk of her work was missing and had not been turned over .
Radack was able to reconstruct much of her work , and informed her supervisor that her department had not complied with the court order .
She was forced to resign before the documents were turned over .
A criminal investigation into Radack ’s actions was eventually closed with no charges , but her case was referred to the state bar of Maryland , which eventually cleared her of all wrongdoing .
She has never been called to testify before Congress .
The Department of Justice ( DOJ ) said it had no knowledge that Lindh was represented by a lawyer prior to his interrogation , but this position appears to be contradicted by material in Radack ’s files .
Radack told the news conference , " My e-mails documented my advice against interrogating Lindh without a lawyer , and concluded that the FBI committed an ethics violation when it did so anyway .
Both the CIA videotapes and my e-mails were destroyed , in part , because officials were concerned that they documented controversial interrogation methods that could put agency officials in legal jeopardy . "
In a related development , one of America ’s leading constitutional scholars said White House involvement in the CIA ’s decision to destroy videotapes documenting severe interrogation techniques of suspected terrorists could constitute as many as six crimes .
Jonathan Turley , a professor at George Washington University law school in Washington , appeared on CNN to discuss a report by the New York Times that four White House attorneys  including then - White House counsels Alberto Gonzales and Harriet Miers  participated in discussions with the CIA about whether or not the tapes should be destroyed .
Turley said , " There are at least six identifiable crimes here , from obstruction of justice to obstruction of Congress , perjury , conspiracy , false statements , and what is often forgotten : the crime of torturing suspects . "
" If that crime was committed it was a crime that would conceivably be ordered by the president himself , only the president can order those types of special treatments or interrogation techniques , " he added .

Researchers at Princeton University announced Wednesday that common electronic voting machines can be subverted by installing software which undetectably alters vote totals and , as a computer virus , spreads itself from one voting machine to the next .
Computer science professor Edward Felten , along with graduate students Ariel Feldman and J. Alex Halderman , published a paper in which they demonstrated the ease of installing malicious software onto a Diebold AccuVote - TS touchscreen voting machine which would alter vote totals in a real election , but be undetectable to election officials by allowing the logic and accuracy tests to pass , and by deleting itself from the voting machines at the end of the election .
“ This report should finally put to rest the myth that the current generation of e-voting machines adequately protects the integrity of the electoral process , ” said Electronic Frontier Foundation staff attorney Matt Zimmerman .
And to add insult to injury , the team posted videos of the entire process of hacking a Diebold touchscreen voting machine .
This paper presents a fully independent security study of a Diebold AccuVote - TS voting machine , including its hardware and software .
We obtained the machine from a private party .
Analysis of the machine , in light of real election procedures , shows that it is vulnerable to extremely serious attacks .
For example , an attacker who gets physical access to a machine or its removable memory card for as little as one minute could install malicious code ; malicious code on a machine could steal votes undetectably , modifying all records , logs , and counters to be consistent with the fraudulent vote count it creates .
An attacker could also create malicious code that spreads automatically and silently from machine to machine during normal election activities — a voting - machine virus .
We have constructed working demonstrations of these attacks in our lab .
Mitigating these threats will require changes to the voting machine ’s hardware and software and the adoption of more rigorous election procedures .
— Security Analysis of the Diebold AccuVote - TS Voting Machine
Diebold Election Systems marketing director Mark Radke said the researchers should have contacted the company , because they have since updated their system to address some of the issues raised .
“ I ’m concerned by the fact we were n’t contacted to educate these people on where our current technology stands , ” Mark Radke said .
Radke also question why Felten had n’t submitted his paper for peer review , as is commonly done before publishing scientific research .
Felten said he and his colleagues felt it necessary to publish the paper as quickly as possible because of the possible implications for the November midterm elections .
— Associated Press
Considering that Diebold election equipment is about as secure as Swiss cheese , as confirmed by numerous reports over the last couple of years , that the company does n’t care about election security , and that that ’s why they were run out of North Carolina , I do n’t think it will mean all that much that the researchers did n’t wait for peer review .
You can peer review it for yourself by watching the researchers ’ video of the process .
Now do n’t you feel good about your vote last Tuesday ?
The Brad Blog has documented instances all over the country where elections have gone haywire and election officials have been sent scrambling to implement emergency security measures because of security problems such as this .
“ The challenges presented by the introduction of electronic voting are systemic and require a systemic response , ” Zimmerman said .
“ Paper trails , regular audits , and robust physical security are a good start , as are improved pollworker training and radically upgraded machine certification requirements and procedures .
H.R. 550 , making its way through the House of Representatives , would go a long way towards implementing many of these fixes on a nationwide basis . ”
As for Diebold , one funny YouTube video seems to sum it up :
Update : Felten writes on his blog that the locks on the Diebold AccuVote - TS machines which allow access to the memory card slot can be opened with a key anyone can buy on the Internet , such as the key to a hotel minibar .
A court hearing tomorrow , being described by lawyers as unprecedented in UK legal history , will decide whether the death of the man who took the last photograph of George Bernard Shaw must remain a mystery .
Allan Chappelow , 86 , was found murdered in June 2006 in the home where he had lived in Hampstead , north London , for 72 years .
Prosecutors have said , however , that they would rather let Wang Yam , a 45 - year - old financier charged with Mr Chappelow 's murder , walk free than risk having national secrets revealed at his trial , which is due to begin on Tuesday .
Last week an application to overturn the public interest immunity certificate – or gagging order – slapped on the trial by the Home Secretary , Jacqui Smith , failed .
It means that much , or even all , of the trial will be held behind closed doors .

Such is the stringency of the order that the media are even barred from revealing why it has been put in place , other than that it is for " national security " reasons .
The order has , however , raised serious concerns among lawyers and the media .
Anthony Hudson , a barrister specialising in media law at Doughty Street Chambers in London , said the fundamental principle of a fair trial was that it is open to the public .
" One of the reasons is that the publicity surrounding a trial can bring forward more witnesses , " he said .
" Another is that witnesses are much more likely to be careful that their evidence is truthful if the trial is in public because there is a much greater risk a lie will be found out . "
The gagging order was challenged by several media organisations , including The Independent on Sunday , and Mr Yam .
Tomorrow lawyers acting for Mr Yam will go back to the Court of Appeal in a last - ditch attempt to overturn it .
Criminal lawyers say they cannot recall the Crown intervening in such a way in a murder trial before .
Cases that involve breaches of the Official Secrets
Act have been held in private for the self - evident reason that a public trial would expose the secrets .
In a criminal trial , an application can be made to hold all or part of it behind closed doors on the grounds of national security , however .
" I 'm not aware of a murder trial that has been held totally or partly in camera , " Mr Hudson said .
" It is certainly very rare , and very likely unique . "
A reclusive man rarely seen by his neighbours , Mr Chappelow was dead for about a month before he was discovered among rotting furniture and piles of papers in his run-down £ 3 m Georgian townhouse in June 2006 .
His head had been smashed in

Police launched a murder inquiry , speculating that he was the victim of identity fraudsters .
They were alerted by his bank after thousands of pounds went missing , according to reports at the time .
Nine days later a fire swept through the house .
Mr Yam was arrested in Switzerland four months later and extradited to Britain , where he was charged with murder , burglary and deception , charges that he denies .
Whoever did murder Mr Chappelow ended the life of a lonely and vulnerable old man .
He had published several books , including two about the playwright George Bernard Shaw in the 1960s .
He was also a freelance photographer , working for national newspapers in the 1950s .
He took the last photograph of Shaw shortly before the playwright 's death aged 94 .
He inherited the house where he lived from the age of 14 from his antique dealer father and never married or had a girlfriend .
He had little family .
A neighbour , Peter Tausig , said : " He always had gripes about his neighbours , the council or the post office , and would regularly fire off letters to them all . "
His home was in a dilapidated condition – it was on the English Heritage At Risk register – because he did not like change .
He had also been seen fixing broken tiles with adhesive tape .
After his death , another of his neighbours , Peggy Sparrow , said : " He was naive .
He used to say to me how terribly clever I was to have had four children .
To Alan , it was like a miracle .
But he did occasionally have his eye on people .
He once tried to get my sister to go on a holiday to Albania on his motorbike .
She politely declined .
" In April we had a card from America .
He said he had gone to see a long - lost cousin and was having a lovely time . "
I personally pretty much gave up on Impeachment a few months ago when it became clear to me that it was n't likely to happen .
Once I accepted that into my head and heart I started on my own type of campaign , but I will talk about that farther down .
That said , while stewing over this lack of coverage I thought about all the airtime and print the Religious Right gets anytime they fart about some issue they want heard .
Once again the " Liberal Media " has shown they are n't liberal at all , and it 's just more propaganda to coverup the facts of life and this illegal war in Iraq .
You can bet if the Press were Liberal this next part would be on the Front Page of every paper .
The letter says that impeachment is warranted for their " deceiving the public under the false pretense that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction " and " destroying " the reputation of the United States and the good will of other nations .
" The time for impeachment is now — before the example of George W. Bush ’s regime is set in stone , " they wrote .
" Future generations will thank you for preserving the freedom of our nation and its relation to the entire human community . "
Coalition of nuns calls for impeaching Bush and Cheney
While I believe there is still time to Impeach these two crook and traitors , and that once it got going the majority of Americans would get behind it if all the lies and crimes were exposed for all to see , with irrefutable evidence , I doubt that Congress has what it take to make that 1st move .
If Conyers were a man of his word he would of started the process by now .
Since I came to the above conclusions a while back I decided to start trying to get people to make our Candidates for President commit to bringing criminal charges once they take office .
My one man movement has been named " Ask the Question " .
Today it is not quite a one man deal because others have begun to think along the same lines .
There has even been a diary or 2 on the same issue here at dkos .
I started by just dropping comments in Open Threads , and in the comment sections of diarys where it fit the topic , as I still do when it fits .
The Question is to Hillary , Obama , Edwards , Gore and any other candidate :
Will you promise if elected , to direct your new Atty .
General to appoint a Special Prosecutor to investigate all the crime and corruption of the Bush Admnistration ?
Crimes in violation of Civil Rights , War Profiteering , Torture , War Crimes , Domestic Spying , Etc. and will you further swear to bring them to trial and to do it without issuing Pardons to anyone found quilty of any crimes ?
I have yet to hear any Candidate even mention this issue in passing .
When Pres .
Ford made the claim that it was best to let our country heal rather than prosecute Nixon and Agnew and others , it was damaging to our country and set up what has happen with Bush and Cheney .
If Nixon had gone to jail then I have no doubt that Cheney , the chickhawk that he is , would not of had the guts to chance ending up in prison .
If that is true , none of what has happen in the last 5 years would be destroying our country today .
If you have the chance during the next 500 days to confront any candidate I beg of you to ask the question , and demand a answer .
The future of our nation rests on how this is handled after Bush leaves office .
He should never be free to go on a speech - giving tour to " refill his coffers with expensive speaking fees "
Update : I 'm touched this made the big list .
Thank you everyone , please let your friends and family know about this since the Media has n't .
At the 2007 Montreal Games Summit taking place November 27th and 28th , the keynote was given by veteran Nintendo game developer Yoshiaki Koizumi , who discussed the path taken from Super Mario 64 to Super Mario Galaxy , and how the development team , along with Shigeru Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma , has continued to challenge themselves in the 3D game space .
During his 16 - year career at Nintendo , Koizumi has worked as a scriptwriter for The Legend of Zelda : Link 's Awakening and as an assistant game director for Super Mario 64 .
Later , he worked on The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time and The Legend of Zelda : Majora 's Mask , as well as Super Mario Sunshine and Donkey Kong Jungle Beat as game director .
Most recently , he headed development of Super Mario Galaxy as game director .
The Early Days
Began Koizumi , " The period between Mario 64 and Mario Galaxy was like the journey in a long road movie : sometimes fun , sometimes hard . "
He recalled learning about 3D technology , research and development during the Super Famicom period .
In college , Koizumi said he mostly focused on how to create images , but did some 3D CG on his own time .
Nintendo liked his work , and he was assigned to Miyamoto 's group .
He had the chance to put that background to use with the Nintendo 64 .
His first step was Mario 's first step - it began with making the character walk .
Koizumi created a Mario motion model and textures and worked out a few actions ; controlling the character felt " new and fresh , " Koizumi said .
Koizumi noted that Miyamoto is known for taking lots of trouble to get key elements just right -- Koizumi called his demands " numerous and exacting " -- especially important in this case as players around the world spend a lot of time in Mario 's shoes .
Koizumi recalled one late night in the development room , about 1 or 2 AM , when most of the staff had gone home .
Miyamoto approached Koizumi to ask about a Mario animation , and then ended up demonstrating the right motions himself by acting them out .
Koizumi mused that despite Miyamoto 's background in art and design , he must have thought acting the animation out would be faster and more accurate .
" We may look like we 're acting out sketch comedy , but it really does work well to get the point across , " Koizumi explained , adding that players can judge a game harshly for a player character that does n't " feel " right .
For example , Koizumi noted , if Mario could n't jump , even the lowly Goomba would be unstoppable .
But empowering Mario with the simple ability to jump , thereby breaking blocks and stomping enemies , opens up several new and connected possibilities just by offering the player one ability .
Koizumi calls it player - based design : the right balance of fun and complexity with the player first in mind .
" That 's why it 's so important , and that 's why we have to be so particular about getting it right , " he said .
Highlighting other areas the team focuses on , Koizumi said that according to Miyamoto , " the greatest appeal of working on 3d games is the camera . "
He explained that cameras allow developers to provide several angles at the same time , opening up new opportunities over the days of NES and SNES .
The Miniature Garden
Koizumi continued that the more amazing factor is the ease and freedom with which the gameplay itself can be changed just by moving the viewpoint and camera .
He continued , " During Mario 64 , we had to ask , ' what kind of camera is best suited for this gameplay ? ' "
He explained the different types of camera angles considered for Mario 64 : A parallel camera , which with its resemblance to 2D is easiest for the player to use without getting lost , or a tower camera , which allows the maintenance of a straight - on side view as in a true sidescroller .
Lastly , the follow camera is exactly that -- it follows just behind the player .
There are other camera types as well , for when Mario is flying and swimming .
He added , " Thinking about the camera is game design , too . "
The different camera types allow player to explore the plains and mountains of a virtual world , said Koizumi , " much like I used to find so many surprises , as the miniature gardens one finds in boxes in Japan . "
This aesthetic , he continued , was something he tried to carry over into Ocarina of Time , describing the aim of making that game into " a movie you could touch . "
It featured scenery that changed with time and a setting that made you feel the natural rhythms of waking up in the morning , with creatures coming out only at night .
For Mario Sunshine on the GameCube , " we tried to create a big water park island that made you feel like you were on vacation ... [ bringing ] out in every screen the fun of exploring the miniature garden . "
But , Koizumi explained , even creating a miniature garden can have its own difficulties and battles behind the scenes .
There are issues with 3D action , including problematic depth perception , getting lost , and even getting motion sickness .
Those phrases , Koizumi said , are the keys the team worries the most about when creating a game in a 3D world .
But Koizumi also stressed a focus on the positive , like creating a sense of surprise so that the player can be astonished by the world .
To do this , Koizumi explained , you have to completely eliminate all the problems that obstruct ease of play .
Problem 1 : Depth Perception
One example is the difficulty of stomping Goomba enemies in 3D , a basic , typical activity in a Mario game .
" On the TV screen , objects do n't have the same kind of physicality , " he said .
" That 's what makes it difficult to make people grasp the physicality and depth . "
One solution is adding shadow .
" We decided to drop a shadow on the ground everywhere in Mario 64 , " said Koizumi .
" That way , every floating object would have a reference point on the ground . "
Shadows are so effective at conveying depth , said Koizumi , that adding them has become an " iron - clad necessity , " having shadows fall directly under the character regardless of the light source .
" It might not be realistic , but it 's much easier to play with the shadow directly below , " he added .
Mario Sunshine added a new kind of " hover " jump -- enabling the player to hover in the air a moment by shooting water .
This resolved some ambiguity and depth problems , but even with these new ideas , resolving height and depth perception proved challenging -- something Koizumi's team never could have imagined working on 2D platformers .
But then , Koizumi had a thought : " Just because Mario has always jumped and stomped does n't mean that he always has to - what about making a game where it 's fun to just run around ? "
Sneaking around behind and grabbing Bowser 's tail , for example , is something players would never be able to do in a 2D game .
Sunshine added another departure from stomping by allowing Mario to spray an enemy with water , creating fun without the need to analyze depth as much .
Similar difficulties faced Ocarina of Time , where Link must be able to strike with a sword -- difficult without the ability to determine distance and direction .
So the team devised a plan for the motion of the camera as if the two were on a single axis .
This way , the player can keep an eye on the enemy and reduce frustration from losing line of sight and perceiving distance .
Problem 2 : Getting Lost
Koizumi mentioned that he'd heard talk about how some people can read maps and some can't .
In a 2D Mario game , the sky is up , the ground is down , and everyone goes right on their way to a goal .
Mario 64 also sent players after a goal , but things were n't quite as simple back in the time when few had yet gained experience with rotating a camera .
Why not just give the player a map ?
According to Koizumi , if you want them to stay in the action without pausing , there 's no time to look at a map - " that 's why we included large landmarks so players could orient themselves without stopping , " he explained .
Just as many famous cities have their own landmarks , Mario Sunshine has a large floodgate in the middle of town , for example -- and to make things even easier , Koizumi dropped in arrow signs as guides .
Problem 3 : Motion Sickness
In Mario games , players press a button to jump and camera follows .
Koizumi noted that this camera pitch can make some people ill .
There are various theories , he explained , about why this occurs -- for example , a disconnect between the sense of motion and the lack of motion sensed by the inner ear .
In the case of Mario , Koizumi continued , rapid and repeated screen scrolling was most likely to cause this discomfort , so he thought of ways to minimize this .
Nintendo's solution was to implement a " vertical shake cushion " -- when Mario's in the center of the screen , the camera wo n't pan , but if he 's about to go off , it will .
Nonetheless , Koizumi noted it 's extremely difficult to create a perfect control environment .
" That was why we allowed the player to control the camera freely in Sunshine and OOT -- but when they did , the overall control scheme became too complex . "
He continued , " As a result , we divided the group of people that might have enjoyed the game - that might have been when some people decided that gaming in 3D was too difficult . "
At a Crossroads
At this point , Koizumi said , he wondered , " Could I really continue to find and implement surprise and ease of play in these types of games ? "
He decided to just close off possibilities in his mind for future Mario games .
Then , in 2003 , Koizumi changed his base of operations to EAD Tokyo .
While there , he started planning a new Donkey Kong game , Jungle Beat .
The team decided to make a 2D action game using bongos , featuring a new clapping sensor , and only 3 buttons total .
With this very simple control scheme -- no control pad , and only three buttons -- they set it up so that when the player encounters an enemy , the screen switches its vantage point and changes its control scheme - they called it " contextual binding . "
Explained Koizumi , " Changing up player abilities and actions allowed us to create varied and striking player actions with a few buttons . "
But the controls were n't going to be enough , Koizumi said -- they had to motivate the player to really want to hit things .
So they made the presentation " over the top . "
Said Koizumi , " These new concepts allowed me to get back in touch with my earlier thoughts about surprise and ease of play . "
He continued , " Through this I found to get the player to enjoy a game with real ease of play , the developer has to be thoughtful , and there are no shortcuts . "
He continued , " Jungle Beat turned out to be a really remarkable game , even just by the appearance of someone playing it .
I aimed to create a game that would make even bystanders giggle and enjoy themselves . "
So successful was the team that Nintendo received letters saying , " When I get carried away , my family complains the bongos are too loud " --
" At least the person playing was having a good time ! " Koizumi joked .
The takeaway lesson for Koizumi here was that the family needs to be able to enjoy the game too - " This became a new theme for me to pursue , " he said .
Gaining the good will of the family toward gaming systems became the team 's new goal .
A New Theme
So in 2005 , a spec sheet was created for " Super Mario Revolutions " .
Koizumi explained , " The concept was to play with Mario running around on spherical objects - something Miyamoto had come up with 5 years before , and something I came up with too .
Why spherical worlds ...
What distinctive features attracted us to spherical worlds ?
Was it just because they were novel ? "
He explained that no matter how large you make the playing field , if you walk long enough you will run into a wall , and that will make you turn around , which makes the camera turn around and runs the risk of making the player lost .
With a sphere , Mario can run all he wants without falling or hitting a wall ... a useful concept for getting players totally absorbed in the moment .
Koizumi added that the best thing about spherical worlds is the " unity of surface , " and the " connectedness . "
Neither will the player get lost easily , or need to adjust the camera - by using spheres , Koizumi said , they had created a game field that never ended .
This became the overall theme of development - " we should tune the game so people can play without ever having to think about the camera , " Koizumi said .
" Frankly , it took a very long struggle , but we finally found the direction we needed . "
The Planet Camera
Mario Galaxy 's " planet camera " also provides a sense of gravity , Koizumi said , demonstrating the difference in field when walking on a planet 's underside .
The camera depicts Mario walking over the planet -- even though he 's changing position all the time , he never has to move .
Because of this , Mario can even play upside down , and avoiding large camera movements also means less motion sickness and fewer players getting lost .
Galaxy also adds two new actions only possible with Wii -- one is the spin attack , and the other is the use of the pointer to gather stars .
The spin attack provides an alternative for players for whom mis-perception of depth makes it a challenge to stomp Goombas .
The spin fulfilled other roles as well , like launching coconuts or twisting a screw .
" You could use the spin for almost any interaction where you did n't know what else to do , " Koizumi added .
" The spirit of simplicity we used in Jungle Beat comes out very well here . "
And the Wii system , according to Koizumi , also helped achieve the earlier goal of bringing families together in the living room .
This extended into the co-op play mode , so that with one extra Wii remote , family and friends could join in the game .
" I hope I 've impressed upon you that Galaxy came not just from one idea , but [ from ] 13 years of dealing with these challenges , " He said .
Beyond The Galaxy
" I know I said that development was like the journey , but perhaps it 's like a series of episodes that call out different staff members like Mr. Miyamoto -- but do n't get the impression that the journey is over , " said Koizumi .
" There 's a long way to go before we reach our destination . "
He continued , " The journey goes on , and everything we learned is like another sign post - when I get back to Tokyo I have to start planning again
So what 's next after Galaxy ?
Said Koizumi , " I imagine all of you are as drawn to the long journey of development as I am .
But as on any long journey , not every step is pleasant , some days you can't get the ideas to get out right , and you might be distracted by family , boss , or relations with co-workers . "
He continued , " What do you do when you find yourself stopped there at those crossroads ?
What I do is try to increase the number of choices I can make - if I can't do it alone , I look for someone that can help broaden my options .
Then I do my best to follow our chosen path - it might be uphill but I try to walk that path proudly . "
Concluded Koizumi , " I 'm sure some of you here are on a journey right now , or getting ready to start one .
Please - enjoy the journey .
Believe firmly that games that are fun to make are always fun to play when they reach the consumer . "
What better selection for the book club than the first novel of all time ?
And of course , we have to read the best possible unabridged translation .
No baby mode here at GeekNights
The plot revolves around Genji , who is the son of the Emperor and a low ranking concubine .
Genji is removed from the line of succession , and proceeds to go on an epic journey .
The journey involves tons of romance and court drama .
Spicy !
Despite being older than any other novel , The Tale of Genji has a tremendous amount of relevance to the geeks of the 21st century .
The influence of Japan on nerds around the world is undeniable , and a surprising amount of things we see in pop culture are present here in a book from the 11th century .
I 'm quite confident after reading it how we will notice how many newer stories have been making references to this tale without us realizing it .
Also , I feel the need to point out that this first novel ever written was written by a woman .
For all these reasons and so many more , this is more than worthy of book club selection .
I 'm a fighting liberal
You know , I 've studied history , I 've read about America and you know something , if it were n't for liberals , we'd be living in a dark , evil country , far worse than anything Bush could conjure up .
A world where children were told to piss on the side of the road because they were n't fit to pee in a white outhouse , where women had to get back alley abortions and where rape was a joke , unless the alleged criminal was black , whereupon he was hung from a tree and castrated .
What has conservatism given America ?
A stable social order ?
A peaceful homelife ?
Respect for law and order ?
No .
Hell , no .
It has n't given us anything we did n't have and it wants to take away our freedoms .
The Founding Fathers , as flawed as they were , slaveowners and pornographers , smugglers and terrorists , understood one thing , a man 's path to God needed no help from the state .
Is the religion of these conservatives so fragile that they need the state to prop it up , to tell us how to pray and think ?
Is that what they stand for ?
Is that their America ?
Conservatism plays on fear and thrives on lies and dishonesty .
I grew up with honest , decent conservatives and those people have been replaced by the party of greed .
It is one thing to want less government interference and smaller , fiscally responsible government .
It is another thing entirely to be a corporate whore , selling out to the highest bidder because the CEO fattens your campaign chest .
They are building an America which can not be sustained .
One based on the benefit of the few at the cost of the many .
The indifferent boss who hires too few people and works them to death or until they break down sick .
Cheap labor capitalism has replaced common sense .
" Globalism " which is really guise for exploitation , replaced fair trade , which is nothing like fair for the trapped semi-slaves of the maquliadoras .
In the Texas border towns , hundreds of these women have been used as sex slaves and then apparently killed , the FBI powerless to do anything as the criminals sit in Mexico untouched by law .
For the better part of a decade , the conservatives made liberal a dirty word .
Well , it is n't .
It represents the best and most noble nature of what America stands for : equitable government services , old age pensions , health care , education , fair trials and humane imprisonment .
It is the heart and soul of what made American different and better than other countries .
Not only an escape from oppression , but the opportunity to thrive in land free of tradition and the repression that can bring .
We offered a democracy which did n't enshrine the rich and made them feel they had an obligation to their workers .
Bush and the people around him disdain that .
They think , by accident of birth and circumstance , they were meant to rule the world and those who did not agree would suffer .
Liberal does not and has not meant weak until the conservatives said it did .
Was Martin Luther King weak ?
Bobby Kennedy ?
Gene McCarthy ?
It was the liberals who remade this country and ended legal segregation and legal sexism .
Not the conservatives , who wanted to hold on to the old ways .
It 's time to regain the sprit of FDR and Truman and the people around them .
People who believed in the public good over private gain .
It is time to stop apologizing for being a liberal and be proud to fight for your beliefs .
No more shying away or being defined by other people .
Liberals believe in a strong defense and punishment for crime .
But not preemption and pointless jail sentences .
We believe no American should be turned away from a hospital because they are too poor or lack a proper legal defense .
We believe that people should make enough from one job to live on , to spend time on raising their family .
We believe that individuals and not the state should dictate who gets married and why .
The best way to defend marriage is to expand , not restrict it .
It was the liberals who opposed the Nazis while the conservatives were plotting to get their brown shirts or fund Hitler .
It was the liberals who warned about Spain and fought there , who joined the RAF to fight the Germans , who brought democracy to Germany and Japan .
Let us not forget it was the conservatives who opposed defending America until the Germans sank our ships .
They would have done nothing as Britain came under Nazi control .
It was they who supported Joe McCarthy and his baseless , drink fueled claims .
Without liberals , there would be no modern America , just a Nazi sattlelite state .
Liberals weak on defense ?
Liberals created America 's defense .
The conservatives only need vets at election time .
It is time to stop looking for an accomodation with the right .
They want none for us .
They want to win , at any price .
So , you have a choice : be a fighting liberal or sit quietly .
I know what I am , what are you ?

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Billionaire Warren Buffett on Wednesday endorsed the estate tax as a check on wealth accumulation , while two senior U.S. senators said they want the tax repealed .
Warren Buffett , chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway , sits in front of a Forbes Magazine which lists the top 400 wealthiest Americans , before speaking at a Senate Finance Committee hearing about " Federal Estate Tax : Uncertainty in Planning Under the Current Law " on Capitol Hill in Washington , November 14 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Jason Reed
Revisiting a long - standing debate over the controversial tax , the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing where Chairman Max Baucus said he supports ending the estate tax , although he said he did not expect this to happen any time soon .
“ I think everyone in this room knows we ’re not going to repeal the estate tax .
It ’s not going to happen in the foreseeable future , ” he said .
The Montana Democrat was joined by Iowa Sen .
Charles Grassley , the panel ’s top Republican , who said , “ The estate tax is unjust .
...
Death should not be a taxable event . ”
But Buffett , the second - richest man in America after Bill Gates , according to Forbes magazine , said recent tax law changes have tended to benefit people like him .
“ Dynastic wealth , the enemy of a meritocracy , is on the rise .
Equality of opportunity has been on the decline , ” Buffett said .
“ A progressive and meaningful estate tax is needed to curb the movement of a democracy toward plutocracy . ”
Buffett , the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway BRKa .
N questioned any effort to further cut taxes for the wealthy .
“ Further shifting of this burden away from the super - rich is not the way to go , ” he said .
“ In a country that prides itself on equality of opportunity , it ’s becoming anything but that as the gap between the super - rich and the middle class is widening . ”
Under present law , maximum estate tax levels have edged down to 45 percent from 55 percent in 2001 .
The rate goes to zero in 2010 but returns to 55 percent in 2011 if lawmakers do nothing , which looks unlikely .
Colorado Democratic Sen. Ken Salazar said at the hearing : “ I do n’t think there ’s going to be a repeal of the estate tax here .
But there is going to be a reform . ”
Kentucky Republican Sen. Jim Bunning said repeal has proven to be politically unattainable .
“ We ca n’t get that done ...
We ought to be able to come to a compromise , ” he said .
Congress ’ Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that 9,600 U.S. estates will be subject to the estate tax in 2009 .
The number will jump to an estimated 62,000 in 2011 and continue rising annually after that , it said .
The group says young people need to know about the risks of sex
In a letter to the Times newspaper , the Terrence Higgins Trust , the NSPCC and the National Union of Teachers said all pupils were " entitled to " such lessons .
Children needed to know about health risks and where to get advice , it said .
Ministers said schools were teaching about sex and that teenage pregnancy rates were the lowest for 20 years .
The call from the group of charities and other organisations comes after a study found almost half of young people had not been taught about teenage pregnancy .
No school should be able to opt out of delivering good sex and relationships education to their pupils
Letter to the Times
The UK Youth Parliament survey in the summer also found the same number of young people did not know where to find their local sexual health clinic .
The letter to the Times says these figures go " some way to explaining " the disproportionately high rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections in Britain .
Nick Partridge , chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust , Dame Mary Marsh , chief executive of the NSPCC , Steve Sinnott , general secretary of the National Union of Teachers , Kevin Barron , chairman of the House of Commons health committee , and TV presenter Davina McCall all signed the letter .
' No opt - out '
It says : " We believe that all children and young people are entitled to receive sex and relationships education ( SRE ) as part of the statutory provision of personal , social , health and economic education ( PSHE Education ) in schools .
" No school should be able to opt out of delivering good sex and relationships education to their pupils ( including primary schools , faith schools and academies ) , which should be taught throughout a pupil 's time in education . "
Young people would be handing over their own proposals on sex and relationship education to Schools Minister Jim Knight this week , the group said .
" We urge the government to listen to what they have to say . "
In a statement , Mr Knight said parents did not have the right to withdraw their children from the statutory sex and education part of the curriculum , only the optional PHSE element .
Schools were teaching about the risks of unprotected sex and directing young people to local services where they could access contraceptive and sexual health advice , he added .
" Nevertheless , our teenage pregnancy strategy is working - teenage pregnancy rates are at their lowest for 20 years . "
Four years before Pearl Harbor , no less .
I ’d never heard of this before , but NPR has a story about Japanese warplanes attacking the USS Panay , a ship sent to rescue Americans from the Battle ( aka Rape ) of Nanking , on December 12 , 1937 .
The US was neutral and its military presence in China was solely to protect corporate interests , specifically Standard Oil tankers .
Why the attack , then ?
Spark says the chaos in Nanking created an opportunity for renegade factions within the Japanese army who wanted the United States and China to “ get into an active conflict so that the Japanese could once and for all drive the United States out of China . ”
Did n’t work that time — the attack was a PR disaster and the Japanese government had to apologize profusely — but those same factions got their way again four years later .
Lucky for us , there was a newreelist on board .
Here ’s a taste of the Uncensored !!! and Unedited !!!

Facebook WASHINGTON ( AP )  Democrat Barack Obama introduced a Senate resolution late Thursday that says President Bush does not have authority to use military force against Iran , the latest move in a debate with presidential rival Hillary Rodham Clinton about how to respond to that country 's nuclear ambitions .
Clinton 's campaign accused Obama of playing politics instead of taking a leadership role from the outset .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton said the Illinois senator drafted the measure in an effort to " nullify the vote the Senate took to give the president the benefit of the doubt on Iran . "
Burton was referring to an amendment sponsored by Sens. Jon Kyl , R - Ariz. , and Joe Lieberman , an independent from Connecticut , that passed 76 - 22 on Sept. 26 and designates Iran 's Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization .
Clinton was the only Senate Democrat running for president to support the measure , and her rivals have argued that Bush could use it to justify war with Iran .
Clinton insists her vote would not support military strikes and instead was a vote for stepped - up diplomacy .
Last week , the Bush administration declared the Revolutionary Guard a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction and announced new sanctions meant to isolate Iran .
The Iranian government contends its nuclear program is aimed only toward providing nuclear power .
Clinton and 29 other senators wrote to Bush Thursday to tell him he has no congressional authority for war with Iran .
The four Democratic senators running for the White House split over whether to sign the letter .
Chris Dodd of Connecticut added his support , while Obama and Joe Biden of Delaware declined .
The letter accuses Bush of " provocative statements and actions stemming from your administration with respect to possible U.S. military action in Iran . "
" We wish to emphasize that no congressional authority exists for unilateral military action against Iran , " it says .
That includes the Kyl - Lieberman amendment , the letter says .
Obama missed the vote on the amendment because he was campaigning .
Clinton spokesman Phil Singer said if Obama was so concerned about the amendment , he should have been there to vote against it .
Singer said Obama also should have signed Webb 's letter and co-sponsored two other pieces of legislation that reaffirm the president cannot use force against Iran without congressional approval .
" It 's unfortunate that ( Senator ) Obama is abandoning the politics of hope in favor of the kind of political games he is so critical of in his book , " Singer said .
He pointed to a passage in " The Audacity of Hope " where Obama is critical of the tendency to " exaggerate or demonize , oversimplify or overstate our case . "
Said Obama spokesman Bill Burton : " With her vote for the war in Iraq and her vote for the Kyl - Lieberman amendment , Hillary Clinton has now given George Bush the benefit of the doubt not once , but twice .
While she 's trying her best to change her position on yet another critical issue facing our country , Senator Obama knows that it takes legislation , not letters , to undo the vote that she cast . "
His resolution says any offensive military action against Iran must be explicitly authorized by Congress , and seeks to clarify that nothing approved so far provides that authority .
Biden spokeswoman Elizabeth Alexander said Biden believes the amendment could be used to justify military action .
" He has also made clear many times his view that the president lacks the authority to use force against Iran absent authorization from Congress , " she said .
" He did n't need to clarify that position .
He 's been clear from the start . "
Even though Dodd shares that view , he signed the letter because " we felt that it was necessary to make it clear that this administration cannot take military action against Iran without the express authorization of Congress , " said Dodd spokesman Hari Sevugan .

As the Congress debates the merits of the Patients ’ Bill of Rights , we are once again told to believe that the federal government can save us all from a problem they created in the first place .
Although over 80 % of HMO ’s users report satisfaction with their service , the feds are all in a tizzy over the apparent " health care crisis " that we are all experiencing thanks to HMO’s .
According to the media accounts of what is wrong with American health care , HMO ’s ( or " managed care " ) are a terrible corporate demon foisted upon the American public over the will of benevolent government by a gang of profiteering faceless corporations committed to keeping the public feeble and in ill health in order to save themselves a few bucks on employee benefits .
The real story of HMO ’s , of course , is one of considerable government meddling and regulation which ended in spiraling health costs which , not surprisingly , begat more government meddling and regulation .
HMO ’s are part of the legacy of price and wage controls supported by " conservative " president Richard Nixon who supported them ( among other ill - conceived reasons ) as a means for controlling health care costs .
The high costs of the early seventies were not produced by free market health care , but by the ever expanding government giveaways of Medicare and Medicaid which removed individuals from the process of making health care transactions and created a situation where third parties ( i.e. government ) were making the payments to health care providers .
You can imagine that in a system where the consumer of health services is responsible for none of the costs , a little excess demand might result .
And that was indeed the result .
No longer restrained by paying for health care , patients ended up in the doctor ’s office for every stubbed toe and every bloody nose resulting in spiraling health care costs due to such massively inflated demand .
Far from being free - market health care as Ted Kennedy would have you believe , managed care has always been a system of complex government regulation which favors large politically influential insurance companies over smaller more entrepreneurial insurance companies .
To claim that there is anything even remotely resembling a competitive marketplace in health care is absolutely preposterous .
In fact , the United States government controls over 45 % of the health care industry in the United States .
In Canada , home of socialized medicine , the number is 75 % .
Now , the Congress is trying to tell us that we need more of their regulations to ensure that better quality care can be assured to all Americans .
The biggest problem that people have with HMO ’s is the control of expenditure by reviewing and managing doctor recommended treatment options that sometimes end in denial over physician recommendations .
Can government solve this problem ?
The last time I checked , Canadians were waiting for months and even years to receive treatments that the government had decided against funding .
In Britain , the non-government health care sector is exploding because so many Brits must go outside the government health services to receive treatment .
( In the US , it is illegal for recipients of government health care to purchase private services from a Medicare / Medicaid doctor unless the doctor gives up all other patients for two years . )
To be sure , managed care systems have actually done a pretty good job of keeping down health care costs in the face of constant government attempts to increase those costs .
Let ’s not be so foolish , though , as to call HMO ’s some kind of free - market solution .
The rising costs and occasionally refused procedure at HMO ’s exist because of government regulation .
The problems are there because government has doggedly refused to let the marketplace work , and has put in its place a system which destroys the patient ’s ability to control which services he wishes to receive and what kind of insurance and what level of insurance coverage ( if any ) he wishes to purchase .
Thanks to massive government health programs , and government collusion with private companies who have purchased political clout , we have destroyed the healthcare marketplace and yet the private healthcare economy somehow manages to be posthumously responsible for all the woes that the Patient ’s Bill of Rights claims to remedy .
Even the proponents of the bill have to admit that the bill will do nothing to make health care more affordable .
It will only further decrease consumer responsibility and further inflate demand and costs as health care providers are laid bare in court to face the wrath of consumers who do n’t even pay for their care in the first place .
Yet the Congress will fight ever harder because the bill gives the illusion of solving the problem .
The Patient ’s Bill of Rights is just more of what we have seen for the last thirty years , and no amount of government intervention can solve rising health care costs .
The only solution is to put consumers back in control of their own health care purchases , end the government / corporate lobby - fest on Capitol Hill , and to resurrect the healthcare marketplace that was killed by government so long ago .
The Best of Ryan McMaken
Duane “ Dog ” Chapman , who makes an ass of himself on A&E on a regular basis , has really stepped in it this time :
A&E has suspended production on its hit reality series Dog the Bounty Hunter in light of some — to put it mildly — racially insensitive remarks its star looks to have made during a phone conversation with his son Tucker , a recording of which was duly posted online by The National Enquirer .
Now , when you hear “ The National Enquirer , ” you are immediately skeptical , but I heard this tape :
“ I ’m not taking a chance … not because she ’s black but because we use the word n—– sometimes here .
I ’m not going to take any chance ever in life of losing everything I ’ve worked for 30 years because some drunken n—– heard us say n—– and turned us into the Enquirer magazine …I ’m not taking that chance at all never in life .
Never … ”
Oooops , sorry , the Enquirer got the tape .
What .
A. Racist .
Bigot .
It always amazes me that there are still people like this .
There ’s no place for anything like that ever .
Oh !
His statement :
“ My sincerest , heartfelt apologies go out to every person I have offended for my regrettable use of very inappropriate language , ” he continued .
“ I am deeply disappointed in myself for speaking out of anger to my son and using such a hateful term in a private phone conversation .
“ I was disappointed in his choice of a friend , not due to her race , but her character .
However , I should have never used that term . ”
Got that ?
He was n’t disappointed that his son was dating a black person .
He was disappointed that his son had a black friend .
Huge difference .
Yeah .
Explains why he did n’t want to go to jail in Mexico though .
He probably would have been more comfortable in a lily white jail .
What a shithead .
I hope his son disowns him .
And kudos to A&E for immediately pulling him off the air !
The warlords of Washington do n’t care about international public opinion , and that goes double for what Americans think .
The politicians , the bureaucrats , the policy wonks , and the lobbyists ( both foreign and domestic ) could care less that the people of this country , and the world , have a very low opinion of their deadly antics : all the elites know or care about is that they have the power  and the will to use it .
Do Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the Iraq war ?
Well , is n’t that tough : they ’ll just have to grin and bear it , because  guess what ?
 we know better .
An imperious hauteur that would do Marie Antoinette proud is the defining trait of the Washington elites in government , the major think tanks , and the " mainstream " ( i.e. , dying ) media .
Their defiance of the popular will in regard to the Iraq war is just one example : their insistence that we might very well have to fight yet another war is the latest display of their unbridled arrogance .
So certain are these Washington know - it - alls that they have the political system effectively rigged and the media in their back pockets that they do n’t even bother to disguise their eagerness to unleash the American military against a new enemy .
Iran seems to be the Hitler du jour , with all the usual suspects clamoring for a strike at Tehran , and others pointing to Lebanon , Syria , and Somalia as new frontiers in the push to establish an American empire of the Middle East .
I wrote about this last Monday , in " Wars to Watch Out For , " but neglected one important potential battlefield : Pakistan .
The tag team of Frederick W. Kagan and Michael O’Hanlon did n’t forget , though .
Their New York Times op - ed piece has brought the War Party ’s latest project to the table where all the Very Serious People gather in solemn conclave : the invasion and pacification of Pakistan in the event the regime of Gen. Pervez Musharraf collapses under the weight of protest .
They state their premise at the very start : " As the government of Pakistan totters , we must face a fact : the United States simply could not stand by as a nuclear - armed Pakistan descended into the abyss . "
This is stated as an unassailable fact , an axiom that does n’t need to be proved because it is self - evident .
Except it is n’t .
If the Musharraf regime folds under pressure , the general ’s successor would not be Osama bin Laden , but Benazir Bhutto .
However , the Kagan - O’Hanlon thesis does not take Bhutto or any other opposition party into account .
We only hear about those sinister " sympathizers and supporters of the Afghan Taliban , " not to mention " nationalists bent on seizing the disputed province of Kashmir from India .
These " extremists " will  somehow  seize power and hand over nuclear weapons to al - Qaeda .
As Kagan and O’Hanlon put it :
" The most likely possible dangers are these : a complete collapse of Pakistani government rule that allows an extreme Islamist movement to fill the vacuum ; a total loss of federal control over outlying provinces , which splinter along ethnic and tribal lines ; or a struggle within the Pakistani military in which the minority sympathetic to the Taliban and al - Qaeda try to establish Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism . "
In less than two paragraphs , the enemy has gone from being evil " nationalists " who want to press Pakistan ’s debatable claim to the Vale of Kashmir , and an allegedly pro-Taliban faction of the intelligence services , to the horrifying specter of al - Qaeda with nukes .
No mention is made of Bhutto ’s Pakistan People ’s Party  which is the driving force behind the anti-Musharraf demonstrations , not the Islamists .
In any case , al - Qaeda is not about to take power in Islamabad .
Yeah , yeah , " that ’s what they said about the shah of Iran , " aver Kagan and O’Hanlon , but Khomeini was not al - Qaeda , either .
That ’s the hallmark of the Kagan - O’Hanlon method , which is also the methodology of the neoconservatives , whose arguments they synopsize and sell to policymakers as products of the " bipartisan center " : conflating wildly disparate elements and somehow always linking them all to al - Qaeda .
That has been the modus operandi of the War Party from the very beginning of this increasingly ugly episode in American history .
Iraq was said to be in cahoots with Osama .
Then it was Iran , according to such impeccable sources as Michael Ledeen .
As I ’ve remarked before , they do n’t even have to produce fresh war propaganda : all they have to do is substitute Pakistan or Iran where it used to say Iraq , and they have a pro-war talking point , good as new .
Another fatal flaw in the Kagan - O’Hanlon thesis : it is impossible to take seriously their claim that the U.S. government lacks " precise information about the location of all of Pakistan ’s nuclear weapons and materials . "
The Musharraf regime has been shaky for quite some time now : are we really supposed to believe that our Pakistani sock puppet did n’t hand us the keys to his nuclear safe as a precondition for our continued support ?
And old Mushie has been a good and faithful ally : his intelligence service has nabbed more real al - Qaeda types  including some of the top leadership  than the CIA and all the other Western intelligence agencies combined .
In this matter , there ’s no reason to believe Musharraf has refused to cooperate .
Okay , so the entire premise of their argument , and everything that lends it its hysterical urgency , is utterly false , but let ’s deal with the implications  the unstated vastness of the project they ’re suggesting .
What they do n’t say , exactly , in their piece is what it would take to carry out the project they suggest , which is , in short , to keep order in a country with six times Iraq ’s population , and potentially more volatile and hostile toward the prospect of a U.S. - led occupation .
Kagan and O’Hanlon admit the difficulties involved , yet they still argue in favor of a preemptive strike :
" The task of stabilizing a collapsed Pakistan is beyond the means of the United States and its allies .
Rule - of - thumb estimates suggest that a force of more than a million troops would be required for a country of this size .
Thus , if we have any hope of success , we would have to act before a complete government collapse , and we would need the cooperation of moderate Pakistani forces . "
Yet further on , we are offered " a second , broader option "  the first is establishing a nuclear " redoubt " guarded in perpetuity by American and Pakistani forces  that " would involve supporting the core of the Pakistani armed forces as they sought to hold the country together in the face of an ineffective government . "
In short , a military occupation similar to what we are attempting with such spectacular lack of success in Iraq .
Hey , is it an accident that our boys Kagan and O’Hanlon were whooping it up for that stroke of pure genius , too ?
We do n’t get any real numbers , or a hint as to what they ’re really proposing , unless we go here and look at their contribution to a volume put out by the Stanley Foundation , an outfit apparently devoted to teasing out and promoting a suitably " bipartisan " foreign policy consensus .
According to the Stanley Foundation folks , we need to " bridge the divide " between Left and Right and come up with a rationale for war that we can all get behind .
In " The Case for Larger Ground Forces , " Kagan and O’Hanlon develop various scenarios that would require a rapid increase in our ground forces of 100,000 or more , including one in which Pakistan collapses into Islamo - anarchy  think of it as a second cousin of " Islamo - fascism "  and control of the country ’s nukes is up for grabs : " Stabilizing a country of this size , " they aver , " could easily require several times as many troops as the Iraq mission a figure of up to one million is easy to imagine . "
Quite a different take than " beyond the means of the United States and its allies . "
The campaign would start with an infusion of " 50,000 to 100,000 ground forces although this is almost the best of all the worst - case scenarios . "
None of this , mind you , is presented in terms of being " beyond our means . "
Quite the contrary :
" Since no U.S. government could simply decide to restrict its exposure in Pakistan if the international community proved unwilling or unable to provide numerous forces , or if the Pakistani collapse were deeper than outlined here , the United States might be compelled to produce significantly more forces to fend off the prospect of a nuclear al - Qaeda . "
According to this version of the Kagan - O’Hanlon case for invading Pakistan , it does n’t matter if we do n’t have the means ; we ’ll just have to find them , that ’s all .
And if that means a draft  as it most certainly would  then so be it .
An army of 1 million , a great many of them conscripts , sent to occupy a vast and volatile country : this is the Iraq disaster multiplied by ten thousand , a jump into a bottomless abyss from which there could be no extrication but exhaustion or outright defeat .
It is the foreign policy of a lemming , intent on plunging to destruction on account of some hardwired signal in its tiny brain .
What signal , I wonder , is buzzing in the brains of this pair of lunatics that is causing them to advocate the suicide of a nation  while simultaneously provoking such near - universal obloquy that none are left to attend the funeral of Uncle Sam .
I had to laugh out loud at the offhand contention , in the Times piece , that it would n’t " be strategically prudent to withdraw our forces from an improving situation in Iraq to cope with a deteriorating one in Pakistan . "
Oh , of course not : these guys are never in favor of ratcheting down our presence .
Some sort of " surge " is always required before we can achieve the glorious victory that ’s always right around the corner .
Never a lighter footprint , much less  horror of horrors !
 no footprint at all .
The key flaw in the Kagan - O’Hanlon argument for a preemptive attack on Pakistan is that we have imperfect knowledge of Pakistan ’s current crisis and therefore cannot know when to strike , and timing , in this case , is crucial .
A premature move could lead to the consequence we fear most : radical Islamists wielding nukes .
Just as in Iraq , where al - Qaeda never had a foothold and now does , the chances that an invasion or some kind of military strike at Pakistan would benefit rather than defeat al - Qaeda are more than even .
Once again , interventionism leads to the exact opposite of its intended result : the principle of " blowback , " as Chalmers Johnson explains it in his classic book of that title , will operate here to deadly effect .
When will they ever learn ?
No , I ’m not talking about the American people , who are viscerally opposed to any further conquests by our would - be Napoleons and would sooner exile the whole lot of neocons and their fellow " liberal " interventionists to Elba than have to endure a bigger , wider , bloodier war .
I ’m talking about the policy wonks like Kagan and O’Hanlon , from AEI and the Brookings Institution respectively .
As Matt Yglesias pointed out in a recent post on think tanks , these outfits are , if not exempt from the laws of the market , then sufficiently cushioned  by large donors to nonprofits and " for - profit nonprofits " like the Weekly Standard  that they operate in the sort of intellectual and moral vacuum that allows Kagan and O’Hanlon to propose what would probably be the single most destructive war in American history .
This would prove to be true , not only in the devastation of Pakistan and Pakistanis , but also in terms of the damage it would do to our society and the American polity .
You think we ’re " divided " now ?
Wait until we have a draft to carry out the orders of Generals Kagan and O’Hanlon .
Inside - the - Beltway outfits like the Stanley Foundation are so concerned about " bridging the divide " between Right and Left , but they seem indifferent or even hostile to the idea of bridging the huge gap between the elites and the American people .
Their idea is to forge a united front of both liberal and conservative opinion - makers to head off a popular rebellion against our crazed foreign policy .
That may have worked , for a time : however , if we are ever so foolish as to actually take up the Kagan - O’Hanlon plan for endless war , then the time is coming when the same old song - and - dance of the elites will provoke anger rather than resignation on the part of the public  and then , watch out .
Yes , these guys can operate in their own little hothouse , courtesy of the War Party ’s fat - cat financiers , who give millions to these pro-war , interventionist nonprofits .
Antiwar.com is another sort of nonprofit , the kind that gets an average donation of $ 50 and is very much dependent on and responsive to market forces  that is , the forces that govern the marketplace of ideas .
We ca n’t afford to get everything wrong , like the neocons and their pet " liberals " did in the run-up to the Iraq war , because our reputation for accuracy is our only asset .
We ca n’t afford to throw government propaganda disguised as " news " to our readers , because we ’ll get called on it , right away , and we depend on our readers for our very survival .
Each contribution is important to us , no matter how small , because we depend on a great many relatively modest donations to keep going .
But that ’s the nature of grassroots support , and the difference between a subsidized operation  like , say , the American Enterprise Institute  and a market - based institution like Antiwar.com .
Our reputation for accuracy , for incisive analysis , for timeliness , and for a thoroughgoing professionalism and respect for facts over propaganda is essential to our continued existence , precisely because we are so dependent on you , our readers and supporters , to give us the resources we need to continue our work .
That ’s why I ’m appealing to you now to help us make our fundraising goal of $ 70,000 during this trying time  trying economically and politically , for all of us , I ’m sure , but for none , it seems , more than Antiwar.com .
And I ’m only exaggerating a little bit
Look , this is the most difficult fundraiser in memory , and there have been some really hairy ones .
I do n’t want to get all panicky on you just before Thanksgiving , but I can tell you that in the offices of Antiwar.com it wo n’t be a very happy holiday season if we have to start closing down or significantly reducing our operations .
There ’s so much out there that ’s dangerous , and so few who are calling the politicians and their enablers in the media on it , that a world without Antiwar.com almost seems inconceivable .
Are we really so uncaring about our own fate ?
Do we really want to repeat the experience of the past few years , only this time magnified to the nth degree ?
We need your contribution today .
In fact we needed it yesterday , but it ’s not too late to give  at least not yet .
While the War Party does indeed seem largely immune to market forces , we do n’t enjoy that advantage .
We have n’t sold out to the big foundations and their corporate sponsors .
We ’re still an independent voice , but it ’s a voice that could be easily stilled .
There ’s only one way to make sure that does n’t happen : make your tax - deductible contribution today .
( CNN ) -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger plans to sue the federal government over its decision not to allow a California plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , he announced Thursday .
California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger says the state will sue the federal government .
Environmental Protection Agency chief Stephen Johnson announced the decision Wednesday , refusing the state 's request for a waiver that would have allowed it to cut emissions faster than a new federal plan the president signed into law Wednesday .
" It 's another example of the administration 's failure to treat global warming with the seriousness that it actually demands , " the governor said at a news conference Thursday .
Bush on Thursday defended the decision of his EPA administrator .
" Is it more effective to let each state make a decision as to how to proceed in curbing greenhouse gases ?
Or is it more effective to have a national strategy ? " he said .
Citing the new energy law -- which sets a fuel economy standard for the whole country -- Bush said Johnson " made a decision based upon the fact that we passed a piece of legislation that enables us to have a national strategy . "
But Schwarzenegger said he would like to set a higher standard for California .
" Anything less than aggressive action on the greatest environmental threat of all time is inexcusable , " he said .
Watch Schwarzenegger slam the Bush administration for denying California the waiver »
The new federal law will increase fuel efficiency standards by 40 percent by 2020 , requiring automakers to bring their fleets to an average of 35 miles per gallon .
The California plan , however , would cut emissions by nearly 30 percent by 2016 , raising fuel efficiency standards in the state to 43.7 miles per gallon for passenger cars and some SUVs and trucks , while larger vehicles would need to reach 26.9 mpg by that year .
In all , 16 states had either adopted California 's tough standards or announced plans to do so .
A top aide to Schwarzenegger said the governor has been frustrated with the White House over emissions standards , and was very exasperated after a February meeting with Johnson .
EPA officials say they went the extra mile with Schwarzenegger , even taking the unusual step of holding a second hearing in California on emissions .
They say they 're sorry he 's upset , but they believe a national standard on emissions is going to be more effective .
A White House official would only react to Schwarzenegger 's frustration by saying the administration " looks forward to working with him on a variety of issues . "
In the ebb-and - flow relationship between Schwarzenegger and Bush , sources close to the governor say this is a low point .
" It 's never been a warm , throw - your - arms - around - the - shoulders kind of relationship , " said former Schwarzenegger adviser Joel Fox .
" Even during the re-election campaign for the president , he would come to California and the governor would n't always be there to greet him . "
Fox said Schwarzenegger and Bush have cooperated on issues like immigration , but the two have differed on several issues , including stem cell research funding , the expansion of the State Children 's Health Insurance Program and climate change .
" He 's got a pretty strong personality , the governor has , and wants to get things done .
If the federal government is one of those obstacles , then he 'll run that tank he has over it .
It 's not particularly anything personal , I think . "
Schwarzenegger is much closer -- personally and politically -- to the president 's father , former President George H.W. Bush , another aide said .

Arraigned for murder in October 2006 , Reiser is being held in Santa Rita Jail near San Francisco .
Hans Reiser is waiting for me , standing on the other side of an imitation - wood table .
The room is small , the concrete walls bare .
A guard locks the steel door from the outside .
There is no sound .
Reiser is wearing the red jumpsuit of a prisoner in solitary confinement , though he has been allowed to meet with me in this chilly visiting room .
There was a time when he was known as a cantankerous but visionary open source programmer .
His work was funded by the government ; he was widely credited ( and sometimes reviled ) for rethinking the structure of the Linux operating system .
Now he is known as prisoner BFP563 .
I stick out my hand .
It ’s an awkward moment — his wrists are chained to his waist .
It ’s mid-December now , and he ’s been in this jail 40 miles east of San Francisco for two months , ever since the Alameda County District Attorney ’s office accused him of murdering Nina Reiser , his estranged wife .
The police found drops of her blood in Reiser ’s house and car , and , when they picked him up on an Oakland street to swab his mouth for DNA , he was carrying his passport and $ 8,960 in cash in a fanny pack .
At the police station , they photographed his body for signs of scratches or bruises .
None were found .
By this time , though , he had been under surveillance for three weeks .
The police had followed him on foot , tailed his car , and even tracked him by airplane .
On October 10 , he was arrested , locked up , and , days later , charged with murder .
( His trial is set to begin in July . )
His only visitors have been his lawyers and his parents .
I ’m the first new face he ’s seen from the outside world .
I ’m here because his defense lawyer thinks I will understand Reiser .
The accused is a 43 - year - old geek — he lives in his own world of computer code , videogames , and science fiction books .
He spent his early twenties developing a role - playing game to compete with Dungeons & Dragons while writing a novel about aliens invading Earth .
By age 30 , he ’d decided that his talents would be better applied to recrafting overlooked aspects of the Linux operating system .
As a technology writer , I frequently meet people like this .
Just because he does n’t behave like the rest of us — and just because he evaded police surveillance and bought a book titled Masterpieces of Murder shortly after his wife ’s disappearance — does n’t mean he ’s guilty .
I have been asked to try to understand this , to try to understand the man .
And so I shake his shackled hand and ask my first question .
“ Tell me about your file system . ”
+ /* initialize transaction manager */ + init_txnmgr ( &sbinfo ->tmgr ) ;
†
A file system organizes data on a computer .
When you double - click a Microsoft Word document on your desktop , for instance , the file system tells the processor where to find the data .
When you upload a picture from your camera , the file system decides how to place the information on your hard drive .
Every bit and byte — including the operating system itself — has its place in the layers upon layers of branching directories .
“ A file system represents the roads and waterways of the OS , ” Reiser tells me .
For the past two decades , he has struggled to create a different method of organizing data .
His approach , known as ReiserFS , is a file system unlike any other .
Rather than assign data a fixed location on a hard drive , it uses algorithms to frequently reposition information , including the code that makes up the file system itself .
It elegantly maximizes storage space , but it can also complicate data recovery when a computer crashes .
If the algorithms are corrupted , the file system will be unable to locate its own position .
All the data it organizes disappears into an indistinguishable mass of 0s and 1s .
The contents of that hard drive will be irretrievably lost .
In Reiser ’s case , a critical piece of data — the location of Nina Reiser — has gone missing .
Alameda County prosecutors think there ’s an explanation for her disappearance ; they blame Reiser , a computer expert with a penchant for violent videogames .
Reiser denies killing his wife .
The two had been separated for 27 months when she disappeared , and her body has not been found .
Reiser has so far relied on the Geek Defense .
It boils down to this : I may be awkward , a little weird , and prone to convoluted theories about nearly everything .
But I am not a killer .

On the overcast Sunday of Labor Day weekend 2006 , Nina Reiser goes shopping at a crowded Berkeley , California , grocery store .
Although she has been living in the US for nearly eight years , she was born and raised in Russia at a time when stores like this did n’t exist .
The place is stocked with heirloom tomatoes and vegan burgers , and Nina loads up her cart .
She brings along her son , Rory , 6 , and daughter , Niorline , 5 .
After depositing the groceries in her minivan , she drives to the quiet neighborhood where her husband now lives with his mother .
Reiser will have the kids for the rest of the weekend .
Rory tells two versions of what happened next :
+ znode * left_child ; + znode * right_child ;
Version 00
When questioned by police , Rory says he and his sister went down to the basement as soon as they arrived at his grandmother ’s house , leaving his parents upstairs .
A few minutes later , he heard them raising their voices and using “ not nice words . ”
He went back upstairs , but his father told him to go back to the basement .
Rory turned and walked back downstairs .
This was the last time he ever saw his mother .
> Version 01
On the witness stand during the December hearing to determine whether his father should be tried for murder , Rory tells the court that he came back upstairs and stayed in the entryway with his mother and father .
They were not arguing .
His mother gave him a hug good - bye .
Then she walked out the door and got in the van .
He watched her drive away .
This was the last time he ever saw his mother .
+ if ( ! JF_ISSET ( node , JNODE_HEARD_BANSHEE ) ) + warning ( “ nikita - 3177 ” , “ Parent not found ” ) ;
Reiser is crying .
He is pale , unshaven , and his stubble is flecked with white .
His nose is running .
It ’s hard for him to wipe it with his hands shackled .
This is my second visit to the jail , and he has deteriorated in the past six weeks .
He tells me that he ’s tormented by what ’s happened to his two children .
After Nina disappeared , the Alameda County social services agency put Rory and Niorline in a foster home at the urging of police .
Two weeks later , the county family court released them to Nina ’s mother , who took them to Russia for the holidays .
It ’s now late January .
They were supposed to return weeks ago .
Instead , a letter arrived from a lawyer in Russia , explaining that the kids were terrified of the US and would not return .
Reiser is facing other losses as well .
Novell , one of the largest Linux distributors to include his software , dropped his file system from its future offerings two days after his arrest .
The process of preparing Reiser4 , his next - generation code , for inclusion in the Linux kernel has all but stopped as his time and cash have been redirected toward his defense .
He ca n’t make payroll for Namesys , his file system company .
“ Programs are in some sense our children , ” Reiser tells me .
He explains that programs can be discriminated against just like people .
That ’s why he wanted to raise his file system in the open source community , where people and programs are encouraged to interact free of corporate barriers to communication .
The point was n’t to make a lot of money .
It was to make the world a better place .
Reiser4 is built on this principle .
It contains a single registry — known as a balanced tree — to organize every piece of data in the operating system .
All programs can employ the same nomenclature to access information .
In the traditional Windows or Unix file system , each application uses different terminology to track data .
As a result , programs do n’t communicate efficiently with one another , which creates walls between data .
In Reiser ’s idealized vision , a simple search for the word “ Nina , ” for instance , will turn up emails in Outlook , images stored in MyPictures , and credit card charges in Quicken .
Google ’s desktop search and Apple ’s Spotlight feature can do this , but they ’re afterthoughts :
The ability of Reiser4 to scour every document is embedded in the operating system itself .
It lays the foundation for a digital universe where there is no discrimination — nothing is walled off .
In this unified space , all things can be known .

An American walks into a warm café looking for a woman he ’s supposed to meet .
He ’s got piercing dark eyes and a muscular build .
He used to think of himself as a wimp .
Now he studies judo and already boasts a brown belt .
He owns a software company and employs a fleet of Russian programmers .
One sign of his newfound confidence :
He sports a cowboy hat .
Then he spots her .
She ’s beautiful , with dark hair and a smile that makes you hold your breath .
But it ’s her voice that captures him .
He finds the Russian inflection in her perfect English enchanting .
Plus , she ’s a doctor , an obstetrician .
Her parents , too , are physicians .
The other women he met through the Russian bride service on his regular trips here did n’t impress him .

And there ’s something else , something magical about her .

They grew up together in Oakland , and Sturgeon wants to help his friend .
He ’s happy to lend the money , which he obtains by taking a loan on the equity in his condo .
He writes Reiser a check for $ 84,000 at the beginning of 2004 .
Reiser thinks of Sturgeon as a brother but is concerned about his friend ’s taste for bondage and sadomasochism .
Reiser once watched Sturgeon carve the letters R - A - G - E into his arm , and was alarmed when his friend told him he went to the ER after an S&M experience led to a burst blood vessel in his chest .
Reiser is worried that Sturgeon is trying to teach Rory and Niorline that pain can be fun and is furious when Sturgeon gives them what Reiser refers to in a sworn court filing as “ gender confused alternative sexuality dolls . ”
Reiser is also upset that Sturgeon has introduced Nina to the drug ecstasy .
When she asks Reiser if he wants to try it , he says no but senses she thinks less of him for refusing .
“ Nina and Sean both seem to be searching for more and more excitement , and going farther and farther to find it , ” Reiser writes in the court papers .
Sturgeon does n’t understand why Reiser is upset .
It ’s true that he was involved in the “ leather ” community and that he ’s bisexual .
But Sturgeon has started going to church , and by the beginning of 2002 he had sworn off kinky sex parties .
He ’s left that life behind .
Either way , Reiser stayed friends with him all those years and did n’t seem to mind it at the time .
Reiser even watched him carve those letters into his arm — it happened back in 1996 .
It was just body art — Sturgeon saw a lot of people doing it at the time .
It was no big deal .
Over the course of 2004 , Sturgeon feels he is growing apart from his friend .
At the same time , he feels a deep connection with Nina .
“ She told me that wolves mate once for life and asked me if I was her wolf , ” he says .
“ I said yes . ”
Reiser fears that Nina is sleeping with Sturgeon and that the two are mixing sex with sadomasochism .
Nina confirms his suspicion that they are having an affair when she files for divorce .
In court filings , Reiser accuses her of being seduced by a “ lewd tattooed drug addicted BDSM pimp / whore ” with multiple personality disorder .
Sturgeon admits to the affair — he ’s fallen in love with Nina — but denies that S&M is a part of the relationship .
He also thinks Reiser has mismanaged Namesys and squandered its financial resources .
He asks for his $ 84,000 back .
Reiser refuses to return the money .
Sturgeon files suit in December , and Reiser lodges a cross- complaint claiming that Sturgeon intentionally seduced Nina in an effort to “ show that he was a better man than I and to convince my wife , Nina , to conspire with him to steal the Namesys , Inc. company assets . ”
Sturgeon feels that Reiser has cast aside their friendship because of greed .
“ You find out who your true friends are when you stop giving them money , ” he says .
Sturgeon believes that Reiser ’s judgment has become clouded by megalomania and the belief that he is the world ’s greatest programmer .
The friendship is over .
Reiser agrees that the friendship is finished .
He tells the divorce court that Sturgeon “ has many wonderful qualities , but as he has gotten older the dark side has triumphed in him . ”
And as for Nina , he thinks the children need to be “ protected from what appears to be a mother spiraling downwards in mental stability . ”
+ request = &owner -> request ; + node = request -> node ;
Reiser wants me to do something .
It ’s late March , and this is my third visit to the locked meeting room inside the jail .
It ’s raining today ; a bucket collects water in the hallway .
Reiser is out of solitary , so his hands are no longer cuffed .
He puts them on the table and leans toward me .
“ I would like to talk you into doing something that will involve a lot of work on your part , ” he says .
He pauses and stares intently at me before explaining that he feels he has been discriminated against because he ’s a computer geek .
He wants me to investigate his custody fight and , among other things , validate his belief that violent videogames are not bad for kids .
I agree to look into it and obtain a sheaf of custody filings from the case .
I pore through the pages and discover that the issue of videogame violence has taken up a lot of his time over the past few years .
+ done_load_count(&left_parent_load ) ; + done_load_count(&right_parent_load ) ;
At the end of 2004 , as the divorce and custody proceedings get under way , Nina asks Reiser to stop playing violent videogames like Battlefield Vietnam with young Rory .
In that game , napalm explosions envelop villages in fire , bodies are hurled through the air , and , when shot , characters collapse to the ground and choke on their own blood , realistic sound effects included .
“ Hans has a deeply held unreasonable belief that it is good to show children , no matter how young , violent videos and movies , ” Nina writes to the court .
She wants him to stop .
For Reiser , this is not about videogames ; it ’s about life and death .
“ Little boys take to violent computer games like monkeys take to trees , ” he says in a court filing .
“ [ They ] do not have instincts that favor combat rehearsal activities for no reason , they have them because they affect whether they live or die a significant amount of the time . ”
Violent videogames are an ideal way to hone these survival skills , for several reasons , he says .
A kid is clearly not going to become battle - hardened in the quiet , idyllic neighborhoods of the Oakland hills .
Reiser believes that history — in , for instance , an Electronic Arts videogame set in Vietnam — is the best teacher , though he is quick to point out that the learning process will not necessarily be easy .
“ Becoming a man normally is psychologically traumatic for boys , ” he says .
What matters most , he says , is that the exercise “ allows him to achieve results in defending family and country . ”
Rory has nightmares .
When he ’s awake , he spends time drawing monsters and soldiers , and he tells his mother that he and his father have a secret .
Nina thinks that Reiser is still playing videogames with their son and worries that Rory is developing a condition called sensory integration dysfunction , which can make the smallest sound or touch overwhelming .
In the coming months , Rory is frequently sick with a high fever and a sore throat .
A year earlier , he was diagnosed with fluid in his ear and treated with five courses of antibiotics , but his condition persists .
Nina uses a low - voltage portable laser — a device commonly used in Russia — to zap his inflamed tissue .
Rory ’s health does not improve .
Reiser claims that Nina may be consulting with “ memory creation specialists ” in order to implant memories in Rory ’s mind .
He insists that he never told Rory to hide the fact that they play Battlefield Vietnam together and is convinced that the specialist created this memory .
“ I am just lucky these memories only involve a computer game so far , ” Reiser writes to the court .
“ I do n’t want to find out that my child remembers being satanically sacrificed by me in a past life . ”
On December 22 , 2004 , the dispute intensifies .
Reiser arrives to pick up the kids at the house Nina is renting , and , according to Nina , he shoves her to the ground .
The next day , she files a request for a restraining order against Reiser — quickly granted — and reports that he threatened to “ make me hurt for the rest of my life . ”
Reiser is amused by the implication that he is violent .
“ In reality I am just a computer gamer , and when someone says I have been demented as a result of [ videogame ] combat the laughter comes easily , ” he writes .
He believes mental health professionals scorn people who “ teach the culture of manhood to little boys , with all of its inherent opposition to wallowing in wimpiness . ”
Reiser delves into this “ culture of manhood ” in a 32 - page filing he submits to the court after Nina accuses him of hurting her .
In it , he explains the difference between appropriate and inappropriate violence .
Grand Theft Auto , for instance , demonstrates inappropriate violence because players can get away with killing innocent people .
“ Many other computer games heavily penalize shooting the wrong person , and I prefer those , ” Reiser says .
He also has a simple solution for Rory ’s nightmares : magical dynamite .
“ I explained to him that he could learn to fight the monsters in his dreams and blow them up with the magical dynamite , ” Reiser recounts .
“ I did this in terms that expressed a quiet confidence that he could handle the job .
“ Note the similarities between how an effective army sergeant would rally frightened men to learn to attack the enemy and the technique I used to teach a small boy to deal with monsters in his dreams , ” Reiser adds .
“ One of the sad facts of dream life is that monsters who are lots of joy to blow up will start to leave one ’s dreams and not want to return . ”
Reiser says he has a right to blow up monsters , whether in dreams or videogames .
The government — in the guise of family court — should have no place prohibiting him or his son from playing Battlefield Vietnam or Age of Wonders : Shadow Magic , a fantasy strategy game featuring elves , dwarves , zombies , and wizards .
“ Should the government be keeping me from showing my son how to direct brave goblin suicide bombers against their elven oppressors ? ” he asks .
To Reiser , a fundamental bias is at work .
“ Male geeks , such as myself , are one of America ’s most hated cultural minorities , ” he writes .
“ Unlike racial hatred , it is considered socially acceptable to indulge in such hatred . ”
Nina , he feels , has exploited this bias .
“ I am tired of being the punching bag , ” he concludes .
“ I could forgive the fighting , and even the mental instability and unfaithfulness , but not the scamming and the lying .
Let the children and I leave this all behind .
Leave them to me , and let Nina go her way . ”
In December 2005 , the court awards full legal custody to Nina .
+ reiser4_status_write ( REISER4_STATUS_DAMAGED , 0 , + “ Filesystem error occured ” ) ;
Six days after Nina ’s disappearance , Oakland police find her minivan parked 3 miles from the house where Reiser lives with his mother .
The groceries are still in it , tipped over and rotting .
Her purse sits on the front passenger seat and contains $ 94.07 in cash and her cell phone , though the battery has been removed and sits loose in the purse .
The van ’s console holds another $ 24.60 and one euro .
There are no fingerprints other than Nina’s .
Reiser ’s Honda Civic CRX has also disappeared .
Beverly , Reiser ’s mother , reports that her son took her car , a Honda hybrid , the weekend Nina disappeared .
At the time , Beverly , 64 , was in the Nevada desert at the Burning Man festival .
She ’s a conceptual artist and had gone there to show her Hopeandfearometer , a video kiosk that asks two questions : “ What makes you glow ? ” and “ What dangers do you delight in ? ”
The device records responses and then , according to an online description , plays them back in “ a cacophonous medley of random hopes and fears . ”
On her return to Oakland , Beverly is confronted with her own set of hopes and fears .
She asks for her car back , but her son refuses , saying that his is n’t working .
Reiser also tells her that Nina has gone missing .
Her ex-husband , Ramon , has warned their son to be careful ; he thinks Nina might have gotten involved with the Russian mafia .
The Oakland police think otherwise and unleash a surveillance team to track Reiser .
Unmarked cars trail him as he drives his mother ’s hybrid .
They follow him to his children ’s school , as he gets coffee , and along the winding roads in the Oakland hills .
An airplane is dispatched to track him , and his phone is tapped .
Still , police cannot locate the missing CRX .
There are two explanations for Reiser ’s reaction to the surveillance :
+ if ( in_panic == 0 ) { + in_panic = 1 ;
Version 00
Though the police believe Reiser is unaware that they are following him , they observe him taking countersurveillance measures .
He accelerates slowly on the freeway that skirts the edge of Oakland and then floors it , only to take the next exit at the last possible moment .
He drives in circles through a residential neighborhood .
He acts like someone who has something to hide .
Version 01 Reiser calls his dad and explains that unmarked cars and maybe an airplane are tracking him .
In Ramon ’s opinion , it ’s an operation beyond the scope of local police .
It sounds like the Russian mafia , Ramon says , or maybe the Russian spy agency , the FSB .
He tells his son to take evasive action : Exit freeways without warning , drive in circles .
“ Do anything you can to lose them and protect yourself . ”

On September 13 , the Oakland police get a search warrant to scour the Reiser household .
They find a drop of blood on a support post in the entry .
Oakland ’s crime lab identifies the sample as a mix of Nina ’s and Reiser ’s , though it ca n’t determine how old the blood is .
Five days later , the police follow Reiser to the CRX , which is parked on a quiet street in nearby Berkeley .
He moves it to a secluded , wooded area of Oakland and dashes uphill toward his mother ’s house 3 miles away .
Police search the CRX and find that the front passenger seat has recently been removed .
The floor is soaked , as if it had been washed .
There are heavy - duty garbage bags , cloth towels , masking tape , and two books : Masterpieces of Murder and Homicide .
Police also find another drop of blood and match it to Nina .
+ warning ( “ Target found unexpectedly ” ) ; + result = RETERR (- EIO ) ;
It ’s a warm Sunday morning in May , and I ’m in the last pew at All Nations Presbyterian Church in an Oakland suburb .
Light streams through stained glass and illuminates floating motes of dust .
A smattering of congregants stand and recite prayers .
I ’ve come here because Sean Sturgeon — Reiser ’s childhood friend and Nina ’s ex-lover — has invited me , though I ’ve yet to spot him .
He wants me to understand that he is a Christian now .
He is eager for me to know this because last week , on the phone , he told me he had killed eight people .
“ The taste of death will not defile us , ” the congregation chants .
I think back to the previous Sunday .
My phone rang late at night .
The caller ID read prison .
It was Reiser .
His defense team had just gotten a call from a deputy district attorney , who told them that Sturgeon had confessed to a number of killings but denied any connection to Nina ’s case .
The confession had come months ago , early in the investigation of Nina ’s disappearance .
Reiser sounded giddy .
Surely this would raise reasonable doubt in jurors ’ minds .
The next afternoon , Sturgeon called me .
I had been trying to reach him for two months .
Now he was breathing into my ear .
If I knew all the details of his friendship with Reiser , he said , I “ would weep piss and blood . ”
I did n’t know where to begin .
If he ’d actually killed eight people , the police would have arrested him , right ?
Why had n’t this come out before ?
Was he fantasizing ?
When I called the DA , he refused to comment , citing a gag order issued three days earlier by the judge in the Reiser case .
Oakland police also refuse to comment , citing the gag order .
“ We are the raisers of the dead , ” intones a woman standing in the chancel .
“ The power of death will not defy us . ”
I sense Sturgeon before I see him .
He has appeared to my left , staring at me with pale blue eyes .
He is unshaven , and the skin around his right eye twitches .
“ Hello , ” he says and then turns his attention to the service .
“ The spirit of death will not destroy us , ” the crowd mutters in a monotone .
We sit silently , side by side for the hour - long liturgy and , when it is over , stand in the lobby and talk about the people Sturgeon says he killed ; the rest of the congregation sips coffee and chats .
He explains that he was abused as a child .
As an adult , he targeted those who had hurt him .
“ If you are n’t one of those people , ” he says , “ you have nothing to fear . ”
And now that he ’s a Christian , he is no longer violent .
He says he stopped killing in 1995 and made a full confession to the police investigating Nina ’s disappearance .
He did it without a lawyer because he wanted to prove that he had nothing to hide .
Even so , he wo n’t tell me anything that might help confirm the killings , like the names of his victims , claiming that the information would draw attention away from the facts in Reiser ’s case .
But he continues to cooperate with the police , even inviting them to check his gun collection and test whether the weapons had recently been fired .
“ Give me some sodium pentothal or any truth serum , put a little ecstasy in there and ask me if I killed Nina , ” he says .
“ I have never been a threat to her . ”
The last time he called Nina was the Friday before she disappeared .
He wanted to find a good time to drop off some money .
He had n’t seen her for four months — as part of the court - approved divorce agreement , Sturgeon was barred from visiting the kids , who stayed mostly with Nina .
The enforced separation strained their relationship , until they finally broke up .
Still , Sturgeon wanted to help her financially .
Reiser was often late with child - support payments , and Nina did n’t have a full - time job .
“ I was her ‘ maid of honor ’ when she married Hans ; I was n’t going to let her down , ” Sturgeon says , explaining that he dressed up as a woman for the wedding and stood beside Nina for the service .
After their friendship turned romantic , Sturgeon felt even more compelled to chip in .
“ I do n’t just sleep with a woman and say , ‚ See you later , I had my fun . ' ”
He would n’t abandon her .
Nina , he explains , thought of him as her mate for life , her wolf .
The coffee hour ends , and we file out into the sun with the other congregants .
We talk for a few more minutes , and then I watch Sturgeon get into his Subaru and drive away .
The car has two large images of wolves stuck on the hatchback .
+ “ Looking for page %lu of file % llu ( size % lli ) . ” +
“ No file items found ( %d ) .
File is corrupted ?
” ,
Reiser ’s lips are chapped , cracked , and peeling .
It is my fourth and final visit , and I have asked him to tell me where he thinks Nina is .
He does n’t answer .
He wants to talk about his file system again .
While he launches into the intricacies of database science , I ’m thinking , “ Where is the front passenger seat of your car ? ”
He has never explained this .
It seems a fundamental hole in his defense .
But he wo n’t stop talking .
When I try to interrupt , he insists I let him finish .
It ’s as if the file system holds all the answers .
So I take the hint , and that night , in my office , I start scouring the 80,496 lines of the Reiser4 source code .
Eventually I stumble across a passage that starts at line 78,077 .
It ’s not part of the program itself — it ’s an annotation , a piece of non-executable text in plain English .
It ’s there for the benefit of someone who has chosen to read this far into the code .
The passage explains how memory structures are born , grow , and eventually die .
It concludes : “ Death is a complex process . ”

A Plan to Kill Everyone
" War , children , it 's just a shot away , it 's just a shot away " – The Rolling Stones , from “ Gimme Shelter ”
FALLUJAH --
A sign on the door leading out of India Company ’s Combat Operations Center says “ Have a Plan to Kill Everyone You Meet . ”
For a fraction of second I thought it might be some kind of joke .
But I was with the Marine Corps in Fallujah , and it was n’t a joke .
I asked Captain Stewart Glenn if he could explain and perhaps elaborate a bit on what , exactly , that sign is about .
“ It ’s pretty straightforward , ” he said rather bluntly .
“ It means exactly what it says . ”
Welcome to counterinsurgency .
A sign outside Lieutenant Nathan Bibler ’s Joint Security Station in the slums of Fallujah makes the point a little more clearly , and delicately .
“ Look at everyone as though they are trying to kill you , but you cannot treat them that way . ”
“ The threat 's always there , ” Sergeant Chuck Balley told me as he looked blankly at nothing in particular .
“ Everybody is sketchy . ”
Maybe they are .
But very few people in Fallujah try to kill Americans – or other Iraqis – anymore .
It has been months since a single Marine in Fallujah has been even wounded , let alone killed .
But at least a handful of disorganized insurgents still lurk in the city .
Once a week or so somebody takes a shot at the Americans .
“ Do you have plates in that Kevlar ? ” one Marine sergeant said to me as I donned my body armor on our way into the city .
He was referring to steel SAPI plates that fit inside Kevlar vests that can stop even a sniper round .
“ No , ” I said , and I did n't care .
The odds that I , personally , would be the first person shot in Fallujah for months were microscopic .
“ Look , ” he said .
“ You are not gonna get shot .
But you should still carry some plates . ”
One lieutenant forced me to wear Marine - issue body armor – which weighs almost 80 pounds – before he would let me go out on patrol with him .
I felt like Godzilla lumbering around with all the extra bulk and weight , and I did n’t really feel safer .
Running while carrying those extra pounds all of a sudden was n’t much of an option .
Sacrificing most of my speed and agility to make myself a little more bullet - proof might not be worth it .
But perhaps that ’s just what I told myself so I could justify wearing lighter and more comfortable armor .
It ’s hard to say .
What I do know for certain is that Fallujah at the end of 2007 was neither scary nor stressful .
No one can go there right now without feeling what is perhaps a dangerous sense of complacency .
But complacency kills .
The Marines are reminded of this fact every day , as was I when I traveled and worked with them .
The day I arrived at India Company 's Forward Operating Base , which had been converted from an old train station , all the Marines had to attend readiness training classes designed to offset complacency .
“ Too many Marines are getting complacent and lax , ” Captain Glenn said .
“ Complacency is as potentially deadly as an IED at this point . ”
The Marines could n't help it , and neither could I. Combat operations in Fallujah are over .
It was n't possible to work myself up into feeling nervous in that city .
I just knew I would n't be shot .
Of course , I could have been wrong , and I knew that , too .
*
“ Are you a strict non-combatant ? ” Second Lieutenant Mike Barefoot said to me as we stepped out of the joint security station in Jolan , Northern Fallujah , and began a patrol .
“ What do you mean ? ” I said .
Of course I am a non-combatant .
Was he asking if I ’m a pacifist ?
“ Do you fight ? ” he said .
I narrowed my eyes at him slightly , still not quite sure what he was getting at .
“ If we get in a fire fight , ” he said , “ and I give you my pistol , will you take it ? ”
Second Lieutenant Mike Barefoot
He put his hand on his sidearm and fingered the thumb break .
He was n't kidding .
All I had to do was say so and he would hand me that pistol .
“ I 'm not allowed to carry a weapon , ” I said .
He rolled his eyes , not at me but at the policy .
“ No embedded journalists are allowed to pick up a weapon , ” I continued .
“ They ’ll throw me out of Iraq if I do .
It ’s a good policy .
Most of us are n’t trained to fight in a war .
If reporters were armed , eventually one of us would shoot a kid or an old woman . ”
It is a sound policy .
He nodded and seemed to understand that .
Still , he repeated the question .
“ If I give you my pistol , will you take it ? ”
“ If it gets bad enough out here that either I shoot it or die , then yes , ” I said .
“ I ’d rather be thrown of Iraq then be killed .
But that is not going to happen , so I can't take your pistol . ”
We walked a few steps .
Second Lieutenant Mike Barefoot on patrol
“ Thanks , though , ” I said , and I meant it .
Several Marines were shocked that I was willing to walk around the streets of Fallujah without a gun , but I did n’t feel the slightest bit nervous .
Complacency kills , and I get that .
But I had Marines as bodyguards and I was n’t allowed to defend myself anyway .
So I figured I might as well relax .
“ Anyway , ” I always said to Marines who thought I should carry a weapon , “ if it gets bad enough out here that you ’re relying on me in a fight , you ’re really screwed . ”
Having a plan to kill everyone I met was n’t an option .
I tried it out for a few minutes , though , to get a tiny idea of what it might be like inside the mind of a non-complacent counterinsurgent .
I imagined carrying an M - 16 on a sling and holding it at the deck with both hands , index finger off but near the trigger .
How quickly could I raise a rifle and shoot a man who takes the initiative and fires an AK - 47 at me or at somebody else ?
What if the friendly young man who just smiled at me pulls a knife ?
Was I supposed to look at women and children as potential combatants ?
Once in a while insurgents are able to pressure children into throwing hand grenades at Americans .
We walked past houses and buildings riddled with bullet holes .
Raw sewage slowly ran in rivulets through the streets .
Only the smallest of businesses were open -- it will be a long time before any international corporate chains arrive in Fallujah .
A young bearded man wearing baggy white pants and a filthy blue shirt sold black market fuel in jerry cans to motorists .
Contrary to popular belief , there are motorists in Fallujah .
There is a so - called vehicle ban , but it has been misreported and misunderstood .
It is true that Fallujah neighborhoods are segmented by barriers , but residents can walk and drive their vehicles from one neighborhood to the other after passing through Iraqi Police checkpoints .
They can also leave and enter the city whenever they like as long as they have a Fallujah resident sticker on the windshield of their car .
Fallujah 's vehicle ban only applies to cars from outside the city .
Non-residents are welcome in Fallujah , but they have to leave their vehicle at the outskirts .
The city is very small .
It is easily walkable , and taxi service is cheap and available .
The non-resident vehicle ban is enforced by the Iraqi Police , not the Marines .
Iraqi Police Colonel Faisal will decide when the non-resident vehicle ban will be lifted .
I did not realized that I had dropped my pen after jotting down a few observations in my notebook while I walked .
A young Iraqi boy ran up behind me , picked up my pen , and handed it over .
Every day at least one Iraqi kid will ask me to give him my pen , but this one wanted to make sure I did n't lose it .
Another young boy came up and gave me a high - five .
They often do this to the Marines .
Whatever the adults in Fallujah might think of Americans , the kids really do seem to like us .
Eight year olds do not have politics .
Almost every house in the city is ringed with a high wall for privacy .
The residents did n't have siege warfare in mind when they designed their homes , but the walls are strong , made of concrete , and they can serve that function .
Any number of insurgents could , in theory , be crouching behind them and we would n't know it until they opened fire on us .
One of the Marines found a cassette tape stashed in the bushes and eyed it suspiciously as he pulled it out .
Abu Musab al Zarqawi's Al Qaeda in Iraq sometimes distributes propaganda on audio tapes just as Ayatollah Khomeini did in Iran before the Islamic Revolution .
“ Can I see it ? ” our interpreter said .
The Marine handed over the tape .
“ It 's just music , ” he said as he read the label .
“ Nothing to worry about . ”
It has been months since the jihadists have been able to murder anyone in Fallujah .
Only a few weeks before , however , a handful showed up on a street corner and handed out anti-American snuff films on DVD .
Apparently they thought the local civilians would be impressed .
They were not .
They called the Iraqi Police , and the propagandists were taken away to the jail .
The main Jolan market was up ahead , but first we passed through a neighborhood that , unlike almost anywhere else in Iraq , received 24 hours a day of electricity .
Lieutenant Barefoot pointed up toward the sky .
“ See the electricity poles ? ” he said .
I did , and I was amazed .
The neighborhood was wired properly as though it were part of a modern First World country .
Gone all of a sudden were the hideously tangled rat 's nest of wires and cables that make up most of Iraq 's electrical grid .
“ Why is the wiring so much better here ? ” I said .
“ And is that really enough by itself to give people 24 hours a day of electricity ?
Is this a politically favored neighborhood or what ? ”
“ No , ” said the lieutenant .
“ They just have better local leadership in this neighborhood . ”
Political corruption is unspeakably bad in Iraq , in Kurdistan as well as in the Arabic parts of the country .
If Lieutenant Barefoot is right about this section of Jolan , the insurgency is by no means solely to blame for Iraq 's shattered infrastructure .
We arrived at Jolan 's market district .
It was not what I expected .
Jolan is the oldest part of Fallujah .
It was built on the banks of the Euphrates River where it swings in closest to Baghdad .
I thought perhaps we would walk through one of the covered souks that are so ubiquitous in the Middle East .
But few buildings in even this part of the city looked more than fifty years old , and many of the shops were in outdoor booths .
The Marines found the market impressive because it had only reopened recently .
Objectively , though , it is not very impressive .
Everything is relative in a place like Fallujah .
The market is an ugly ramshackle mess where only the most basic goods and necessities are for sale .
It smelled of piss .
Trash burned in oil barrels .
There were hardly any women out and about , even though the market areas of conservative Muslim cities are where you are most likely to see them .
All women older than teenagers wore black abayas that enveloped them from head to toe .
Only their faces were visible .
A man carrying a stick led goats through the area who managed to find nourishment from piles of garbage .
Amid this drabness , though , was a surprising little oasis .
A local man was selling flowers and plants at a pleasant little store .
He contentedly watered his flora with a hose and smiled at us as we walked past .
I had a hard time imagining that the Marines I walked with had a quiet and secretive plan to kill this guy if all of a sudden he raised up an AK - 47 from behind the bushes .
He was not going to do that .
I just knew it .
It is very nearly impossible to tell what most Iraqis are thinking when you briefly pass them on the street .
Theoretically any one of them could be an insurgent .
But there are some I felt safe writing off as potential threats .
You can just tell with some people .
At least I have the luxury of thinking so when it is n't my job to return hostile fire .
On our way back to the station we stopped by a volleyball game .
An Iraqi Police captain recently started a Fallujah - wide volleyball tournament .
He purchased uniforms for the players and trophies that will go to the winners when the tournament ends .
Most of the Marines I spoke to were stunned by this development , especially those who had previously served in Fallujah when it was still the catastrophically violent city most Americans think it still is .
I was n't personally all that impressed with the fact that Iraqis play volleyball now .
That is not because I do n't “ get it , ” but because it 's hard to imagine just how bad a place Fallujah recently was .
It 's not a nice place today , but it is almost normal for a rough - around - the - edges city in the Third World .
And it 's a paradise compared with , say , a shantytown - packed Mexican border town like Juarez or Tijuana .
Our patrol came upon a wedding party being put together in the street .
A shiny black Mercedes decorated with purple , red , and white flowers pulled up beside us .
Sharply dressed Iraqi men and children got out and walked up to meet us .
They were so friendly .
An older man in a keffiyeh greeted us so warmly and sincerely it was obvious his affection was real .
“ Thank you , thank you , ” he said .
We all knew what he meant .
Thank you for being here .
Thank you for the security .
Some Iraqis only pretend to be friendly , but it 's obvious when you meet someone who is n't pretending .
Human emotion and its expression is the same across cultures .
This man could not have been a combatant .
I was certain the odds of him trying to kill us were zero .
I could n’t help wondering : was it really necessary to have a plan to kill everyone ?
But complacency kills .
You never know who might attack you in Iraq .
I imagined bashing his head into the sidewalk .
*
I shared a room that night at the Joint Security Station with Lieutenant Barefoot and his roommate and station commanding officer Second Lieutenant Gary Laughlin .
Joint Security Stations are shared by American Marines and Iraqi Police .
Our room was on the Arab side of the house .
The wall opposite my bed was riddled with shrapnel holes , as if a mortar round had exploded right in our bedroom .
“ It used to be a lot less friendly here , ” Lieutenant Laughlin said and laughed .
He led me out to the back porch where we could sit and enjoy the moderately warm afternoon sunshine .
All the Marines I spoke to were amazed at the progress made in Fallujah .
It was safer than even they had expected .
I asked Lieutenant Laughlin what , specifically , surprised him most about the current state of the city .
Second Lieutenant Gary Laughlin
“ The most surprising thing , ” he said , “ is how friendly people are .
I expected people here to just hate us after Al - Fajr .
You kind of have to take it with a grain of salt , though .
Some of them really just want the Iraqi Police to take over , and they only smile at us to be polite . ”
That has to be right .
Some unknown percentage of Fallujahns are still disgruntled with the American presence .
But there is almost no surface - level evidence that this is true .
Very nearly 100 percent of the people who live there are friendly .
“ Have you run into any civilians who are hostile toward you ? ” I said .
“ Not really , ” he said .
“ Some of them are scared of us , though .
We can look pretty intimidating . ”
Lieutenant Laughlin had only been in Fallujah for a couple of months .
First Lieutenant Barry Edwards has been around longer , so he could compare and contrast the present and past .
“ Have you seen a shift in the way Iraqis treat you in the year you 've been here ? ” I said .
“ Oh yeah , ” he said .
“ This summer I ate dinner just about every week out there .
I could n't have done that back in January .
They would have lit my tail up .
You could n't go 100 feet down the road that runs along the river without getting hit by an IED .
Now we can sit there with our flak jackets and helmets off like we 're sitting right here .
We can do that outside in the open .
We go out there and eat chow with the guys who were shooting at us a year ago . ”
While Lieutenant Laughlin and I basked in Iraq ’s winter sunlight , we heard a weather report that might be slightly disturbing under different circumstances : there was absolutely no wind .
That meant it was an ideal time , from the point of view of insurgents , to launch a chemical weapons attack .
Because the air was perfectly still , poison gas would n’t float away on the wind .
Marines , therefore , were required to carry gas masks on their person at all times , even though the odds of a chemical weapons attack were very near zero .
Not quite zero , though .
Chlorine gas has been used by Fallujah insurgents before .
The Marines seems hyper - prepared almost to the point of paranoia .
But they were not paranoid .
They were just ready for anything .
“ Make Yourself Hard to Kill ” is one of their catchphrases .
“ Marines are more focused than soldiers , ” Sergeant Balley told me .
“ If we get in a fire fight , you will see . ”
But I could see it , a little , even though we were n’t being shot at .
They do seem to make themselves a little bit harder to injure or kill than Army soldiers .
The differences are n’t huge , but they are there .
One of the reasons I felt relaxed in Fallujah was that they seemed so over - prepared for everything .
One of the peculiar things about Fallujah now is that , for some people at least , it ’s less dangerous than some other places in the Middle East , even some that are full of tourists .
“ Our interpreter is from Jordan , ” said Lieutenant Laughlin .
“ He ’s been with us for four years .
He does n’t go home .
There have been threats against his life from former Iraqi insurgents who live there .
He is actually safer here in Iraq because we protect him . ”
*
I walked the streets of Fallujah at night with a platoon of Marines looking for intelligence tips from local civilians .
They were n’t fishing for information about anything in particular .
They just wanted to ask around the neighborhood in case anyone was up to something suspicious .
We passed through a reeking garbage dump on a empty lot as wild dogs barked .
I ducked beneath dangling wires and almost ran straight into a group of young Neighborhood Watch men carrying AK - 47s and lurking like dark wraiths in the night .
Plastic bags snarled in razor wire billowed in the soft breeze sighing in from the desert beyond the city ’s walls .
Local civilians grumbled about the price of gasoline and the lack of electricity , as they often do , but no one said they had seen anything suspicious .
The one thing they were actually happy about was the dramatic and apparently stable restoration of calm .
Later , though , we came across something suspicious ourselves .
I rode along in the first truck in a convoy of Humvees on the way back to India Company ’s Forward Operating Base .
Our driver slammed on his brakes and said something to the sergeant in the passenger seat .
The sergeant stepped out of the vehicle and walked in front of the headlights .
“ What ’s going on ? ” I said to the driver .
“ There ’s a mound of dirt in the road that was not there this morning , ” the driver said .
I found it amazing that such a small detail was noticed .
“ Why is that a problem exactly ? ” I said .
“ It ’s in the shape of a speed bump , ” he said .
I stood up as much as I could in the back seat .
Sure enough , dirt had been carefully piled up on the road in the exact shape of a speed bump .
Someone had done this on purpose .
“ It could be a pressure - plate IED , ” he said , but he did not need to say so .
Those IEDs are notorious , and they do look exactly like speed bumps .
The explosives are triggered by the weight of a Humvee or Bradley .
The sergeant gingerly pushed dirt aside with his boot .
He had better hope there was n’t an insurgent lurking somewhere who could manually set it off .
I was safe in the back of an up - armored vehicle , but there ’s no way he could survive an explosion from right underneath him .
But there was nothing under the dirt , and no one triggered anything manually .
“ It ’s fine , ” the sergeant said as he climbed back in .
“ Why on earth would someone push dirt into the street like that ? ” I said , unconvinced that everything was actually fine .
It was obviously formed by hand for a specific purpose .
What on earth for ?
“ I do n’t know , sir , ” the sergeant said .
“ Iraqis are weird . ”
Perhaps someone wants Marines to become complacent about piles of dirt in the shape of a speed bump so they ’ll slowly learn to just drive over the top of them .
But it ’s also true that some Iraqis really are weird .
“ We ’ve had kids out here build fake IEDs on the side of the road , ” Lieutenant Laughlin said .
“ Last time it happened was right out in from of the station .
We saw what looked like an IED so we got out of our Humvees all concerned .
Then some kids jumped out and yelled Mister !
Mister !
Chocolate !
Chocolate !
They know they can get us to stop with fake IED , but we wo n’t give them candy when they do .
Our psy - ops guys put out fliers telling kids not to do this .
It ’s dangerous .
But they do n’t understand , or they do n’t care . ”
*
The next day we heard gunfire , and we heard a lot of it .
I walked the perimeter of Fallujah with a platoon from the Khaderi station .
Corporal Hayes was in charge of my security .
The desert was on our left , houses on our right .
“ Route Kathy was hit with a Katyusha rocket in early October , ” he said .
Route Kathy was one of the main streets through the neighborhood which we would shortly be walking along .
“ It was fired from six miles away . ”
There is nothing you can do if a Katyusha rocket explodes next to you .
You ’re just dead .
Iraqi Police officers joined us on the patrol .
They walked in front so it would appear to the locals that they were leading .
But they were not really leading .
“ They ’re too bunched up ! ” one of the Marines said .
“ Tell them to spread out . ”
Our interpreter told the Iraqi Police to spread out .
Too many people too close together are more likely to be shot at .
The Marines carried their regular rifles , and a few brought grenade launchers , too .
One Marine fingered a smoke grenade – they ’re useful if you come under fire from snipers .
Some carried signal flares to be fired in the air if we made contact with the enemy .
Overwatch at the station will see the flares and send reinforcements .
I carried a high - tech signal device that Lieutenant Mike Barefoot had given me in case I got separated from the platoon .
Several unemployed Iraqi men loitered and waved hello as we passed .
“ There ’s movement on the roof of that house , ” one Marine said and pointed to a house just outside the city on our left .
I could barely make out the figure of a person on top .
“ There ’s two people up there now , ” said another .
They were too far away to accurately shoot at us with anything but a sniper rifle .
But they could give away our position to somebody closer if that ’s what they wanted to do .
It did n’t seem like a big deal to me .
But complacency kills , so I stopped walking in a straight line and started to zig zag at random to make myself harder to shoot at .
It was not because I was paranoid .
I never felt nervous in Fallujah , not even after what happened next .
I ’ve just learned to do a few things that soldiers and Marines do to make myself a harder target .
I do it casually now , often times without even thinking about it .
We walked a few moments in silence and kept our eyes on the roof of that house .
Suddenly we heard automatic gunfire behind us .
“ Shit , ” I said .
“ That sounds close . ”
“ It sounds bad , ” I heard a Marine say .
More gun shots .
“ It sounds like it ’s coming from that checkpoint we just passed , ” Corporal Hayes said .
Then there were more shots , also automatic , and they sounded different .
More than one kind of weapon was being fired .
“ That ’s intense , ” I said .
And it was .
It sounded like a full - blown fire fight had just broken out .
“ That ’s worse than anything we ’ve seen since we got here , ” said another Marine .
We crossed the street and leaned up against the outer walls of the houses .
“ We have to get you back , ” Corporal Hayes said to me .
“ Back to Khaderi ? ” I said .
He nodded .
“ I do n’t want to go back , ” I said .
I was slightly surprised to hear myself say this .
I probably should have been scared .
A fire fight in Fallujah is nothing to shrug at .
But I wanted to see what would happen .
And of course I would stay in the rear where I would n’t be personally shot at .
Several Marines sized me up in ways they had n’t before .
They were obviously trying to determine if I would be a liability for them in a fight , if I would need to be babysat while they were being shot at .
No one objected when I said I did n’t want to go back , but I have no idea what they were thinking .
“ Is that coming from the train station ? ” someone said .
Oh , I thought .
Yeah .
The Forward Operating Base that had been converted from a train station was only a few hundred meters away .
“ Maybe they ’re test firing at the station ? ”
As soon as somebody said it , I was sure that ’s what it was .
The shots were probably on the practice range .
Fallujah is no longer a war zone .
But we did n’t know .
The Marines are supposed to be warned in advance when the range goes live so they do n’t overreact and think there ’s a war on .
Every single one of them first thought what we were hearing was combat .
“ Khaderi is n’t answering . ”
“ That has to be the range , right ? ”
“ The shots are too consistent .
It is n’t a fight . ”
“ Somebody should have told us . ”
We still were n’t sure , though .
No one at Khaderi answered the call .
But everyone was slowly convinced that the gun shots were practice rounds on the range .
The platoon ’s radio squawked .
It was Khaderi .
Twenty minutes from now , we were told , they will be gun shots at the train station .
“ Nice of them to tell us , ” Corporal Hayes said .
It was only then that I noticed that none of the Iraqis on the street reacted in any noticeable way to what had just happened .
They did n’t take cover when we did .
We were all briefly certain that war had returned to Fallujah .
But the Iraqi kids still played in the street .
They did not run and hide .
Their parents did not yank them inside .
Try to imagine that in an American city .
One of the Marines later told me that military dogs , while they ’re being trained , are put into rooms with loud speakers .
The first half hour of Stephen Spielberg ’s Saving Private Ryan -- that terrifying scene where hundreds of soldiers are shot and blown to pieces while storming the beach at Normandy – are played over and over again until the dogs no longer fear the sounds of war .
Iraqis who live in Fallujah have heard more shots fired in anger than I ever will .
Machine gun fire has been the sound track in that city for a long time .
War is just a shot away , but even the children of Fallujah wo n’t flinch if it breaks out again .

Sick and tired of work ?
Stress may be culprit
You 're so busy you can't take a vacation , your boss drives you crazy and your company just announced layoffs .
It 's stress , stress and more stress , and it's no wonder the American Psychological Association Stress in America survey last year revealed work as the leading cause of stress .
Nearly three - quarters of people consider it a very or somewhat significant source , up from 59 percent in 2006 .
" Unfortunately , we reward the employees that work 100 hours a week , " says Gus Stieber , national sales director at Bensinger , DuPont & Associates , an EAP firm whose clients include Houston companies .
" They really do the job , but how long can they do it for ? "
The problem may stem from a supervisor who expects employees to put in eight more hours after they leave the office , Stieber says .
Be your own advocate .
Keep expectations realistic by organizing and prioritizing your responsibilities .
Ask for a job description .
Stress takes its toll physically , mentally and emotionally .
Poor eating habits can lead to chronic disease .
You become irritable and forgetful , anxious and angry .
Sleepless nights are the norm , making you prone to accidents and mistakes .
Your immune system weakens .
But it 's not hopeless .
Experts say you can take control of your stress level .
" Becoming aware of it is a very good first tool to fixing it , " says Melinda Stanley , a professor of psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine .
" Break down behaviors , thoughts and feelings related to stress . "
Do n't look to vending machines , alcohol , caffeine or cigarettes for comfort .
Exercise regularly , eat well - balanced meals or snacks every few hours , drink enough water and get adequate sleep .
" I think people feel more stressed in the workplace when they are n't taking good care of themselves , " Stanley says .
Escape the computer and phone for 2 - 5 minutes every 1 1/2 - 2 hours , says Terry Lyles , author of Good Stress : Living Younger Longer ( Healthful Communications , $ 21.95 ) .
" We should have a recovery break to recharge our batteries . "
Imagine a soothing place , breathe deeply from the diaphragm or take a walk for fresh air .
" Ten years ago , we did n't have crackberries , " Lyles adds .
" Now people can stay connected to us when we 're in our sleep cycles . "
Have a Plan B if you 're concerned about layoffs , says Eva Stubits , a Houston clinical psychologist .
Update your résumé , explore other job opportunities and network .
Lyles says the elite athletes and corporate executives he works with approach stress as a stimulus , pressure to improve .
They learn how to extend their limits and to recognize their true limits .
" Stress is nothing more than gravity , " he adds .
" It 's what you do with it . "
Employers , of course , can do their part by providing a healthy work environment .
Employee Assistance Programs , on - site daycare , open - door policies and flexible schedules support that , Stubits says .
Communication is key .
" Open up to someone at work , whether it 's your boss or someone in human resources , " says Philip Burguieres , vice chairman of the Houston Texans .
The Texans earned a Best Practices honor from the American Psychological Association Psychologically Healthy Workplace Awards Program last year .
It was the first NFL team to offer mental health insurance equal to physical health .
" In the workplace , there 's a stigma with regard to people who seek help , " says Burguieres , who has suffered from depression .
" Probably across the board , most people are working longer hours and probably feel they have less ability to focus on family and personal time , " Stubits says .
Stress typically comes on gradually , and some of it is very normal , Stieber says .
Yet if it lasts three months or longer , evolving into a lifestyle , that 's a warning sign .
Strive for a sense of equality between work and personal .
" If you feel things are fair , " Stieber says , " stress wo n't be that bad . "

Playoff time is finally here , and as promised , I 'm going to run a COM - vs - COM sim of every matchup using Tecmo Super Bowl and the rosters found here ( with some tweaks to reflect current depth charts ) .
But first , there 's some business to attend to ...
I just did the article last week for a larf , but it was picked up by Deadspin and Football Outsiders , among others .
And , like the idiot I can be sometimes , I forgot to give proper credit where it was due .
So , special shout - outs go to :
Greg the Ex - ' Burgher , for originally doing something like this two years ago , and for pointing me to ...
Knobbe.org , the makers of the incredible 32 - team ROM I 'm using , and your one - stop destination for all things Tecmo .
The Sportscenter Altar , for providing the super - dope NFL Primetime music you hear over the highlights .
music you hear over the highlights .
And , last but not least , Tecmo , for making such a timelessly classic game that still holds its own 17 years after it was released .
Thanks again , guys , and sorry for not mentioning you last week !
Now , to the games .
Tecmo was abysmal at picking last week , selecting the winner only once ( Chicago over New Orleans ) in five tries !
Hopefully , the game will do better this time around .
For each game , I 'll tell you what Tecmo's simulated score was , as well as what I think the outcome will be -- you should take each with a grain of salt .
At Alex H.'s suggestion , I uploaded the entire games to Youtube , so you can watch them and pretend Chris Berman is narrating the action ( that goes double for you , Corey ) .
Oh , and the new " Matchup Breakdown " charts are based on a percentile ranking of each team using Football Outsiders ' DVOA metric .
Enjoy !
GAME OF THE WEEK : NY Giants vs. Tampa Bay
First Half
Second Half
Game Summary : The Tampa Bay Buccaneers won the opening toss and it was off to the races , as Jeff Garcia and Earnest Graham moved the Bucs down the field on an 82 - yard drive that ended with Garcia finding Ike Hilliard for a 14 - yard TD strike .
After the kickoff , Eli Manning was immediately intercepted , and Tampa quickly turned the turnover into points when Graham raced in for a 6 - yard TD to end the first quarter .
On the following drive , Manning finally started making plays , scrambling for a big gain and then firing a 23 - yard TD to Plaxico Burress in the back of the end zone .
But after a Tampa punt , Manning was back to his old ways , throwing a bad interception to Ronde Barber .
Tampa would use the field position to make a field goal , and the teams went to the half with the Bucs leading 17 - 7 .
After a New York punt to start the 3rd , Tampa maneuvered into field goal range and had a chance to go up 20 - 7 , but Matt Bryant missed a 47 - yarder .
The G - Men would make TB pay for this missed opportunity when Manning heaved a 55 - yard bomb to Burress to make the score 17 - 14 as the 3rd quarter came to a close .
When Tampa sputtered on offense to start the 4th , Manning stepped onto the field with 3:01 remaining in the game and a chance to pilot NY to their first playoff win since Kerry Collins took them to the Super Bowl in 2000 - 01 .
Despite his miscues earlier in the game , Manning was calm and decisive on the final drive , and his arm combined with the legs of Brandon Jacobs to move the Giants down the field for the go - ahead score .
Tampa would take the ball with just under a minute to play , but their final drive stalled at New York 's 15 yard line , and the game ended with Osi Umenyiora batting down Garcia 's pass with 0:00 on the clock .
21 - 17 Giants , final score .
My Prediction : New York 24 , Tampa Bay 21 .
Seattle vs. Washington
First Half
Second Half
Game Summary :
This simulation surprised me , because it was a rare case of COM - vs - COM Tecmo domination .
The Seahawks were forced to punt four times ( a whopping total for tecmo ) , were intercepted once , and gave the ball away on downs once as well .
They only amassed two first downs and 131 total yards all game , with Shaun Alexander struggling badly against Washington 's strong defense .
Meanwhile , Clinton Portis ran wild on Seattle , racking up 69 rushing yards on 12 carries and another 112 ( with a TD ) through the air .
It was as complete a victory as a computer team could have against another computer in Tecmo .
24 - 7 Redskins , final score .
My Prediction : Seattle 24 , Washington 21 .
Pittsburgh vs. Jacksonville
First Half
Second Half
( Note : I have no clue why Jacksonville 's uniforms are red and yellow .
Maybe they found some old 49ers unis and decided to go with them .
Who knows ?
Such are the mysterious ways of Tecmo . )
Game Summary :
This one was close ... for about a quarter .
David Garrard had the game of his life , tossing 5 TD passes with 0 interceptions en route to his first career playoff win as a starter .
Pittsburgh kept things close early on , answering Garrard 's first 2 touchdowns with a Santonio Holmes reverse for a score and a Ben Roethlisberger TD pass to Heath Miller .
But after a Maurice Jones - Drew touchdown made it 21 - 14 in Jacksonville 's favor midway through the 2nd quarter , a flea - flicker gone awry set up a Garrard TD to Dennis Northcutt to end the half with the score 28 - 14 , Jaguars .
Holmes cut Jacksonville 's lead to 7 when he ran another reverse into the end zone to start the 3rd , but Garrard answered with a TD to Marcedes Lewis , and Pittsburgh would turn the ball over ( INT , safety , INT ) on each of their remaining drives .
44 - 21 Jaguars , final score .
My Prediction : Jacksonville 28 , Pittsburgh 21 .
San Diego vs. Tennessee
First Half
Second Half
Game Summary :
You just knew that this game would be a back - and - forth affair .
With LaDainian Tomlinson leading the Charger attack , San Diego jumped out to an early lead ( probably accompanied by Tecmo - Philip Rivers hurling cyber- insults at the opponent ) .
But just as quickly , Vince Young hit Justin Gage on a 49 - yard game - tying bomb , and after Stephen Tulloch recovered a Tomlinson fumble in the 2nd quarter , Young ran it in himself to make it 14 - 7 Tennessee .
With 1:28 left in the half , San Diego struck back with a huge Rivers - to - Vincent Jackson connection that tied the game at 14 , and Tomlinson tacked on 7 more when he scampered in untouched to start the 3rd .
Young was n't through , though -- he immediately engineered an epic 96 - yard drive that ended with him finding Bo Scaife in the back of the end zone to tie the game as time expired in the quarter .
This playoff game was beginning to resemble one of those NBA games where two superstars just take over , and Tomlinson did his part when he took a Rivers screen pass and ran 24 yards downfield , then capped the drive with a 5 - yard TD run that put San Diego back on top .
After a solid return by Chris Henry , it looked as though Young would have time for one more heroic drive ... but his pass on 3rd - and - 21 from his own 47 was picked off by Quentin Jammer , and that was the ballgame .
28 - 21 Chargers , final score .
My Prediction : San Diego 24 , Tennessee 14 .
Paula Abdul Super Bowl Performance Taped Not Live
UPDATE : View video below
Either the producers of the Super Bowl pregame show want to make darn sure that they do n't have a flop like the VMA 's did withorwants to make darn sure that we see the best performance she can give .
Word is that Paula 's comeback performance will be a taped segment that was done in front of a live audience on January 27th .
Fox Sports executive producer , David Hill said this performance was too last minute for Paula and that she is simply too nervous to perform live .
It 's odd but I think we did a post a few weeks ago , so she had plenty of time to get it going .... right ?
American Idol host Ryan Seacrest said that Paula has been working very hard and he believes she will pull this off but also added that he will not preview the tape before the pregame show .
Ryan wants to be surprised like everyone else .
Or does Ryan not want to be put in the position on being asked the million dollar question by Abdul : ' Was I good , will people like me ? '

エクセルは、バージョンが上がるたびに何かしらの新機能が搭載される。例えばエクセル2000では「ピボットグラフ」機能が追加され、エクセル2002では「スマートタグ」などの新機能が目玉となった。だがその陰で、非常に便利なのにもかかわらず、なくなってしまった機能があることをご存じだろうか。図の「マップ」機能もその1つだ。
「 2002 」 で消え た “ 地図グラ フ ” の作成機 能
マップとは、エクセルで “ 地図グラフ ” を作成する機能。地域ごとの売上高を棒グラフにして地図上に配置したり、都道府県別の顧客構成を円グラフで示したりと、統計データの図示に絶大な威力を発揮した機能だ。地名と数値を入力した表を基に、簡単に地図グラフが作成できるスグレモノである。
エクセル95や97の時代、マップは標準のメニューとして搭載されていた。エクセル2000では、利用するために追加インストールが必要になったが、便利な地図グラフの作成ツールとして、雑誌やマニュアル本などでも詳しく取り上げられていたものだ。
ところが、エクセル2002の登場とともに、なぜかこのマップは姿を消している。それまでマップを活用していたユーザーは、「2002にバージョンアップしたら、マップが使えなくなった」と混乱したものだ。あれほど便利な機能を、なぜ、あえて削除しなければならなかったのだろう。
実はマイクロソフトは、オフィス2000の発売とほぼ同時期に、米国で「マップポイント」というビジネス向けの地図ソフトを発売している。この地図ソフトには、エクセルのデータを基に、地図グラフを作成する機能が備わっていた。いわば、エクセルのマップ機能を独立させ、より高機能な地図ソフトに仕上げたようなものだ。日本では発売されていないが、以来米国では、地図グラフの作成は、もっぱらマップポイントの仕事と見なされたようだ。エクセルのマップが削除された背景には、そんな事情が伺える。
もちろん、マップが消えた原因はそれだけではない。地図データには、さまざまな“版権”の問題が発生する。また、市町村の合併に見られるように、常に最新の地図に更新する必要もある。地図データを維持していくには、相当なコストと手間が発生するのだ。残念なことだが、表計算ソフトの付属機能として継続するには、荷が重すぎたのかもしれない。
A sizeable faction of the people who think peak oil is important , and happening soon enough to care about , think it has big implications for agriculture .
And most of them agree on what those implications are : as a society , we are going to have to give up the big combine harvesters , the thunderous power of 275 horsepower tractors , and instead we will have to return to small - scale , hand - labor organic production .
Rather than having 2 - 5 % of the working population involved in agriculture , as in most western societies at present , most people will need to be involved in growing food .
This is part of the agenda of the relocalization movement , which itself is a recent reincarnation of a long - standing movement for localism
This argument has never really made sense to me , but my recent explorations of food prices and biofuels have sharpened up my conviction that the thinking behind this position is mistaken .
In this piece , I 'm going to first document that some influential peak - oilers do in fact believe this , then try to discuss what I think the reasoning is -- it 's not usually made very explicit but it depends on something I 'm calling the Fallacy of Reversibility .
Finally , I 'm going to lay out why I do n't think things are going to go the way the proponents of relocalization expect , at least not any time soon .
Relocalization Quotes
The idea that " peak oil " was something that society was going to have to reckon with began amongst scientists with backgrounds in the oil industry - most famously Hubbert himself , and then elaborated by Colin Campbell Ken Deffeyes , and others .
These oil industry scientists - what I will call the first wave of peak oil thinkers and writers - were mainly interested in estimating when peak oil would be , and the likely supply side mitigations ( or lack of them ) .
The implications of peak oil for agriculture was not a major focus .
However , a second wave of journalists , writers , and non-profits have been doing a lot to spread the word about peak oil - Richard Heinberg , James Kunstler , Julian Darley and the Post Carbon Institute , the staff of the Community Solution , and others have all written books , held conferences , and started non-profits to warn the world about the dangers of peak oil .
Given that the world as a whole has been doing its best to stay in denial about peak oil these outreach efforts have been a valuable service -- certainly I have learned a lot from them .
At the same time , these writers bought to the table an agenda about society in general , and agriculture in particular , that I believe lacks an empirical foundation .
Let me start with a quote from Jim Kunstler :
We have to produce food differently .
The ADM / Monsanto / Cargill model of industrial agribusiness is heading toward its Waterloo .
As oil and gas deplete , we will be left with sterile soils and farming organized at an unworkable scale .
Many lives will depend on our ability to fix this .
Farming will soon return much closer to the center of American economic life .
It will necessarily have to be done more locally , at a smaller - and - finer scale , and will require more human labor .
The value - added activities associated with farming -- e.g. making products like cheese , wine , oils -- will also have to be done much more locally .
This situation presents excellent business and vocational opportunities for America 's young people ( if they can unplug their Ipods long enough to pay attention . )
It also presents huge problems in land - use reform .
Not to mention the fact that the knowledge and skill for doing these things has to be painstakingly retrieved from the dumpster of history .
The Community Solution also believes that the current agricultural model cannot be sustained , though they are concerned about the ability to manage the transition :
Reliance on large - scale agribusiness , driven by vast energy consumption , has resulted in an agricultural monoculture that is simply not sustainable .
But where are the tens of millions of small farmers who will be necessary if we are to return to locally grown food crops ?
And what about all the food that is being used for feed , and now , for fuel ?
The Post Carbon Institute is attempting to build model farms of the kind that they believe will be required post peak :
Using science , proven tools , and evolving methodologies the Energy Farm Initiative seeks to demonstrate systems of agriculture that can sustain both farms and communities in the face of climate change and peak oil .
This program weaves threads of the Relocalization vision into a fabric of local currency , local food and biofuel systems , revitalization of local industry , and community cooperation .
Our aim is to build flexible systems that reduce dependence on high energy inputs and produce food and reliable renewable energy for local users .
The steps in which this transition is manifest is the Local Energy Farm Initiative .
Another writer who has been very influential in getting the word out about peak oil is Richard Heinberg ( including reportedly reaching former President Bill Clinton ) .
I profiled Richard here .
In December of last year , he wrote :
The aim of substantially or entirely removing fossil fuels from agriculture is implicit in organic farming in all its various forms and permutations - including ecological agriculture , Biodynamics , Permaculture , Biointensive farming , and Natural Farming .
All also have in common a prescription for the reduction or elimination of tillage , and the reduction or elimination of reliance on mechanized farm equipment .
Nearly all of these systems rely on increased amounts of human labor , and on greater application of place - specific knowledge of soils , microorganisms , weather , water , and interactions between plants , animals , and humans ...
Because ecological organic farming methods are often dramatically more labor - and knowledge - intensive than industrial agriculture , their adoption will require an economic transformation of societies .
The transition to a non -fossil - fuel food system will take time .
Nearly every aspect of the process by which we feed ourselves must be redesigned .
And , given the likelihood that global oil peak will occur soon , this transition must occur at a forced pace , backed by the full resources of national governments .
I have to say that I really do n't like the sound of " at a forced pace , backed by the full resources of national governments " .
As JD , of Peak OIl Debunked , noted recently there is a history of attempts to forcibly reallocate land to urbanites : it 's mainly been attempted by dictators , and the results have made the countries in question bywords of disaster ( Cambodia and Zimbabwe are examples in recent decades ) .
The most thoughtful advocate of relocalization I know is Jason Bradford , who is quantitative enough to have investigated his own area , the rural Northern California county of Mendocino , and discovered that the county probably could not feed itself :
Out of 2,246,400 acres of land in Mendocino County , 94,039 acres or 4.19 percent is considered prime agricultural soils ( NRCS - USDA figures ) .
Of that amount , much is unavailable and covered by roads , highways , cities , parks , and other land uses .
While growth is very slow in Mendocino County , settlement patterns have tended to occur in areas dominated by prime soils .
Only one third , or approximately 35,000 acres , of prime farmland remain available for agricultural use .
Besides the unavailability of prime farmland , changes in hydrology as a result of agricultural and other human uses have affected the quality and use of prime farmland .
The Caltrans EIR implies that in about a ca. 20 year span , Mendocino County went from 69,000 to 35,000 acres of prime farmland , down from and original endowment of 94,000 acres .
This does seem like a remarkably high rate of loss , totaling 34,000 acres or about 1700 acres per year for 20 years .
In either case , whether the real figure is closer to 69,000 or 35,000 , both are far from the estimated need of ca. 95,000 .
I think as Jason investigates further , he is going to find more reasons for pessimism about this path .
The Fallacy of Reversibility
So , the second wave peak oil writers see us as abandoning the combine harvester and returning to this kind of scene :
Raking hay by hand .
Image courtesy : University of Minnesota .
Let me try to summarize what I believe the underlying logic of their position is .
What is certainly true is that pre-industrial societies generally use a lot less energy , and have a much larger share of their population involved in agriculture than industrialized societies do .
Jason Bradford did a nice analysis a few weeks back , and I made this graph based on his analysis :
Industrial energy use per capita versus share of population used in agriculture .
Source : Does Less Energy Mean More Farmers based on data from the FAO and EIA .
Clearly , as countries have gone through the process of industrialization and development ( roughly moving down the curve to the right ) , they have come to use more energy in general , and their agriculture has become far more mechanized and involves a smaller fraction of the population .
Another view of the same process can be seen in this World Bank graphic , which shows both the share of agriculture in the labor force and in gross domestic product , but this time plotted against GDP / capita :
Share of agriculture in labor force and GDP for a sample of countries .
Source : Figure 1.2 of the World Bank's World Development Report 2008
This reminds us that countries that have far higher portions of the labor force in agriculture do n't just use less energy , they are also far less wealthy .
( Note that the scale in this graph is logarithmic and cuts off around Argentina - the full graph on a linear scale would have a sharply curved hyperbolic shape much like the energy versus agricultural population one from Jason 's analysis ) .
So I think the argument of the relocalization advocates essentially is that , since we were using a lot less energy before we were industrialized , and our population was primarily agricultural then , and peak oil implies we will have less energy in the future , or at least less liquid fuel , then it must be the case that the agricultural population will grow again .
In other words , having coming come down the curve in the graphs above from the top left to the lower right , our society will now start to retrace its steps back up the curve .
This implies that the process of industrialization and development is a reversible process .
We in the developed world have evolved from low - energy high - agriculture societies into a high - energy low - agriculture society .
So the thinking goes that we can / should / will reverse that process and go back to something like what we were 200 years ago ( at least on these large macro- economic variables ) .
Now , coming from a background as a scientist , there are many reversible processes familiar in science ( and indeed in everyday life ) , but there are also a lot of irreversible processes .
Some examples of reversible processes - if you lift up a weight , you can set it back down again into the same position it was in before .
If you blow up a balloon , then , up to a certain point , you can let the air out and get back more or less the uninflated balloon you had before you started .
If you pump water from a lower reservoir to a higher reservoir , you can let it down again , and the lower reservoir will be in little different condition than if you had n't bothered .
If you freeze a liquid by cooling it , you can warm it up again and have the same liquid .
Here are some examples of irreversible processes .
If you let grape juice ferment into wine , there 's no way to get grape juice back .
If you bake a cake in the oven , there 's no way to turn it back into cake dough .
If you ice and decorate the cake , but then accidentally drop it on the floor , there 's no way to pick it up and have anything approaching the same cake as if you had n't dropped it .
So when you industrialize a society , is that a reversible process ?
Can you take it on a backward path to a deindustrialized society that looks in the important ways like the society you had before the industrialization ?
As far as I can see , the " second wave " peak oil writers treat it as fairly obvious that this is both possible and desirable .
It appears to me that it is neither possible or desirable , but at a minimum , someone arguing for it should seriously address the question .
And it is this failure that I am calling the Fallacy of Reversibility .
It is most pronounced in Kunstler , who in addition to believing we need a much higher level of involvement in agriculture also wants railways , canals , and sailing ships back , and is a strong proponent of nineteenth century urban forms .
I am going to christen this general faction of the peak oil community reversalists .
This encompasses people advocating a return to earlier food growing or distribution practices ( the local food movement ) , folks wanting to bring back the railways and tramcars , people believing that large scale corporations will all collapse , that the Internet will fail and we need to " make our own music and our own drama down the road .
We 're going to need playhouses and live performance halls .
We 're going to need violin and banjo players and playwrights and scenery - makers , and singers . "
And before moving on , I stress that I 'm not making an argument that our time is in all ways better than earlier times and that nostalgia for the past is entirely misplaced .
Nor am I making an argument that peak oil does not pose a massive and important challenge to us .
Instead , I 'm making an argument that society is unlikely to reverse its trajectory of development , regardless of what we might like .
Calls for it to do so are a distraction and get in the way of figuring out what we really need to be doing , and what the real options and dangers are .
Why it Wo n't Be So
Industrial farming is less profitable at high oil prices than at low oil prices .
Now that we are at , or close to , peak oil , industrial agriculture is beginning to show signs of strain , indicating it may break down in the future , allowing alternative approaches to take over .
Industrial farmers use more labor in the face of high oil prices .
Farms are starting to get smaller now that peak oil is nigh .
In developing countries , where the farmers never unlocalized in the first place , the dynamics are changing to favor small subsistence farmers over larger mechanized operations .
Although the reversalist approach to peak oil covers many dimensions of society , I 'm going to confine my attention in this piece to the proposition that agriculture is likely to revert to eighteenth or nineteenth century approaches in the face of a slowly contracting oil supply .
My central tool for looking at the question is going to be the factors going into the profitability of industrial agriculture .
If it 's the case that agriculture is going to revert to a manual low - energy process in the face of peak oil , then that should show up in the profitability data .
Here are some natural predictions we might make :
As we shall see , the evidence does n't provide any support for any of these propositions , and in fact it tends to provide at least some evidence for the opposite view : the industrial agricultural system appears to be strengthened by peak oil , and is likely to get stronger still in the near future .
Rather than industrial farms losing money , land prices dropping , and desperate farmers loooking to throw in the towel and sell out to the hordes of neo - peasant reversalists , we find farm incomes rising , average farm sizes increasing , and no sign of greater use of labor in the production of the core arable crops in the US .
Agricultural Profitability and Oil Prices
Most of my analysis is based on the data compiled by the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) on the average costs of growing various kinds of crops .
This data is based on national surveys of farmers and represent an average for all farmers ( some will be doing better than the average , some worse ) .
Let 's start with corn :
Average cost structure and revenue of US corn farmers , per acre , 1975 - 2006 .
Source : USDA .
Costs have been adjusted to 2006 dollars via the BLS CPI -U .
Here , the various colored bands are the different costs of producing corn , expressed in 2006 US dollars per acre of land planted in corn .
The heavy black line is the revenue per acre of selling the corn .
The big picture is that very little money is spent on labor ( indeed , agriculture in the US is highly industrialized ) , that costs have been coming down over time , and that farming in recent decades has been an activity with modest and unpredictable profits ( that graph represents a business I would not want to be in ) .
The cost reduction per acre is particularly striking given that yields per acre have been improving steadily over this period - farmers have obviously gotten enormously more productive over time ( all that machinery and those fancy chemicals really do work as advertised , it seems ) .
It 's worth quickly noting that most of the spikes of better profitability come at times of high oil prices ( 1975 , 1979 , and 2006 ) .
We will explore this more systematically in a moment .
Here is the same thing for wheat :
Average cost structure and revenue of US wheat farmers , per acre , 1975 - 2006 .
Source : USDA .
Costs have been adjusted to 2006 dollars via the BLS CPI -U .
The story is similar , except that both costs and revenues per acre are lower , and profitability is even worse .
To look at the relationship between profitability and oil prices for the sectors as a whole , I took the profit margin ( revenues - costs ) / revenues , but excluded land and unpaid labor from the costs .
The reason for excluding land is that I would expect land prices to mainly reflect the profits being made on the land , so including them in costs is confounding understanding the profitability of the sector ( obviously , an individual farm has to worry about the land costs , but the land is only worth anything because people are farming it , so it 's a confounding effect at at sector level ) .
I excluded unpaid labor as owner 's compensation which I consider more a form of profit than a cost .
For that definition of profit margin , for the three main arable field crops , we get this graph :
Average profit margin for US farmers on three main field crops , versus oil prices .
Profit margin is computed without the land rent or unpaid labor cost components , 1975 - 2006 .
Source : USDA and author 's calculations for profit margin , BP for oil prices in 2006 dollars .
There is a very weak upward slope to all three lines ( ie in the direction of better profits at higher oil prices ) .
In an effort to reduce the noise , I produced a weighted average according to the planted acreage of the three crops :
Acreage of three main field crops in the United States , 1975 - 2007 .
Source : USDA .
and thus got this graph :
Average profit margin for US farmers on acreage weighted average of three main field crops , versus oil prices .
Profit margin is computed without the land rent or unpaid labor cost components , 1975 - 2006 .
Source : USDA and author 's calculations for profit margin , BP for oil prices in 2006 dollars
The relationship is somewhat stronger - profits are a little likelier to be higher when oil is expensive , but oil prices explain only about 12 % of the variance in profit margins .
The relationship is just barely statistically significant ( p = 4.9 % ) , but I would n't set too much store in it , given that the regression is not controlled for any other factors that might be explanatory .
But certainly , there is no evidence for the idea that farms are less profitable at high oil prices - that inference is completely unsupported by the data since 1975 .
The analysis does not include 2007 , since the cost data are not available yet , but it is likely that 2007 had high profit margins ( since crop prices were very high ) , and certainly it had fairly high oil prices .
I will argue below that this is a harbinger of the game - changing role of biofuels , which will tend in the future to make industrial farming more profitable as oil prices rise .
Labor Usage in Arable Crop Production
Let 's turn for a moment to the use of labor in the farm system .
If it was the case that peak oil was promoting a return to a more local , less industrialized , style of agriculture , we might expect to see usage of labor correlated with oil prices - when oil prices are high , farmers are differentially likely to prefer to do things manually and use less expensive fuel to get the job done .
So I looked at the total labor input ( both paid and unpaid ) into the crop versus oil prices :
Average labor expended per acre by US farmers of corn , wheat , and soybeans , versus oil prices 1975 - 2006 .
Both are converted to 2006 $ .
Source : USDA .
What we see is that wheat and soybeans show essentially no meaningful relationship between oil prices and the amount of labor per acre that farmers use .
They use the same low amount regardless .
Corn farmers actually spend less on labor when oil prices are high , for reasons that are unclear - however the relationship is quite strong ( r2 of 43 % ) and very statistically significant ( p = 0.005 % ) .
So again , there is no evidence in the data for the reversalist idea that farmers might need more labor when oil prices get high on account of peak oil .
Biofuels and the Future of Industrial Agriculture
A possible objection to my argument thus far is that , although we may be at or near peak oil , nonetheless we have n't seen anything yet in terms of how high oil prices could go - $ 100 / barrel is nothing , and when we see $ 200 / barrel or $ 300 / barrel , then the situation will change , industrial agriculture will fall apart , and the reversalist future ( which is really the past ) will start to play out .
Now , I certainly would not discount the possibility that oil could get to $ 200 / barrel .
With an income elasticity near 1 , we would expect to see oil usage expand by a few percent a year due to global economic growth if prices were constant .
Since supply has not been increasing at all for the last couple of years , higher prices have been required to balance supply and demand .
Since elasticity of oil demand is more like 0.05 , it takes several tens of percent of price increases each year to balance the missing single percentage point increases in supply that are n't occuring .
That 's how we got to $ 100 oil .
If supply continues to be flat , it 's quite possible oil will get to $ 200 in a few years time .
On the other hand , if the credit - collapse recession in the US turns severe , as it certainly could , oil prices could fall a lot instead .
If we do manage to get a boost in supply from the 2008 megaprojects , that will moderate prices also , at least for a time .
But what I would argue is that if oil gets to $ 200 / barrel , industrial agriculture is likely to do very well .
I pointed out in Fermenting the Food Supply that corn-ethanol has been profitable even without subsidies at times in the last few years , and that whenever oil prices go up sharply , there is a huge spurt in the growth of the biofuel industry .
This creates an arbitrage between food prices and fuel prices , and mean that the former must go up whenever the latter go up ( since the biofuel industry can very easily use most of the global food supply without adding more than a modest fraction to the fuel supply ) .
This next graphic summarized the key point :
Bottom panel : capacity of ethanol plants at year end , in production and under construction , as a percentage of total ethanol potential of the entire US corn crop in that year ( left scale ) , together with year on year change in that percentage ( right scale ) .
Top panel : oil prices ( annual average in $ 2006 ) .
Sources : USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service for corn production , National Corn Growers Association for conversion efficiencies , and Renewable Fuels Association for ethanol plant capacities .
Oil prices are sourced from BP .
I suggested earlier that the growth rate has a lot to do with oil prices , and I 've made that more explicit in the graph above with the green lines .
When oil prices spike up , a year or so later we have a new burst of ethanol capacity under construction ( which then comes on stream 1 - 2 years after that ) .
This has had a lot to do with the high crop prices of the last two years .
Thus , if we get $ 200 oil , I confidently expect a new burst of growth in crop prices and for farm revenues to go up a lot .
If we look at the average costs over the last thirty years :
Average cost structure and revenue of US corn farmers , per acre , 1975 - 2006 .
Source : USDA .
we can see that some costs are of a kind that scale with energy prices .
The " fuel " component is certainly that way , but fertilizer is almost entirely made from natural gas and will tend to go up in periods of high energy prices .
And , for safety , I 've also included chemicals , most of which have petroleum or natural gas as the feedstock ( though I imagine most of the value is added in manufacturing , rather than in the raw fossil fuel input ) .
However , the rest of the farm costs do n't have a direct relationship to energy costs ( the various forms of labor , cost of capital , etc ) .
So with this decomposition , the history of corn farm costs and profits looks as follows :
Revenue of corn farmers , together with cost structure decomposed into hypothesized energy price scaling and energy price independent components .
Costs exclude the land rent or unpaid labor cost components , 1975 - 2006 .
Source : USDA .
As you can see , the non-energy components have not increased much at all since 2002 , but the energy - related portions have been increasing sharply .
All costs were high in the 1970s and early 1980s ( when not only were energy costs high but interest rates were extremely high too , so that capital costs were very great ) .
So going forward , I expect to see significant increases in food prices and farm profitability ( with a significant caveat for the possibility of a credit - induced severe recession ) .
The following hypothetical scenario for what happens to the corn curve if both energy and corn prices increase by 15 % / year in real terms , while other farm costs ( eg labor , cost of capital ) stay flat in real terms .
As you can see - industrial farmers do very well in that case :
Revenue of corn farmers , together with cost structure decomposed into hypothesized energy price scaling and energy price independent components .
Costs exclude the land rent or unpaid labor cost components .
Actuals for 1975 - 2006 , and scenario ( not forecast ) for 2007 - 2013 based on 15 % annual increases in energy - scaling costs and corn prices , with flat other costs .
Source : USDA .
Clearly , farmers making money like that will not be selling out to hordes of the urban poor trying to go back to the land , nor will they need to employ them .
Instead , the farmers will simply outbid the urban poor for the energy required to operate the farms ( and in the US , the farm sector only uses 2.2 % of all petroleum in the country ) .
Farm Size Trends
Farms in the US have been getting steadily bigger for a long time .
The reasons are very simple : there are substantial economies of scale in industrial farming - it 's desirable to keep the expensive machinery and administrative labor working at maximum capacity , which means spreading it out over as much land as possible .
That leads to this kind of graph :
Operating profit as a function of farm size in the US , 2003 .
Source : USDA .
Small farms lose money at a great rate , and only large operations make a profit .
This is a recipe for larger farms as the small ones sell out to their wealthier neighbors .
As the share of energy in the cost structure grows , this graph may moderate a little ( since fertilizer and fuel usage are likely directly proportional to acreage ) .
However , there is nothing in high energy costs that will make it reverse - it will still be beneficial to spread the non-energy costs over more acreage .
Thus although the trend of increasing farm size may slow , there is nothing to put it into reverse .
And in the developing world , another important factor comes into play .
As we discussed last week , over half of all households in rural areas in developing countries are net food importers , even though the vast majority are involved in agriculture somehow .
Thus , rising food prices will place tremendous stress on very poor households that grow some food , but not enough to live on .
They may be forced to sell their land to larger landholders that produce a surplus .
Thus , we may see the exact opposite of what the relocalization movement might predict - farm sizes in developing countries may increase in the face of peak oil .
In Conclusion
I 've argued in this piece that industrial agriculture is likely to be stronger and more profitable when oil prices are high , not weaker .
So the reversalist future of local food production on smaller farms with higher labor input will not come to pass as a result of peak oil .
The industrial agricultural sector owns most of the land , and will be in an excellent position to increase their land holdings as remaining subsistence farmers fail or consolidate in the face of high food prices .
Industrial farmers will have no reason to sell out to improverished urban dwellers .
Thus the industrialization of the land is not a reversible process any time soon - it is a fallacy to think so .
The reversalists are expressing wishful thinking and nostalgia for the past , not a reasoned analysis of how the future is likely to play out .
And urbanites worried about their future should not be looking to buy or rent a smallholding as a solution to their problems - industrial farmers are extremely efficient , and there is no way to compete with them except by becoming one .

One Human Family
The conviction that we belong to one human family is at the heart of the Bahá ’í Faith .
The principle of the oneness of humankind is “ the pivot round which all the teachings of Bahá ’u ’ lláh revolve ” .
Bahá ’u ’lláh compared the world of humanity to the human body .
Within this organism , millions of cells , diverse in form and function , play their part in maintaining a healthy system .
The principle that governs the functioning of the body is cooperation .
Its various parts do not compete for resources ; rather , each cell , from its inception , is linked to a continuous process of giving and receiving .
Acceptance of the oneness of humanity demands that prejudice — whether racial , religious , or gender related — must be totally eliminated .

Members of Congress & Senate
I am writing this letter on behalf of all concerned citizens of the United States of America .
As you are probably aware , there continues to be mounting evidence of election fraud , most recently in the primary election in New Hampshire .
Specifically , the use of electronic tabulation devices and the privatization of vote counting cannot be tolerated in a nation that cherishes Democracy so dearly .
If you are unfamiliar with the information I urge you to perform a Google search or to explore the HBO documentary " Hacking Democracy " which is available to view on YouTube .
Now more than ever our country is desperately in need of sweeping reform that guarantees every citizens most sacred right .
I am flabbergasted at the hypocrisy of the legislative branch of our government .
Even the NFL and its fans demand perfection with the use of replay technology to scrutinize every play , thereby ensuring the correct outcome .
Football is at best , a trivial pastime , however it offers us an invaluable lesson that should serve as a template for all future elections .
Our FREE elections are perhaps the most important and symbolic representation of this great nation .
So let us never forget the lessons of history .
We as citizens expect our voices to be heard and for our votes to be counted , even if this requires ' instant replay ' .
We appropriate billions of dollars for so many questionable conflicts around the world and billions more for so much unchecked pork barrel spending .
Certainly you and your colleagues can agree there is nothing more inviolate than our FREE elections , regardless of the associated cost .
We The People demand and insist that members of the House of Representatives and Senate shall faithfully serve those they were ELECTED to serve .
I urge you to immediately support uniform legislation that protects and ensures the accurate outcome of all future primary , mid-term and general elections .
All
rational citizens agree , regardless of creed , color or party affiliation .
The future history of our great Democracy is counting on you .
Thank you for your consideration .
HRW said Kenyan leaders believed the US would tolerate electoral fraud
Allowing autocrats to pose as democrats without demanding they uphold civil and political rights risked undermining human rights worldwide , it warned .
HRW said Pakistan , Thailand , Bahrain , Jordan , Nigeria , Kenya and Russia had been falsely claiming to be democratic .
The World Report 2008 summarises human rights issues in more than 75 nations .
' Playing along '
In the report , HRW said established democracies such as the US and members of the European Union were increasingly tolerating autocrats " claiming the mantle of democracy " .
It seems Washington and European governments will accept even the most dubious election so long as the ' victor ' is a strategic or commercial ally
Kenneth Roth
HRW Executive Director
World Report 2008 ( 5.5MB )
" In 2007 too many governments , including Bahrain , Jordan , Nigeria , Russia and Thailand , acted as if simply holding a vote is enough to prove a nation ' democratic ' , and Washington , Brussels and European capitals played along , " it said .
" The Bush administration has spoken of its commitment to democracy abroad but often kept silent about the need for all governments to respect human rights . "
HRW Executive Director Kenneth Roth said it had become too easy for autocrats to get away with mounting a sham democracy " because too many Western governments insist on elections and leave it at that " .
ELECTORAL MANIPULATION
Outright fraud : Chad , Jordan , Kazakhstan , Nigeria , Uzbekistan Control of electoral machinery : Azerbaijan , Bahrain , Malaysia , Thailand , Zimbabwe Interfering with opposition candidates : Belarus , Cuba , Egypt , Iran , Israel ( in Palestinian territories ) , Libya , Turkmenistan , Uganda Political violence : Cambodia , Congo , Ethiopia , Lebanon Stifling the media and civil society : Russia , Tunisia Undermining the law : China , Pakistan Source : Human Rights Watch
" They do n't press governments on the key human rights issues that make democracy function - a free press , peaceful assembly , and a functioning civil society that can really challenge power , " he added .
HRW said the West was often unwilling to criticise the autocrats for fear of losing access to resources or commercial opportunities , or because of the perceived requirements of fighting terrorism .
" It seems Washington and European governments will accept even the most dubious election so long as the ' victor ' is a strategic or commercial ally , " Mr Roth said .
Aid donors
HRW highlighted Pakistan as an example .
It said the US and UK , its largest aid donors , had refused to distance themselves from President Pervez Musharraf , despite his " tilting the electoral playing field " by rewriting the constitution and firing the independent judiciary ahead of February 's election .
In terms of the United States and this administration ...
I do n't think there 's any question about where we stand in terms of promotion of democracy
Sean McCormack
US State Department spokesman
It also argued that Washington 's acceptance of the result of the Nigerian election in February 2007 , " despite widespread and credible accusations of poll - rigging and electoral violence " , had encouraged the Kenyan government to believe that fraud would be tolerated in December 's presidential poll .
And it said the US and some allies like Britain and France had made it harder to demand other countries uphold human rights by committing abuses themselves in the " war on terror " .
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and other European leaders were criticised for their reluctance to allow Turkey to join the EU , despite its improved human rights record .
HRW said the EU " lost leverage itself and diminished the clout of those in Turkey who have cited the prospect of EU membership as a reason for reform " .
Atrocities
Among the countries where the watchdog said human rights atrocities had been committed were Chad , Colombia , the Democratic Republic of Congo , Ethiopia , Iraq , Somalia , Sri Lanka and Sudan .
Burma , China , Cuba , Eritrea , Iran , Libya , North Korea , Saudi Arabia and Vietnam were criticised for severe repression and closed societies .
When asked about the claims made by HRW , US state department spokesman Sean McCormack said he had not seen the report , but insisted his country did not promote false democracy and condone human rights abuses .
" In terms of the United States and this administration speaking up in defence of , and advocating for , and putting its effort behind its rhetoric , I do n't think there 's any question about where we stand in terms of promotion of democracy , " he told reporters .
Ah , summer , the time for daydreams , like when BlogCritics.org 's John Bambenek believed he could haul DailyKos before the Federal Election Commission and have a hearing where he'd prove that we were violating the law by failing to register as a political committee .
Vacation 's over , and the FEC has unanimously determined that DailyKos qualifies as a media entity under federal law , and thus none of the site 's expenditures count under federal law for determining whether a political committee was formed .
Just like a newspaper is n't charged with making a campaign contribution by editorializing on behalf of a candidate , neither is this site :
Kos Media qualifies as a media entity in its function of operating DailyKos .
DailyKos is available to the general public and is the online equivalent of a newspaper , magazine , or other periodical publication as described in the Act and Commission regulations .
Additionally , DailyKos is precisely the type of online media presence the Commission contemplated when revising the media exemption provided in 11 C.F.R. §§ 100.73 and 100.132 .
An examination of DailyKos and other supporting materials demonstrates that the site ’s primary function is to provide news and commentary to millions of viewers through its " blog " entries providing news stories with links to " breaking news , " original political commentary , and calls to action .
Like traditional media outlets such as newspapers and magazines , DailyKos has a publisher , Moulitsas , who appears to retain editorial control over the content of the site , and a list of contributing editors , who along with Moulitsas appear to be " front page posters " and draft stories .
Further , registered users of DailyKos may post responsive comments , which are similar to letters to the editors in traditional media outlets .
In addition , Kos Media ’s creation and distribution of the DailyKos falls within the scope of the exemption .
First , the complaint does not allege , nor does publicly available information indicate , that Kos Media is owned or controlled by a political party , committee , or candidate .
Second , by creating and distributing the DailyKos , containing news stones with links to " breaking news , " original political commentary and calls to actions akin to editorials , Kos Media is acting within its legitimate press function that qualifies it as a press entity .
As such , Kos Media ’s creation and distribution of the DailyKos falls within Kos Media ’s legitimate press .
function .
Moreover , Kos Media 's operation of DailyKos is the type of activity contemplated by the Commission during its rulemaking regarding the media exemption ....
While the complaint asserts that DailyKos advocates for the election of Democrats to federal office , the Commission has repeatedly stated that an entity that would otherwise qualify for the media exemption does not lose its eligibility because it features news or commentary lacking objectivity or expressly advocates in its editorials the election or defeat of a federal candidate .
You can see our submission before the FEC via this link .
In an abundance of caution , I opted to be thorough with this one and review the FEC 's clear precedents -- if you 're doing news , commentary or editorial , and you 're not owned / controlled by a political candidate , party or committee , you 're exempt .
The law was clear before today , and it 's even clearer now : what this site does and what sites like this do is protected under federal law , and should not be the subject of baseless , time - consuming complaints .
We were n't the only folks to win before the FEC today .
Blogger Michael Grace was hit with an FEC complaint in 2006 which alleged that he created a site on something called a " blogspot " to criticize Rep.
Mary Bono , allegedly making unlawful , unreported expenditures in coordination with Bono 's opponent by blogging as " Mary Bono " on an obvious parody site .
Grace fought this one back by himself and won -- the FEC unanimously ruled that his voluntary expenditures ( if any ) were perfectly legal , and that his obvious parody was protected under the law : " the content of the blog sites would lead a reasonable person to believe that Grace ’s blog was not actually the creation of Mary Bono .
Instead , this is , as Grace contends , political satire that does not violate the Act . "
Bottom line : no blogger should have to go through what either we or Michael Grace did .
The FEC regulations for which we fought in 2005 - 06 make pretty damn clear that online grassroots political activity is protected under the law , and none of us should live under the threat of FEC sanction for our activities .
And , hopefully , these clear decisions will quash the cinematic dreams of gadflies like Bambenek who believe they can get their " day in court " to vindicate their personal fantasies of what the law is .
Now , one hopes , the FEC can focus its attention on more important things .
Lucky & Flo , the dogs employed by the MPAA to hunt down pirate media have returned home .
But before media pirates start celebrating , beware : there are two new pirate - chasing canines on the block .
The authorities say " Good Boy ! " to their latest recruits - Paddy and Manny , all the way from Ireland .
There have been many attempts at ending the flow of pirate media around the world but the introduction of sniffer dogs must rank up there with some of the most novel .
Back in September 2006 the MPAA introduced a pair of black Labrador dogs , trained to sniff out pirate media .
In fact the dogs were trained to recognize the aroma of polycarbonate – the material from which DVDs are made .
At the time , Dan Glickman , CEO of the MPAA explained : “ Lucky and Flo have helped us prove that if we think outside of the box , we can find new and interesting ways to assist law enforcement and Customs officials around the world to stop illegal shipments of counterfeit DVDs from making their way across borders ”
Indeed , Lucky and Flo enjoyed a great success ( pdf ) in March 2007 when they led authorities to seize 1,000,000 pirate DVDs , as part of ‘ Operation Double Trouble ’ .
It was n’t long before there were reports that the syndicate whose DVD ’s were seized were n’t happy – and they put a bounty on the heads of the black Labradors .
As the pair head home to the US , according to reports they are to be replaced by a fresh duo .
Paddy and Manny are a pair of male Labradors from Ireland .
One white , one black , they ’re being trained by the same people who taught Lucky and Flo and should arrive for duty in Malaysia around February 2008
“ Their training is almost completed , ” said Nor Hayati Yahaya , a Malaysian representative of the Motion Picture Association .
“ Malaysia will be the first to have its own canine unit for sniffing optical discs ” he added .
Just like their predecessors , Paddy and Manny are trained to detect polycarbonate from which DVDs are made .
They are not able to tell the difference between pirate and legal discs but as pirate discs are often hidden in areas which are documented as containing other materials , the dogs are able to sniff out the rogue items .
Malaysia has quite a bad record for piracy and these DVD sniffing dogs have provided them with a couple of headline grabbing hauls which generate some much needed publicity for the authorities , desperate to be seen to be taking action against pirates .
The MPA ’s Nor Hayati claims that the use of these dogs by Malaysia shows a “ huge difference in terms of attitude , commitment . ”
Others might say it ’s 10 % effort with the dogs , and 90 % commitment on the publicity drive .
Image , they say , is everything .
An international study investigating the carbon sink capacity of northern terrestrial ecosystems discovered that the duration of the net carbon uptake period ( CUP ) has on average decreased due to warmer autumn temperatures .
Net carbon uptake of northern ecosystems is decreasing in response to autumnal warming according to findings recently published January 3rd , in the journal Nature .
The carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems is particularly sensitive to climatic changes in autumn and spring .
Over the past two decades autumn temperatures in northern latitudes have risen by about 1.1 °C with spring temperatures up by 0.8 °C .
Many northern terrestrial ecosystems currently lose carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) in response to autumn warming , offsetting 90 % of the increased carbon dioxide uptake during spring .
Using computer modeling to integrate forest canopy measurements and remote satellite data , researchers found that while warm spring temperatures accelerate growth more than soil decomposition and enhance carbon uptake , autumn warming greatly increases soil decomposition and significantly reduces carbon uptake .
Lead author of the study , Dr. Shilong Piao from the LSCE , UMR CEA - CNRS , in France says " If warming in autumn occurs at a faster rate than in spring , the ability of northern ecosystems to sequester carbon will diminish in the future " .
Philippe Ciais also , a member of the research team and a scientist from the Global Carbon Project says " The potentially rapid decline in the future ability of northern terrestrial ecosystems to remove atmospheric carbon dioxide would make stabilization of atmospheric CO 2 concentrations much harder than currently predicted . "
This study was supported by European Community - funded projects ENSEMBLES and CARBOEUROPE IP , and by the National Natural Science Foundation of China as well as by Fluxnet - Canada , which was supported by CFCAS , NSERC , BIOCAP , MSC and NRCan .

US defence spending has seen a huge rise since 9/11
But as the nation 's defence budget soars , there has been a series of procurement and political scandals surrounding multi-billion dollar contracts .
There is mounting concern about the relationship between the Pentagon , the politicians setting the budgets and defence contractors - sometimes known as the iron triangle .
Congressman Henry Waxman , a Democrat , who chairs the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , argues for urgent reform .
" We need to restore transparency , efficiency and accountability to government contracting and nowhere is that more important than in defence . "
His committee was shocked at the scale of the problems revealed through investigations into federal procurement , of which defence accounts for almost three quarters .
" When we have contracts let out and we are seeing so much money involved , the oversight has been discouraged and accountability undermined , " he told the BBC .
Oversight committee
The oversight committee identified contracts worth a total of $ 762bn in which there were problems of mismanagement , poor value , and fraud .
" Some of the ways we are handling these contracts is almost an invitation for fraud and abuse , " said Mr Waxman .
It is an invitation some politicians found hard to resist .
In a trial in California in October 2007 defence contractor Brent Wilkes was found guilty on all charges relating to corrupt practices with his local congressman , Randy " Duke " Cunningham , a Republican .
According to author Seth Hettana , Wilkes enjoyed $ 90 m worth of defence contracts fixed by his pet congressman , some in exchange for sun and sleaze in Hawaii .
Congressman Randy Cunningham was jailed for corruption
" This was a lavish vacation that Wilkes threw for Cunningham at a $ 6,600 a night suite .
" The whole trip was an act of seduction , he instructed his nephew , his right hand man , to make some calls and find some girls .
" He even instructed his employees to lose to Cunningham at poker games .
Whatever the congressman needed - a boat payment , a mortgage payment - whatever the issues were in his life , Wilkes would try to take care of it for him . "
Cunningham is now in jail with Wilkes ' sentence expected next month .
' Earmarking ' under attack
The congressional device which enabled Cunningham to award contracts direct to his business friend is called earmarking .
Earmarking is legal under the US Constitution unless , like Cunningham , you receive bribes or other significant material benefits in direct return for awarding federal contracts .
Critics argue that earmarking can lead to individual politicians authorising federal money to be spent on businesses of their choosing , often with little public scrutiny and without competitive bidding .
As US defence spending has soared , so have earmarks , according to Winslow Wheeler , a former congressional staffer on Capitol Hill who handled earmark issues for Democrats and Republicans .
" It really started taking off after 9/11 .
In fiscal year 2001 it was about $ 2bn a year in the Defence Bill ; it doubled in that very first year to $ 4bn .
It went from there to $ 6bn to $ 8 bn .
Up to about $ 10 bn for fiscal year 2007 . "
Prime cuts
This huge rise raises questions which go to the heart of the US political system itself , and what is called pork barrel politics - government spending intended to benefit a politician 's constituents in return for their political support .
John Murtha has been criticised for Pork Barrel politics
The prime cuts of pork are found on Defence Appropriations - the same committee on which Randy Cunningham once sat .
Its chairman is now criticised for his heavy use of earmarks , although it is not suggested he has done anything illegal .
Democrat John P Murtha , who has represented a district in Pennsylvania in Congress for more than three decades , has risen to this key position in a committee overseeing half a trillion dollars spending this year .
According to Mr Wheeler , Mr Murtha " is a major porker .
" They have an event every year in Johnstown Pennsylvania - they call it the Murtha Fest , and lots of defence manufacturers come and display their goodies that they want Murtha 's help on .
Spending probity
" He gets his popularity in his district from that , he gets his power from making sure the system distributes enough to the people that he wants it distributed to . "
Figures from the US watchdog organisation Taxpayers for Common Sense , which analyses government spending , suggest Mr Murtha secured the highest value of earmarks of any congressman from next year 's defence bill - $ 150 m .
This watchdog calculates he sent $ 2bn of federal cash to his district in this way over the years .
Another non-profit watchdog group , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , also questions this arrangement 's probity .
Crew 's Melanie Sloan , a former assistant district attorney , said : " Mr Murtha brings tons of money into his campaigns all from defence manufacturers whom he earmarks for .
So it 's quite a quid pro quo relationship going on there which is very questionable although not illegal because this is the way the system works . "
Arcane process
Mr Murtha would not be interviewed for Global Account but in a statement said he had been elected to congress 18 times because he understood the needs and concerns of his constituents and was effective at creating working partnerships between community leaders , businesses and the residents of the region .
We ought to go back to competition for the work to be done
Congressman Henry Waxman
But Congressman Henry Waxman believes it is time to rein in the long established but arcane political process of earmarking .
" There is no competition .
In reality appropriators are naming the project .
Sometimes it makes sense but more often than not , I think that these earmarks are unjustified and a real problem .
" We ought to go back to competition for the work to be done . "
