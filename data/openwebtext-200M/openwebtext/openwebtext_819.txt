The decline in U.S. manufacturing deepened in December as demand for such products as cars , appliances and furniture reached the lowest level since at least 1948 , signaling further cutbacks in factory jobs and production this year .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index fell to 32.4 , below economists ’ forecasts and the lowest level since 1980 , from 36.2 the prior month .
Readings less than 50 signal contraction .
The group ’s new - orders measure reached the lowest level on record and prices slid the most since 1949 .
“ Every component suggests that the weakness is going to carry over into 2009 , ” Mark Vitner , a senior economist at Wachovia Corp. in Charlotte , North Carolina , said in a Bloomberg Television interview .
“ There ’s just not a whole lot of new business coming in , ” and companies will have a “ painful adjustment ” as consumers shun spending .
Today ’s figures underscore that , with private demand collapsing , manufacturers ’ best hope for new business this year may be President - elect Barack Obama ’s plans for an unprecedented stimulus package .
Obama has pledged an investment program in roads , schools and the U.S. energy network akin to the 1950s - era interstate highway construction boom .

Statistics show that most users on Facebook pay absolutely no attention to the advertisements that are on the site .
People who have advertised on the site have reported that the click - through rates they are seeing are a fraction of one percent , much lower than just about anywhere else on the web .
Apparently Facebook is n’t paying terribly close attention to the advertisements that they are allowing on their site either .
If you happen to take a glance over at the Facebook ads , you ’ll find that they are promoting a number of “ get rich quick ” schemes which are almost certainly fraudulent .
One advertisement , for a website called get - money - online.com tells users that they can “ make $ 1000 daily . ”
The ad has a picture of a scantily clad woman holding several one - hundred dollar bills .
It also has a tag line of “ And learn to impress the ladies !
Learn to get RICH now ! ” .
Well , I do n’t know about you , but , I ’m sold !
If you click through the ad , you ’ll see a pitch for a “ Google Money Kit ” and a check for $ 5,300 from Google ’s AdSense service .
Interestingly enough , the ad is clever enough to figure out your geographic location and pretend to be from your area .
By browsing to the ad , it tells the story of a “ Ken Peters ” from “ Sioux Falls , SD ” ( my home city ) .
However , when visiting it from a proxy - service , he ’s suddenly from “ Crownsville , MD ” ( the location of the proxy server .
I guess they figure that people will be more likely to believe the story if it ’s about someone in their home town .
Another ad with the title of “ Make $ 75 / hour part - time ” and a tag of “ Read and learn about how people like you make $ 50 - 90 / hr online .
Start making money today , ” links to a very similar looking website with a similar story .
The picture of the check is of a slightly different size and tells the story of a man named “ Dante Miller . ”
Interestingly enough “ Dante Miller ” and “ Ken Peters ” have the exact - same story , word for word about how they “ got rich with Google . ” J
Facebook does offer a chance for users to “ report ” ads that are misleading , offensive or pornographic .
It seems that either Facebook is n’t paying attention to those user reports or that users are simply not submitting them to begin with , since approximately 50 % of the ads are for misleading or very - spammy products and services that no one would seek out on their own .
It appears that even the Washington Post has taken notice .
GUIDs as Primary Keys or How to Walk Into an Argument
I generally work on two kinds of projects : the big enterprise web application and the tiny startup web application .
The requirements and processes for building these two projects are distinct .
For example , the database in a big project could easily be Oracle or DB2 while a tiny or mid-size project may run on MySQL or SQL Server .
Other differences include hardware and staffing resources .
Before we get too far , I should make a note about the above databases .
I personally have yet to encounter a project that cannot be implemented using MySQL .
I have built analytical web applications running hundreds of millions of rows in a single table and it worked and performed well .
There are limitations in tuning but generally I have found some level of snobbery with the DBA ’s thinking that MySQL is just a toy DB .
A word of caution to them is that Toyota was once seen as a mediocre , unreliable , rusty piece of junk and now it is considered one of the most reliable and financially stable auto makers in the world .
Things really do change over time .
Back to the main subject .
Big projects often have larger budgets , more resources , more requirements and often have a longer development cycle .
That longer development cycle may include more time to understand the data model and the production environment and thus produce a executable design .
Small projects often have a small budget , fewer resources and may have much less planning .
These projects may also be cash flow constrained , meaning that you want to spend as little per month as possible while still delivering a service that customers will buy .
Databases and primary keys come into play when you are working with a small project that may become big and outgrow its hosting needs .
Moving a physical server is relatively easy provided that you can schedule some downtime .
You may end up having to replicate the database on a new server and bring up the new server at the new hosting site .
There will almost certainly be some data reconciliation process after the transition form the old server to the new .
A bigger problem occurs when you are really small and trying to go from one web provider to another .
You may have a Virtual Private Server ( VPS ) at one hosting provider and have to migrate to a dedicated server with a new provider .
This migration process is more difficult and requires more downtime .
Its more difficult in that replication is not an option .
Some will argue that database replication is tricky unto itself .
However , to me there are only a few things more painful than exporting a database and then importing it somewhere else .
The easiest migrations used a GUID as the row ID .
This is especially true when I ’ve had to merge two or more active databases .
I was planning on writing extensively about the virtues of using a GUID as a primary key and then I read the following posts :

Jeff Atwood ’s post is particularly interesting because of the huge number of comments and most of them are against the use of a GUID as a primary key .
The most common reason against GUIDs has to do with large tables in that search performance degrades more rapidly than autoincrement or sequence integer IDs .
Some of the other posts argue that the degredation is not significant enough to warrant concern .
Others argue that the primary key should be an integer but the end user should see a GUID as that makes it easier to obscure the layout of the database .
I ’m not sure I buy that argument since it should still be pretty easy to find a given row using that GUID .
I think this developer was really trying to create a level of abstraction from what a user may bookmark from something that code could efficiently work with .
The strategy would allow the developer to change his primary key without impacting the user .
However , it would seem reasonable to ask how much benefit there really is to having both keys when the GUID alone is enough to do all the work ?
My thought on this is that the GUID is slow to look up , but once it is loaded you have the object ’s real ID and hopefully it will load faster in follow - on queries using that numeric ID .
A smart developer may also ask why someone would be loading a record once by GUID and then reloading repeatedly by numeric ID .
Should n’t the original load be enough for most applications ?
Many of the posts have a shared viewpoint that GUIDs do not significantly impact performance on small tables but fail to say how many rows makes a table small .
They often agree that DB merges are easier using GUIDs .
My personal viewpoint is that I have not measured a significant enough performance impact to dissuade me from using GUIDs in a project that I know will be migrated to a new hosting provider .
I think it is fair to use autoincrement integers or sequences when you know your database will never have to be merged or migrated and on tables with more than 10 million rows though the quality of the server may increase the number of rows .
This opinion takes us to the second part of the time :
How to walk into an argument .
Computer science , like all of science , allows developers the freedom to form an opinion and later a hypothesis about how something should work or be done .
We have opinions on nearly every subject and some of them are polarizing .
A GUID as a primary key is one of those polarizing subjects .
I have witnessed an explosive argument between developers arguing for and against GUIDs and both of them citing anecdotal evidence only that there is a performance issue .
I have personally been involved in a discussion where the other person dismissed the very idea of GUIDs without further discussion .
That same project had a significant delay as a result of a data migration problem that would have been entirely avoided had we used GUIDs .
As I said , I was planning to write more extensively on the virtues of GUIDs and then I read the other articles and realized that this is not a back - and - white solution .
It is a solution that is ideal in only some situations , just like a hammer is only really useful when driving a nail or banging something into a new shape .
It became clear that this subject is highly contested and would become a serious argument .
Walking into a huge discussion or argument over design principles is amazingly easy .
One of the hardest things to overcome is that generalizations are often very dangerous without empirical data to back it .
Only by taking risks and testing the approach , using real data , can one rule out the use of a particular construct or strategy within a web application .
Thus many seemingly unorthodox approaches may actually be valid within the conditions of the application .
My conclusion is simply that GUIDs as a row ID may be perfectly reasonable for your application .
It may cause some performance degradation , but the degradation may be insignificant .
The only way to know is to test it and compare the performance of the key to a more common numeric key and then balance that against the requirements of your application .
The only thing we should not do is dismiss the approach without first confirming that the conceivable issue is a real issue .
Neil Young has gone on the record in support of music powerhouse Warner Bros .
Reprise 's policy deleting and muting its artists ' videos on YouTube , after negotiations between Google and Warner broke down .
The legendary singer , guitarist and songwriter says consistent standards need to be hammered out to compensate artists and other copyright holders fairly when their music appears on YouTube .
The problem , he says , is that Warner was open to a fault in its embrace of YouTube , so it signed an early deal worth less than the ones Google offered other music companies .
" You Tube was in its fledgling stages when Warner made an early deal to work with them , " wrote Young .
" Today , other labels have made more lucrative deals for their artists at YouTube . "
__
__
Update ( 3/3/09 ) : Google / YouTube spokesman Chris Dale responded to this post with the claim that labels are responsible for negotiating deals to compensate their artists .
" You Tube connects music , musicians , and fans , " he wrote .
" We have deals with all of the other major record labels and with musicians , songwriters , and other independent creative producers .
It is the record labels ' responsibility to represent and pay their artists . "
Much of Young 's music was removed from the site along with that of countless other artists after the negotiations broke down .
According to Young , the underlying reason for this is that no strong industry standard exists for paying artists and copyright holders exists for online videos .
Everything has to be renegotiated each time , and when these negotiations fail , it hurts fans and artists in addition to the companies doing the negotiating .
The removal of audio tracks affects not only the official videos , but mash - ups and user - generated videos that use the tracks , for which YouTube compensates copyright holders .
When the tracks disappear , people stop creating these derivative works , which deprives artists and copyright holders of the addition plays and blog embeds that make a video grow in popularity .
" YouTube has a responsibility to respect the artists it facilitates and resist punishing them to make a business point , " wrote Young .
" It is time for industry - wide standards of artist compensation on the web . "

Mixed martial arts legend Ken Shamrock tested positive for three illegal anabolic steroids -- Norandrosterone , Noretiocholanolone and Stanozolol -- after his first round armbar submission win over Ross Clifton at War Gods : " Valentine 's Eve Massacre , " which took place at Selland Arena in Fresno , Calif. , on Feb. 13 , according to the California State Athletic Commission .
Shamrock has been suspended and fined $ 2,500 for the transgression .
He has the right to appeal the finding in the future .
If the positive test is upheld it will more than likely erase the first win in four years for " The World ’s Most Dangerous Man . "
In addition , it will throw a wrench into his upcoming fight against former WWE superstar turned MMA fighter , Bobby Lashley , in the Roy Jones Jr.- promoted hybrid MMA and boxing event from the Pensacola Civic Center in Pensacola , Fla. , on March 21 .
In fact , it could be another big money match down the tubes for the Lion 's Den founder .
That 's because Shamrock was supposed to collide with Internet street fighting sensation Kimbo Slice at Elite XC : " Heat " in October 2008 .
However , Shamrock pulled out of that scheduled match with Slice on fight night because of a cut sustained in warm - ups and has since been accused by younger brother Frank of cutting himself to get out of the fight .
Lashley is an absolute monster , boasting a a rare blend of size , freakish athleticism and blazing quickness .
He ’s going to be a handful for anybody in a fight , let alone a 45 - year - old man who ’s lost eight of his last 11 contests and has n’t beaten a decent heavyweight since submitting Bas Rutten nearly 14 years ago .
Perhaps this is a blessing disguise after all .
乳酸菌で快腸美人を目指そう！
乳酸菌は便秘解消をはじめ、美容や健康、ダイエットサポートにも有効な成分。
スッキリ爽快な明日の為に乳酸菌のパワーを活用しましょう。
「 最近少し便秘がち・・・ 」 「 肌が荒れたり年齢を感じることが多い・・・ 」 そんな悩みは腸内環境悪化のサインの可能性大。
腸内環境が荒れているということは「善玉菌の減少」
「悪玉菌の増殖」を意味します。 私たちの腸内では常に善玉菌と悪玉菌が勢力争いをしていて、どちらが優勢かによって腸内環境が決まるのですが、悪玉菌はストレスや生活習慣の乱れ、便秘など様々な原因から増えてしまいます。
そうなると、健康状態に問題が生じて、日常生活にも様々なトラブルが出てきてしまうでしょう。
そんなことにならない為にも、身体の中で私たちの健康を支えている「善玉菌」、
その中でも特に重要な役割を果たしている乳酸菌を活用しましょう。
生まれたときは99％、60歳で1 ％ これは腸内におけるビフィズス菌（乳酸菌の一種）の割合を指しています。
生まれたばかりの赤ちゃんの腸内は99％がビフィズス菌で占められていますが、60歳になるまでにその数は減り続けて最終的には1％になってしまうのです。
特に対策を講じない場合、知らない内に腸内環境は悪くなっていってしまいます。
ビフィズス菌をはじめとする善玉菌が体内に少ない状態では、いくら美容の為に高価な化粧品を使っても、健康の為に健康食品などを摂っても効果が実感できないまま無駄になってしまいます。
毎日の快便を習慣にすることは、美容・健康・アンチエイジングなどの全ての基本になります。
その為には、乳酸菌を上手に補うことが非常に大切です。
乳酸菌の働き・効果を知る！ Effect
人間の身体（腸内）には大きくわけて三種類の細菌が棲んでいます。
一つは私たち人間の身体を健康にしてくれる「善玉菌 」 逆に有害な働きをしてしまう「悪玉菌 」 そして、どちらにも属さずに日和見的にうごく「日和見菌 」
これらの腸内でのバランスが私たちの健康状態を大きく左右しています。
そして、乳酸菌は善玉菌の代表選手。 消化・吸収をサポートして、便秘や下痢などの排便トラブルを予防してくれるのが主な効果として有名です。
しかし、実はそれ以外にも様々な働きがあります。
具体的には、これらの効能が挙げられます。
・免疫力を高める（アレルギー・花粉症・アトピー・鼻炎などの対策にも）
・コレステロールの抑制効果（生活習慣病対策に）
・病原菌・発がん性物質の誘因となる悪玉菌を抑える
副作用がないという安全性の高さもメリットですね。
詳細をチェックしたい場合は、当サイトの「効果・効能別に選ぶオススメサプリ」コラムを参考にして下さい。
乳酸菌は減りやすい ！
実は乳酸菌をはじめとする善玉菌は加齢やストレス、タンパク質や脂質などの過剰摂取などによって、非常に減りやすいという特徴があります。
だからこそ、現在特にお腹の不調などに悩まされていなくても積極的に摂取することをオススメします。
もちろん、便秘などに悩まされている場合や美肌を目指す場合は必ず摂っておきたいですね。
とは言っても、最近では乳酸菌サプリはどんどん登場していて、選ぶのも難しくなっています。
そこで、このサイトでは乳酸菌サプリを選ぶ際に役立つコラムを多数用意しました！
下記のコンテンツを参考にしながら、自分にフィットする相性の良い乳酸菌を選びましょう！
筆者が使った感想はこちら！
選び方メニューはこちら！
自分で選ぶのは大変だから、ずばりオススメが知りたい！
という人は、是非こちらを参考にしてみてください。
いきなりですが、腸の健康度をチェックしましょう！
質問に答えて腸内環境をチェックしてみましょう。
あなたは下記の内、何個の項目に当てはまるでしょうか？
１□睡眠時間が不規則で寝不足気味 ２□便・おなら・口臭などの「ニオイ」が気になる ３□慢性的に疲労が溜まりがち ４□運動不足になりがち ５□肩こり・頭痛・冷え性などに悩まされている
６□ファーストフード、スナック菓子が好き ７□便秘気味（便の状態が悪い） ８□口内炎やニキビができやすい ９□野菜よりも肉を沢山食べている 10□乳製品や発酵食品はあまり食べない
０~２個当てはまる 腸の状態は非常に健康的と言えるでしょう。
ただし、２と７が該当している場合は注意が必要です。
乳酸菌サプリを飲んで対策を講じましょう。
３~６個当てはまる 腸が少し弱くなっているかも知れません。
できるだけ早期に生活習慣を改善する必要があるでしょう。
乳酸菌も忘れずに活用したいところ。
７個以上当てはまる 腸の状態は非常に衰えていると言えるでしょう。
生活習慣の見直しと乳酸菌の摂取は必須です。 積極的な対策が必要と言えます。
たくさん摂取しても効果がない場合・・・
POINT ： 《 自分にフィットした乳酸菌を選ぶ 》 《 腸までしっかり届くものを選ぶ 》
しかし、いくら量を沢山摂っても効果を実感できない場合があります。
これは乳酸菌の弱点が大きく関係しているかもしれません。
乳酸菌の弱点はズバリ「熱と酸」です。 せっかく摂取した乳酸菌も何も対策をしないと殆どが体温や胃酸によって腸まで辿りつかずに死滅してしまいます。
そして、腸まで辿りついたとしても、その人の身体にフィットしていない場合は短時間で身体の外に追い出されてしまうのです。
もし、ヨーグルトやサプリメントなどを続けても効果が実感できなかったとしたら、
それは乳酸菌が腸内で働いていなかった証拠とも言えるでしょう。 次は「腸内でしっかり働く乳酸菌サプリ」を選びましょう。
その為には、沢山の量を摂るだけでなく、 《 自分にフィットした乳酸菌を選ぶ 》 《 腸までしっかり届くものを選ぶ 》 という二点も大切になります。 これらの弱点を克服しているサプリメントとしては「生命の乳酸菌」が挙げられます。
Judge Janet Half of the US District Court for the District of Connecticut made history on March 31 when she sentenced Ovidiu - Ionut Nicola - Roman , a 23 - year - old native of Romania to 50 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release .
This is the first time a foreign national has been tried and convicted as a phisher in the United States , which may be why Judge Half chose the sentence that she did .
The intended message is quite clear — if we catch you at this , you 're going to pay for it .
We were n't able to confirm that Ovidiu - Ionut 's guilty plea and sentencing came out of the international , trans - Atlantic phishing bust we covered almost a year ago — sections of the PACER database were offline as of this writing — but the dates roughly match up .
That takedown was the result of a joint FBI / Romanian endeavor ; the phishers were charged under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ( RICO ) .
The group 's normal business operations and the actual phishing process were handled by the Romanian side of the business while the Americans were responsible for encoding and verifying the stolen credit card / debit card data .
The Register reports that this same group was also responsible for an October 2006 attack against the Brattleboro Savings & Loan Association .
In that attack , the phishers sent out an e-mail advising Brattleboro S&L members that the bank 's website was unavailable while service upgrades were being performed .
Users were ordered to confirm their e-mail addresses under penalty of account deletion .
In a nifty twist , the phishers than launched an actual DDoS attack against the bank to make the " service upgrades " appeared legitimate .
Nicola - Roman was captured in Bulgaria on an Interpol warrant and extradited to the US sometime later .
Romania 's decision to cooperate with US law enforcement on cracking down on phishers as well as allowing one or more of their nationals to be tried here speaks to the spirit of international cooperation that 's needed at all levels if we , the Internet - using public , ever want to see a reduction in the sheer amount of malicious and illegal sewage flowing across the system .
NUCLEAR LOAN GUARANTEES ….
We talked a few weeks ago about nuclear power , and the piece from Washington Monthly editor Mariah Blake about why it ’s a bad idea to go back down this road .
Blake wrote a post with relevant follow - up information , and the Center for American Progress noted the end result from the stimulus package .
Thankfully , the final bill excludes the Senate ’s $ 500 million allocation that would have provided up to $ 50 billion in loan guarantees for “ low emission ” electricity , predominately aimed at nuclear power .
With a 50 - percent default rate , these nuclear loans could have made taxpayers responsible for at least $ 25 billion in risky loans .
This program would have created very few jobs because it takes a long time to finance and build a nuclear power plant .
Good move .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) --
It was described as one of the most grisly scenes Los Angeles police had ever encountered : the bodies of five young children and their parents , all shot to death , in two upstairs rooms of the family 's home .
A photo on Ervin Lupoe 's Facebook page shows his wife and five children .
" The reaction on their faces was not a pretty sight , " neighbor Jasmine Gomez told CNN .
" There was an officer who came out of the house throwing up . "
But even more incomprehensible to some was the story that emerged after the bodies were found Tuesday : A father who , in a last desperate act after he and his wife were fired from their jobs , killed all six family members before turning the gun on himself .
In a letter faxed to Los Angeles television station KABC before his suicide , Ervin Antonio Lupoe blamed his former employer for the deaths , detailing his grievance against Kaiser Permanente 's West Los Angeles Medical Center , where he and his wife , Ana , had worked as technicians .
Lupoe , 40 , claimed the couple was being investigated for " misrepresentation of our employment to an outside agency for the benefit to ourselves 's ( sic ) , childcare . "
He said the initial interview was held on December 19 , and when he reported for work on December 23 , " I was told by my administrator ... that ' You should not even have bothered to come to work today .
You should have blown your brains out . ' "
" Oh lord , my God , " the letter concludes .
" Is there no hope for a widow 's son ? "
Kaiser Permanente said in a statement Tuesday night that although the company is " saddened by the despair in Mr. Lupoe 's letter faxed to the media ... we are confident that no one told him to take his own life or the lives of his family . "
Watch how the note brought police to the home »
The company followed its initial statement with another , saying the couple was fired for forging the signatures of supervisors and misrepresenting their income on documents they gave to agencies that provide help with child care .
" They were terminated for good cause ... , " the statement said .
" Throughout that process , the Lupoes were treated with dignity and respect . "
Lupoe wrote in the fax , " after a horrendous ordeal my wife felt it better to end our lives and why leave our children in someone else 's hands ... we have no job and 5 children under 8 years with no place to go .
So here we are . "
Ana Elizabeth Lupoe was 38 , according to the Los Angeles County coroner 's office .
The children were identified as 8 - year - old Brittney Nicole ; 5 - year - old twins Jaszmin Lissette and Jassely Lisbeth ; and 2 - year - old twins Christian De Shawn and Benjamin Ryan .
Lupoe and the girls were found in what appeared to be an upstairs bonus room , police said Wednesday .
Ana Lupoe and the boys were found in the master bedroom .
Police think Lupoe also called KABC and threatened suicide , prompting the station to notify police .
About the same time that KABC contacted police , Lupoe called 911 and reported returning home and finding his family dead .
Among those struggling to comprehend the news were Lupoe 's relatives .
His 83 - year - old grandmother , Josephine Lupoe of Atlanta , Georgia , sobbed as she told CNN , " I just ca n't believe it . "
She said Lupoe was born in Atlanta but moved to Detroit , Michigan , with his parents as a child before moving to California .
She recalled visiting the family when they lived in San Jose , California , " but that was years ago , " she said .
" I had n't been to visit them since he got married and moved . "
She said she last heard from him when he called her to say they were having a second set of twins .
" Every time I called , he was at work , " she said .
" He worked a lot , and even when I talked with him , he would be at work . "
But she said she had no indication of problems within the family .
She said she had spoken with Lupoe 's mother a couple of days ago , and they discussed his sending pictures of the boys .
" And then I hear this , " she said tearfully .
Lupoe 's mother was on the way to California on Wednesday , she said , but Josephine Lupoe said she is unable to travel .
Lupoe 's co-workers told the Times they remembered the Lupoes as cheerful , good workers and caring parents .
Ana Lupoe was " always talking about the kids , " said co-worker Hamlet Narvaez .
On Ervin Lupoe 's Facebook page , which displayed pictures of the family , he described himself as a graduate of the University of Southern California .
The page could not be found Wednesday .
In a written statement , Facebook spokeswoman Rebecca Hahn told CNN , " When it comes to our attention that a user has passed away , we put the profile in a memorial state .
In the memorial state , certain profile sections and features are hidden from view to protect the privacy of the departed .
We encourage users to utilize groups and group discussions to mourn and remember the deceased . "
Cherise Pounders - Caver , principal of the children 's school , Crescent Heights Elementary , said Lupoe showed up to check the three older children out of school about two weeks ago and told her the family was moving to Kansas , the Times reported .
Police said Wednesday that school administrators were notified several weeks before the deaths that the children would no longer be attending .
The deaths sent shock waves across the city and beyond .

" No matter how desperate you are , no matter how frustrated you are , to think this was the only answer -- to take your whole family with you in death -- is just too much to understand , " said Councilwoman Janice Hahn , who represents the city 's Wilmington neighborhood , where the slayings took place .
She and other city officials urged those who may be despondent to seek help from available resources .
" It 's sad that this happens anywhere , you know ? " neighbor Jose Rodriguez told KABC .
" You see it on the news , but you never really become accustomed to it .
" I have kids , too , and grandkids , " he said .
" It hits home . "
CNN 's Stan Wilson , Ashley Broughton and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report .

Named for the madman / religious prophet that founded the tightly - knit rim colony of “ Bohan ” along the only narrow and airless strip of barely habitable land available on the surface , Elos Thu ’Ban is a tidelocked world ( one side bakes , the other side freezes ) .
The few colonists who follow Thu ’Ban and who have chosen to settle in the nearly inhospitable moderate belt between the more extreme sides , make up the body of a very secretive and reclusive religious sect that keeps to itself and maintains an almost aggressive stance against letting visitors anywhere near the planetoid .
A cloud of relatively stable rock and a few errant chunks of cometary ice that have been snared by the pull of the little planetoid keep an additional sense of mystery and privacy that tends to scare off most of the colony ’s would - be visitors before they even get within visual range .
It ’s not the kind of rock you ’d find on any map , and those who dare to enter the rock field on an approach vector to Elos Thu ’Ban are sternly urged at range to turn away before the colony ’s array of interorbital cannons comes online .
The rim colony of Bohan is enormous– at close to 12,000 KM in length , it rings the entire planetoid as a single contiguous city uniformly 2.8 kilometers in width .
Great walls of blasted metaceramics hundreds of feet in height contain the sprawl on either side for the entire length , and more than half of the visible towers and spires that peek over the edge are studded with vicious turret - mounted cannons .
Power is partly solar , partly void mechanics , but mostly geothermal , as the core of the rock is still active , if only barely so .
On the whole , the followers of Thu’Ban have worked hard to make their operation entirely self sufficient , so supply transports visiting in - system are few and almost exclusively staffed by cult members .
Little is known about the populace due to their isolation , but estimates place the population of Bohan at just over 200,000 .
In the rare circumstances when they export materials , they trade primarily in gold , opal , and other precious metals and stones , and almost always send a ship out of the field to make the exchange instead of letting any outsiders in .

Fathers appear to be playing a bigger role in their daughters ’ career choices compared to men of previous generations .
Researchers from the University of Maryland used various data sets to study the career paths of 63,000 women born between 1909 and 1977 .
Given that more women today are entering predominantly male occupations in higher numbers compared to women of previous generations , the researchers said it has been difficult to distinguish between general societal changes and family factors that may be influencing a woman ’s career choices .
The question is whether fathers are passing on what the researchers called “ job specific human capital ” to their daughters .
The notion that fathers pass on job skills and work interests to their sons has been long established , but the trend has n’t been pronounced in girls , in part because women are relatively recent participants in the workforce .
To distinguish between social trends and the additional influence a father might have , the researchers first compared the percentage of women who worked in the same field as their fathers - in - law .
A father - in - law provides a useful comparison because he represents male generational influences of the time , but does n’t exert any parenting influence over the woman , the researchers said .
Then the researchers evaluated the number of women who went into their fathers ’ line of work .
In comparing women who worked in the same field as their fathers - in - law with those who followed in their fathers ’ footsteps , the researchers found a surprising difference .
About 6 percent of women born in the first decade of the study worked in the same field as their fathers .
But about 18 percent of women born in the last decade of the study followed their fathers ’ footsteps .
Although much of the increase is attributed to social influences , the study showed that about 20 percent of the difference is attributed to a father ’s influence .
By comparison , the percentage of men who followed in their fathers ’ career paths remained relatively unchanged at about 30 percent during the study period .
The study was n’t designed to explore the reasons behind the change .
However , it may be that today ’s fathers are spending more time with their daughters and passing on more skills and values related to their careers , said Judith K. Hellerstein , associate professor of economics at the University of Maryland .
Another factor may be that daughters also are paying more attention to the fathers .
Dr. Hellerstein notes that her own father ’s job as a math professor influenced her career path .
“ I watched my father grade math papers at night , ’’ she said .
“ And my father made it clear to us that women could do math , which was important . ’’
The study is under review by an economics journal and is part of a University of Maryland dissertation project by Melinda Sandler Morrill , who is now an assistant economics professor at North Carolina State University .
The authors noted that most of the women in the data set were married , since the study compared the effects of fathers - in - law as well as fathers on career choice , but that they do n’t believe excluding single women had a major effect on the findings .

1 . The United States military specifically states that gays are not allowed to serve openly in uniform and they will be discharged if they are outed .
That pretty much says " No gays allowed .
" 2 . Many private schools , including those not affiliated with a religion , refuse to hire gay teachers because they believe that children are n't safe around us , perpetuating the stereotype that all gay people are pedophiles .
( Note : most of the teachers arrested for inappropriate contact with students are straight . )
The same goes for some nationally - recognized summer camps .
3 .
In 1993 my partner and I tried to book a vacation at a couples - only resort in the tropics .
We contacted the resort 's booking office and were told that they only allowed straight couples at their facilities , including those located in the United States .
If we really wanted to come , we could book separately and stay in separate rooms and be charged the full rate per person instead of the double - occupancy rate given to couples .
By the way , straight couples at these resorts did n't have to prove that they were married to each other .
4 .
The state of Florida specifically bans gays and lesbians from adopting children .
Perhaps you missed the recent court cases that are fighting -- and winning -- for the right to do so , but the state is promising to appeal the ruling .
That right there is a clear - cut case of denying equal protection .
And of course there 's Amendment 2 that passed in November .
Again , a denial of equal protection in that while straight people can marry the person of their choosing , gay people cannot based solely on their sexual orientation .
Same - sex couples are not entitled to the same inheritance or hospital visitation rights that straight couples have , nor are they allowed to receive the Social Security benefits that a widowed mate would be entitled to .
That is not equal protection .
5 . In 1988 I had to explain to my skeptical landlord in Longmont , Colorado , that my partner and I would be sleeping in separate bedrooms before he took my deposit check .
Fair housing laws in many states and municipalities cover discrimination against tenants or homeowners based on race , color , creed , or national origin , but they are still allowed to refuse to rent to gay couples , and a lot of landlords refuse to do so based on their so - called " Judeo / Christian " values .
Mr. Harrison , it 's not so much the fact that you 're ignorant of the facts right in front of your nose and the discrimination that your fellow citizens face every day .
It 's the fact that you try to hide your bigotry behind the excuse that " America was founded on Judeo / Christian values , which do not include gay marriage . "
( That sounds noble , but as Robert Wuhl noted , America was actually founded by a bunch of rich white landowners who did n't want to pay taxes . )
One of the principle Judeo / Christian values is " do unto others as you would have them do unto you . "
So either I get to decide whether or not the marriage of a man and a woman is subject to a vote , or I am entitled tothe rights and responsibilities of citizenship that everyone else is entitled to .
Rights , after all , are binary ; you either have them or you do n't , and if you are going to deny one group of people a right based solely on an innate quality such as race , gender , or sexual orientation , you might as well deny them all .
Fortunately for you , I believe that all people , regardless of who they are or who they love , are entitled to all the rights under the law .
So , Mr. Harrison , I say with all sincerity , own up to your bigotry .
Stop hiding behind the curtain of religious dogma and come right out and say it : you do n't like gay people .
You 've already taken the first step by writing your letter to the editor .
Your next step is to tell me or any other member of the LGBT community to our face exactly what it is that we have done to you to make you hate us so much that you would deny us the same rights you apparently take so much for granted .
“ So many corrupt bankers , so few lethal - injection tables . ”
How many times have you heard that lately ?
Yes , it ’s a common complaint in America today .
In these difficult economic times , we have a lot of justice to mete out to the people who have destroyed our lives .
But we do n’t have much money to do it , and we do n’t want to contribute to global warming either .
How to solve all three problems ?
How can we possibly put to death all of the bankers and their minions without hurting your wallets or GAIA ’s delicate balance ?
The answer is “ Made in China ” : a fleet of new mobile execution vans that can make America ’s looming Mass Arrests efficient , clean , and cheap .
Let ’s face it : why should we taxpayers pay to keep these criminals alive in leisurely prisons with TV sets and “ prisoners ’ rights ” and endless costly court appeals ?
What about our rights , huh ?
What about us , the victims ?
It seems like the so - called justice system is more about the criminal ’s rights than the victim’s !
We want the bankers and their promoters tried , sentenced , and put to death in as speedy , clean and cost - effective a manner as possible .
And now , after years of these same plutocrats shipping American jobs to China , we can finally say that a “ Made In China ” death chamber that puts one banker to death while driving at top speed to the next banker ’s office is something worth buying .
It ’s cheap , reliable , and it ’s funny as fuck .
That ’s right , the Chinese are finally paying us back for all the manufacturing jobs we sent their way by offering us the perfect mobile murder machine for these difficult New Great Depression times .
The mobile execution chamber is called the “ Jinguan Automobile , ” and it ’s produced in Jiangsu and Shandong provinces .
It comes at the very reasonable price tag of between $ 37,000 - $ 75,000 , which is nothing when you think about how much we ’d save in legal expenses from all the appeals , as well as feeding and clothing these mass - murderers in their leisurely prisons .
Put it another way : if you just took back the $ 3.6 billion in taxpayer bailout money stolen by the Merrill Lynch bankers last December when they illegally paid themselves giant bonuses just as the company went under , you could use their bonus money to buy 100,000 execution - buses .
They wo n’t disclose who got the payouts ?
No problem : once they hear the Death Bus pulling up , you betcha those bankers will squeal and turn each other in at the drop of a hat .
Too late though : you ’re all still gonna suck on some vein - poison .
Efficiency is the name of the game here : 100,000 of these buses could put to death so many bankers , and their paid think - tankers , journalists , academics , and politicians , that within a few months , America would be a much safer , cleaner , and cheaper place to live in .
Definitely cheaper , which is good enough for us .
But wait , that ’s not all : not only is it cheap , fast and efficient , but it ’s green !
Yes , the executed bankers ’ bodies can be recycled and put to use by more responsible citizens .
As the Chinese have quickly discovered , the bankers ’ organs , eyeballs and extremities can be quickly harvested , stored , and redistributed to distressed American homeowners who lack health insurance .
Every part of the executed bankers and think tank propagandists can be recycled into the ecosystem , saving taxpayers ’ money , lives , and helping a spotted owl or two .
Hey , as our friend Zach Wamp would say , those organs are n’t a right , they ’re a privilege .
Here ’s how one authoritative figure explained the eco-friendly murder machines :
Injections leave the whole body intact and require participation of doctors .
Organs can “ be extracted in a speedier and more effective way than if the prisoner is shot , ” says Mark Allison , East Asia researcher at Amnesty International in Hong Kong .
“ We have gathered strong evidence suggesting the involvement of ( Chinese ) police , courts and hospitals in the organ trade . ”
Hey Amnesty , thanks for the tip !
You see folks , those weepy liberal elitists are n’t always defending criminals against the innocent .
They ’re giving us valuable information that we can use !
Chinese tycoon Yuan Baojing was recently put to death in an Execution Van .
Are Americans too beaten down and afraid of their elite to mete out Chinese justice ?
So , here ’s how they work : each mobile execution chamber vehicle is 20 to 26 feet in length and can travel at speeds of up to 80 mph , meaning these mobile murder machines execute criminals in the fast lane !
The buses are divided into three sections : driver section ; observation section in the middle , with a window dividing the observers ( up to 6 ) from the execution chamber ; and the execution chamber in the back , with blackened windows ( we may want to make them transparent , in the interests of transparency ) blocking out the view of the lethal injection table and seats for the doctor and guards , along with a sterilizer for injection equipment and a wash basin .
( We may want to skip the sterilizer to cut costs too ; what ’s the worry , that the corpse might get an infection ? )
Not since the old Model T Ford rolled off the line has there been such a true “ People ’s Car , ” so perfectly tailored to the times .
In fact , the Morgan Stanley bankers who are using their taxpayer dollars to bankrupt Ford for a quick derivative profit would be perfect “ recylced banker volunteers ” in a launch campaign to show America how justice is served .
Just imagine the possibilities : using only the funds that Merrill Lynch ’s bankers stole from us , we can put 100,000 execution buses on the streets of America .
That ’s one mobile execution chamber for every 3,000 Americans , which should just about about cover it .
We can hire a marketing firm to brand the execution buses with names that will better reflect their service to the community .
“ Banker Recyclers ” or “ TARP Collection Cabs ” or even “ Voluntary Contribution Vans . ”
Drivers of the buses can even brand their own individual execution vans .
Name them after poster - villains of the New Great Depression : Look , Bobby the Bus Driver ’s calling his the “ Madoff Mobile ” !
And Juanita the Bus Lady named hers the “ Betsy Buggy ” after Betsy McCaughey .
Beep !
Beep !
Move Over Herbie !
It ’s America ’s favorite TARP - Collection Cab , the “ Betsy Buggy , ” a - chuggin ’ and a - churnin ’ justice , saving taxpayers valuable dollars , a - harvestin ’ bankers ’ eyeballs , and dishin ’ out a li’l chitty - chitty and a lotta bang - bang !
Yes , my fellow Americans , we can imagine this beautiful future : 100,000 Banker Recycling Vans , powered by green hybrid electric engines , slowly patrolling this great nation ’s downtown financial districts from Manhattan and Boston to Chicago and San Francisco … blowing their “ execution ” horns as they pass huddling , cowering bankers , who flash big “ America ’s well - being is more important than my obscene profits ” smiles … a “ Betsy Buggy ” quietly cruising the mansion - lined communities of West Hartford , Back Bay , Chevy Chase , and Pacific Heights , playing a happy ice cream truck jingle so as not to scare the kids as daddy - banker and mommie - foundation - head are dragged inside for an appointment with justice …
So remember , honk if you want rough justice !
And honk twice if you see a banker hiding , and we guarantee a Reclycing Vehicle will take care of the problem with a smile !

Human Behavior : A Look at the Nacirema People Part 3
A look at the Nacirema people , anthropology and history at their bizarre human behavior .
Studying the Strange People of Nacirema
In addition to the private mouth - rite , the people seek out a holy - mouth - man once or twice a year .
These practitioners have an impressive set of paraphernalia , consisting of a variety of augers , awls , probes , and prods .
The use of these objects in the exorcism of the evils of the mouth involves almost unbelievable ritual torture of the client .
The holy - mouth - man opens the client 's mouth and , using the above mentioned tools , enlarges any holes which decay may have created in the teeth .
Magical materials are put into these holes .
If there are no naturally occurring holes in the teeth , large sections of one or more teeth are gouged out so that the supernatural substance can be applied .
In the client 's view , the purpose of these ministrations is to arrest decay and to draw friends .
The extremely sacred and traditional character of the rite is evident in the fact that the natives return to the holy - mouth - men year after year , despite the fact that their teeth continue to decay .
It is to be hoped that , when a thorough study of the Nacirema is made , there will be careful inquiry into the personality structure of these people .
One has but to watch the gleam in the eye of a holy - mouth - man , as he jabs an awl into an exposed nerve , to suspect that a certain amount of sadism is involved .
If this can be established , a very interesting pattern emerges , for most of the population shows definite masochistic tendencies .
It was to these that Professor Linton referred in discussing a distinctive part of the daily body ritual which is performed only by men .
This part of the rite involves scraping and lacerating the surface of the face with a sharp instrument .
Special women 's rites are performed only 4 times during each lunar month , but what they lack in frequency is made up in barbarity .
As part of this ceremony , women bake their heads in small ovens for about an hour .
The theoretically interesting point is that what seems to be a preponderantly masochistic people have developed sadistic specialists .
The medicine men have an imposing temple , or latipsoh , in every community of any size .
The more elaborate ceremonies required to treat very sick patients can only be performed at this temple .
These ceremonies involve not only the thaumaturge but a permanent group of vestal maidens who move sedately about the temple chambers in distinctive costume and headdress .
The latipsoh ceremonies are so harsh that it is phenomenal that a fair proportion of the really sick natives who enter the temple ever recover .
Small children whose indoctrination is still incomplete have been known to resist attempts to take them to the temple because " that is where you go to die . "
Despite this fact , sick adults are not only willing but eager to undergo the protracted ritual purification , if they can afford to do so .
No matter how ill the supplicant or how grave the emergency , the guardians of many temples will not admit a client if he cannot give a rich gift to the custodian .
Even after one has gained admission and survived the ceremonies , the guardians will not permit the neophyte to leave until he makes still another gift .
Apple ( AAPL ) added hi-def movie downloads to its iTunes store yesterday .
The selection is pretty limited , but that 'll improve over time .
But at $ 19.99 , are they cheap enough to drive meaningful sales ?
In most cases , especially for big hits , they 're 17 % to 33 % cheaper than hi-def Blu-ray discs , especially at Best Buy ( BBY ) , and even at Amazon ( AMZN ) , where prices tend to be lower .
But in other cases , we 're finding Blu-ray discs cheaper on Amazon than iTunes .
" Quantum of Solace " is $ 17 on DVD , $ 20 on iTunes , and $ 26 on Blu-ray .
" Twilight " is $ 18 on DVD , $ 20 on iTunes , and $ 24 on Blu-ray .
( $ 25 on Blu-ray at Best Buy . )
" Transporter 3 " is $ 17 on DVD , $ 20 on iTunes , and $ 26 on Blu-ray .
( $ 30 on Blu-ray at Best Buy . )
" W. " is $ 18 on DVD , $ 20 on iTunes , and $ 18 on Blu-ray .
( $ 30 on Blu-ray at Best Buy . )
" Saw V " is $ 15 on DVD , $ 20 on iTunes , and $ 18 on Blu-ray .
( $ 30 on Blu-ray at Best Buy . )
" Disaster Movie " is $ 20 on DVD , $ 20 on iTunes , and $ 18 on Blu-ray .
( $ 30 on Blu-ray at Best Buy . )
In general , it looks like the instant hi-def download from iTunes is worth saving $ 10 instead of driving to Best - Buy for a Blu-ray disc .
So that could boost Apple 's sales .
( Note to studios : You really need to start pricing Blu-ray discs cheaper . )
But each has its benefits and drawbacks .
Blu -ray discs require a Blu-ray player ( still pretty expensive ) and either a trip to the store or waiting for the cheaper movie to ship from Amazon .
But to watch HD iTunes movies on a TV , you have to hook up your computer or buy an Apple TV set - top box .
Or you could watch them on a computer screen ( which is admittedly how we 're watching many more movies ) .
And hi-def iTunes downloads could face another challenge : Some Internet service providers -- most aggressively Time Warner Cable -- are experimenting with metered bandwidth and overage charges .
So that 3.37 GB hi-def download could potentially cost another $ 3.37 to download , erasing some of the savings .
Gmail users will soon notice a new tool in their settings that makes switching from Yahoo , Hotmail , and many other email services a good bit easier than tinkering with IMAP and POP importing .

Screenshot from Google Operating System .
The new import tool arrives as a partnership with the email - changing service TrueSwitch , which is normally free only for switchers to its selected ISP partners .
In Gmail , though , the switch tool can automatically handle the transfer of contacts , old mail and 30 days of mail into the future ( until your contacts get up to speed ) , and adding a label to all mail picked up from your old account .
If you or someone you know is looking to make the switch to Gmail , check the list of supported email hosts and give it a go .

Of course , if an email host is n't supported by this new - fangled import , you can always switch using IMAP or follow the official POP guide .
Tools like the previously mentioned Gmail Loader can help move things along , as well .

OFFICIAL police records are under - reporting some crimes - including assaults - with the public distrustful that the records reveal the true extent of crime in Victoria .
A scathing Ombudsman 's report also found some police were misusing procedures to boost the number of crimes declared solved .
It detailed how some offenders had unrelated offences added to their file to " clear up " more crime .
The matter of clearing crime has been referred to the Office of Police Integrity .
The report , tabled in parliament yesterday , also found :

Police have antiquated , ad hoc administrative practices for recording crime .

Chapter 2
For a derelict vampire , the best part about winter north of the Mason - Dixon is the existence of snowbirds .
People abandon perfectly nice houses for months at a time in order to avoid shoveling snow .
Finding these empty houses is n’t terribly difficult .
Paperboys usually forget to stop throwing the paper on the porch until there is a stack of four .
The tricky part is slowly driving a van through a quiet neighborhood at night , and not looking like some sort of burglar or pederast .
I find a house that suits my needs surprisingly quickly .
Perhaps my luck is about to change .
I keep driving for a half mile , until there are no streetlights and nothing around but trees .
I finish eating my store - bought liver , and cram all things useful into my new backpack .
I end up having to shove a few potatoes in my coat pockets .
Suburbs and small towns do n’t really have pedestrians .
When everybody drives everywhere , walking becomes suspicious , let alone walking on the side of a dark road a couple of hours before dawn .
If you ’re in a big city , you can wander down the middle of the street in the middle of the night , shirtless and drinking blood out of a Gatorade bottle and nobody will find it odd .
You ca n’t get away with that sort of thing in a Podunk town .
But like every restaurant will eventually have roaches , every town eventually has joggers .
Running and walking breed mistrust , but jogging just breeds a mild level of innocuous contempt .
It takes me five minutes to get back to the house .
A couple of years ago , I kept a collection of garage door openers to help me get into these places .
While that might sound like a great idea , it sucks in practice .
I ditched them when one accidentally opened a neighbor ’s door at four in the morning and their dog started barking like mad .
Nowadays , I just carry a couple of bobby pins and an old library card for this sort of thing .
Bobby pins are surprisingly good at any number of things , and library cards tend to be thinner and more flexible than credit cards when used as a shim .
The library card gets me into the snowbird ’s garage with minimal effort .
I check the light switch , and sure enough they did n’t bother shutting off the power .
Working lights might mean food in the freezer , and maybe even heat .
Easy living .
The garage is well organized , with a toolbox for every tool , a shelf for everything else , and two cars gently tucked away for the winter .
The door connecting the garage to the house is n’t even locked .
I drop my bag onto the kitchen table and take a look around .
No pets or plants that need to be watched , so I should n‘t have to worry about being spotted by any variety of sitter .
There are some frost covered boxes of foodstuffs in the freezer , and a fridge full of condiments .
The living room has a large , fluffy couch a decent television and what must be three hundred movies on VHS .
I check the thermostat in the hall ; the heat is working and set to fifty - eight degrees .
That ’ll do .
The basement is big and dark and contains another freezer with somewhat less antiquated food .
There is also a bookshelf overrun with canned goods .
Some people never got out of that Cold War bomb shelter mentality .
You know what old people have in their houses ?
Answering machines .
The only people still using answering machines are the ones who could never figure them out in the first place .
Their away message indicates that they ’ll be away for another week .
How nice of them to give us all a window of the best time to burgle their home and rifle through their belongings .
Thank you , Jack and Barb .
Best of all , Jack and Barb are the type of people who keep their keys on a conspicuous hook in a central location .
With labels .
I pocket one key labeled Barb ’s car ; it ’ll save me the trouble of hotwiring that thing .
Another tag catches my eye : lock box .
It takes me three and a half minutes to find the lock box in the back of the snowbirds ’ bedroom closet .
For the most part , the box contains dental records , medical records , useless certificates , and various bits of superfluous paperwork trailing back to 1978 .
But I also find a slip of paper containing the words “ Safe Combination ” and a set of directions on how to open said safe .
( Spin it three times to start . )
I love old people .
I waste six minutes looking for their safe behind pictures and in various closets .
Jack and Barb did n’t get that cute though .
As it turns out , the safe is just underneath their bed .
I ’m surprised that was n’t written down as well .
I pocket five hundred dollars in twenties and fifties in order to teach them an important lesson about theft proofing their home .
I put everything back where it goes , shut off all the lights and head back towards the basement .
Down there , it wo n’t be so conspicuous that this house is no longer empty .
I pull the string on a hanging light bulb , empty my new backpack onto an old card table , and take a seat on an easy chair that ’s been clawed to shreds by a long dead cat .
I push aside my groceries and the kid ’s peanut butter .
I grab the wallet first .
I pocket the cash and a couple of notes that the kid wrote with names and telephone numbers .
There are only three names on the notes .
Fuck .
I should ’ve kept the cell phone long enough to look at his contacts .
The kid ’s name is apparently Hugh Sommers , at least , according to his driver license , his Blockbuster video card , his Humana Insurance ( still on his dad ’s plan ) , and three credit cards .
Hugh has a picture of himself at the junior prom standing next to a girl that looks like whassername from “ Bones ” .
Stuck to the back of the photo is a business card .
BLOODSUCKING FREAKS
Videos , Novelties , Swank .
It has a Chicago address .
I see a road trip in my future .
I take the card , still stuck to the photo , and toss the wallet full of ID onto a pile of laundry .
What else did Hugh have in his sack ?
One obnoxiously large crucifix with a big miserable Jesus on it : Jack and Barb , I ’ll leave that as my gift to you , for your hospitality .
One small bottle of Bohemian Absinth : Like regular absinthe , it ’s distilled from wormwood and fairly dangerous to bloodsuckers .
This is n’t enough to kill one , but could probably be used like a morning after pill for vampire infection .
One squirt gun full of ( what I can only presume to be ) Holy Water : Holy Water tends to have the distinct musty smell of Catholicism all over it .
Maybe Jack and Barb have a grandson that could use this thing ?
Three odd - looking meters of some sort :
They look like the sort of things Tom Cruise would use to tell you how many thetans were trapped in your body .
Each is labeled “ Scantech Industries “ , a business run by a conman named Siodmak out of a basement in LaPorte , Indiana .
Nice guy , though .
One nasty - looking syringe : I figure the needle to be titanium , very thick but very sharp and made for puncturing vampire sternums .
The syringe contains 10 cubic centimeters of liquefied mugwort .
No vampire could survive this sort of stake to the heart .
We ’ll empty this one in the utility tub .
Numerous mirrors : I can see my reflection in them .
Man it would be cool if I could n’t .
One of those heavy duty flashlights that can also serve as a Billy club : A useful thing to carry .
A manila envelope :
You know what ’s weirder than seeing your name on a file you stole from a stranger ?
Not immediately recognizing your own name .
Pictures of me , names and dates , photocopies of official - looking documents and all sorts of tiny printed paragraphs .
Hey , I was officially presumed dead until 1995 .
I did n’t know that .
There ’s got to be 50 pages worth of notes here .
I need a good day ’s sleep before I can soak in that much information .
I rest my feet on the card table and pull the string to turn off the light .
I am snoring within minutes .
It is about two hours later when the doorbell rings .

It 's a tough time for businesses , but one entrepreneur may have found the recipe for success .
Male and female servers go topless at Grand View Topless Coffee Shop .
On Monday , Donald Crabtree opened Grand View Topless Coffee Shop in Vassalboro , Maine , where the waiters and waitresses serve their customers topless .
In a town with fewer than 4,500 residents , the topless coffee shop is booming with business .
Paul Crabtree , the owner 's brother , describes business so far as " fantastic . "
" It 's just been crowds mobbing in , " he said .
Donald Crabtree faced initial opposition to his plan , but he won the right to go ahead in a planning board hearing last week .
Many local residents were irate over the idea of combining coffee and nudity .
Crabtree , however , saw a profitable business venture .
" I know what people want , " he said .
" People like nudity , and coffee is profitable .
Sure , I 'd start a coffee shop , but I 'd be out of work in a week . "
The flood of job applications -- more than 150 -- for Grand View Topless Coffee Shop reflected the rough job market .
Crabtree hired 10 women and five men under stringent requirements , including friendliness and , what he considered most important , that the wait staff " treat everyone equally . "
Watch townspeople , employees talk about coffee shop
" We did n't hire ' 10s , ' " he said , referring to appearance .
" We hired everyone from skinny to big - boned women . "
Of the 15 selected , most had been laid off from other jobs in the past few months .
Elvis Thompson of Brunswick , for example , was a line cook at a restaurant before he lost his job .
" They could n't afford me anymore , " he said .
He said he does n't mind fielding interesting requests from customers .
" An 80 - year - old woman told me she wanted to see me in spandex , " Thompson said .
" I just feel really lucky to have a job .
I need the money so I can pay my rent . "
Ginni Labree from Palermo , Maine , said she applied to several restaurants before being hired at the Grand View .
All the restaurants declined to hire her because of her lack of experience .
" I 'm so excited , so excited to have a job , " she said .
The coffee shop jobs are paying off .
One waitress received a $ 100 tip for a cup of coffee , and most of the wait staff make about $ 30 a table .
Although the topless coffee shop has been open less than a week , Crabtree said he is already seeing regulars .
Customers include a variety of individuals , but mainly couples and females .
He also sees his new business venture as a temporary fix for customers struggling through tough economic times .
" The economy is so bad , " Crabtree said , " Everyone 's losing their homes , their ties , everything they own .
People leave here happy and can't wait to come back .
It 's nice to see people smile again . "

“ Empty , ” says Jack Rodman , an expert in distressed real estate , as he points from the window of his 40th - floor office toward a silver - skinned prism rising out of the Beijing skyline .
“ Beautiful building , but not a single tenant .
“ Completely empty .
“ Empty . ”
Advertisement
So goes the refrain as his finger skips from building to building , each flashier than the next , and few of them more than barely occupied .
Beijing went through a building boom before the 2008 Summer Olympics that filled a staid communist capital with angular architectural feats that grace the covers of glossy design magazines .
Now , six months after the Games ended , the city continues to dazzle by night , with neon and floodlights dancing across the skyline .
By day , though , it is obvious that many are “ see - through ” buildings , to use the term coined during the Texas real estate bust of the 1980s .
By Rodman ’s calculations , 500 million square feet of commercial real estate has been developed in Beijing since 2006 , more than all the office space in Manhattan .
And that does n’t include huge projects developed by the government .
He says 100 million square feet of office space is vacant -- a 14 - year supply if it filled up at the same rate as in the best years , 2004 through ’ 06 , when about 7 million square feet a year was leased .

“ The scale of development was unprecedented anywhere in the world , ” said Rodman , a Los Angeles native who lives in Beijing , running a firm called Global Distressed Solutions .
“ It defied logic .
It just does n’t make sense . ”
Construction cranes jut into the skyline , but increasingly they are fixed in place , awaiting fresh financing before work resumes .
Boarded fences advertise coming attractions -- “ an iconic landmark ” or “ international wonderland ” -- that are in varying states of half - completion .
A retail strip in one development advertised as “ La Vibrant shopping street ” is empty .
In a country where protests are rare , migrant workers stand in front of several construction projects , voicing their grievances .

“ Our boss ran away with the money and he is nowhere to be found , ” said Li Zirong , a migrant worker from Shaanxi province , who was a supervisor on a stunning building with windows shaped like portholes .
What makes this boom - and - bust cycle different from those in the West is that there is no private ownership of land in China , making local governments de facto partners in the real estate industry , which earn huge fees from leasing and transferring land .
Huang Yasheng , an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , traces the blame for the bust to the Chinese Communist Party and its reluctance to allow a true market economy .
“ The lack of land reform fed into the real estate bubble and now it ’s coming back to haunt them , ” said Huang , author of “ Capitalism With Chinese Characteristics , ” published last year .
“ There should have been more checks and balances on the ability of the government to acquire land . ”

The government spent $ 43 billion for the Olympics , nearly three times as much as any other host city .
But many of the venues proved too big , too expensive and more photogenic than practical .
The National Stadium , known as the Bird ’s Nest , has only one event scheduled for this year : a performance of the opera “ Turandot ” on Aug. 8 , the one - year anniversary of the Olympic opening ceremony .
China ’s leading soccer club backed out of a deal to play there , saying it would be an embarrassment to use a 91,000 - seat stadium for games that ordinarily attract only 10,000 spectators .
The venue , which costs $ 9 million a year to maintain , is expected to be turned into a shopping mall in several years , its owners announced last month .
A baseball stadium that opened last spring with an exhibition game between the Dodgers and the San Diego Padres , is being demolished .
Its owner says it also will use the land for a shopping mall .

Among the major Olympic venues , only the National Aquatics Center , nicknamed the Water Cube , has had a productive afterlife .
It ’s used for sound - and - light shows , with dancing fountains in the swimming lanes where Michael Phelps won his gold medals .
All around the Olympic complex , there are cavernous empty buildings , such as the main press center for the Games , that still await tenants .
A shopping arcade that stretches for a quarter of a mile across the street from the complex is empty , the storefronts papered over with signs reading “ famous stores corridor . ”
“ They wanted to build ‘ the world ’s biggest this ’ and ‘ the world ’s biggest that , ’ but these buildings have almost zero long - term economic benefit , ” economist Huang said .

Moreover , the makeover of Beijing for the Olympics led to an estimated 1.5 million residents being evicted from their homes , according to the Geneva - based Center on Housing Rights and Evictions .
In this vibrant capital city of 17 million , there is an insatiable demand for housing , yet prices remain far out of reach of most residents .
American - style free - standing homes are being advertised for more than $ 1 million in gated communities with names like Versailles , Provence , Arcadia and Riviera .
Within the Fourth Ring Road , a beltway that defines the central part of the city , two - and three - bedroom apartments are offered for $ 800,000 in compounds named Central Park and Riverside .
“ These are like New York prices , but we are Chinese .
We do n’t have that kind of money , ” said Zhang Huizhan , a 55 - year - old businessman who owns a Chinese furniture factory .
He has been looking for five years for an apartment for him and his wife within their budget of $ 150,000 .
The average salary in Beijing is less than $ 6,000 a year .
Advertisement
Louis Kuijs , a senior economist at the World Bank in Beijing , said a lack of government supervision of the real estate industry tempted developers to build only for the luxury market and to ignore the mass market .
“ If you think demand is endless for anything you build and you have just 200 square meters of land , you will build high - end apartments to make the highest profit , ” Kuijs said .
To its credit , the government recognized in 2007 that the real estate market was headed toward a bubble , economists say .
In an attempt to make real estate more affordable , restrictions were introduced on ownership of second homes and on foreign home buyers .
But the measures came too late , accelerating the crash of an already weakening market .
The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics reported this month that housing sales in the city dropped 40 % last year .
Chinese economists have predicted that housing prices will drop 15 % to 20 % in Beijing this year .
Shanghai has experienced a similar decline .
Advertisement
“ You can look at this perhaps as a healthy correction in the market , ” Kuijs said .
In the longer term , he said , “ China ’s urbanization and overall development is going to lead to a very large additional demand for housing in the city . ”
Before that happens , the situation could get worse .
Most of the real estate has been financed by Chinese banks , which have avoided writing down the loans .
Eventually , they will be forced to , and that probably will have a ripple effect throughout the economy .
“ At the end , somebody is going to have to pay the piper , ” real estate expert Rodman said .

In what could be an encouraging sign of change in the long - standing shortage of Americans preparing for “ clean energy ” careers , the subject is suddenly hot on college campuses across the nation -- a surge of interest largely stimulated by the specter of global warming .
Concern about climate change is galvanizing more undergraduate students to turn toward a subject involving science and engineering , some educators suggest , in much the same way that Moscow ’s launching of the Sputnik space satellite jolted baby boomers to turn their eyes to the stars .
What remains uncertain is whether their enthusiasm for renewable energy will carry over into graduate school and lead them to swell the ranks of Americans with advanced science and engineering degrees .
“ We have a shortfall of people to do cutting - edge research and do the innovations we need , ” said Vijay K. Dhir , dean of the engineering school at UCLA .
But , he added , “ the potential is there . ”
Advertisement
The rising interest in renewable energy is so new that it ’s not clearly reflected in the latest enrollment figures , educators say .
But leaders from a range of schools -- including Arizona State University , Indiana University and the University of Colorado -- say energy and sustainability are the hottest topic for their students .
President Obama is mounting a multibillion - dollar push to boost “ clean energy , ” in an attempt to create millions of jobs while focusing on the environment .
The effort includes stepped - up support for graduate students doing research in the area .
At the White House last week , Obama told a group of academics and energy entrepreneurs that “ innovators like you are creating the jobs that will foster our recovery . ”
The U.S. has struggled in the last two decades to produce enough home - grown scientists and engineers to meet demand .
Enrollment in graduate engineering programs dropped more than 5 % from 2003 to 2005 , the last year for which statistics are available .
At the same time , rapidly developing countries such as China and South Korea have ramped up such programs , both in size and quality .

Graduate science enrollment in the U.S. nearly doubled in the last two decades .
But the programs are now more than half - filled with foreign students , who increasingly are leaving the country upon graduation .
Aggravating the dearth of newly minted engineers , the rate at which American workers with science and engineering skills retire is expected to triple over the next decade .
If that trend continues , “ the rapid growth in [ research and development ] employment and spending that the United States has experienced since World War II may not be sustainable , ” the National Science Board said in a 2008 report .
Business leaders are equally blunt .
“ The most critical challenge over the long - term is people and brainpower , ” said Karen Harbert , executive vice president and managing director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ’s Institute for 21st Century Energy .

Obama hopes massive federal spending will help .
His economic stimulus package includes $ 20 billion to support basic and applied science research -- much of it done by graduate students -- that could yield cheaper solar cells , more efficient wind turbines and longer - lasting batteries .
His proposed federal budget seeks to triple the number of graduate research fellowships .
The increased interest among students reflects developments over the last few years that have raised the profile of global warming .
Climate change was a prominent issue in the presidential campaign , with Obama and other Democrats focusing heavily on it and Republicans joining in calling for action .
Even the Bush administration , which had previously downplayed climate change , acknowledged the issue as important .
The nation ’s economic problems may also be contributing to the trend .
“ In the past , very talented kids would go into business school , to Wall Street , get big bonuses , ” said Yannis C. Yortsos , the engineering dean at USC .
“ That may not be the case for a while .
They may go into engineering instead . ”
Advertisement
Yortsos has seen a rise in freshman and graduate - student interest in renewable energy research .
It ’s driven by a “ social awareness ” of sustainability issues and climate change , he said .
Students agree .
“ I became an engineer because of alternative energy and the potential it had ” to solve problems , said Loni Iverson , 21 , a mechanical engineering senior at USC who is assisting a professor ’s research into fuel cells that run on bacteria .
“ In high school , I kept hearing about America ’s dependence on foreign oil and the war in Iraq and gas prices rising . ”
Graduate research often leads to patents , which often lead to start - up firms -- and sometimes major industries .
Economists have shown strong links between patent production and economic growth .
University presidents and deans say that half the nation ’s science and engineering challenge is encouraging more domestic students to pursue graduate degrees .
The other half is to retain more of the foreign students after they earn their degrees .
They are being lured back to their home countries by quality jobs or pushed by complications in securing legal U.S. residence .

The immigrant scientists and engineers who study in the U.S. appear to be more inclined to take risks and start new companies , said Alice P. Gast , president of Lehigh University .
Gast previously was vice president for research and associate provost at MIT , where she noted in a 2005 faculty newsletter that the university had seen a rapid increase in patent disclosures with at least one international student involved .
Gast and other university presidents say that to keep domestic students engaged and keep international students in the U.S. , the federal government must sustain its energy research spending .
Top students , Gast said , “ will go where the excitement is . ”
Obama ’s energy secretary , Steven Chu , said in a recent interview that he sees “ a new cadre of idealistic people who want to work on [ energy ] in any way they can ” -- and that harnessing them is the key to the nation ’s economic future .
“ You have to start the long - term now , ” Chu said .
“ The long - term is being aware that a lot of students want to study science and engineering for this issue , to support them .
That requires patience . ”

Last week the National Court in Madrid received a complaint filed on behalf of five Spanish nationals formerly detained in Guantanamo who have charged that they were tortured in U.S. custody .
The complaint was referred for investigation to one of Spain ’s most high - profile law enforcement officials , Judge Baltasar Garzon .
Judge Garzon is best known for bringing similar charges against the former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and seeking his arrest and extradition from the United Kingdom .
In 2002 , Judge Garzon also sought unsuccessfully to question Henry Kissinger concerning alleged U.S. complicity in acts of state sponsored assassination carried out by Latin American dictatorships in the 1970s and 1980s .
The Spanish complaint names six senior lawyers from the Bush administration : former Attorney - General Alberto Gonzales , David Addington , William Haynes , John Yoo , Jay Bybee and Douglas Feith , the former under secretary of defense for policy .
Feith went on record in a Wall Street Journal op - ed piece in May 2004 in support of observing the Geneva Conventions in the context of the War on Terror and his inclusion on the list raises some intriguing questions .
The Spanish action comes at the same time as the British Attorney General , Baroness Scotland , has directed London ’s Metropolitan Police Service to investigate the participation of a Security Service ( MI5 ) officer known only as Witness B in the interrogation of former Guantanamo inmate Binyam Mohamed during his detention in Karachi in 2002 .
Yet calls inside the United States for Bush administration officials to be held accountable for the abusive policies adopted as part of the global war on terror continue to fall on deaf ears in Washington .
Although Judge Baltasar ’s investigation is unlikely to lead to those named in the complaint appearing in a Spanish courtroom any time soon , it is nonetheless a timely reminder that crimes were committed and that those responsible have walked away from the mess they created scot free .
In the next few weeks Americans will have the opportunity to reverse this situation without looking to a foreign court to take the lead .
The Senate Armed Services Committee is soon expected to re-release its damning bipartisan December 2008 report on the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody reinforced by more than 200 pages of newly declassified material not previously released to the public .
The first version of this report identified those senior officials most responsible for the detainee abuses that occurred in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo .
This expanded version will lay out the evidence of their complicity in compelling detail .
The Committee Chairman , Senator Carl Levin ( Democrat , Michigan ) , has already stated that he plans to refer the report to the Department of Justice .
The Obama administration will then face the first great test of its campaign rhetoric .
The President has said that no one in America is above the law , he will soon have the opportunity to prove it .
ROME  Responding to an extraordinary burst of global outrage , especially in Pope Benedict XVI ’s native Germany , the Vatican for the first time on Wednesday called on a recently rehabilitated bishop to take back his statements denying the Holocaust .
Late last month , the pope revoked the excommunications of four schismatic bishops from the ultraconservative Society of St. Pius X , including Bishop Richard Williamson , a Briton , who in an interview broadcast last month denied the existence of the Nazi gas chambers .
In a statement issued Wednesday , the Vatican Secretariat of State said that Bishop Williamson “ must absolutely , unequivocally and publicly distance himself from his positions on the Shoah , ” or Holocaust , or else he would not be allowed to serve as a bishop in the Roman Catholic Church .
The statement said that the bishop ’s recent comments denying the Holocaust had been “ unknown to the Holy Father at the time he revoked the excommunication . ”
Leading mobile phone manufacturers announced on Tuesday they had agreed to produce a standardised charger for the industry in a move set to save money for consumers and reduce waste .
Currently , each mobile phone maker has its own charger design , sometimes using several across different models , which increases replacement costs for users and leads to unwanted cables when a consumer swaps brands .
In a small move set to make this aspect of modern life easier , industry body the GSM Association said on Tuesday that leading manufacturers had agreed to link up to resolve the problem .
The Summit is focused on addressing lesbians , bisexual women , queer women , and transgender people .

Ros-Lehtinen : Hanging up on Obama ‘ pretty embarrassing ’
Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen ( R - Fla . ) said Thursday that it was “ pretty embarrassing ” to realize that she had twice hung up on President - elect Barrack Obama .
“ It took two hang - ups on my part .
Whoops .
Sorry about that , " she said on ABC 's " Good Morning America . "
" Listen , I do n't want to be presumptuous , but please tell President - elect Obama that he may call me now . ”
The congresswoman received the call on her cell phone Wednesday from a Chicago number informing her that Obama was requesting to speak to her .
When the President - elect introduced himself , Ros-Lehtinen assumed it was a prank and quickly cut him off .
“ I ’m sorry , but I think this is a joke from one of the South Florida radio stations known for these pranks , ” she said .
Incoming chief of staff Rahm Emanuel then called back to tell the congresswoman that it was in fact Obama on the other end of the phone .
“ Ileana , I can not believe you hung up on the president - elect , ” Emanuel said , before Ros-Lehtinen again hung up still thinking it was a prank .
Obama was finally able to connect after Rep. Howard Berman ( D - Calif. ) , the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee , on which Ros-Lehtinen is the ranking member , called to tell her that it really was the president - elect on the other end .
Once connected , Obama told Ros-Lehtinen , “ It is very funny that you have twice hung up on me . ”
She responded by telling Obama that South Florida radio stations frequently make prank calls .
“ Unfortunately , yes , I did hang up on President - elect Obama twice , ” Ros-Lehtinen said Thursday .
“ I said to him , ‘ Boy , you are a very good Obama impersonator .
Much better than that guy on " Saturday Night Live . " ’
And then , no wonder .
It was him . ”
Ros-Lehtinen added that she did not want to fall victim to a prank , as did Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin ( R ) , who was convinced that she was talking to French President Nicholas Sarkozy when in fact she was talking to two Canadian comedians broadcasting the conversation on the radio .
White Sands Testing New Laser Weapon System
The Phalanx is an air and missile - defense system used on nearly every ship in the fleet .
Converted to be transported and fired from a trailer , it is also used by the Army under the name Centurion to provide defense from air and missile threats as well as defense against mortar and artillery attacks .
Since it is also able to be used against small surface targets , the laser will be able to be used in peacekeeping and anti-piracy missions without drawing the kind of attention a cannon would .

White Sands Missile Range NM ( SPX ) Feb 06 , 2009
White Sands Missile Range is testing a new weapon system known as the Laser Centurion Demonstrator .
The system , developed by Raytheon , combines proven radar and threat - detection technology with the latest in laser weapons .
This demonstration model is intended to prove the capabilities and effectiveness of the new laser weapon as part of the Laser Area Defense Systems program , officials said .
The new laser system is designed to replace the 20 mm cannon on the Navy 's Phalanx system and the Army 's Centurion system , according to Raytheon 's Web site .
The integration of an advanced directed energy weapon into an existing conventional weapon system helps keep the system 's costs down as well as allowing an easier transition from one system to another , officials said .
The Phalanx is an air and missile - defense system used on nearly every ship in the fleet .
Converted to be transported and fired from a trailer , it is also used by the Army under the name Centurion to provide defense from air and missile threats as well as defense against mortar and artillery attacks .
As an upgrade to the Phalanx and Centurion , the laser system is a program that is jointly funded by the Navy and Army .
Other services are also interested in the laser itself for possible integration into other weapon systems .
" Directed energy is getting more and more prevalent in weapon systems , " said Col. Bruce Lewis , White Sands Test Center commander .
Initial tests with the demonstrator have been positive .
The laser has proven capable of rapidly penetrating armor plating even when not at full power , and system setup has been very easy .
" We are excited to be testing system capabilities by shooting down mortar rounds in the coming weeks , " said Sal Rodriguez , senior flight test engineer with the Naval Surface Warfare Center , Port Hueneme Division , Sands Missile Range detachment .
Rodriguez also thanked all the members of Team White Sands who have supported the program while it prepares to test the system .
The Laser Centurion will fill the same role as the conventional cannon - equipped version while providing a commander with more options and capabilities , officials said .
The laser - based system will still be able to engage targets like mortars , rockets , and missiles , but without the drawbacks of limited ammunition .
Also , since the laser does not use any kind of solid shot like the cannon , it can be used to better defend populated areas without the fear of the " 20 mm shower " that conventional air - defense guns cause when their bullets fall back to earth .
Since it is also able to be used against small surface targets , the laser will be able to be used in peacekeeping and anti-piracy missions without drawing the kind of attention a cannon would .
" At ( short range ) it 's a nice deterrent , and without the big bang of a gun , " said Lt. Shawn Mitchell , assistant officer in charge of the Naval Surface Warfare Center , Port Hueneme Division 's WSMR detachment .
Unlike previous laser systems of this kind that used chemical reactions to generate the necessary power for the laser , the Laser Centurion uses a solid - state laser that can run off any appropriately powerful source of electricity .
" It 's like the difference between an electric car and a gas - burning car ... this is a very green system , " said Dan McMaster , a program manager from Raytheon .
This makes the Laser Centurion a very flexible weapon system as it will be able to run off land - based generators and power supplies just as well as it will off of a ship 's reactor .

Historic Estates of U.S. Presidents
America has a fascination with its presidents .
One of the best ways to delve into the character of each commander - in - chief is to visit their boyhood homes .
Enduring Wanderlust has compiled six great estates to visit in Virginia , Massachusetts , and New York State .
1. George Washington ’s Mount Vernon ( Virginia )

Mount Vernon was the home of the first president of the United States .
George Washington lived on this forty - five acre estate before and after his presidency .
The grounds , including a spectacular view of the Potomac River , are open to the public .
Washington ’s home also features several gardens , lots of farm animals , and a dozen trees that date back to the former president ’s generation .
A new National Treasure Tour has been set up for visitors who want to view behind - the - scenes information about locations where the filming took place a few years ago .
Since the tours are popular , it ’s essential to book ahead .
Tours run from March 1 – October 31 , 2009 at 9:30 am , 11:30 am , 1:00 pm , and 3:00 pm .
Regular visits to Mount Vernon are possible 365 days of the year .
Admission is $ 14 for adults , $ 7 for children ( ages 6 to 11 ) , and free for children ages 5 and under .
2. John Adams ’ Peacefield or The Old House ( Massachusetts )

Peacefield or The Old House was the home and farm of John Adams .
It was the family residence of the Adams family for four generations .
Adams ’ son , John Quincy Adams , was also president of the United States .
The house includes the Stone Library , which contains over 14,000 volumes .
As with Washington ’s residence , tours are available for visitors .
It ’s smart to arrive early , as the house has become a popular tourist attraction since the publication of David McCullough ’s John Adams and the HBO Mini-series John Adams .
The open season for the home is from April 19 through November 10 .
During this time it is open seven days a week from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm .
Entrance fees run from $ 5.00 for adults to free entry for children under 16 years of age .
3. Thomas Jefferson ’s Monticello ( Virginia )

Monticello and its surrounding area constituted the main area of the estate since Thomas Jefferson ’s grounds had a number of partitions based on natural barriers .
The 5,000 acres are currently filled with a variety of exotic plant life among a number of separate farms in area .
A Renaissance man , the former president , was responsible for the design of the majestic property including the thirty - three - room house .
Its décor remains consist with Jefferson ’s taste though much of the original content has been sold .
In a difficult state of affairs , Jefferson ’s daughter Martha sold the original contents of the estate in order to pay of her father ’s massive debt after his death .
The primary author of the Declaration of Independence and founder of the University of Virginia managed to amass approximately $ 107,000 worth of debt .
Adults can expect to pay from $ 15 to $ 20 , depending on time of year , for entrance to the estate .
The fee is $ 8 for children except those under 6 who enter free of charge .
Hours are based on season : March to October runs from 8 am to 5 pm with November to February open from 9 am to 4:30 pm .

What if the ' Rapture ' happened but you were left behind ?
That 's what millions of Christians are wondering amid mounting evidence that the Rapture , the much - anticipated event in which God summons his faithful to the heavens , may have happened earlier this month .
Among the startled ' still here ' : House Majority Leader Tom DeLay , just one of the political leaders who had expected to be making the trek skyward .
From Capitol Hill to Kansas , finger pointing and questioning : ' why are we still here ? '
By Deanna Swift
Editor 's note :
After receiving hundreds of e-mails questioning the veracity of this article , the Swift Report conducted an internal investigation and later retracted the story .
The official retraction can be read here .
WASHINGTON , DC -- When House Majority Leader Tom DeLay delivered a moving speech from the halls of Congress last week , in which he argued that his political enemies are persecuting him because of his religious faith , there was just one problem : he was n't supposed to be there .
Earlier this month , say observers , the ' Rapture , ' the much - anticipated event in which God summons his faithful to the heavens , finally happened .
But instead of Mr. DeLay and millions of other believers making the skyward trek , the biblical bash appears to have been an exclusive , invitation - only affair .
As of today , fewer than three dozen Christians are confirmed to have been ' raptured , ' leaving their rejected brethren to deal with seven years of Tribulation , a turbulent period marked by the return of the anti-Christ .
For those who had hoped to be cashing in on their heavenly rewards , these are days of soul searching and regret .
From Capitol
Hill to the mega-churches of the south , disappointed travelers are asking the same questions : ' Why not me ? '
' What did I do wrong ? ' and ' Was it something I said ? '
The lucky few
David Dumé , originally of Spring Hill , KS , appears to be among the lucky few who are currently enjoying the company of the world 's most famous father .
Mr. Dumé , who had recently returned to Kansas from Hollywood , where he enjoyed a short but lucrative career in adult - themed films , was expected to attend a potluck supper and informal prayer session at the Spring Hill Baptist Church — but disappeared from site just minutes after reaching the building .
Stunned onlookers say that they watched aghast as Mr. Dumé " flew up through the ceiling , " leaving a pile of clothing , gold jewelry , an outsized diamond - covered crucifix , and several piercings and chains behind .
Experts say that the fact that Mr. Dumé and others cast off such earthly accoutrements is another sure sign that they were indeed raptured .
And the not - so - lucky
The pastor of the church , Roy DeLong , who is also an active supporter of conservative political causes including a constitutional ban on gay marriage and private Social Security accounts , says that he is personally shocked that Mr. Dumé was chosen to make the trip , while he and so many other more faithful believers remain behind .
" He was not even a regular presence around here , that 's what 's so startling .
I do n't want to say that mistakes were made , but you really have to wonder about the selection process here , " says Pastor DeLong .
DeLong , who also heads up the Baptist Leadership Council , will join other prominent Christian leaders , including the Reverends Tim Lahaye , James Dobson and Franklin Graham , for an emergency meeting later this week .
" At this point , we 're concluding that this was probably a practice round before the real deal , " says Pastor DeLong .
" That 's the only way this makes any sense .
He left behind all of the wrong people .
Why would He do that ? "
The right — left behind
Meanwhile , no one appears to have made the trip upwards from Capitol Hill .
Beltway observers had speculated that dozens of high - profile leaders , including President Bush and Representative DeLay , would be raptured , possibly setting off a complex battle over succession within the halls of power .
So certain were these men that their earthly tenure was coming to an end , say sources , that they scheduled a lengthy break over the Easter weekend .
While Stewart Roy , a spokesman for Mr. DeLay , refused to acknowledge that the House Majority Leader has indeed been left behind , he did confirm that the Texas representative is taking some much - needed time off .
" Let 's just say that there are some unexpected openings in his schedule .
I 'm not going to say anything more than that . "

I have a secret .
And it really is one I can't share just now .
I promised someone .
You may speculate all you want in the comments , and I wo n't confirm or deny anything until the time is right , and I can reveal all .
It 's not Earth - shattering or anything , but if things work out the right way , it 'll be a whole lot of fun .
Until then , for reasons I can't explain just yet , I need some help .
It 's totally self - serving , and I make neither apologies nor excuses for it .
Basically , I 'd like for you , me droogs , to spread the word about my blog .
I do n't want anything artificial , like people clicking my posts lots of times just to rack up traffic -- that wo n't help , and may hurt , so seriously , please do n't .
I want this to be at least somewhat organic , though with a kick start .
If you like something I 've written , tell a friend .
Email someone with a link to a post here that you liked .
You can help promote it via social networks like Digg , Reddit , and StumbleUpon ( use the buttons at the top of each post ; you may need to register with those sites which is free and actually worth your time , since there 's lots more great content waiting for you there ) .
I also do a lot of chit- chatting and such on Twitter , so you can follow me there ( I link to a lot of friends ' stuff you might otherwise miss , too ) .
I 'm also on Facebook .
Like I said , this is self - serving , but the end result should be fun .
And if it pans out -- well truly , even if it does n't , but I hope it does -- I 'll reveal everything , in probably more detail than you 'll want .
That 's a promise to you .
Washington , D.C. —
The risk of getting cancer from coal ash lagoons is 10,000 times greater than government safety standards allow , according to a draft report from the Environmental Protection Agency obtained by an environmental group .
Although the EPA acknowledges this risk , it has neglected to adopt regulations that will limit exposure and protect against the health threats of America 's second - largest industrial solid waste stream , coal ash .
While EPA has not yet formally released the revised assessment , environmental groups received a summary of the draft , which indicates that the cancer risk for adults and children drinking groundwater contaminated with arsenic from coal combustion waste dumps can be as high as 1 in 100 -- 10,000 times higher than EPA 's regulatory goals for reducing cancer risks .
Read excerpts from the EPA assesment .
( PDF )
EPA 's failure to limit pollution from coal combustion waste , or coal ash , has poisoned surface and groundwater supplies in at least 23 states , by EPA 's own admission .
Coal combustion waste is the solid waste produced by coal - fired power plants , which produce approximately 129 million tons of the waste each year .
The waste is contaminated with toxic chemicals such as mercury , arsenic , lead , cadmium , chromium and selenium .
There are currently about 600 existing coal ash landfills and surface impoundments in the U.S.
See the amount of coal ash generated in each state in 2004 .
( PDF )
There are currently plans to build over 150 new coal - fired power plants in the United States by 2030 .
Pollution from coal ash impoundments will undoubtedly worsen unless EPA takes the necessary steps to protect neighborhoods and communities from this dangerous pollution source .
EPA acknowledges that coal ash landfills and surface impoundments have contaminated water above federal drinking water standards in the following states :
Texas , Maryland , New York , Virginia , Wisconsin , Indiana , North Carolina , and South Carolina .
The agency also acknowledges that more cases of drinking water damage occur , but that monitoring systems are not in place to detect contamination at a large percentage of the existing dumps .
A broad coalition of 27 environmental and public health groups , led by Earthjustice , Clean Air Task Force , and the Environmental Integrity Project , recently submitted a proposal to EPA detailing ways to protect against pollution from the millions of tons of coal ash disposed annually by U.S. coal - fired power plants .
The groups also requested that EPA take immediate action to investigate and abate pollution at coal ash dump sites .
" It 's very simple , " said Earthjustice attorney Lisa Evans .
" Coal combustion waste currently disposed without adequate safeguards poses an imminent and substantial endangerment to health and the environment in dozens of communities throughout the country .
EPA has made no effort to protect the public against these pollution sources for over seven years .
We believe it is time to act . "
In 2000 , EPA committed to establishing regulations for coal ash disposal .
Since then , the agency has met repeatedly with industrial polluters and will soon issue a Notice of Data Availability ( NODA ) , which is expected to defer federal waste regulation in favor of a voluntary industry agreement .
However , the voluntary industry agreement , announced by a consortium of coal - fired electric utilities last fall , promises no controls on the hundreds of existing waste dumps and gives industry three years to place monitoring wells around dumps within a mile of drinking water sources .
Simple measures such as isolating the waste from groundwater , prohibiting dumping of coal ash in sand and gravel pits , and lining landfills and surface impoundments would have a huge impact on limiting pollution from these facilities .
" The people who are exposed to a greater cancer risk by drinking water poisoned by coal ash landfills and surface impoundments need to be heard , " said Jeff Stant , Director of the Power Plant Waste - Safe Disposal Project for the Clean Air Task Force .
" EPA has ignored affected communities for far too long . "
" Many coal ash disposal sites lack the most basic safeguards such as liners , covers , and groundwater monitoring -- standards that are routinely required for household trash at sanitary landfills , " states Eric Schaeffer , Director of the Environmental Integrity Project .
" In fact , in many cases , the operators are simply dumping the waste straight into groundwater and face no cleanup requirements by states . "
The National Academies of Science ( NAS ) found in a March 2006 report studying the practice by utilities of dumping coal combustion wastes in coal mines that high contaminant levels in leachate , or runoff , from coal ash dumps has contaminated drinking water and caused considerable environmental damage , including the local extinction of multiple species .
The NAS report cited EPA 's commitment in 2000 to promulgate federal regulations to require adequate safeguards for disposal of toxic ash and called for the development of regulations mandating safeguards for minefilling .
The Environmental Protection Agency , nevertheless , has neglected issuing these much needed safeguards .

Do you wish you had a rain barrel to harvest rainwater from your roof — but do n’t want to spend $ 100 ’s or settle for an ugly blue plastic container ?
Good —
I think you can have a pretty , aesthetically pleasing rain barrel for CHEAP !
I ’ve got 3 clever ways to turn ugly rain barrels into pretty rain barrels … without spending much money .
Why does something as simple as harvesting run-off rainwater from your roof have to be so pricey ?
( Answer : Because it ’s trendy . )
There are ridiculously priced rain barrels out there that everyone has seen — like these planter / rain barrel combos for $ 100 and up !
Then , of course , there is the CISTA rainwater harvesting system that looks amazing , but who knows what the price tag on that bad boy will be ?
( My guess is $ 300 + . )
So how can you build your own rain barrel that does n’t cost you an arm and a leg and that you will actually want people to see ?
I ’ve got 3 ideas for you …
Top 3 Affordable & Pretty Rain Barrels
# 1 – Grow flowering vines down the sides of ugly 55 - gallon barrels to make them look pretty .
One of my absolute favorite ( and cheapest ) DIY rain barrel ideas is from designer Michelle Kaufmann .
Michelle shares the idea of just spending about $ 10 to get any cheap 55 gallon barrel .
Then she suggests growing beautiful vines up around it on cheap wire mesh and placing potted flowers or plants on top to completely hide it !
Check out her awesome how - to video for this cheap and attractive DIY rain barrel :
Michelle Kaufmann also shows you how to ditch your downspout and make your own rain chain to carry your rain water to your new rain barrel !
Here ’s the video :
# 2 – Paint ugly barrels , place a few potted plants around them , and you have pretty rain barrels .
Another cheap and easy way to make an attractive rain barrel is to find a cheap or free 55 gallon barrel and paint it to match your landscaping , home , or give it a terra cotta look .
If you ca n’t or do n’t want to grow vining plants around it , as in Michelle Kaufmann ’s idea above , you could simply place some potted plants or flowers on the top or sides .
If you choose creeping plants , they ’ll look nice falling over the side of the barrel ..
# 3 – Reuse old rustic barrels to make your own wooden rain barrels that look great .
Lots of home and garden stores , nurseries , wineries , and the like will sell you used oak barrels that make beautiful and great wooden rain barrels .
I happen to live in the heart of whiskey country ( within 1 - 1/2 hours of both the Jack Daniel ’s distillery and the Maker ’s Mark distillery ) , so a barrel from one of those locations would work too .
You can see a finished example of this type of wooden rain barrel in the top picture above from Kent Rasmussen ’s Lincoln Green Scene profile .
What Do You Think About These 3 DIY Rain Barrel Ideas ?
Do you think you could make one of them work for your home ?
Have you found another way to make a rain barrel that you ’ll actually want to incorporate into your landscape , not hide behind a fence ?
I think every little step toward living green is an awesome one … but eco-snobbery sucks !
My goal is to help newbies learn the most important steps toward living green — individually and collectively .
Personally , I strive to have as little impact as possible on Planet Earth while I 'm here .
Pioneering Japanese surgeon Seishu Hanaoka , with his mother ( left ) and wife ( Image : International Museum of Surgical Science )
See a gallery of bizarre medical devices
“ When the dreadful steel was plunged into my breast …
I began a scream that lasted unintermittingly during the whole time of the incision .
I almost marvel that it rings not in my ears still , so excruciating was the agony . ”
When English writer Fanny Burney had surgery for breast cancer in 1811 , she felt every move of the knife as the surgeon cut through her all too resistant flesh .
The introduction of ether and chloroform as general anaesthetics was still 35 years away .
Yet , unknown to doctors in the west , Japanese surgeon Seishu Hanaoka had performed the same operation several years earlier – and his patient had n’t felt a thing .
IT WAS nine months before Fanny Burney could bring herself to write about the operation to remove her breast .
In a letter to her sister Esther , she described in harrowing detail what she had felt as the surgeon cut and scraped and cut some more .
By the early 19th century , Europe ’s surgeons had the knowledge and skills to perform major operations .
What they did n’t have was an effective anaesthetic .
Opium or copious amounts of cognac could help dull the pain , but no one had yet found a reliable way to render a patient unconscious during surgery – or so European surgeons thought .

What do you get if you divide science by God ?
A prize - winning quantum physicist says a spiritual reality is veiled from us , and science offers a glimpse behind that veil .
So how do scientists investigating the fundamental nature of the universe assess any role of God , asks Mark Vernon .
The Templeton Prize , awarded for contributions to " affirming life 's spiritual dimension " , has been won by French physicist Bernard d'Espagnat , who has worked on quantum physics with some of the most famous names in modern science .
Quantum physics is a hugely successful theory : the predictions it makes about the behaviour of subatomic particles are extraordinarily accurate .
And yet , it raises profound puzzles about reality that remain as yet to be understood .
WHAT IS QUANTUM PHYSICS ?
Originated in work conducted by Max Planck and Albert Einstein at start of 20th Century
They discovered that light comes in discrete packets , or quanta , which we call photons The Heisenberg Uncertainty principle says certain features of subatomic particles like momentum and position cannot be known precisely at the same time Gaps remain , like attempts to find the ' God Particle ' that scientists hope to spot in the Large Hadron Collider .
It is required to give other particles mass
The bizarre nature of quantum physics has attracted some speculations that are wacky but the theory suggests to some serious scientists that reality , at its most basic , is perfectly compatible with what might be called a spiritual view of things .
Some suggest that observers play a key part in determining the nature of things .
Legendary physicist John
Wheeler said the cosmos " has not really happened , it is not a phenomenon , until it has been observed to happen . "
D'Espagnat worked with Wheeler , though he himself reckons quantum theory suggests something different .
For him , quantum physics shows us that reality is ultimately " veiled " from us .
The equations and predictions of the science , super - accurate though they are , offer us only a glimpse behind that veil .
Moreover , that hidden reality is , in some sense , divine .
Along with some philosophers , he has called it " Being " .
In an effort to seek the answers to the " meaning of physics " , I spoke to five leading scientists .
1 . THE ATHEIST Nobel - prize winning physicist Steven Weinberg is well - known as an atheist .
For him , physics reflects the " chilling impersonality " of the universe .
He would be thinking here of , say , the vast tracts of empty space , billions of light years across , that mock human meaning .
He says : " The more the universe seems comprehensible , the more it seems pointless . "
So for Weinberg , the notion that there might be an overlap between science and spirituality is entirely mistaken .
2 . THE SCEPTIC The Astronomer Royal and President of the Royal Society , Martin Rees , shows a distinct reserve when speculating about what physics might mean , whether that be pointlessness or meaningfulness .
He has " no strong opinions " on the interpretation of quantum theory : only time will tell whether the theory becomes better understood .
" The implications of cosmology for these realms of thought may be profound , but diffidence prevents me from venturing into them , " he has written .
In short , it is good to be humble in the face of the mysteries that physics throws up .
3 . THE PLATONIST Oxford physicist Roger Penrose differs again .
He believes that mathematics suggests there is a world beyond the immediate , material one .
Can science explain all of life 's meaning ?
Ask yourself this question : would one plus one equal two even if I did n't think it ?
The answer is yes .
Would it equal two even if no - one thought it ?
Again , presumably , yes .
Would it equal two even if the universe did n't exist ?
That is more tricky to contemplate , but again , there are good grounds for a positive response .
Penrose , therefore , argues that there is what can be called a Platonic world beyond the material world that " contains " mathematics and other abstractions .
4 . THE BELIEVER John Polkinghorne worked on quantum physics in the first part of his career , but then took up a different line of work : he was ordained an Anglican priest .
For him , science and religion are entirely compatible .
The ordered universe science reveals is only what you 'd expect if it was made by an orderly God .
However , the two disciplines are different .
He calls them " intellectual cousins " .
" Physics is showing the world to be both more supple and subtle , but you need to be careful , " he says .
If you want to understand the meaning of things you have to go beyond science , and the religious direction is , he argues , the best .
5 . THE PANTHEIST Brian Swimme is a cosmologist , and with the theologian Thomas Berry , wrote a book called The Universe Story : From the Primordial Flaring Forth to the Ecozoic Era .
It is avidly read by individuals in New Age and ecological circles , and tells the scientific story of the universe , from the Big Bang to the emergence of human consciousness , but does so as a new sacred myth .
Swimme believes that " the universe is attempting to be felt " , which makes him a pantheist , someone who believes the cosmos in its entirety can be called God.
Mark Vernon is author of After Atheism : Science , Religion and the Meaning of Life A selection of your comments appears below .
As a Hindu I can agree with them all .
There is a ( centuries old ) western short - sightedness approach to science that is generally backed up Abrahamic beliefs .
Science is being polarised or is seen in that manner ie if A is right B must be wrong , rather like the concept of heaven and hell .
In Hinduism and other ' Dharmic ' beliefs it has always been said that we live in the age of " maya " or illusion or even ' veil ' and that what we see is made from ' cosmic vibrations ' .
Nothing that we see is how it is , it is our eyes that can only take in limited information which our brain processes to fill in the gaps .
Is a rock just a rock or is it billions of particles resonating at a certain frequency to make the ' image ' of the rock ' seen ' by our eyes .
The answer is both !
Seeing may be believing , but it depends on whether you see with your eyes or an electron microscope .
Dipen , Stanmore I am a physicist and evangelical Christian , so I think Penrose and Polkinghorne are closest to the truth .
I 'm pleased to hear that people are beginning to look again at the foundations of quantum theory .
In recent decades physics has been dominated by what I call ' quantum mechanics ' ( like ' garage mechanics ' ) - people who can do the sums but do n't think about what they mean .
The deeper questions in physics are bound to interact with the religious / philosophical assumptions of the physicist .
Dave , St Neots I agree with Weinberg .
The maths might show up the complexities in nature and point to some profound conclusions , but the whole idea of something supernatural pulling the levers of the universe just escapes me .
Dan Wildsmith , Barnsley
When my ego is flaring I 'm with the atheist simply because all thoughts , perceptions and concepts come from that wonderful delusional and often ignorant creature we call the mind .
When the self is in check I 'm with the sceptic ... for the same reason !
Only mankind 's arrogance , brought about by that delusional self , has to believe they exist for some " special " purpose .
Billy , Garnerville , New York Obviously the great Martin Rees , but for more detail and a lot of work on the scientific view [ eg , ch.6 in " Exploring Reality " ] , I go with Polkinghorne .
My own view is ' 99 % Dawkins ' - but what a difference 1 % Christ makes .
Your equation should be something about exobiology , or evolution of altruism : the Price equation , or just rB > C. Biology describes the world ; physics is a special case .
Valerie Jeffries , Faversham , England As a Christian I would agree with John Polkinghorne .
Science just reveals how awesome the world is , a world which God created and designed .
It is ironic that many scientists try and disprove God but in many instances only demonstrate just how complex and wonderful the world is .
There had to be an author of creation .
We are not here by chance .
Nathan Goodearl , Guildford I most agree with Martin Rees .
He seems to accept that we are not currently in a position to understand the universe in it 's entirety .
I would be interested to hear his views on the so - called ' God Particle ' ( Higgs Boson ) .
I fundamentally disagree with the view that science and religion are compatible and fail to see why some people who choose to exercise faith in a religious belief choose to do so via science .
Religion can exist without science , and science without religion .
Rachael Amato , Bristol I agree with the Atheist .
For as long as anyone can remember the things we do n't understand have been given the explanation ' God ' , or ' Gods ' and throughout history science , little by little , provides non-God explanations for things ( suns , stars , comets , animals , plants etc. ) .
This pattern looks set to repeat itself ad infinitum .
In time we will be looking at our current religious theories and thinking how primitive and quite frankly wrong they look in the context of modern knowledge .
But belief seems to be a need for many humans and I have no doubt their beliefs and Gods will move on in to the future gaps in our understanding .
Julian Harrison , Shrewsbury 4 . THE BELIEVER is correct InshAllah .
Many scientific facts have been found to be consistent with The Quran .
Science is the rational study of creation , and its facts are consistent with revelation .
Saqib Pervaiz , Wolverhampton
The Atheist makes the most sense .
The Universe is full of mystery that Mathematics and Physics will , in time , unravel .
However , I do n't understand why Steven Weinberg needs to believe that the Universe should have a personality and why he deems it as pointless .
Everything in life is pointless from that point of view , experiences - my enjoyment of living is my spirituality , for me there is no God and why does that matter ?

During 2008 and early 2009 , Endangered Species International ( ESI ) conducted monitoring activities using undercover methods at key markets in the city of Pointe Noire , the second biggest city in Congo .
Findings reveal that 95 percent of the illegal bushmeat sold originates from the Kouilou region about 100 - 150 km northwest to Pointe Noire where primary and unprotected rainforest still remains .
The Kouilou region is one the last reservoirs of biodiversity and endangered animals in the area .

Gorilla is among many endangered species sold illegally in markets .
Gorilla is sold in the form of smoked meat already cut in pieces .
A piece of hand size smoked gorilla is usually sold for 2,500 CFA ( 6 USD ) .
ESI has estimated about 300 gorillas butchered a year for the bushmeat market in Pointe Noire .
Pierre Fidenci , head of Endangered Species International , says that gorilla illegal market trade is thriving in Congo and the mass arrival of the Chinese in search of natural resources will exacerbate illegal hunting for rare and endangered species .
If the present trend in forest exploitation continues in Kouilou , most edible endangered wildlife — including great apes — will vanish within a few years in this region .
Examples of frequent wildlife species observed by a local ESI team led by Franck Makoundi , included mandrill , African rock python , spotted hyaena , great blue turaco , Nile monitor , and black - and - white - casqued hornbill .

Pons ' and Fleischmann 's announcement was made on 23 March 1989
The long - standing debate about cold fusion is receiving new impetus at the American Chemical Society 's national meeting in the US this week .
Cold fusion , first announced 20 years ago on Monday , was claimed to be a boundless source of clean energy by Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons .
Attempts to replicate their experiments failed , but a number of researchers insist that cold fusion is possible .
The meeting will see several approaches that claim to produce fusion power .
The American Chemical Society has organised sessions surrounding the research at its meetings before , suggesting that the field would otherwise have no suitable forum for debate .
In a bid to avoid the negative connotations of a largely discredited approach , research in the field now appears under the umbrella of " low - energy nuclear reactions " , or LENR .
Gopal Coimbatore , ACS programme chair for an LENR session at the 2007 national meeting , said that " with the world facing an energy crisis , it is worth exploring all possibilities " .
Heating up
The principle of cold fusion runs counter to that of other fusion production mechanisms that employ enormous lasers or magnetic chambers to contain searingly hot gas .
Pons and Fleischmann ran a current through a simple , room - temperature device called an electrolytic cell .
I 'm not at all surprised that something is being said today .
It is an interesting date in the calendar of wrong results that claim to be science
Professor Frank Close
Oxford University
They observed a heat rise in the cell , suggesting that power was being produced within it from nuclear fusion .
However , a flurry of attempts to repeat the experiment around the world , an extensive review by the US Department of Energy of cold fusion research , and a few years spent by Pons and Fleischmann themselves working on the approach in France failed to establish cold fusion as a reality .
Researchers who pursue LENR approaches say that their work has been marginalised and suffers from a chronic lack of funding in the wake of the initial , flawed announcement .
Frank Close , a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Oxford , says that the far greater problem with cold fusion claims is that results from any given study have never been independently verified - a problem that plagued that first announcement .
" Nothing 's really changed in 20 years .
I 'm not at all surprised that something is being said today , " Professor Close told BBC News .
" It is an interesting date in the calendar of wrong results that claim to be science . "
NIF , the world 's largest laser , is designed to initiate nuclear fusion Many of the details of Pons and Fleischmann 's original electrolytic cell feature in more recent work , including the type of metal used in the cell 's electrodes and water made from a heavy isotope of hydrogen .
One wholly new approach will be explained by researchers from Hokkaido University , who have seen unexplained heat production in a chamber filled with compressed hydrogen and a chemical called phenanthrene .
Professor Close said that many inexplicable phenomena have arisen in the 20 years since Pons and Fleischmann 's announcement that have been tagged with the " cold fusion " moniker .
" If I come up with a weird phenomenon and call it cold fusion , I know that reporters will be interested .
Convincing the scientific community is another matter entirely . "

" A secret police intelligence unit has been set up to spy on leftwing and rightwing political groups , " said the story in the Mail on Sunday .
Who has decided that political and environmental groups consisting of individuals , who are guaranteed the rights of demonstration , association , free speech and privacy under the Human Rights
Act , should be spied upon by this new sinister police unit ?
The answer is the Association of Chief Police Officers – and that is the problem .
Few understand that ACPO is a private company , which happens to be funded by a Home Office grant and money from 44 police authorities .
But despite its important role in drafting and implementing policies that affect the fundamental freedoms of this country , ACPO is protected from freedom of information requests and its proceedings remain largely hidden from public view .
In reality ACPO is no more troubled by public scrutiny than the freemasons .
That is wrong .
Senior police officers are acting with increasing autonomy in drafting these authoritarian new policies .
If you wonder how it came to be that police officers are being equipped with 10,000 stun guns , despite the reports of hundreds of deaths in the United States , or how the automatic number plate recognition camera network was set up to record and store data from most road journeys , look no further than ACPO .
Too often it seems ACPO is the driving force behind policy , and the Home Office succumbs , either because of its own autocratic instincts or because the police are exceptionally good at pushing through the things they want .
Now the police have set up the confidential intelligence unit to monitor the political life of this nation .
The only reason we know of this is because the Mail on Sunday followed up an internal police job advertisement for the head of the confidential intelligence unit , who would work closely with government departments , university authorities and private sector companies " to remove the threat of criminality and public disorder that arises from domestic extremism " .
The story tells us that the CIU will also prevent details of its operations being made public .
This surely must ring a few alarm bells , even among our complacent MPs who have allowed this tiny state - within - a - state to flourish over the past decade .
It is evident that the CIU will not be troubled by any public accountability and that the individual who becomes its head will be able to make decisions unilaterally about the nation 's politics .
If all environmental groups are to be branded extreme , if those who demonstrate against the invasion of Gaza are , as a matter of course , to be regarded as a criminal threat , we will enter a period of enormous tension between the authorities and those people who wish to exercise their legitimate right to demonstrate .
Of course there are extremist groups hoping to make use of troubles ahead but it is surely a matter of the gravest urgency that parliament involves itself in defining the limits of the CIU 's activity and bringing ACPO into the 21st century by forcing it to become more accountable and open .
We cannot have the police making decisions about what constitutes legitimate politics in this country .
Solid Gold Advice for Chinese Economists
You will be happy to know that we have nothing to fear from the Chinese , as they are as stupid as the rest of us , as I learned from a Bloomberg.com report that China ’s Premier Wen Jiabao says that China is “ the U.S. government ’s largest creditor ” in terms of T - bonds , and he is “ worried ” that something might happen to the buying power of all of that American money , and he “ wants assurances that the investment is safe ” and that he “ requests ” that the U.S. “ maintain its good credit , to honor its promises and to guarantee the safety of China ’s assets . ”
Which makes me laugh that anyone would even bother saying such a thing !
Hahaha !
Moron !
Of course , being The Mogambo like I am , it is my duty to enlighten world leaders about economics , and in that regard I say to them , “ Of course those dollar - denominated assets are safe , Chinese dude !
If they ever get lost or destroyed , the United States will merely give you more paper promises !
That ’s the beauty of a fiat currency , you morons :
We can give you more and more dollars until you are freaking drowning in them ! ”
I do n’t expect the Chinese to hear me and suddenly say , “ Thanks , Mogambo ! ” or even something that sounds like “ Wong choi how wong ! ” which I interpret to mean , “ That Mogambo fellow is one sharp economic cookie , and maybe we ought to be following his Strong Mogambo Suggestion ( SMS ) to buy gold , silver and oil against the terrifying inflationary conflagration that will inevitably result from such insane monetary and fiscal irresponsibility by the Federal Reserve and the Congress , respectively , which is about the only time you can ever use the word ‘ respect ’ in relation to either one of those lying , corrupt institutions , which does not even mention the sheer corruption of their state and local governments , and governments and central banks around the world who are doing the exact same thing , which is enough to give you the Horrified Mogambo Screamies ( HMS ) . ”
But perhaps such gracious social niceties are foreign to Chinese culture , or maybe they are still miffed that I have been calling them “ morons ” for years since they ignore me when I tell them that they , of all the countries on the earth , need the stability of a gold standard so that they can grow their economy with cheap imports and low cost of capital , which is what you get from a gold - backed currency , and that is why they should be exchanging their excess dollars for gold bullion .
But whatever the reason , they have plenty to worry about , as the American Congress and the Obama administration have already announced , crafted and passed legislation authorizing multi-trillion dollar federal budget deficits !
And these unbelievably massive federal budget deficits will continue for as far as anyone can see , meaning that the Federal Reserve will create more money and credit to pay for it all , thus vastly expanding the money supply some more , which makes prices go up some more , which devalues all the other existing dollars , which makes prices go up some more , which makes people more angry and rebellious , but which – in this case – makes me laugh and laugh and laugh ; and I say to Wen Jaibao , tears of laughter running down my face and ruining my mascara ( which is another sad story of heartbreak and betrayal best left for another time ) , “ Hey , Chinese dude !
Do n’t worry about your stinking dollars losing value !
Hahaha !
We ’ll take real good care of your money , you moron ! ”
Or , if the Chinese are not interested in the Valuable Advice Of The Mogambo ( VAOTM ) just because I am widely considered to be an idiot with no redeeming qualities , then they could instead just read in the respected Economist magazine where the “ budget balance as % of GDP 2009 ” for the USA is now a negative 11.1 % , which is one of those “ I never thought I would live to see it ” kind of things , sort of like my family waiting for me to live up to my responsibilities and act like a normal human being , which are ( as I gather from the way they ask me about it ) , not too much to ask , although I politely remind tell that I am too old and hateful to give a crap about what they think about anything , including this .
And if they want something more immediate , In fact , all they would have to do is keep reading , as this is where I cite Doug Noland of the Credit Bubble Bulletin , who reports , “ M2 ( narrow ) ‘ money ’ supply jumped $ 29.5 bn to a record $ 8.304 TN ( week of 3/2 ) . ”
In case Mr. Wen Jaibao wants to know how much of a rise in price inflation that will follow such a rise in the money supply , I will tell him , “ I have no idea , but ( in keeping with mixing up Eastern philosophies with religions ) , I have a riddle for you , Wen , baby : ‘ What is the sound of one hand clapping when the hand is burned to a cinder with two red - hot pokers instead of just one red - hot poker ? ’ “
Naturally , he will be confused at the sheer stupidity of the question and probably offended at what appears to be a crude slur , whereupon I will tell him that as part of the answer to his original question of “ How much inflation in the money supply ” Mr. Noland calculates that , that “ Narrow ‘ money ’ has now inflated at a 16.9 % rate over the past 24 weeks and $ 738bn over the past year , or 9.8 % . ”
As to being offended by my laughing at his apparent lack of intelligence , if he does n’t want to look like an idiot , then stop saying stupid things like he “ requests ” that the U.S. “ maintain its good credit , to honor its promises and to guarantee the safety of China ’s assets . ”
Hahaha !
Like that ’s going to happen !
In healthy volunteers , the equivalent of two cups of coffee reduced the body 's ability to boost blood flow to the heart muscle in response to exercise , and the effect was stronger when the participants were in a chamber simulating high altitude , according to a new study in the Jan. 17 , 2006 , issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology .
" Whenever we do a physical exercise , myocardial blood flow has to increase in order to match the increased need of oxygen .
We found that caffeine may adversely affect this mechanism .
It partly blunts the needed increase in flow , " said Philipp A. Kaufmann , M.D. , F.A.C.C. , from the University Hospital Zurich and Center for Integrative Human Physiology CIHP in Zurich , .
The researchers , including lead author Mehdi Namdar , M.D. , F.A.C.C. , studied 18 young , healthy people who were regular coffee drinkers .
The participants did not drink any coffee for 36 hours prior to the study testing .
In one part of the study , PET scans that showed blood flow in the hearts of 10 participants were performed before and immediately after they rode a stationary exercise bicycle .
In the second part of the study , the same type of myocardial blood - flow measurements were done in 8 participants who were in a chamber simulating the thin air at about 15,000 feet ( 4,500 meters ) altitude .
The high - altitude test was designed to mimic the way coronary artery disease deprives the heart muscle of sufficient oxygen .
In both groups , the testing procedure was repeated 50 minutes after each participant swallowed a tablet containing 200 milligrams of caffeine , the equivalent of two cups of coffee .
The caffeine dose did not affect blood flow within the heart muscle while the participants were at rest .
However , the blood flow measurements taken immediately after exercise were significantly lower after the participants had taken caffeine tablets .
The effect was pronounced in the group in the high - altitude chamber .
Blood flow normally increases in response to exercise , and the results indicate that caffeine reduces the body 's ability to boost blood flow to the muscle of the heart on demand .
The ratio of exercise blood flow to resting blood flow , called the myocardial flow reserve , was 22 percent lower in the group at normal air pressure after ingesting caffeine and 39 percent lower in the group in the high - altitude chamber .
Dr. Kaufmann said that caffeine may block certain receptors in the walls of blood vessels , interfering with the normal process by which adenosine signals blood vessels to dilate in response to the demands of physical activity .
" Although these findings seem not to have a clinical importance in healthy volunteers , they may raise safety questions in patients with reduced coronary flow reserve , as seen in coronary artery disease , particularly before physical exercise and at high - altitude exposure , " the researchers wrote .
Although caffeine is a stimulant , these results also indicate that coffee may not necessarily boost athletic performance .

" We now have good evidence that , at the level of myocardial blood flow , caffeine is not a useful stimulant .
It may be a stimulant at the cerebral level in terms of being more awake and alert , which may subjectively give the feeling of having better physical performance .
But I now would not recommend that any athlete drink caffeine before sports .
It may not be a physical stimulant , and may even adversely affect physical performance , " Dr. Kaufmann said .
" It may not be as harmless as we thought before , particularly if you suffer from coronary artery disease or if you are in the mountains . "
Dr. Kaufmann noted that this study was not designed to measure athletic performance .
Although the participants were all healthy , Dr. Kaufmann said that the results raise concerns about possible effects of caffeine in people with heart disease .
" Any advice would be based on results of healthy volunteers and would be a bit speculative ; nevertheless , my advice would be : do not drink coffee before doing physical activities .
We hope to be able to provide data soon on the situation of patients with coronary artery disease , " he said .
The researchers noted that other studies of coffee and heart disease have produced mixed results .
Although this study included only 18 participants , the researchers said that the differences they saw were large enough for them to be confident that the effect of caffeine on heart muscle blood flow is real .
They pointed out that longer studies of people with heart disease will be needed in order to understand whether the blood flow effects have important health consequences .
advertisement
Thomas H. Schindler , M.D. from the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA in Los Angeles , California , who was not connected with this study , said that if the results are confirmed , they could have important implications .
" In particular , this may play an important role in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease in the intermediate range between 50 percent and 85 percent narrowing of the epicardial luminal diameter .
In this range of coronary artery disease - induced epicardial narrowing , the myocardial flow reserve ( MFR ) has been widely assumed to compensate for the epicardial narrowing and , thereby , to preserve the myocardial blood flow to the heart .
A further reduction of the MFR , for example owing to caffeine intake , therefore could precipitate stress - induced myocardial ischemia , angina pectoris ( reflecting an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand ) or could also contribute to the manifestation of acute coronary syndromes .
Consequently , as stated by Namdar et al. , the current findings indeed raise safety questions in patients with already reduced MFR as seen in coronary artery disease , particularly before physical exercise and at high - altitude exposure , " Dr. Schindler said .
Dr. Schindler said that further studies will be needed to answer the important questions raised by this study .

CPS gives Scientologists same legal protection as mainstream religions
The Crown Prosecution Service has decided that anyone who attacks Scientology can be prosecuted under faith hate laws .
The move will for the first time provide the controversial Church of Scientology – described by some as a cult – the same protection as other mainstream religions .
Critics of the organisation , whose members include Tom Cruise and John Travolta , attacked the decision last night , saying it would encourage Scientologists to push for official recognition in Britain .
Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes are two of the highest profile followers of scientology
The Mail on Sunday understands the CPS passed down the guidance after it received legal advice from the Treasury Counsel to regard the group as a religion alongside Christianity , Judaism and Islam .
It means that any alleged offenders who ‘ abuse ’ or ‘ threaten ’ the Church of Scientology can be charged under the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 .
It is understood the decision was made this month after the Police Diversity Directorate asked the CPS to clarify its position on the organisation .
It follows the arrest last summer of a 15 - year - old boy for calling Scientology a ‘ dangerous cult ’ during a demonstration outside the Church ’s £ 23 million headquarters in London .
Scientology , which was founded by the sci - fi author L. Ron Hubbard in the Fifties and teaches that humans are immortal spiritual beings known as Thetans , has long been accused of using dubious methods to recruit members .
As far back as July 1968 , it was described in Parliament by a Government Minister as an organisation that has ‘ authoritarian principles and practices ’ that are a ‘ potential menace to the personality and wellbeing of those so deluded as to become its followers ’ .
Ian Harris , founder of the Cult Information Centre , said last night : ‘ Scientology has always wanted to be recognised as a religion but it does n’t even have a God .
This decision is news to me and it is frankly quite upsetting and shocking .
‘ The Church of Scientology will be delighted and will want to use this to give themselves more credibility . ’
A CPS spokesman said : ‘ It is ultimately for the courts to decide how to interpret legislation . ’
Graeme Wilson , public affairs director for The Church of Scientology in the UK , said last night : ‘ Scientology is the chosen religion of millions of people around the world , a point which has been recognised by numerous governmental bodies . ’
The European principalities of Andorra and Liechtenstein pledged to relax their bank - secrecy laws , yielding to international pressure on tax havens to stop shielding the holdings of the rich .
The moves raise the stakes for big tax - haven centers such as Switzerland to take similar steps before the coming meeting of the Group of 20 developed and emerging nations in London .
Offshore tax evasion is expected to be a topic at the April 2 summit .

A coalition of Irish ISPs has rebuffed the music industry 's attempts to force a " three strikes " disconnection policy on all of Ireland 's major internet providers .
The ISP group sent an open letter to the Irish Recorded Music Association ( IRMA ) on Friday , calling recent legal threats against them " spurious , " stating they wo n't ignore established privacy law to aide the music industry 's campaign against illegal music swappers .
In late February , IRMA sent letters to Ireland 's internet service providers ( and unrelated internet firms ) demanding they implement a French - style " three strikes " rule and universally block websites the music industry claims give illegal access to copyrighted music like The Pirate Bay .
IRMA represents the " big four " labels : EMI , Sony - BMG , Universal , and Warner .
The letters warned that Eircom , Ireland 's largest internet provider , had already agreed to its demands as part of an out of lawsuit settlement deal .
Eircom also agreed not to oppose any court action taken by the labels in the future .
After weeks of silence on the issue , the Internet Service Providers in Ireland ( ISPAI ) released a statement of position saying they 're under no legal obligation to follow IRMA 's orders .
Privacy of user communications is protected in European and Irish legislation .
ISPs can not be expected to ignore these merely because it does not suit another private party .
To do so would breach the privacy of our users as well as having serious implications for the continued location of international e-business in this country and the jobs these generate .
According to ISPAI 's website the org 's members include BT Ireland , O2 , Verizon Ireland , Vodafone , Clearwire , Google Ireland , UPC Ireland , and ... Eircom .
The letter states the ISPAI board of directors and general manager consulted with its members , who voted on a majority basis to approve the position statement .
ISPAI 's letter says its members have never condoned the use of their internet services for theft of copyrighted material and will continue to operate " within the existing legal framework " to take actions where appropriate .
The group also adds this barb :
ISPAI is disappointed that the great potential of the internet , to provide opportunities to connect with users in new ways and develop new business models , is being missed by the music recording industry .
The Internet has revolutionised countless other services where consumers have benefited from any - time accessibility , wider choice and reduced prices .

Is there anything in this world that billionaire Richard Branson is n't interested in ?
The British tycoon already has over 360 ventures under the control his Virgin Group , and he may soon add another .
According to an unnamed spokesperson for Honda , Branson is in discussions , along with other unknown interested parties , to purchase the erstwhile Formula 1 team that was formerly part of a factory - backed effort from the Japanese automaker .
The 2009 F1 season begins in Australia on March 29 , and officials for the ex-Honda racing team have been under frantic negotiations to get their stars aligned and cars on the starting grid ever since Honda announced it was pulling its support from the team late last year .
Current speculation suggests that the team may use engines from Mercedes - Benz , though a decision on the team 's fate would need to be made as quickly as possible .
F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone has said that he 's personally spoken with Branson about the possibility and has offered public support for Virgin 's bid .

To successfully manage your time you have to get organized both in your professional and personal life .
Getting organized in an efficient way is a skill that not all people have .
To manage your life and work you need to first manage your time .
In our days people spend most of their time working .
There are times that they feel that they will never manage to escape from the four walls of the office and are lost in the various projects and tasks they have to finish .
Their personal life has become an old memory , which has been « locked in the drawer » .
The solution to this vicious circle is one : get organized and start managing your time .
This article outlines 14 ways that can help you manage your time successfully and efficiently .
1 . Make a list of what should be done
Make a list of what to do and try to constantly renew the list and keep it up to date .
Include in this list both urgent and non-urgent things so as never forget or ignore something again .
Keep the list all the time with you , in your briefcase or in your daily agenda .
2. Allocate your time correctly
Include an estimated time frame for each action and the date by which each task must be completed .
If the order that each task must be completed does not matter it may be possible to complete something during an unexpected free time .
For example , you can look for information on the Internet while you wait in your office to start a meeting .
3 . Set your own deadlines and meet them
Be realistic about the deadlines you set and try to meet them .
It is true that any work gets exactly the time allocated for it .
Have you ever noticed how quickly you can finish something you have to write , give assignments and take decisions on the last day before your vacation ?
Although we tend to complete many things when we are under pressure , is less stressful and much more professional to establish and follow an action plan .
4 . Use your time intelligently
Consider the case to check your e-mail only certain times of the day and let the answering machine respond to your calls so as not to interrupt your work for a couple of hours .
If possible , avoid dealing with the same job or the same e-mail again .
Never open e-mail address if you do not have time to read and edit , that is , to answer it , send , or delete it .
5 . Organize your desktop
Organize your desktop ; manage the copies of your files , your computer folders and e-mail folders so that you can easily find what you want .
Minimize the time you spend when searching for information .
Benjamin Franklin once said : « A place for everything , everything in place » .
6 . Insist in your targets
You should have an “ in tray ” in your office so that others can give you what they want to give you and not just leave it on your desk .
Have you ever come back from a meeting and find additional records , letters and documents all over your office ?
Rather than follow your own program , you are “ forced ” to follow someone else ’s priorities .
7 . Do not distract your attention
If you have a door , you need to close it occasionally .
If you have an open door policy that must always be open for your employees , but if you do not have time to really listen to their questions and concerns , then you will not manage to keep your promise .
If a colleague comes to your office when you have a job and cannot discuss , seek to find another time to meet .
8. Co-operate with your colleagues
Colleagues will expect you to finish the job on time , so make sure to avoid any delay .
You would expect the same from them .
To avoid any delays , give more time to the project so as to be able to handle unexpected complications , misunderstandings or missed deadlines .
If the date of presentation is the 25th of the month , be sure to plan to finish everything by 23 .
9. Avoid unnecessary Supervisions
If you authorize someone else for a job or a contract , do not deal any more with this , unless you have a specific responsibility to monitor .
Many people spend precious time to listen or read reports of other projects .
If the investigation of your colleagues or their professional responsibilities does not affect your daily work , your performance at work or objectives of your career , you could simply express an interest just to encourage them .
10 . Cancel routine meetings
Decide if the meeting is absolutely necessary .
If , you have to attend , set an agenda and make sure that you follow it – start the meeting and finish it on time .
If your presence is not necessary for the entire meeting then leave earlier .
11 . Be constantly busy
Keep your skills in shape by having at least one project to be involved .
Two or more ( projects ) would be even better because you are given the opportunity to « change speed » and to focus on something else for variety .
To deal simultaneously with different project assures that you will always have something on which to work .
Also , it keeps your mind alert and renews your prospects .
12 . Choose carefully your projects
Make sure that your work has some value for the company and that it raises your skills .
There are many good reasons why you cannot accept to take part in a meeting and refuse to take an additional project .
Successful entrepreneurs know how to say « no » .
Ask yourself , « this will promote my career ? » and « Can I give the necessary time to this assignment ? ”
You will win more respect by working with a colleague , whose expertise and skills complements your own , rather than getting an extra work on your own and overloading yourself .
13 .
Do not waste your time
It is an integral part of human nature to postpone unpleasant tasks .
Plan some of the more pleasant tasks of the project to be made after any unpleasant tasks .
If you do not like to work with numbers , plan to do the accounts in the morning when you are still fresh and there are not so many things to distract your attention .
14 . Reward yourself
To manage your time efficiently does not have to do only with your job .
You should also include in your schedule time where you stop everything , relax and recharge your batteries .
Thing of a reward to give yourself when you finish your work .
This may mean to make a break for coffee once finished reading a long report or to leave for vacation just after the promotion of the new product .
You must give greater attention to how you spend your time .
Watch how successful businessmen allocate their time and emulate some of their time management practices .
Success comes to those who know how to manage their time well .
I am ardently hoping that one of the MEPs who will replace me at the forthcoming European elections might look at this and be better prepared than I was when started researching this subject nearly ten years ago .
This article 's purpose is to take you through the jargon and the boredom of the “ Budget Discharge ” process .
I want to explain which questions I ask , and why , and explain why I think this process deserves a lot more attention from the press and MEPs than it currently gets .
The plain fact is this : the Court of Auditors has no power over the EU Budget .
I 'll say that again : the headlines you have read every year about accounts " not being signed off " refer to an institution with no real power .
The European Parliament , by contrast , has genuine power here .
If the Parliament refuses to grant discharge ( " discharge " means a positive approval of the accounts ) then whilst the Commission is not compelled to resign , a considerable amount of pressure would be imposed on it to sort out the problems within its accounts and accounting systems once and for all .…
What most people probably do n't know - and what never gets reported - is that after the Court of Auditors gives it 's opinion ( normally there are a few headlines - see here and here for some recent examples ) a long process starts , which lasts 9 months and gives MEPs the power to look into every Eurocent that the Commission has spent in the previous year .
I am talking about the perennial story of the European Commission 's accounts not being signed off – this time for the 14th consecutive year .
There is one thing that everybody seems to know about Europe .
And it is quite shocking that considering everyone 's knowledge of the problem , that no one seems to care about a solution ; or indeed care at all .
Chris Heaton - Harris is currently an MEP for the East Midlands , and will be standing down at June 's European election to concentrate on his role as prospective parliamentary candidate for Daventry , where Tim Boswell is standing down .
He is a member of the European Parliament 's Budgetary Control Committee .
Last year he wrote a rough guide to the contents of the EU budget .
Article 274 of the Treaties essentially states that the European Commission is responsible for the money it spends on behalf of the European taxpayer - " The Commission shall implement the budget , in accordance with the provisions of the regulations made pursuant to Article 279 , on its own responsibility and within the limits of the appropriations , having regard to the principles of sound financial management . " .
The Commission 's accounting year runs from 1st January to 31st December .
As you would expect , there is a process by which the Commission 's accounts are checked , first internally by its own accounting staff and then by external and independent auditors - the European Court of Auditors - after the financial year ends to ensure that money has been spent correctly .
The European Court of Auditors thus checks random samples of transactions to ensure that the processes and accounting systems are solid and work .
After the accounts close for a financial year , say 2007 , the European Court of Auditors complete all their various checks and then write their report .
This gets sent to the European Commission who argue over what the Court has written in what is called the " contradictory procedure " .
Simultaneously the heads of each Commission Department ( known as Directorates - General ) sign a letter where they say either that ' everything is fine ' within their DG , or that they would like to express ' reservations ' in certain areas .
These comments are made available to the European Parliament in a report so mind - numbingly boring that very , very few MEPs actually read it .
The Court of Auditors ' report on the Commission 's accounting year 2007 was published in early November 2008 .
It is 304 pages long ( it can be found here if you are feeling particularly masochistic today ) and for the 14th year running it failed to give a “ positive statement of assurance ” ( i.e. it did n't sign off ) the European Commission 's accounts .
Actually , even this statement is amazingly difficult to find within the report .
It seems that even the European Court of Auditors is embarrassed by constantly having to not sign off the Commission ’s accounts .
The European Parliament 's role
As soon as the Court of Auditors publishes its report a debate is held in the plenary session of the European Parliament .
After this the Budgetary Control Committee take the report , questions various European Commissioners about the accounts of their Directorates - General and then , generally in March , vote on whether the Parliament should " grant the discharge " or not .
The Parliament has never voted to NOT grant discharge .
Just to be clear : every year , for the past 14 years , the Court of Auditors have refused to sign the accounts off .
And every year the elected representatives in the European Parliament say " carry on , chaps " .
Last year , on 24th April 2008 , Labour and Liberal Democrat MEPs voted - as usual - to let this farce carry on .
Conservatives MEPs voted against , numbering over half the entire opposition in the Parliament ( it was passed by 582 votes to 49 ) .
The whole of the EPP - ED , with the honourable exception of Gabriele Stauner MEP , voted to grant discharge .
And for those who think UKIP are the ones who stand up to this kind of fraud and waste , at one of the most important votes of the year only 3 of UKIP 's current MEPs bothered to even show up .
Concurrently there is also a debate in the European Council between the Member State Finance Ministers - Alistair Darling would have attended this year ’s back in November and the results of this discussion are reported back to the Budgetary Control Committee - about whether the European Council agree that the accounts should be signed off .
This debate rarely lasts longer than a few hours and very few countries seem to care .
Rarely does anyone question why money cannot be accounted for correctly , let alone propose not rubber - stamping the accounts .
Credit here should go to the Dutch Government , who a few years ago decided to take a stand against the waste of their citizens ' hard - earned cash .
Alas , the same cannot be said of the British Government .
In all the time that Gordon Brown was Chancellor of the Exchequer , neither he nor his Department ever raised any questions about the state of the Commission 's accounts in these meetings .
He nodded the accounts through along with everyone else .
The amount of money that is estimated to go missing each year is varies between £ 3bn and £ 8bn and that roughly corresponds to the UK's net contribution to the EU every year - surely any prudent Government should be demanding better controls ?
Alas , the Court of Auditors bowed to political pressure a long time back and no longer gives a percentage figure as to how much money it thinks is spent incorrectly or wastefully and so for years now , we have not had any solid figures to work with .
People who have stood up and asked questions
At this point I think we should have a short , but important , history lesson .
Back in the late 1990 ’s a low - ranking European Commission official called Paul Van Buitenen noticed a number of things happening in and around his office that he was uncomfortable with .
His story is well documented and indeed , he wrote an excellent account of what happened to him in a book called “ Blowing the Whistle ” ( available from Amazon ) but to sum it up , instead of his superiors helping sort out the problems that he found , he was harried out of his job , he and his family were followed in the street , bullied and threatened by officials to the extent that his wife had a nervous breakdown .
Van Buitenen was a stronger man that the Commission officials who were trying to break him had bargained for and he contacted a number of MEPs , including Edward McMillan - Scott , who helped bring his case into the public domain .
This scandal broke at the same time as a number of other smaller scandals within the Commission came to light and the resulting wave of news stories encouraged the European Parliament of the time to threaten the Commission with censure .
Unable to cope with the pressure of possible censure , on March 15th , 1999 , the European Commission fell .
The complete European Commission resigned .
And at that point absolute panic set in , for no one knew what to do !
Captains of industry were concerned as to who was regulating them ; Government leaders were in a quandary , the next Commission was due to come in within a few months and whilst there were attempts to try and speed up the process of bringing in a new Commission , it was proving impossible for the institutions to move any quicker and thus the Santer Commission decided to stay on – it would not make any decisions , but would keep the machinery of European administration well oiled so any future Commission could hit the ground running .
Whilst Euro sceptics across Europe were celebrating the demise of the Commission , many of those who were keen to drive European integration forward were stunned , angry and determined to never allow this to happen again .
All of a sudden , the boring budget discharge procedure had become very political indeed .
Reform of the EU Accounts was demanded from all sides – although not for the same reasons .
Some were calling for this to protect European taxpayers ' money ; most , however , because they realised that the fraud and waste was becoming a barrier ( both in political and PR terms ) to closer European integration .
So , in the European Elections of June 1999 most of the major political parties across Europe and all of the main political parties in the UK had similar passages in their European election manifestos , promising to clear up the mess in the European accounts and when the long awaited new Commission came into power , under the leadership of Romano Prodi , it promised the same - even laying out a five point plan for greater accountability of the Commission .
Despite the Santer Commission resigning in disgrace , four of it's Commissioners - 20 % - were immediately re-appointed .
One of these , a certain Neil Kinnock , was installed as Vice President of the Commission in charge of “ Administrative Reform ” .
Alongside Michaela Schreyer , the new Budget Commissioner from Germany , he was charged with sorting out the Commission 's accounts .
These appointments were regarded as recognition that restoring the public 's trust in the Commission and its accounts was top priority .
Commissioner Kinnock started with gusto and as you would have expected , made lots of long speeches preparing the ground for the tough work ahead :
" With reform , we will help to build from good performance to the excellence that the European public deserves and Commission people want to provide "
" Reform and renewal are essential ... for the purpose of enlargement …
The really hard work starts now "
And so on .
Commissioner Schreyer started more quietly , but seemed resolute in trying to come to terms with her Department .
There were some problems for her there – the Head of her DG , Mr JP Mingasson , was the ultimate encapsulation of a brilliant but arrogant male French civil servant – called the Budget Discharge process “ an inter- institutional game ” which was an inconvenience and distraction for all in his department .
The emphasis was to spend money ( huge surpluses had been building ) , not to be held to account for it !
Meanwhile , the majority of MEPs decided that the new Commission should not be held accountable for the mistakes of the past and , probably fairly , they gave the Commission some time to get on with the job of reform .
However , they also were busy changing the rules to ensure that no Commission should ever fall again in such circumstances .
One such change removed the ability of the Parliament to censure individual European Commissioners .
Instead , should the Parliament wish to censure anyone in the future , it would actually have to censure the whole Commission .
This might sound like a minor change ; however it basically removed this weapon ( which previously had been used to scrutinise individual appointments and keep Commissioner in check ) from Parliament 's armoury altogether .
Previously it had been difficult enough to raise the numbers of signatures needed for the censure of an individual Commissioner , as the country from where would ensure that tremendous amounts of political pressure were exerted on those mooting the idea of censure in the first place .
However , now to censure the Commission , you would be attacking every Commissioner from every country .
Remember for a moment that the nomination for these positions is in the gift of the Prime Minister or President in most European countries and that they tend to nominate a close friend or associate – so by attacking these appointees you are essentially taking on the Head of Government of each country in Europe , and thus their political parties and civil servants .
No matter the scandal , I am certain that huge political vested interest will ensure that no Commission could possibly fall in the future .
Not content with this massive safeguard , the Parliament 's own lawyers - its Legal Services - then " clarified " the situation , saying that a negative discharge should n't necessarily lead to the fall of the Commission .
Suddenly , MEPs ' power was massively reduced ; yes , not signing off the accounts would be very embarrassing for the Commission , but it would no longer be a resigning or firing matter .
Having established that the Parliament could say what it liked about the Commission 's accounts without the fear of disrupting ongoing European integration , surely MEPs would now have demanded a stronger line on reform ?
Alas , this ruling seemed to have the reverse effect .
Commissioners Kinnock and Schreyer , certainly between 1999 and the beginning of 2001 tried their hardest to do the jobs they had been given - indeed at the end of 2000 Commissioner Schreyer imposed her choice of candidate for the European Commission 's new Chief Accountant .
Against the recommendations of just about all in her Department , she decided that she wanted to pick a reformer , she wanted to pick someone from outside , but most of all , she wanted to pick a woman .
Only one such candidate suggested herself – Marta Andreasen .
Marta Andreasen started work in the European Commission at the beginning of January 2001 and she was unique ; she was the first fully qualified career accountant that had found themselves in that role .
As such , she will tell you , that she pretty much immediately spotted some problems : the closing balance on 31st December , 2000 did not match with the opening balance the Commission had in it accounts for 1st January , 2001 .
She spotted that the Commission did not use double - entry book - keeping in its budgetary accounts and had huge concerns about the accounting system on which the Commission ran its accounts .
It would later transpire that in many areas the Commission did not use audit trails – so it could not exactly say that the correct amount of money was going to the correct person for work done .
I later tabled Written Question , asking when the Commission would start to use standard double - entry bookkeeping in its accounting system .
The Commission ’s answer basically said that they do n’t use it .
“ The budgetary accounts , and the execution of the budget , are based on single entry , as is the case for most public administrations , which find little value - added in recording the use of appropriations in double - entry .
This is in accordance with the Financial Regulation , which does not require the use of double entry for the budgetary accounting . ”
In fact Andreasen found a whole bunch of problems .
Coming from outside the European Institutions she was not yet swallowed up by the cultural treacle of the reporting system , which positively discouraged reporting of problems .
Andreasen started to ask questions of her superior , Jean - Paul Mingasson .
He was simply irritated by her and ignored her .
Andreasen began to get seriously concerned and within a couple of months was threatening to withhold payments from the Commission as she was unsure as to where the money might end up .
It was here that the proverbial hit the fan .
Andreasen was summoned by Schreyer , who had now changed from being her strongest supporter to being wary of her – warned off by her services and told that Andreasen was trouble .
At this meeting Andreasen told the Commissioner of the problems she had found and promised to draw up a report .
Schreyer agreed this and off Andreasen went .
However there were many now in the Commission who had had enough of her making waves , and briefings against her started to be heard by Commissioner Kinnock , the Vice President of the Commission for Administrative Reform .
What happened next was a comedy of errors and a shockingly poor cover up .
Andreasen sent her report full of reforms to her superiors .
It was reviewed by a number of people including the Commission 's Internal Auditor , Jules Muis , who sent some of the most infamous memos about Andreasen ’s report to his bosses :
Mr Muis claimed the Commission 's accounting control systems were " rudimentary " , and complained there were hardly any checks made on the quality of statements made by each department head , which " repetitively opens the Commission to a high level of reputational risk . "
The Commission 's budget department was described as " severely under - resourced " and the weakness of the budget control systems was a cause of " major concern " .
In another he said that the European Commission should only start reforming its accounting practices " if it has a commissioner ... who has the stamina and spine to take a lot of shit and see it through consistently " .
This has to go down as one of the bluntest synopses ever given .
So blunt , in fact , that the Financial Times saw fit to publish it on their front page .
Eventually , those high up in the Commission decided that Andreasen had to go .
She was summoned to a show down with Commissioner Kinnock , where he was meant to remove her from her duties .
He had to do this , as the Commission press service had already placed on the front page of the FT a short article stating that this had happened .
Alas , somehow , Marta Andreasen left that meeting still in post .
As she departed the Commission building to head for the airport and then onto her home in Barcelona , panic was the order of the day in the building she left .
And so , to his eternal shame , an extremely embarrassed Neil Kinnock , the man who took on “ Militant ” in Liverpool and told a Labour Party conference of his shame he felt of the grotesque way Derek Hatton 's council fired workers , by sending their redundancy notices to them by taxis – that very same Neil Kinnock allowed Marta Andreasen 's suspension letter to be faxed to the Airport and be delivered to her at the gate of her departing plane by airport security guards .
I am pretty sure that was exactly the moment that Marta Andreasen chose to share what she had found with a wider public .
Still trying to be professional , she contacted a number of MEPs by letter to raise her concerns .
I am sure many of the others called her back , but I think it is fair to say that I was the only one who followed up what she told me at our initial meeting .
Indeed seven weeks later , on August 1st , 2001 , and after a huge amount of double checking facts and figures , asking many questions etc , it became obvious that the Commission was not interested in “ Reform ” at all , and so Marta 's story splashed on the front page of the FT .
A few weeks later the European Parliament showed its true colours and whilst talking the talk on reforming the accounts , it chose not to allow Marta Andreasen to address the Budgetary Control Committee .
And even after all we all learned from the Commission 's former Chief Accountant about the former year 's accounts , both the Parliament and the Council chose not to raise any concerns and signed off the accounts anyway .
So , have things changed ....?
How bad are the accounts , really ?
There are many myths that surround the state of the European accounts .
Let me state here that they are , absolutely , slowly improving .
Having said that , considering that the accounts have not been signed off for the past 14 years and just about everybody in the world knows what sort of problems that exist within them , it is rather surprising that this process of improvement is taking so long .
The main myth is that the accounts were never that bad in the first place .
Just about every pro-European I have ever met has told me that the state of the accounts of the European Commission is nowhere near as bad as , for example ( and they now always use the same British example ) as the state of the accounts in the Department of Work and Pensions here in the UK .
Well , that quite simply is not true .
However , please do not feel that you have to believe me ; let us look at bits of a presentation made to the Budgetary Control Committee of the EP back in December 2006 by the then President of the European Court of Auditors , Mr Huber .
He said :
" The Court have identified levels of irregular or illegal expenditure which are significantly higher [ than the DWP ] .
These are not one - off results , but rather have been consistent over a number of years .
There is significant and compelling evidence that public funds are not being spent according to the regulations . "
He then re-iterated this in a letter he sent to the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee in the House of Lords , Lord Grenfell at the same time .
So , there you go !
It is actually worse than it seems , as we all know that the Department of Work and Pensions has to deal with millions of smallish transactions every week .
The European Commission , however , deals with significantly fewer transactions and many of these transactions are either Governments at National or regional level .
The one area of expenditure that has the most transactions is also one of the worse for fraud and maladministration – that being the DG for Agriculture and this is what the Court of Auditors Report for 2007 had to say about that :
" the Court concludes that the transactions …are affected by a level of material error of legality and / or regularity .
Rural Development expenditure is particularly prone to errors .
Some two - thirds of errors were classified as ' serious ' .
There was a material incidence of error affecting eligibility , accuracy or occurrence , such that the estimated value of the overall error rate falls into the range from 2 % - 5 % . "
Another myth is when the Commission say , as they always do , that their accounts are in good order .
They then point to the following phrase , which always appears in the Court of Auditors report :
“ Revenue , commitments and payments for ' Administrative and other expenditure ' and ' Economic and financial affairs ' are free from material error . "
Whilst this statement in itself is true , what the Commission do n't like recalling is the following paragraph that also always appears :
“ The other areas of expenditure payments are still materially affected by errors ” .
Essentially what this means is the Commission 's internal spending ( on salaries , other personnel costs etc ) is correct .
That is something you would expect and involves little work to keep under control .
It also accounts for only about 5 % of the budget .
The remaining 95 % of the budget is subject to “ significant errors ( or whatever the quote in the report is ) ” .
Obviously the 95 % of the rest of the budget is harder to police , however the annual attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of the European press on this is quite breath - taking .
The Commission spin doctors , with their annual budget of £ 180 m of your money , work hard to kill the story on day one , as it then becomes “ old news ” and has less chance of being printed a day or two later .
This year 's spin which consisted of a very simple lie : “ EU Budget given clean bill of health ” seemed to do the job quite nicely .
The Discharge Process in action
Throughout the current discharge process several European Commissioners have come before the Budgetary Control Committee in the Parliament and read out long statements that would make watching paint dry seem extremely interesting .
They already have a good idea of what areas of concern the members of the Committee have , as a detailed questionnaire is sent by MEPs to the relevant Commissioner a month or so in advance .
This is always answered in detail and the answers mean you know roughly whether you have touched a nerve or not .
As a rule of thumb , the closer to the meeting you get the answers and the longer the answer that you are given is , the closer to finding a problem you are .
There is then , before the whole Committee , a twenty minute or so exchange of views between the Parliament 's “ Rapporteur ” ( the author of the report by which the Parliament grants discharge ) .
This year a delightful Frenchman called Jean - Pierre Audy has the honour of letting the Commission off scot - free .
Of course the mood music in the Committee in these hearings is very different – a charade is acted out ( as in every single one of the other ten years I have seen this process through ) where the Rapporteur acts as though he / she is still considering whether or not he will recommend a positive discharge .
I very much doubt whether William Hill will be taking any bets on this one !
Twice I have tried to become the Rapporteur of the Discharge report myself .
I thought it might spice up the life of the Parliament a bit and knew full well that my fellow MEPs would , had I been given this report , have changed absolutely everything that I wrote when it came to the final vote .
However both times , my own political group - yes , the EPP - ED , who have a remarkably poor track record of action in this area , did everything they possibly could to ensure I did n't get the report .
Then , after the Rapporteur 's pleasant questioning , other members of the Committee are allowed to question the Commissioners .
To be fair to them , the Commissioners normally answer these questions honestly , but the word “ tame ” really could have been invented for this part of the exchange .
Anyone who has ever seen a Minister get a grilling in the House of Commons would be extremely underwhelmed at the EU version of Parliamentary oversight .
After all this , the Rapporteur will draw up his report .
It is normally critical of the Commission in the areas where concerns have been raised by the Court of Auditors , MEPs or the Commission itself ; but always recommends a positive discharge
There follows the normal parliamentary process for a report , with a debate in committee , amendments being tabled and a vote in committee , before the whole thing goes for a plenary debate and then a final vote of the whole House .
And usually , by the end of March , the Commission 's accounts are signed off once again , and the problems mentioned by the Court of Auditors all those months ago have once more been filed away somewhere and quietly forgotten .
Just as a final thought , in case something went so seriously wrong , that all the other changes to its procedure failed to safeguard the Commission , the Parliament made one final change to its rules .
This change actually meant that the Parliament , even if it wanted to not sign off the accounts , actually could not ; in fact the worse thing it can do now is postpone the Discharge for six months at this stage .
Thus giving the Commission and national governments plenty of breathing space to lean on any troublesome MEPs who might be asking too many questions .
Plenty of people here in Brussels will tell you that the Commission can't exert political influence .
Well , they need reminding that Members of the Commission are normally politicians , and all are members of partisan political parties .
From 1999 to 2004 , German CSU MEP Gabrielle Stauner was one of my biggest supporters in the Budgetary Control Committee .
She had a track record or both talking and acting tough on fraud and maladministration and for asking tough questions .
Alas , when it came to her reselection for the CSU list in 2004 , she found herself too far down it to be elected .
Fortunately for her she is now back in Parliament , but she keeps well away from budgetary controversy now - and who can blame her ?
Then and only then , after discharge has been postponed for 6 months , can the accounts be refused by the Parliament .
You can work out for yourselves what the chances of that ever happening are .
So what 's the point , then ?
If this all sounds a bit negative and a bit depressing , there actually is hope .
This is a process where MEPs get unparalleled access to the accounts of the Commission and the Parliament .
We can ask as many questions on as many subjects as we like , and this is where we can really try to deliver on our promise to root out fraud and malpractice .
We can also deliver on our promise to work for better value for taxpayers - highlighting examples of wasteful spending , and opening up what is generally a closed shop .
And there are some obvious clues to look for when investigating if something is wrong .
Things tend to go wrong in the areas on big contracts , even those open to open tender and especially those connected to property ; procurement – one day we will all find out how many computers lie in the cellar of the European Fundamental Rights Agency in Vienna ; where people from the same nationality gather in key positions in a single department or Agency and you should always ask each individual department if any people in key posts have been “ sick ” for prolonged periods ( this tends to indicate either lax management or alas more normally , where individuals like Paul Van Buitenen are scared or bullied into going sick . )
Alas , the problem with the European Commission is that you can change as many systems as you like ; if you do not change the culture of the institution , you might as well burn taxpayers ’ money .
Finally , I must mention in passing the ultimate check and balance : OLAF , the anti-fraud office of the EU .
They were set up back in 1999 when the Santer Commission fell and have been , well bloody useless since their inception .
Whilst set up to investigate “ internal ” fraud matters , they prefer the more sexy role they have been given of chasing cigarette smugglers for VAT exemption .
They will remain a hopeless organisation until they are made independent of the Commission – they currently are a part of the Budget Department and are very wary of upsetting their paymaster .
So that is it !
There is still so much to do and realistically I have not achieved much of what I would have liked to in this area .
Perhaps after the European Elections the Conservative delegation will once again make these issues a priority , and that at least a few of our new MEPs really get to grips with the Budgetary Control Committee .
If we are serious about reforming Europe , we have to take the advice of the most famous whistleblower of all - and " follow the money " .
And look out for the lack of headlines at the end of this month , when yet again the European Parliament signs off the Commission ’s accounts in Plenary in Strasbourg – oh , and guess which way the EPP MEPs will be voting !

Google has come out with its own browser and called it Chrome so I thought I ’d look into chrome as a word .
First of all I think many people know that Google as a company took its name in error , based a made - up name for a large number .
Edward Kasner was an American mathematician who once asked his nine year old nephew Milton Sirotta what he thought a really big number should be called .
Milton said googol and that an even bigger number should be called googolplex .
So these are now the names of two numbers .
Googol is 1×10 100 ( that ’s 1 with 100 zeros after it )
( that ’s 1 with 100 zeros after it ) Googolplex is 1×10googol
The founders of Google Sergey Brin and Larry Page knew the internet was big and so chose googol for their name ; except , like me , they were n’t perfect spellers .
There the similarity ends .
Anyway , on to chrome .
Like Google itself the origins of chrome touch on a rags - to - riches story .
I ’m not sure why Google named its new browser Chrome but here are some thoughts .
Google has been pretty supportive of the browser Firefox and buried within any Firefox installation there is a folder called chrome and in that folder there is a file called userchrome .
Within the userchrome file it says
“ This file can be used to customize the look of Mozilla ’s user interface . ”
Wired Magazine says chrome is
“ the term used to describe the frame , toolbars , and menus bordering a browser window ”
and a Wikipedia article on Graphical User Interface says that
“ the visible … features of an application are sometimes referred to as chrome . ”
So chrome denotes “ the look ” of things .
I find further support for this “ look ” meaning from Google themselves .
In one of the YouTube videos issued to promote the new browser project manager Brian Rakowski says :
“ From top to bottom we designed the interface to make sure that it was as efficient and as clean as possible .
We argued over every single pixel in the chrome of Chrome to make sure there was nothing wasted . ”
So from that “ chrome of Chrome ” you might expect that Google wants Chrome to be the new look of the internet .
But Google does n’t do something for nothing and there is a slang meaning to chrome that might apply too .
To most people chrome denotes a shiny mirror - like finish on metal .
One metal object in particular gave the word chrome a slang meaning ; that object is a handgun .
I can’t find a date for a first citation where chrome meant “ gun ” but I see it in many Urbandictionary entries as well as in Tony Thorne ’s Dictionary of Contemporary Slang .
Software applications that become really popular are called killer apps so perhaps chrome as “ gun ” fits there with Google ’s hopes for it .
But it ’s the logo that Google has chosen for Chrome that points to chrome ’s etymology .
It ’s Google ’s corporate blue , red , yellow and green .
There is n’t a metallic look to it at all ; it ’s more a plastic look .
In 1797 a French chemist by the name of Louis - Nicolas Vauquelin isolated chromium as an element .
He noticed that compounds that contained chromium had especially vibrant color and so he chose as the name for this new element the Greek word for “ color ” khroma .
Other chemists liked Latin better than Greek which is why we call the stuff chromium ; it sounds more Latin .
Google is also offering the source code for its new browser for others to use .
By amazing coincidence the open - source project name is chromium .
So maybe Google thinks mixing its new browser with other elements of the web will give the internet more vivid color — figuratively speaking of course .
I said there was a rags to riches story in here somewhere .
Louis - Nicolas Vauquelin ’s parents were French peasants but Louis - Nicolas was lucky enough to be apprenticed in what we ’d now call a drug store or pharmacy .
This highlighted his natural genius for chemistry and he went on to become one of the first professors to make lab work part of an education .
Instead of just talking about how chemicals reacted with each other , he got them to actually mix the stuff up and see for themselves .

Horrifying video of militants beheading Polish engineer is released by Pakistani Taliban
A shocking new video that appears to show Pakistani militants beheading a kidnapped Polish engineer has emerged .
The seven - minute video appears to show the Polish hostage , Piotr Stanczak , sitting on the floor flanked by two masked men .
Off camera , a militant briefly engages him in conversation before three others behead him .
The video is so horrifying that some news wire agencies chose not to distribute the images .
This frame grab from video footage released by Pakistani Taliban militants shows kidnapped Polish geologist Piotr Stanczak minutes before he was beheaded
One of the hooded men then addresses the camera , blaming Pakistan for the killing for not agreeing to their demands to release Taliban prisoners .
If confirmed , Stanczak 's death would appear to be the first killing of a Western hostage in Pakistan since U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl was beheaded in 2002 .
The video was given to an Associated Press reporter yesterday in north - western Pakistan on a flash drive by an intermediary who said he obtained it from the Taliban .
Jacek Cichocki , Polish minister for security services , said he saw the full video and in his opinion ' that is the Pole and the film is authentic . '
' I can say that watching the film last night , it is a terrible thing , ' he told Poland 's TVN24 television , adding final confirmation would have to wait until diplomatic and consular services receive the body .
Piotr Adamkiewicz , a spokesman at the Polish Embassy in Islamabad , said today the mission was still waiting for some formal communication from the Pakistani government .
Terror : Stanczak in another shot taken from the video moments before his death
' They are not providing us with any information at all , ' he said .
Pakistani Interior Ministry spokesman Shahidullah Baig said yesterday that the government was investigating the existence of the video .
Violence in Pakistan and Afghanistan has soared since U.S. - led forces ousted the Taliban regime in Afghanistan in 2001 .
Many militants fled across the border to Pakistan , establishing bases and continuing to attack U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan .
President Barack Obama has made resolving the Afghan war a key focus of his foreign policy strategy , appointing heavyweight diplomat Richard Holbrooke as a special representative to Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Holbrooke , who was the White House envoy to the Balkans in the Kosovo conflict , was due to visit Pakistan from Monday to Thursday , according to the Pakistani Foreign Ministry .
At a security conference in Germany over the weekend , Holbrooke described the Afghan campaign as ' one theatre of war straddling an ill - defined border . '
' We have to think of it that way and not distinguish between the two , ' he said .
The U.S. Embassy said this morning that Holbrooke was not yet in Pakistan , declining to reveal exactly when he would arrive .
A spokesman for the Taliban in north - western Pakistan said Saturday that they killed the Polish captive because the government missed a deadline to release 26 prisoners .
Armed men pulled Stanczak from his car on September 28 after killing three Pakistanis traveling with him near the city of Attock in northwestern Pakistan .
Stanczak was surveying oil and gas fields for Geofizyka Krakow , a Polish geophysics institute .
John Solecki , the American U.N. official , was seized February 2 in Quetta in Baluchistan province as he traveled to work at the offices of the U.N. refugee agency there .
His driver was shot to death .
Quetta chief investigator Wazir Khan Nasir said a previously unknown ethnic Baluch separatist group called the Baluchistan Liberation United Front telephoned a local journalist Saturday to claim responsibility .
Pakistan - based Online International News Network quoted a spokesman for the front as saying Solecki was kidnapped to highlight the Baluch campaign for independence .
The group has demanded the release of 141 Baluch women allegedly detained by Pakistani authorities and that the U.N. ' solve the issue of Baluchistan under the Geneva Convention , ' he said .
The natural gas - rich region is home to a decades - long insurgency , but Westerners had never been targeted before .
Also today , a suicide bomber rammed his truck into a security checkpoint near the Bannu area outside the volatile northwest tribal regions , wounding 17 people in the blast , police official Tahir Dawar said .

Having watched the original series since my early childhood one of my early disappointments in life was the 1979 film Star Trek : The Motion Picture :
You have to understand for me this was like Beatles getting back together again , but then producing a bad disco album .
So it ’s not surprising that I ’ve blocked most of my memories associated with that “ film ” out of mind .
But one thing that that the Paramount marketing dept .
got right was the merchandising , and in this case I had forgotten that fast food giant McDonald ’s had created a series of Star Trek themed Happy Meals to coincide with the film .
Shown above and below are commercials that promoted fast food for Star Fleet officers in training .
Each Star Trek Happy
Meals box art included comic strips and trading cards that you could cut out .
The comic strip artwork was by illustrator Ron Villani who had quite a bit of fun with his subject matter :
But best of all each Happy Meal included a special toy communicator which included a comic strip that you could scroll through :
Health chiefs have agreed the controversial move of adding fluoride to the water supply of 195,000 people in Southampton and and South Hampshire .
Southampton Primary Care
Trust argues it is the only way to reduce tooth decay in children across the city .
But campaigners fear fluoride could have health risks , saying adding it to tap water amounts to mass medication .
Five million people in England and Wales have been drinking water with added fluoride for several decades .
But other water companies refused to add the chemical until its safety had been resolved .
Now the Department of Health is putting pressure on the NHS to use powers under the Water Act 2003 to demand water companies add the chemical .
In Southampton , four in every 10 children have a filling by the time they start school .
Dentist Ragini Ramchandani says some parents fail to brush their children 's teeth properly .
Not even giving out free toothpaste has helped .
She said : " Dental health has improved in Southampton over the last 40 years .
A lot of that is due to fluoridated toothpaste .
" But what has not improved is the inequalities between people with good and poor dental health .
That gap has not closed at all . "
But independent experts at York University have concluded there is only limited evidence that adding fluoride to water reduces decay .
And it warns any benefit comes at the cost of increasing the number of children developing mottled teeth from consuming too much fluoride .
The uncertain scientific evidence has led to an angry debate between those for and against fluoride .
Jo -Anne Carey ensures her two children brush their teeth properly twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste .
She does n't want an additional - and unregulated - dose in the tap water .
" What is this toxin going to do in the body for the next 40 years ?
It 's cumulative .
It sits in the tissue and grows .
" Nobody knows what it can do .
So I say err on the side of caution and do n't put it in the water . "
The decision on whether to give Southampton Primary Care Trust was taken by the regional health authority .
Campaigners claim the public consultation has been a sham and that NHS South Central bowed to pressure from the Department of Health .
But chief executive Jim Easton insists the decision was taken based on the evidence .
" Let me be very clear .
We have received no direct or indirect pressure from the Department of Health , ministers or senior officials to make a decision one way or the other . "
Fr. Thomas Berg , LC , directs
The Westchester Institute for Ethics & the Human Person
, a think - tank specializing in exploring and responding out of the wisdom of the Church to vexing moral , especially medical - moral , issues .
Fr. Berg has just issued a short , superb statement regarding the Maciel debacle
.
Read it carefully first , so as to better follow my observations on it .
Notice : Instead of oblique references , Berg calls Maciel by his full name and title ; Berg expressly identifies the grave offenses which he now knows Maciel to have committed , and he makes no claims , for or against , the possibility of other crimes which have not been disclosed to him .
Berg issues no cost - free , third - party apologies for things he ( Berg ) did not do , but instead expresses his profound personal sorrow for the victims of Maciel .
Berg has no power to make material reparations to the victims , but he has pledged the power of his priestly prayers and personal penances on their behalf .
Berg recognizes that the Maciel crisis is not simply some sort of internal Legion imbroglio , but a crisis for the whole Church .
Berg clearly understands what " communion of the saints " demands of us in this life , as well as what it portends for the next .
Finally , Berg makes no rash and premature predications about the future of the Legion , but asks for prayers toward discernment of that future , keeping Christ and his Church first in view , and not just focusing on a small part of it .
In sum , Berg 's is a moving statement from an accomplished priest and scholar ; I hope it's a break - through statement for the Legion at large , or at least for many of Berg 's brothers who doubtless feel exactly as he does .
Non-fragile ABI in D ?
One shortcoming of the D programming language comes from its C++ roots .
In C++ , whenever you add , change or remove a virtual method or a variable as a member of a class or struct , you ’re probably breaking binary compatibility and must recompile everything depending on that .
That makes C++ a bad choice for publishing public APIs when you expect binary compatibility .
The fragile binary interface problem ( as Wikipedia calls it ) is not new .
As a OS written entirely in C++ , BeOS has been “ bitten ” by it in the last decade and suggests some guidelines to alleviate that problem .
But following those guidelines adds clutter in the code , forces you to be extra careful when changing a class , and some suggestions are downright impossible in D : for instance , you ca n’t have private virtual functions in D ( something I disagree with , but that ’s another subject ) .
As the Wikipedia entry suggests , a better approach is to use a language that does not have the problem .
Or , I should say , change an existing language so it does no longer have that problem .
I ’d certainly like to see D gain a non-fragile ABI for classes .
I ’ll explore this and other subjects in a couple of posts about the D language I ’m preparing .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Levels of a powerful greenhouse gas are four times as high as previously thought , according to new measurements released on Thursday .

New analytical techniques show that about 5,400 metric tons of nitrogen trifluoride are in the atmosphere , with amounts increasing by about 11 percent per year .
Ray Weiss of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , California , and colleagues said it had not been possible to accurately measure this gas before .
They said nitrogen trifluoride is 17,000 times more effective at warming the atmosphere than an equal mass of carbon dioxide , although it does not yet contribute much to global warming .
Previous estimates had put levels of the gas at less than 1,200 metric tons in 2006 .
Nitrogen trifluoride , a colorless , odorless , nonflammable gas , is used to etch silicon wafers and in some lasers .
Writing in Geophysical Research Letters , Weiss and colleagues said they analyzed air samples gathered over the past 30 years under the NASA - funded Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment .
Weiss said nitrogen trifluoride needs to be regulated , as carbon dioxide is .
“ From a climate perspective , there is a need to add nitrogen trifluoride to the suite of greenhouse gases whose production is inventoried and whose emissions are regulated under the Kyoto Protocol , thus providing meaningful incentives for its wise use , ” he said .
Michael Prather , an atmospheric chemist at the University of California at Irvine , noted nitrogen trifluoride is being used more commonly and predicted that more would be found in the atmosphere .
“ It is now shown to be an important greenhouse gas , ” Prather , who was not involved with the Scripps study , said in a statement .
“ Now we need to get hard numbers on how much is flowing through the system , from production to disposal . ”
Italy at the nexus of stupidity and luck
Italy has taken its fair share of losses in the current economic downturn .
However , the damage has n’t been severe enough to elevate it to one of the top five countries that we fear could become the next Iceland .
In scanning the reddit comments on our list , I noted one Italian with a hilarious explanation for why Italy has n’t been more affected :
We ( Italy ) are somewhat not in this mess because our banks did not understand the last 5 years of finance and did not pretend to understand it , so they stayed out .
We are now in the spot where stupidity and luck meet .

At Prisma IT we have an application that has been under constant development for 2 years .
Over that time it has seen lots of feature creep and changing requirements , and no refactoring .
As you can imagine that does n’t make for pretty code or an optimal database model .
Due to a retargeting of that application and a much more focused requirements process we are finally getting ready to start reworking that application .
Over the past month I have been working on and off ( mostly in the train on my way to clients ) on putting more structure in the long list with things we ( I ) really would like to change about the technology of the application .
I have also been running some experiments on the code to see what the impact of certain changes would be .
Amongst others this includes the experiments with changing the datatype used in MS SQL Server to store ColdFusion UUIDs .
One of the last things I wanted was to get a feel for the cost / benefit ratio of a conversion from MS SQL Server to PostgreSQL .
One of the problems we are having with this application is that it stores lXML documents .
Since these documents are between 70 and 300 KB each the database gets large fast .
As you have seen in the posts about the storage of UUIDs in the database the total database size was approximately 32 GB , and 24 GB of that was XML .
With that size you can no longer use MS SQL Server Express so local development on a developers laptop suddenly gets a lot more complicated .
And you have to shell out for CPU licenses for MS SQL Server which gets expensive fast .
And even with a retargeting of the appliction for running in the cloud , that is still the difference between $ 0.40 per hour for a Linux instance or $ 1.10 per hour for a Windows + SQL Server Standard instance ( about $ 500 per month ) .
While PostgreSQL is my database of choice some of my co-workers feel more comfortable with MySQL .
But in this case I had a very good technical reason for trying PostgreSQL .
The way PostgreSQL internally deals with wide rows is to start moving columns to an overflow table .
That overflow or TOAST table is not visible to the end user , it is completely transparent to the user .
But what PostgreSQL does as well is compress the content of those columns .
The compression algorithm is very lightweight : light compression , but even lighter CPU usage .
But considering that the content was XML I had high hopes for the compression ratio and the effect this would have on the size and manageability of the database .
Compression of fields is possible in MySQL , but it is n’t transparent : you need to write it yourself and I ’m not interested in that complication .
So PostgreSQL it was .
Converting the database
Scripting the schema for the database was a breeze .
I had the DDL scripts for MS SQL Server from my earlier experiments and I just did a lot of search and replace on them .
Switched all bit datatypes to booleans , changed all datetimes to timestamps , removed the N from all national character datatypes ( in PostgreSQL you just declare the whole database to be UTF - 8 and be done with it ) and switched some fields with IP addresses to the INET datatype .
The actual data conversion was pretty trivial as well .
I created linked tales from MS Access and ran queries to select the records from one database and insert them in the other .
I just had to make sure the queries only selected a limited number of records , because apparently Access runs out of resources if you try to insert 20 million rcords in one insert statement .
Running these conversions took almost a whole day , which is quite excessive even for a 30 GB database .
I got the impression Access would process the queries one record at a time instead of in batches .
But since it was a process that can run unattended that is not really a problem either .
The results in terms of database size are pretty amazing .
For comparison I have included the results I previously recorded with MS SQL Server as well .
Database Datatype Storage requirements ( B ) Database size ( GB ) MS SQL Server UNIQUEIDENTIFIER 16 29.6 MS SQL Server VARCHAR ( 35 ) 35 32.5 MS SQL Server NVARCHAR ( 35 ) 70 38.6 PostgreSQL UUID 16 7.6
As you can see the database was reduced in size by about a factor 4 , from 29.6 to 7.6 GB .
That alone will make some of the management issues a whole lot easier to deal with .
I also did some apples to oranges benchmarks with this database ( I have PostgreSQL on my laptop instead of on a heavy server ) and the results are in the same ballpark as the results for MS SQL Server .
At the very least the benchmarks showed that there were no performance analomies like with MS SQL Server and the wrong Unicode hints .
I am also very confident that PostgreSQL will scale to many more concurrent users then the application currently has .
So all in all on the database side PostgreSQL is looking like a very good option .
Fixing the CFML code
On the ColdFusion side I had to overcome some hurdles though .
First is that ColdFusion comes with an ancient version of the PostgreSQL JDBC driver .
To use the UUID datatype I had to install the PostgreSQL 8.3 driver .
With that out of the way I had to fix many of our cfqueryparam tags to use the cf_sql_other cfsqltype instead of cf_sql_varchar ( this application does n’t use an ORM ( yet ) ) .
Once that is done there remain about 50 queries that require more work .
In most cases the extra work is due to different casting rules .
In the old database the UUIDs were stored in VARCHAR fields and in quite a few queries these varchar fields were concatenated or processed by string functions .
( This extra work is the same as when the database stays MS SQL Server but the datatype is changed from VARCHAR to UNIQUEIDENTIFIER . )
Only for an estimated 15 queries out of 800 I actually need to rewrite the SQL to make it work again because the SQL syntax is really different .
This is mainly related to locking ( FOR UPDATE vs. WITH ( UPDLOCK ) ) , recursive queries and in three cases to reverse the case sensitivity ( MS SQL Server needed extra code to make the password lookup case sensitive , PostgreSQL will need extra code to make the username lookup case insensitive ) .
The result
So does that mean this application will soon run on PostgreSQL ?
Well , no .
Everything works great and if I have my way it will happen in due time .
But the most important short term gain with a database conversion is the elimination of the performance inconsistencies with MS SQL Server caused by Unicode hints .
The cheapest way to get that gain is to convert the datatype used to store the UUIDs of that application from VARCHAR to NVARCHAR and leaving the database as MS SQL Server .
That change does n’t require any code changes on the ColdFusion side .
Sure , it will make the whole application a few percent slower and the database a few GB larger , but for an existing deployment that is n’t a real problem .
Gains like a reduction in license fees and lower cost for backups are long term and will have to wait while I first fix a bad case of class explosion in the user roles , rewrite the reporting engine from HTML and cfdocument to dynamic PDF and cfpdfformdata and a refactor a webservices API that duplicates thousands of lines of code from the main application ( with one change every 10 lines of course ) .
Georgina Hobbs - Meyer discovered her husband had had cyber sex .
Now she has two warnings for users of social networking sites : your whole life can be exposed - and do n't get dumped online
My mother emailed me last week to tell me she had joined Facebook .
We do n't chat on the phone ; we email .
Soon I expect she will want to poke me , write on my wall and , worse still , tag me in photographs of my wedding last May .
Well , not if I can help it , mama .
I love you too much to expose you to my online self .
You see , she does n't yet know that I , her 24 - year - old daughter , am about to divorce .
She can't see my Facebook status , so why would she ?
Mummy , how do I tell you I'm a Facebook divorcee ?
That the son - in - law you try so hard to like cheated on your only daughter using the social networking site you so adore ?
That your daughter learnt of her imminent divorce via Google Mail 's free chatting facility , Gchat ?
Prince Harry may know how I feel .
Would he even have known that he was single again if Chelsy Davy had n't flagged it up on Facebook ?
Her recently changed status cascaded through her friends ' newsfeeds to inform all that she was no longer in a relationship .
Snap went the trademark red heart , sending gossip rocketing offline and on to the printing presses , neatly bypassing Clarence House .
Headline : " Chelsy Davy : A change of heart on Facebook . "
Oh Prince Harry , yours is a state I know too well .
You , me , all of us , we 're helpless to defend ourselves once our partners rush to Facebook our misery over a thousand flickering screens .
The sad truth is that , once you announce your relationship on Facebook , and for as long as you are linked to one another by html , your status – hell , your love life – is on show to all .
Even though I 've opted to delete my relationship status rather than modify it Chelsy - style ( she , like my husband , distastefully rushed to invite comment on fresh singledom ) , people will see the photographs of my wedding and draw obvious conclusions .
Not that many people take relationship statuses to heart .
Even if they should , they do not read " X is married to Y " and immediately write off the object of their affection as unobtainable .
My divorce is proof of that .
It began with a woman he met at a party .
But it was within the sticky web of Facebook where they really got to know each other , despite the photos of us and our " married to ... " status .
I know this because my husband once logged on to Facebook and foolishly left the room .
I began to use his Mac , only to find myself blasted into the middle of a sizzling cyber romance .
And once I was in , I was hooked .
Their lusty emails touched on bad Beat poetry , but were infused with textspeak , their coy cyberflirts rife with emoticons .
It felt like I was stuck in a hyper - reality where Douglas Coupland wrote Danielle Steel novels .
" Could this really be happening six months into my marriage ? " I wanted to comment on my own Facebook wall .
And whatever Facebook was before that – a relatively innocuous way to keep up with friends , I suppose – it has since taken on a more demonic intent .
Most infuriating is my near - constant Facebook - style method of internal communication that I cannot switch off .
Whenever I do something , I narrate internally .
Something like : " Georgie is hacking into her husband 's Facebook account just to see if she knows the password ...
Georgie is pleased she knows the password !...
Georgie is disturbed to find her husband chatting to a very pretty 19 - year - old rather a lot ...
Georgie is furthermore disturbed to discover her husband is partaking in cybersex with said 19 - year - old !...
Georgie is slowly realising that while she has been Facebook - chatting with her husband , he has simultaneously been sending the 19 - year - old dirty messages !!...
Georgie is considering divorce . "
That 's pretty much how it went .
Actually , I did n't get round to asking for a divorce .
Pathetically , I did feel somewhat vindicated when my husband , once caught , deleted the 19 - year - old at my request .
And what did her status read ?
" Someone deleted me !
I know who you are ! "
Scary stuff .
So , divorce .
I do n't know anything about getting a divorce after you have caught your husband having real sex , let alone text sex .
If a poke is slang for fornication in real life , but polite in social networking terms , where do I stand ?
Instead , I asked him to fly back to his home country so we could take a break from one another .
I still was n't sure how fatal a crime two - timing online was – me and her duped by the same typist ; sex with me in the marital bed , sex with her via keyboard .
I received a curt Facebook message from him a few months later asking to " book some Skype time " .
This was serious .
Skype , the videophone software that allows you to talk face to face to anyone in the world with an internet connection , was not used lightly between us .
When we courted but lived in different countries , it was through Skype that we would have our most intimate conversations , eye to eye .
Almost .
Playing cool , I demurred : " Just email your concerns . "
But before he'd got a chance , we found ourselves on Google chat .
Here is a transcript of the conversation : Me : " why cant u just email some of what u want to chat via skype ? "
He : " i think we need to get divorced , and move on from this point in our life , I still love you , but our marriage has failed and needs to be over . "
The typing is appalling – but not unusually so .
It 's also inaccurate .
The marriage did n't fail .
It 's just that he could n't resist typing things that he thought would have no consequence in the flesh and blood world .
But no longer .
The two worlds are on a collision course .
The question is , which will take precedence – the Facebook hyperbole where all and nothing can be summed up with a " ? " and a " ! " , a world where self - promotion cuts out the middle man and you 're the last to know if your own daughter is married ?
Looks like it .
I know divorce was never nice , but was n't there a time when communication , on the whole , was romantic ?
Painfully slow , granted , but perhaps a chance to reflect is what we need .
Where once it was smoke signals across the American plains , homing pigeons over chimney tops or calling cards plucked from silver trays , we now have the puerile , typically misspelt , Facebook status update .
With all the charm of an overbearing town crier on a caffeine overload , the monster of Facebook feeds off our ids , leaving us bored office workers and near - royalty wrecked after a day of reading between the comments .
Now single and unable to delete my husband from my list of friends ( I am paralysed every time I try ) , I 'm acutely aware that he can see my every move , just as I can see his .
Foolishly , I fiddled with my settings and ramped up the amount of information I am fed about him .
When he adds a friend or pretentiously quotes the vacuous Bret Easton Ellis in his status updates , it makes me want to vomit .
And still I ramp it up .
This perverse circumstance has seen me go the way of the online bunny - boiler .
I 've added more friends than I care to mention just to infuriate him .
I 've got buddies I 've never met in New York and Australia , a Canadian spammer who believes that raw food cures cancer and – worst of all – people I dislike in real life .
I even tried adding Chelsy Davy since , from hard - nosed appearances at least , she 's doing pretty well .
The pursuit of letting endless idiots become my friends is draining .
Having to then show off about it with a wall comment , more so .
" Georgie is wondering what is happening to her , her friends and the man she married ?

No , Facebook is not for you , mother ; it is for the bored , the boring , the unfulfilled .
Install it on your BlackBerry or iPhone at will ( my husband just did ) , but do n't let it fool you .

SAN FRANCISCO – Soon after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) took office in 2003 , he set in motion a campaign promise to build , by 2010 , a " hydrogen highway " composed of 150 to 200 fueling stations spaced every 20 miles along California 's major highways .
Schwarzenegger 's " Vision 2010 " plan promised that every California motorist would have access to hydrogen fuel by the end of the decade .
He has since repeatedly mentioned the highway in a standard stump speech on his environmental accomplishments .
But the program has fallen short of expectations .
With less than 10 months until the end of the decade , only 24 hydrogen fueling stations are operating in California , most of them near Los Angeles .
The vision of a hydrogen infrastructure , with fueling stations dotting the interstates , has not materialized , partly because the eager governor may have set unrealistic targets .
Gerhard Achtelik , manager of the hydrogen highway program at the Air Resources Board , admitted in an interview that the state would not hit its 150 - station goal by 2010 .
" That was a very optimistic guess , " Achtelik said .
" It 's certainly been a learning experience . "
The state 's hydrogen - highway experience points to a fundamental question confronting any effort to build an alternative car market , be it powered by hydrogen or electricity :
What comes first , the vehicle or the infrastructure ?
Of the hydrogen effort , Achtelik conceded that the public has " not received the vehicles as quickly as we hoped . "
Automakers have developed test models and advanced fuel - cell technology in labs around the world , but this test phase has not yet resulted in anything close to a commercial hydrogen car market .
" If all the cars were there that would be needed for the infrastructure , then the stations would be there , " Achtelik said .
Vision with ' hiccups '
Roy Kim , of the California Fuel Cell Partnership , also said developing hydrogen stations when there are not enough cars to serve them does not make sense .
The most likely candidates to build the stations in the private sector -- the oil companies -- still see the infrastructure as a questionable investment , while public dollars , especially in cash - strapped California , have been scarce .
But Kim sees reason for optimism , with General Motors Corp. , Honda Motor Co. , Toyota Motor Corp. and Daimler AG moving closer to putting hydrogen cars in the hands of customers .
Once the Honda Clarity or GM Equinox catches on , the stations will come , he argued .
" It has had its hiccups , " said Kim of the hydrogen highway program .
" But this is characteristic of any emerging new technology .
It takes time to realize a vision , and it takes patience to get there . "
Kim compares the hydrogen fuel cell to the personal computer and likes to reference Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates ' famous prediction that he would one day see a personal computer in every household .
Hydrogen fuel cells are getting slimmer and safer , he said , and commercial pilot projects have shown promise .
Catherine Rips , managing director of the California Hydrogen Business Council , puts it another way .
She said the alternative car market in the United States – with hydrogen matching up against plug - in electrics , hybrids and biodiesels , to name a few – has spread itself outward rather than imitating the internal combustion engine 's more linear path .
This means the highway concept , which was adopted early in the decade , may not apply , at least for the time being .
" What sounded like a good idea in 1999 does n't necessarily match up with reality a decade later , " Rips said .
" New technology does n't follow a straight path . "
Joan Ogden , director of the Sustainable Transportation Energy Pathways program at the University of California , Davis , says the 150 - station idea was a " broad - brush vision " that experts quickly realized was unlikely to be fulfilled after the governor launched his program .
Transportation planners and policymakers , Ogden said , several years ago stopped taking the highway concept literally .
They came up with a new image – the cluster – and decided a more doable pilot program would be to create a network of 10 to 20 stations in a specific region , to fuel the cars where they reside .
Shell Hydrogen BV , an industry leader , and GM soon advocated the same concept in a study that called for the creation of station clusters in three locations , including Los Angeles .
So now you have , in theory , a developing network in a region where automakers can directly market their cars .
" GM has repeatedly said the development of such a cluster is what is needed to take their learning to the next level , " Rips said .
Zero-emissions rule
Crucial to the emergence of the cluster , in Ogden 's view , is California 's zero-emissions vehicle rule , which goes into effect in 2012 .
Under the regulation , which was advanced by the state 's Air Resources Board , automakers will be required to make 7,500 " pure ZEVs " in the 2012 - 14 time frame , and 25,000 in 2015 - 17 .
Because pure ZEVs emit no greenhouse gas emissions from their tailpipes , that means fuel - cell cars powered by either hydrogen or electricity .
" I 'm actually pretty encouraged , " Ogden said .
" When I started watching this 15 years ago , it took the whole back of a minivan to hold a fuel system .
You have a very attractive car now . "
The market for the vehicles and the infrastructure , Ogden added , should " really be driven by this ZEV regulation . "
The automakers have announced plans to introduce hundreds of fuel - cell vehicles into Southern California in the years ahead , in hopes that a cluster would emerge .
" Clusters make a lot more sense at this point , " agreed Achtelik , who predicted " bridge stations " to Las Vegas and Santa Barbara , Calif. , from the Los Angeles region by 2014 or 2015 .
But just who will build the fueling stations beyond the experimental stage is still an open question .
Ogden said the oil companies , unlike the carmakers , are not regulated to build the infrastructure or participate in the fledgling market .
Shell Hydrogen and Chevron Corp. are involved in demonstration stations , but they have been resistant to all - out investment for a reason .
" There 's some question as to how this is going to take place , " Ogden said .
" What we really need is a network demo . "
' It 's in the mix '
To the automakers , the bumps on the hydrogen highway are emblematic of the state of the alternative car market and the difficulties associated with building cars during the economic downturn .
The manufacturers are developing a number of models to meet increasing fuel economy standards , with an eye on greenhouse gas emissions reduction policies like the one adopted in California under A.B. 32 .
That means flex - fuel , compressed natural gas and biodiesel vehicles in addition to hydrogen and electric fuel cells .
What are lacking , said Charles Territo , spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers , are clear signals on stations and how drivers will be able to drive long distances .
" Our industry is committed to offering the vehicles , " he said , " but the reality is there needs to be a very significant effort to expand the alternative fuel infrastructure . "
Ultimately , Territo added , consumers will likely decide on a region - by - region basis what technology they prefer .
Some regions in the Midwest could see ethanol - 85 networks emerge , while more urban areas could see electrification .
And hydrogen ?
" It 's in the mix , " Territo said .
" Our goal as manufacturers is to provide as many different technologies as possible . "
In the short term , hydrogen advocates have applauded the federal stimulus package , which has billions set aside for research into fuel cells and $ 300 million earmarked specifically for alt - vehicle infrastructure projects .
In the long term , they would like to see more public dollars to build the stations , possibly alongside state and federal facilities in highway rest stops .
" There 's not yet a commercial case for an infrastructure provider , " Rips said .
" It 's going to take public support , or a mandate . "
Back in California , state officials say all this is part of what they now view , in the words of ARB spokesman Dimitri Stanich , as a " retooled " hydrogen highway .
" It 's very much alive , " Stanich said of the program .
" This vision is still there .
It 's just being groomed . "

Male circumcision , already shown to reduce the incidence of H.I.V. infection in men , also reduces transmission of both herpes simplex virus Type 2 and human papilloma virus , a study has found .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , at least 45 million people in the United States ages 12 and older have had herpes , or H.S.V. - 2 , the incurable infection that can cause recurrent painful genital lesions .
About 20 million are currently infected with human papilloma virus , or H.P.V. , which causes various genital cancers , including most cervical cancers .
There is no treatment or cure for H.P.V. , but there is a vaccine now licensed only for girls and women .
The study , a randomized clinical trial published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine , assigned more than 3,000 uncircumcised Ugandan men who were not infected with H.S.V. - 2 to undergo immediate circumcision or to be circumcised 24 months from the start of the investigation .
A subgroup was similarly evaluated for H.P.V. infection .
At 24 months , 114 men of the men initially circumcised and 153 of the noncircumcised tested positive for H.S.V. - 2 . After controlling for various health and behavioral factors , the researchers estimated that circumcised men had a 25 percent reduced risk of infection .
The results do not apply to their partners .
The worsening U.S. economy hit the nation 's work force hard in December , as the unemployment rate climbed to 7.2 % and brought the total number of jobs lost last year to just over 2.5 million -- the most since 1945 .
Of those , 1.9 million vanished in just the final four months of the year .
Job losses spared no region or sector , except for small ...

Teens might not be entirely self - centered and lazy at home .
Sure , parents might think as much , but a new study shows that teens not only feel obligated to help their parents , but they do this out of love and concern for their parents , even at the expense of social livelihood .
" There certainly are situations where kids say , ' I do n't want to do that ; it 's my choice ; it 's up to me . '
But I think we overestimate that , " said study researcher Judith Smetana of the University of Rochester in New York .
" We have a somewhat stereotypical view of teenagers .
There 's the good and the bad , and we tend to focus on the bad . "
And Smetana is n't immune to such negative views of teens .
Her research was partly spurred by her own teenagers .
" It was striking to me in my own life how my kids have been cited in their high school as natural helpers , the kind of kids who go out of their way to help other people , " Smetana told LiveScience .
" And yet at home my feeling was they do n't always act that way with me .
That sort of motivated the study .
How could they be so oblivious to their parents ' needs ? "
She added , " That 's not at all what we found in the study .
They felt obligated to help even when parents ' needs were low . "
To help or not
Smetana and her colleagues surveyed nearly 120 teenagers ( in 7th and 10th grades ) from lower - middle to middle - class families , along with their parents ( 109 mothers and 9 fathers ) .
Participants read vignettes in which either a parent asked a teen for help or a teen asked a parent for help .
The scenarios were considered low - need or high - need .
For example , in a low - need scenario , parents ask their teenager if she or he will stay home to wait for a furniture delivery , but the teen has plans with friends to attend a new movie opening that night .
One of the high - need scenarios describes a father who is planning a big holiday party , but a wait - staff member bails , so the dad asks his teen daughter for help serving food .
The party apparently will be a flop without more help , but the teenager already has plans to go sledding with friends .
Then , parents and teens had to decide whether or not the character in the story should help and whether it was okay for that character to say " no " due to conflicts with personal desires .
Participants also rated the story character 's selfishness in the scenario where he or she does n't help on a scale from " not at all selfish " to " very selfish . "
Perfect teens
In the low - need situations , teens were twice as likely as parents to say that teens should help .
So whereas nearly 70 percent of the time teens said the adolescent character should help , parents said so just 31 percent of the time .
For the high - need scenarios , both parents and teens said teens should help about 80 percent of the time .
Surprisingly , parents thought it was more acceptable for teens to abandon helping a parent to go out with friends than did teens themselves .
" Part of what [ parents ] are considering are the needs of the person in the situation , but they 're also balancing adolescents ' developmental needs , " Smetana said .
" So they seem pretty attuned to adolescents ' needs for autonomy or to do their own thing . "
Compared with parents of 7th - graders , more 10th - grader parents said it was selfish for teens to ditch helping others in order to hang out with friends .
But those 10th - graders were less likely than their younger counterparts to say kids were selfish for not helping .
Smetana said one reason could be that as teens get older they appreciate more an adolescent 's need to " do their own thing . "
Parents , however , may place higher expectations on their older teens .
" Parents view adolescents as increasingly competent to help , and so view them as selfish when they do n't . "
Smetana says she would like to follow up this study with one involving real - life situations to see if the same results hold .
The research is published in the January / February issue of the journal Child Development .

Hara hatchi bu , the Okinawan people ’s habit of eating only till they are 80 percent full , is thought to be one of the secrets of their extraordinary health and longevity .
In addition to one of the highest percentages of people in the world who live past 100 , Okinawans appear to be less prone to heart disease , diabetes and obesity .
Indeed , ever since it was discovered in the 1930s that laboratory rats fed a caloric - restricted ( CR ) diet lived almost twice as long as their well fed counterparts , scientists have pursued caloric restriction research in the hopes of finding novel strategies for extending human life and preventing disease .
Given the growing older population at risk for memory problems and the rising rates of obesity , the role of diet in maintaining peak brain performance has taken on added importance .
Although the links between caloric restriction and longevity are still not fully proven in humans , short - term human trials have clearly shown that CR can improve many vital surrogate health markers , such as body weight , blood pressure , blood sugar and insulin levels , blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels , and measures of inflammation .
High insulin levels and inflammation have both been linked to cognitive problems .
In mice , reducing calories also promotes neurogenesis and slows certain Alzheimer ’s - related changes in parallel with reductions seen in blood insulin and inflammation .
Thus , there is great interest in examining the effects of CR on brain health in humans and in comparing its effects with those of other diets ( for example , diets rich in healthier unsaturated fats ) that may also help memory .
Diet and Memory
A recent study on caloric restriction and memory led by the neurologist Agnes Floel and her colleagues at the University of Munster took the first step in examining this issue .
They recruited 50 older ( ages 50 to 80 years ) adults with a normal memory .
Subjects on average were slightly overweight .
The researchers assigned the volunteers to three groups , based on their age , gender and weight .
Group 1 got a diet with 30 percent reduced daily calories and normal levels of other essential nutrients ; the minimal level was set at 1,200 calories daily to prevent malnourishment .
Group 2 ’s diet had 20 percent increased unsaturated fatty acids with no increase in total fat — thus boosting the ratio of healthy ( unsaturated ) to unhealthy ( saturated ) fats .
The control was Group 3 ) — who had a diet as usual .
None of the participants were advised to change their exercise habits .
The researchers gave subjects in the first two groups individualized dietary plans and monitored their diet via self - reports .
All subjects underwent memory and blood tests before and after the three months in the trial .
At the end of three months , the reduced - calorie diet group showed a small reduction in body weight ( by 2.4 kilograms ) , whereas the other two diet groups showed a slight increase in weight ( by about one kilogram ) .
There was , however , a highly significant ( about 20 percent above baseline ) improvement in the CR group ’s ability to recall words they had on a list ( called delayed recall ) , and they also made fewer errors .
Their memory improvement tended to be correlated with reductions in blood insulin and markers of inflammation ( C - reactive protein and TNF - alpha ) .
Memory did not change in the other two diet groups .
This study is commendable because it is the first prospectively planned trial in older adults to demonstrate memory benefits of a low - calorie diet .
The replication in humans of some of the findings seen in earlier animal studies provides an important proof of concept step that will encourage and guide the design of larger future studies .
Further , it demonstrated improvements in the type of memory ( delayed recall ) that is typically the first to fail in very early stages of Alzheimer ’s disease .
Further Questions
As with any single center pilot study , this study also has some limitations ( many of which the authors acknowledge ) , such as : small sample size , considerable differences in baseline characteristics of the three groups , unreliability of diet self - reports , the possibility of chance findings from multiple comparisons , greater social contact with subjects in diet groups , and highly variable adherence to diet as evidenced by the small weight loss in the CR group .
For these reasons , the results should be considered preliminary , but promising .
What next ?
There are several unanswered questions .
Will memory benefits of CR continue once body weight has dropped below a certain level ?
Was it the caloric restriction per se or was it the type of diet that led to the effects observed ?
Might a low carbohydrate diet , without reducing calories , achieve a similar effect ?
Is a 30 percent caloric restriction even sustainable for most people in the face of constant bombardment with food products ?
Can the combination of diet and exercise lead to greater benefits ?
Could prolonged caloric restriction cause wasting or other harm in older people ?
If inflammation mediates the cognitive benefits of diet , why have prior trials of anti-inflammatory agents failed to improve memory ?
Is there an interaction between one ’s genetic makeup and diet ?
Further dietary intervention studies of much larger samples with known risk factors ( such as elevated C- reactive protein , insulin resistance , or mild cognitive impairment ) would be needed to address these questions .
But until such studies are completed , a good rule of thumb with regard to diet is “ what is good for the heart is generally good for the brain . ”

For Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. , the national housing crisis has been a double whammy .
The Riverside company , which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Tuesday , is grappling with sharp declines in demand for its two key products : manufactured houses and the big homes - on - wheels it makes for the recreational vehicle market .
The dual hit has forced Fleetwood to drastically cut its workforce , adding to the economic woes in Riverside County .
There is little prospect of a quick turnaround , especially in Fleetwood ’s flagship RV business .
The bankruptcy filing is a sad turn for a company that has been making recreational vehicles since 1965 and was known for having one of the more colorful chief executives in the industry -- John C. Crean , Fleetwood ’s founder and sometime TV cooking show host , who died two years ago .

Fleetwood said Tuesday that it was in talks with potential buyers for all or part of its business , and that it would continue to operate while in bankruptcy proceedings .
“ The vast majority of our suppliers and dealers should see no disruption in our business , ” Chief Executive Elden L. Smith said in a statement .
Fleetwood said it was exiting the travel trailer business .
As part of that process , it will close three factories and two service centers and eliminate 675 jobs , including 12 at its soon - to - be- shuttered Rialto plant .
An additional 65 corporate jobs will be cut , most of them at the company ’s headquarters , where employment will fall to about 200 people .
The layoffs will reduce Fleetwood ’s payroll to just more than 3,000 people nationwide -- down 70 % from three years ago .

In its filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Riverside , Fleetwood listed total assets of $ 559.7 million and total liabilities of $ 623.6 million .
Its largest unsecured creditor is Bank of America Corp .
Fleetwood had $ 23 million in cash as of Jan. 25 and said it was in talks with its lenders to secure additional financing .
Fleetwood , along with other RV makers , has been hit by a severe slump in sales caused by several years of high gasoline prices and worsened by the current recession .
In addition , the credit crisis has made it tough for Fleetwood customers to get loans .
High - end models that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars are gathering dust on dealers ’ lots .
Industrywide sales of motor homes , trailers and other RVs totaled 237,000 in 2008 , down 33 % from 2007 .
The industry is projecting 2009 sales of 130,100 units , which would be the lowest annual sales since 1980 .
“ In the current recession , consumer confidence levels have retreated to new lows , and RV shipments have cratered as a result , ” analyst Kathryn Thompson of Avondale Partners wrote in an assessment .

Contrary to industry claims , high gas prices have affected sales , Thompson wrote , particularly for the largest models whose gas mileage is typically 8 to 10 miles per gallon .
When prices soared past $ 4 a gallon last summer , Thompson wrote , sales of RVs “ hit a wall . ”
Fleetwood , the nation ’s No. 3 RV builder , has suffered even more than its rivals .
Revenue fell from almost $ 3.8 billion in fiscal 2000 to just under $ 1.7 billion in the fiscal year that ended in April 2008 .
RV sales accounted for 56 % of Fleetwood ’s revenue in fiscal 2009 ’s first half , which ended Oct. 26 .
That was down 57 % from the year before and helped fuel an almost $ 86 - million first - half loss .
The collapse of the housing industry has also taken a toll on Fleetwood , although its manufactured housing unit saw its sales fall by a less - fearsome 24 % in the first half of the current fiscal year .

Trading in Fleetwood ’s shares was suspended by the New York Stock Exchange in December after they lost 98 % of their value during the year .
The industry downturn , and Fleetwood ’s problems in particular , have slammed Riverside County , where unemployment stands at 12.2 % .
“ The entire recreational vehicle industry and the manufactured housing industry are , and have been for a long time , major employers in the county of Riverside , ” said Tom Freeman , spokesman for the Riverside County Economic Development Agency .
“ Their financial problems , their closures , their layoffs , all have impacted our communities extremely hard . ”
Weekend Warrior Trailers Inc. , which in 2005 employed 1,000 people in the Inland Empire , shuttered its operations in September .
National RV closed its doors in late 2007 .
Several smaller RV makers have also gone under , Freeman said .

Fleetwood still has an RV plant in Riverside employing 316 people , as well as a manufactured housing operation in Jurupa that employs almost 100 .
Overall , the company has 15 plants in 10 states .
Fleetwood got a boost in September 2005 when the Federal Emergency Management Agency ordered 7,500 travel trailers and 3,000 prefabricated homes to provide temporary housing for Hurricane Katrina victims .
But that bonanza was short - lived .
John Crean , the son of a Depression - era North Dakota farmer who moved his family to Compton in 1930 , founded the company in 1950 to design and manufacture Venetian blinds for travel trailers .
He entered the RV business by buying a small travel trailer company in 1965 , the same year he took Fleetwood public .

Crean later became a noted Orange County philanthropist .
During the 1990s , he co-hosted a cable TV cooking show called “ At Home on the Range ” on which he pulled such stunts as cooking dog food .
He died in January 2007 at age 81 .

Alison Carroll , 23 , is an English actress best known for her role as Lara Croft in the computer game .
She was born in Croydon and originally trained as a gymnast and actress before becoming a model .
In August 2008 , she was announced as the new Lara Croft model for the Tomb Raider : Underworld game .
Tomb Raider : Underworld featuring Lara Croft is now available on the new gaming handset Sony Ericsson W910 exclusively at The Carphone Warehouse .
If I were n't talking to you right now I 'd be ?
I ’d probably be going out for a run through the woods with my iPod .
I listen to all sorts of crazy stuff when I ’m running .
A phrase I use far too often ...
I say ‘ really ’ far too much .
I wish people would take more notice of ...
When it was announced that I was to become Lara Croft , everyone immediately assumed I was just a model .
I ’m actually a trained actress so I ’d really like people to be aware of the fact I am trained .
The most surprising thing that ever happened to me was ...
In Italy last year , I had to do a performance with Negramaro which is a big rock band over there .
I was asked to abseil from the top of the stadium and land in the middle of the whole audience .
There were thousands and thousands of people watching and after the abseil , I still had to do my Lara Croft routine .
It was a bit of a challenge .
I 'm good at ...
Gymnastics .
My party trick is having the ability to balance on just one hand .
But I 'm very bad at ...
Is Lara Croft bad at anything ?
Alison might be but Lara Croft certainly is n’t .
The ideal night out is ...
Doing something active .
I often go down to the New Forest for a weekend for mountain biking and camping .
I like my weekends to be action - packed .
In moments of weakness I ...
I go for a run .
It completely clears my head .
You know me as the new Lara Croft but in truer life I 'd have been ...
A cat .
Because then I could roam around doing whatever I want , just eating and sleeping all day .
Cats are also pretty athletic too .
The best age to be is ...
21 . I ’ll always be 21 at heart despite the fact I ’m 23 now and will soon be 24 .
In a nutshell , my philosophy is ?
Live life to the full and cram in as much as possible !

Baylor study : Women more likely to die after heart attacks Women less likely to get proper care for heart attacks
Baylor study finds many factors contribute to disparity in treatment
Women are less likely than men to receive appropriate and timely treatment after being hospitalized for a heart attack and more likely to die if it 's severe , according to a new study .
The study , led by a Baylor College of Medicine cardiologist , found that women overall are nearly twice as likely to die of massive heart attacks as men .
When researchers adjusted for the fact female patients tend to be older and sicker , they were 12 percent more likely to die .
" I was surprised there is still so much of a difference , " said Dr. Hani Jneid , a Baylor professor of cardiovascular medicine and the study 's lead author .
" I would have expected the gap to have closed by now .
We need to do better . "
Jneid said he believes the undertreatment of female patients is one reason for the higher mortality rate , but added the study only showed an association .
He called for future studies to find the causes .
Previous research also has found women 's heart attacks are treated less aggressively .
Jneid said the stereotype that heart disease is a man 's issue exists even among many health - care workers .
The new study , reported Monday in the American Heart Association journal Circulation , did show improvement by women .
A decade ago , studies found that women overall were 40 percent more likely to die from heart attacks than men and 25 percent more likely when the numbers were adjusted for age and risk factors .
Measuring progress
The new study was undertaken to determine if initiatives taken to reduce the gender gap since it was identified in the 1990s were successful .
The study found men and women now have about the same adjusted in - hospital death rate for heart attacks .
The remaining gap was evident only after the most severe type , when a complete blockage of a coronary artery causes more heart muscle to die .
The researchers examined medical records of more than 78,000 heart attack patients treated at 420 U.S. hospitals between 2001 and 2006 .
The hospitals are enrolled in a program that follows the latest guidelines for treatments shown to work in clinical trials .
Because many U.S. hospitals are not enrolled in the program , researchers say the actual disparity in the care and outcome of women might be worse .
The researchers found women admitted with a massive heart attack were twice as likely to die in the first 24 hours of hospitalization .
" This is a clear call to action , " said Dr. Gregg Fonarow , a professor of cardiovascular medicine at UCLA and a study author .
" Progress has been made , but there is still substantial opportunity to improve care and outcome . "
Jneid noted that treatment is complicated because women often experience atypical and less obvious heart attack symptoms , such as nausea and vomiting .
They experienced heart pains less often than men .
Other factors
On average , the women in the study were more likely to have heart - related health problems such as diabetes , heart failure and high blood pressure .
They were eight years older at the time of the heart attack — 72 compared with 64 .
As a result of those factors , 10.2 percent of women with heart attacks died in the hospital , compared with 5.5 percent of men .
After taking into account those factors , the researchers said women in the study were 12 percent more likely to die .
Massive heart attacks occur more frequently in men .
In the study , 35 percent of men suffered heart attacks characterized by a complete blockage of an artery , compared with 28 percent of women .
The study was funded by the American Heart Association 's Council on Clinical Cardiology .

Two decades ago , real estate mogul Randy Black turned this blip on the Arizona border into a boomtown when he opened the first of four casinos .
Nearly 1 million visitors a year followed , and hotels , restaurants and stucco homes seemed to sprout from sand .
“ It seemed to be one of those things that ‘ Geez , it ’s just going great .
It ’s never going to end , ’ ” said Victor Kotalion , who left Las Vegas in 1990 for this arid patch off Interstate 15 .
Locals and travelers passing through have long kept Mesquite ’s casinos afloat .
But like the spent mines that have busted many Western towns , Mesquite ’s source of wealth ran out .
As the economy soured , tourists hoarded their cash , and the town ’s gross gambling revenue plummeted 11 % .
Visitor volume fell 7.4 % last year ; the average daily room rate fell 35.4 % .
Last month , Black laid off 347 workers at the Oasis and shuttered much of the casino .
Kotalion , a 60 - year - old dealer and floor supervisor , was one of the ones let go .
Advertisement
“ As you get older , what do you do ? ” Kotalion said .
“ There are n’t a lot of options here . . . not for me .
Actually , not for anybody that ’s in the gaming industry . ”
During the last 20 years , a number of states bet on gambling -- a supposedly recession - proof business .
But this downturn has wiped out even conventional wisdom :
In the third quarter of 2008 , revenue dropped in six of the 12 states with commercial casinos , the American Gaming Assn. said .
Resorts are typically reluctant to cut staff , experts said , because training new hires costs thousands of dollars .
Yet in the last year , commercial and tribal casinos have trimmed workforces in Riverside County and on the Las Vegas Strip as well as in Michigan , Oregon , Connecticut and New York .
The industry ’s losses can be seen vividly in Mesquite , whose reliance on gambling resembles a Rust Belt town tied to an auto plant .
Job losses hurt restaurants and retailers , overwhelm social service providers and demoralize the remaining employees .
Advertisement
“ If you have one , two , maybe three key industries , if one goes out , the whole town suffers , ” said William Eadington , director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at the University of Nevada , Reno .
“ It ’s like cutting one of the legs off a stool . ”
Before Randy Black arrived , Mesquite was barely more than a cluster of dairy farms and alfalfa fields along the Virgin River .
The Oasis was the sole casino .
Black envisioned the city as a rural desert destination , “ halfway between where you are and where you ’re going . ”
After opening the Virgin River hotel - casino in 1990 , he bought the CasaBlanca , the Oasis and the Mesquite Star ( since closed ) , becoming Mesquite ’s largest employer , with up to 2,800 casino workers .
Mesquite ’s population soared , to nearly 20,000 last year from 1,960 in 1990 .
From 2002 to 2007 , yearly gambling revenue climbed an average of 8.2 % .
Advertisement
“ It was too fast , too hot and heavy , ” Kotalion said from his home on the outskirts of the mountain - ringed town .
“ You could see things going bad , but there was not much you could do about it . ”
Over the years , Black took on $ 200 million in debt to expand his casino business and buy out his partners ; he became owner of all but one Mesquite casino , the Eureka .
Like magnates in such industries as finance and real estate , he thought business would keep booming .
Then the “ bubble ” burst , he said .
Black mothballed the Oasis in December .
Its gambling tables are shrouded in heavy plastic .
The buffet , bars and lounge are empty .
Dozens of unplugged slot machines sit dark .
On a recent afternoon , fewer than a dozen gamblers played the remaining penny slots .
“ Has it hit bottom yet ?
No one knows , ” Black said at the CasaBlanca .
Advertisement
If business continues to drop , Black plans more cuts ; similarly , he says he ’ll rehire staff if demand returns .
“ If everybody in the planet or in Las Vegas or in the world would say , ‘ OK , things are better ’ . . . we could open [ the Oasis ] back up in a day . ”
Residents , meanwhile , are struggling .
Traffic at nonprofit Virgin Valley Family Services tripled to 100 people a day .
Case manager Alex Corral said about 15 % of casino employees he had helped decided to leave town .
“ Right now , with the Oasis shut down , it ’s really hard to decide if anything ’s going to come here , ” he said .
“ There ’s no money coming into town at all . ”
Kotalion is holding out for a casino job .
He and his wife , Gail , a floor supervisor at the CasaBlanca , filed for bankruptcy five months before he was laid off .
The couple has struggled to pay for medical care and to repair flood damage to their home .
He ’s stretching unemployment checks that are at least $ 500 less than his former monthly income .
And the Kotalions are fearful that other casinos -- including the CasaBlanca -- might close or be sold .

Still , Mayor Susan
Holecheck remains sanguine about her city of new sunset - colored tract homes .
“ Mesquite is going to evolve , ” she said .
“ Gaming is not going to be as much of a focus , I do n’t think , as it was before . ”
The town recently built a soccer complex and softball fields , hoping to lure sporting events .
A second Walgreens is on the way .
The Census Bureau arrived last month to recruit as many as 150 people .
But none of them can match the casinos , which employed nearly 3,000 in the spring .
The next - largest employers , the Clark County School District and Wal - Mart , provided about 330 jobs each .
In fact , the town is awaiting the phased opening of another casino :
The 190 - acre Solstice , a high - end gambling , retail and resort complex , is slated to bring up to 1,000 jobs when Barcelona Partners fully opens it next year .
Down the street from the construction site , freshly paved roads halt at leveled dirt lots , ready for the next boom .

The Beauty of Erlang Syntax

While it is nice that you like Erlang , I do n't think your arguments will work very well to convince somebody to try Erlang .
You sound more like http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=drink+the+kool-aid.
Believe me , there can be doubt about lambda calculus being " ultimate " .
This is the internet , and your argument is WEAK .
Phrases like " elegant " , " what is right " , " creative soul " do simply not work .
Try a Java guy sometimes , they will dislike that Erlang * is not Java * is not running on the JVM * is not equipped with classes nor the object - dot - metod - arglist syntax * is just plain different and academic for no practical advantage * is not doing anything you could n't do with Java using NIO , blocking queues , and something called osgi they read about in a trade mag but have n't used personally yet * is unimportant now that Scala exists * is unimportant because Kilim is adding cheap actors to Java ... and then continue with weak reasons .
The human being is not rational .
The human being rationalizes its irrational choices though .
Argumenting with emotions wont work since they have strong emotions in favour of OOP already .
I used to think that I liked erlang programming just because it was quite academic , and that this was just a personal preference .
But I have come to realize that side - effect free programming is easier to reason about .
Not always easier to write though .
Being easier to reason about means that I can imagine more execution in my head than I can in languages that rebind variables and mutate values .
Because those destructive changes defines a before - change , and after - change , sequence , order , and there are only so many steps one can keep the mind without the brain starting to lie to you , filling out the blanks without telling you .
I recently read an article published in idg.se where Erik Stenman of kreditor was quoted saying that ( something like ) java systems grow complex over time in a way that Erlang does not as much .
This is something I experience with Java systems .
In Java there is no cost in adding more things that keep state .
It is said that you just encapsulate state it in your object , but that state is not as encapsulated as you think .
Problems are fixed by adding more things with state , and more .
and more .
Pretty soon you have behavior that depends on several hundred mutable variables , and the code - base feels hard to grasp , difficult to reason back into previous code execution to see the " big picture " .
It makes architectural fixes more difficult .
And the problems accelerates , since more quick fixes are added .
( I really need to get better at describing this . )
The funny thing is that the OOP world have found one way to manage the complexity and the code - bases that grow ugly :
They are using unit tests , and practice the art of writing testable code .
( " Testable code " is something that is simple to write unit tests for . ) *
You make it very easy to supply the dependencies to code under test need .
Avoid things that go out and grab values from global state .
*
You avoid side - effects , and the side - effects you need ( database updates , writing files etc ) you make sure that you perform with a layer of indirection so that during tests you can replace the real object with ( for example ) a do - nothing mock .
What they are doing is that they are making as much of their code as possible to be side - effect free and placing all that code in one method so it can be called from a unit test .
They are concentrating side - effects to well - defined places , carefully avoiding mixing side - effects and testable / test - worthy logic .
What they are doing is that they 're reinventing functional programming .
PS
Anyone care to make my argument better or shoot it down ?
Cannabis addict gripped by paranoia stabbed a stranger to death in the street
Victim : Devoe Roach was stabbed through the heart
A cannabis addict gripped by paranoid psychosis knifed a teenager to death in the street seconds after meeting him for the first time , a court has heard .
Imran Khan , 21 , admitted the manslaughter of 17 - year - old Devoe Roach but denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility .
Khan stabbed Mr Roach through the heart less than a minute after bumping into him in the street last March .
Psychiatrist Dr Mark Lyall told the Old Bailey that Khan was in the ' grips of a major psychiatric episode ' at the time of the killing .
Khan , whose mother is schizophrenic , has a genetic pre-disposition to mental illness which was emphasised by his regular heavy use of ' skunk ' .
' It is likely Mr Khan has paranoid schizophrenia , it is sometimes difficult to tell when people are in the early stages of severe mental illness and that is the position with Mr Khan , but I am sure he has paranoid psychosis , ' said the doctor .
Jurors were told Khan looked at the world through a ' paranoid filter ' which impacted on the way he reacted to life .
He heard voices in his head and believed people were out to kill him , it was said .
In the months before he stabbed Devoe , he had removed the handle from the outside of his bedroom door so it could only be opened from the inside .
Khan , who is married with a young daughter , had left his wife ' petrified by his erratic behaviour ' .
Dr Lyall interviewed his grandmother and aunt who said he would mumble and talk to himself , bang his head against walls , stare and laugh uncontrollably to himself .
He had trouble sleeping , ate little and spent much of his time in his bedroom smoking weed .
He armed himself with a knife whenever he went out in public .
Dr Lyall said : ' Mr Khan had two major risk factors for the development of paranoid psychosis .
' There is a strong family history of paranoid psychosis which afflicted his mother and also an aunt and on top of that there is his persistent and heavy use of strong cannabis . '
In an interview with the psychiatrist , Khan revealed he first took ecstasy when he was 11 and smoked cannabis from the age of 12 .
His use of skunk was ' particularly heavy ' in the three years leading up to his arrest for murder , the court was told .
He smoked two joints before killing Devoe last March , having woken up at 6.30 am and left the house to avoid going out when it was busy .
Paranoid : Imran Khan , 21 , killed teenager Devoe Roach , who he just met in the street , after years of smoking ' skunk ' cannabis ( file photo )
Khan told Dr Lyall he became paranoid that Devoe and his friend were watching him as he crossed Stamford Hill , north London .
They confronted each other when Devoe asked : ' What are you looking at ? '
' He said he tried to walk away but Mr Roach followed him , ' the psychiatrist said .
' He was panicking , paranoid , he felt anxious , his palms were sweaty , his heart was breathing fast and his was breathing quickly .
' He could n't remember exactly what happened next but he recalls Mr Roach running his mouth .
' Mr Khan took out the knife he carried with him .
He told me he was n't angry and did n't swing the knife around however Mr Roach fell over and before he got up Mr Khan ran off . '
The court heard he had ' changed greatly ' in the 15 months before the stabbing , according to his aunt and grandmother who cared for him .
His strange behaviour forced some of his extended family to cut short visits to his home .
At the time of the killing his grandmother had flown to Pakistan and left him with his wife , who he called ' an enemy ' , and child in the care of his aunt .
She had tried repeatedly to contact his GP about his behaviour ' but no help was forthcoming ' .
When he was arrested , a doctor who examined him said Khan suffered from psychosis ' due to excess skunk use since the age of 13 ' .
Dr Lyall said : ' It is difficult to tell for certain what is likely to have caused the paranoid psychosis .
He had a very strong genetic predisposition to psychosis and the use of cannabis caused the illness to develop . '
Michael Holland QC , prosecuting , has told jurors they would have to decide whether Khan 's condition impaired his responsibility for the killing .
Devoe , who lived with his mother in Stoke Newington , bled to death after the knife wound penetrated one of the major chambers of his heart .
A doctor then performed open heart surgery on the pavement , but the teenager was pronounced dead at hospital just after 11am .
Khan , from Stamford Hill , north London , denies murder .
He will not be giving evidence .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Obama said Sunday that his administration remains prepared to order strikes against " high - value " targets within Pakistan .
President Obama makes a statement on Afghanistan and Pakistan on Friday at the White House .
Obama reiterated a previous assertion that the U.S. military would pursue extremists within Pakistan 's borders after consulting with the Pakistani government .
The U.S. policy does n't change American recognition of Pakistan 's " sovereign government , " Obama said during an appearance on CBS 's " Face the Nation . "
But the United States needs to hold that government " more accountable . "
" This is going to be hard , " he added .
" I 'm under no illusions . "
Obama said his administration remains determined to weaken or destroy al Qaeda until it no longer presents a threat to the United States .
He added that his administration is prepared to continually adjust its strategy in Pakistan and Afghanistan as necessary .
Watch top Obama aides describe plans for the region »
On Friday , Obama announced a new plan for the region encompassing Pakistan and Afghanistan .
It calls for , among other things , more U.S. troops , greater economic assistance , improved Afghan troop training , and added civilian expertise to defeat the " terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks . "
" Let me be clear : Al Qaeda and its allies -- the terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks -- are in Pakistan and Afghanistan , " he said Friday .
" Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al Qaeda is actively planning attacks on the U.S. homeland from its safe haven in Pakistan . "
He added that " al Qaeda and its extremist allies are a cancer that risks killing Pakistan from within . "
Obama specifically announced plans to send another 4,000 troops to Afghanistan along with hundreds of civilian specialists , such as agricultural experts , educators and engineers .
The troops -- who are in addition to the 17,000 the president announced earlier would be sent to Afghanistan -- will be charged with training and building the Afghan army and police force .
Sunday , Obama warned that America 's military commitment to Afghanistan would not be open - ended .
" It 's not going to be an open - ended commitment of infinite resources .
We 've just got to make sure that we are focused on achieving what we need , " Obama said during the CBS interview .
" What I will not do is to simply assume that more troops always results in an improved situation , " the president said .
On Friday , Obama also called for legislation authorizing " $ 1.5 billion in direct support to the Pakistani people every year over the next five years -- resources that will build schools , roads and hospitals and strengthen Pakistan 's democracy . "
The president added that " we will ask our friends and allies to do their part , " including at a donors ' conference in Tokyo , Japan , next month .
He also said the United States would work with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and others to help Pakistan get through the economic crisis .

As the administration presses forward on many fronts , Kathleen Sebelius reasserts , in her prepared testimony today , that health care reform remains a priority :
I share the President ’s conviction that “ health care reform cannot wait , it must not wait , and it will not wait another year . ”
Inaction is not an option .
The status quo is unacceptable , and unsustainable .
Also :
The President ’s budget submitted in February continues the work begun in the Recovery Act .
It dedicates $ 634 billion over 10 years to reforming the health care system .
Its specific proposals would align payment incentives with quality , promote accountability and efficiency , and encourage shared responsibility .
The President recognizes that while a major commitment , the reserve fund is not sufficient to fully fund comprehensive reform .
He is committed to working with Congress to find additional resources to devote to health care reform .
The President is also committed to hearing from Americans across the nation .
In March , he held a White House health care forum and several regional forums in places like Iowa , Vermont , and North Carolina .
There , bipartisan forums brought together people from all perspectives – across the political spectrum and representing all people with a stake in the system – to focus on solutions .
We appreciate the tremendous leadership of this committee to address this urgent challenge .
The leadership in Congress is getting to work to solve this great challenge for our nation , and we hope to see action in the coming months .
Should I be confirmed , health reform would be my mission – as it is the President ’s – along with the tremendous responsibility of running this critical Department .
And so , I would like to highlight a few of the opportunities and challenges currently facing the Department .
When we get scratched , our skin can repair itself .
Nonliving coatings can't currently do the same thing , so we can not put self - repairing surfaces on cars , cell phones , laptops , and many other items .
As the commercial applications are numerous and the financial payoffs are potentially huge , material scientists have been actively developing polymers that can self - heal .
Everything from nanoparticles to expandable gels have been tried .
While some of the developments are certainly promising , nothing is quite at the stage where it 's ready to be commercialized .
In today ’s issue of Science , Biswajit Ghosh and Marek Urban from the University of Southern Mississippi present a new polymer design that can employ UV light from the Sun to activate a latent self - pair capacity .
Their strategy involves using the combined functions of three chemical components .
At the core of their design is polyurethane , which is an elastic polymer that already has decent scratch resistance .
To enhance its ability to withstand mechanical damage , Ghosh and Urban added two more components , OXE and CHI .
OXE has an unstable chemical structure ( a four - membered ring containing three carbons and one oxygen ) that makes it prone to being split open .
CHI is UV sensitive .
The idea is that , if the polyurethane gets damaged by a scratch , the unstable ring structure of OXE will open to create two reactive ends .
Then , UV light can trigger CHI to form new links with the reactive ends of OXE and thereby fix the break in the polymer .
Ghosh and Urban purposefully created scratches in films of their polyurethane - CHI - OXE material and tested to see if it mended itself under UV light .
When they placed the damaged film under a 120 W fluorescent UV lamp , the scratches became negligible within half an hour .
This repair reaction can work under a variety of conditions , ranging from dry air to high humidity .
IR and optical images of a self - healing scratch .

They estimated that the UV lamps used in the experiments generated about a 0.3 W/m2 per nm power density , which is only a little more than what the Sun gives off on average ( 0.25 W / m2 per nm ) .
Thus , they propose that the repair would take about the same amount of time under sunlight .
Of course , the time of the year would matter — the process could take much less time under the harsh summer sun or much longer on a gloomy winter day .
The ability to use natural sunlight for self - repair and the simple design are advantageous , but this polymer system still needs some work before it can be released commercially .
For example , the authors must figure out what happens if a second scratch occurs directly where a previous scratch was mended .
They also need to determine the shelf life of their three - component polymer .

It will use my bytecode DSL " BiteScript " , just like Duby does
It will use the * runtime * definition of a class to generate the Java version
# myruby.rb
require ' rbconfig '
class MyRubyClass
def helloWorld
puts " Hello from Ruby "
end
if Config:: CONFIG [ ' host_os ' ] =~ /mswin32/
def goodbyeWorld ( a )
puts a
end
else
def nevermore ( * a )
puts a
end
end
end
Here we have a class that defines two methods .
The first , always defined , is helloWorld .
The second is conditionally either goodbyeWorld or nevermore , based on whether we 're on Windows .
Yes , it 's a contrived example ... bear with me .
The compiler2 prototype can be invoked as follows ( assuming bitescript is checked out into ../ bitescript ) :
jruby - I ../bitescript/lib/ tool/compiler2.rb MyObject MyRubyClass myruby
A breakdown of these arguments is as follows :
- I ../ bitescript / lib includes bitescript
tool / compiler2.rb is the compiler itself
MyObject is the name we'd like the Java class to have
MyRubyClass is the name of the Ruby class we want it to front
myruby is the library we want it to require to load that class Running this on OS X and dumping the resulting Java class gives us :
Compiled from " MyObject.java.rb "
public class MyObject extends org.jruby.RubyObject{
static {} ;
public MyObject ( ) ;
public org.jruby.runtime.builtin.IRubyObject helloWorld ( ) ;
public org.jruby.runtime.builtin.IRubyObject nevermore(org.jruby.runtime.builtin.IRubyObject [ ] ) ;
}
The first thing to notice is that the compiler has generated a method for nevermore , since I 'm not on Windows .
I believe this will be unique among dynamic languages on the JVM : we will make the * runtime * set of methods available through the Java type , not just the static set present at compile time .
Because there are no type signatures specified for MyRubyClass , all types have defaulted to IRubyObject .
Type signature logic will come along shortly .
And notice also this extends RubyObject ; a limitation of the current setup is that you wo n't be able to use compiler2 to create subclasses .
That will come later .
Once you 've run this , you 've got a MyObject that can be instantiated and used directly .
Behind the scenes , it uses a global JRuby instance , so JRuby 's still there and you still need it in classpath , but you wo n't have to instantiate a runtime , pass it around , and so on .
It should make integrating JRuby into Java frameworks that want a real class much easier .
So , thoughts ?
Questions ?
Have a look at the code under

Questions ?
Have a look at the code under tool / compiler2.rb in JRuby 's repository .
The entire compiler is so far only 78 lines of Ruby code .
" Compiler # 2 " as it has been affectionately called is a compiler to turn normal Ruby classes into Java classes , so they can be constructed and called by normal Java code .
When I asked for 1.3 priorities , this came out way at the top .
Tom thought perhaps I asked for trouble putting it on the list , and he 's probably right ( like asking " prioritize these : sandwich , pencil , shiny gold ring with 5kt diamond , banana " ) , but I know this has been a pain point for people .
I have just landed an early prototype of the compiler on trunk .
I made a few decisions about it today :
The second point is an important one .
Instead of having an offline compiler that inspects a file and generates code from it , the compiler will actually used the runtime class to create a Java version .
This means you 'll be able to use all the usual metaprogramming facilities , and at whatever point the compiler picks up your class it will see all those methods .
Here 's an example :
this happened in england in june 2006 at the riverside park , it killed 2 women and injured many , it was shown to the jury at Newcastle crown court , england , as part of the trial into Maurice Agis
On the same day the House whooped through a 90 % surtax on some bonuses , Bloomberg News reported that Democratic Rep. Pete Stark , a House eminento from California , may have been improperly claiming residency in Maryland to get a tax break .
As you might guess , Maryland 's tax bite is n't as deep as wonderful California's .
This follows on news reports last week that Democratic New York Congressman Eliot Engel has been told by Maryland authorities he too may not claim his suburban Maryland home as his primary residence for tax purposes .
The AP noted , " Engel is n't the only politician who 's been found to be improperly receiving ...
I think the news that Flash is coming to smartphones over the next year is a big deal .
Most of the rich media experiences I have on the web are in Flash .
YouTube 's success had a lot to do with its choice of Flash for its video player .
Now almost every video site on the web uses a Flash video player .
The same is true of audio .
It used to be that when you wanted to listen to streaming audio , you had to use Windows Media Player , the Real player , or a link to iTunes .
But all that 's gone , thanks again to Flash .
Whether it 's Last.fm , Pandora , most radio station Web streams , or hypemachine , you are listening via Flash .
I have been able to port most of my web activity pretty seamlessly to a smartphone , either iPhone or BlackBerry .
But the one thing I 've not been able to replicate is the seamless experiences of watching video or listening to streaming audio on my phone ( downloading an app to listen to music is not seamless ) .
I realize that the mobile networks may not yet be ready for hundreds of millions of people watching or listening to streaming media on their smartphones , but they will be someday and getting Flash onto smartphones is going to accelerate the demand for this .
It 's also true that a lot of the interesting new desktop apps like Twhirl and TweetDeck are written for AIR , Flash 's runtime cousin for the desktop .
I 'd love to have apps like this on my smartphone too .
So it 's very exciting to me that Flash is making a big move over the next year onto smartphones .
I 'm also very excited to see Nokia and Adobe creating the Open Screen Project and Open Screen Fund to promote an open and consistent experience for web browsing and mobile apps across mobile devices .
The mobile web needs to be just like the Web for innovation to flourish and capital to flow .
Which takes me back to the title of this post .
I believe Apple is making a mistake by snubbing Adobe 's desire to get Flash on the iPhone .
And I believe Apple does n't share in Adobe and Nokia 's vision of an open and consistent experience for Web browsing and mobile apps .
It seems to me that Apple is interested in replicating its iTunes / iPod strategy it used to dominate digital music to dominate the mobile web .
I do n't think that will work .
In fact , I do n't think the iTunes / iPod strategy has much life left in it .
Things like Pandora , MySpace Music , music blogging , and other forms of streaming music will eventually chip away at that franchise .
But leaving the digital music situation alone for the moment , the mobile web is not going to be dominated by a single device and a single app ecosystem .
I do n't even think an app ecosystem is the long term solution for the mobile web .
It 's a bridge enviroment that allows for rich experiences on devices that do n't have reliable high bandwidth connections yet .
But the mobile web will eventually just be the web .
And a big part of getting it there is to get the tools that allow us to seamlessly consume rich media on the web onto mobile devices .
To me that means Flash .
I 'm rooting for Adobe and its allies like Nokia and Palm ( and hopefully BlackBerry ) to win this game .
If they do , we 'll all be much better off because of it .

Chris Dodd ’s Wife Was a Director for an AIG Owned Company
Oh what a tangled web we weave , when first we practice to deceive .
That quote from Sir Walter Scott is particularly poignant in the case of Chris Dodd and the AIG bonuses .
Let me try to recap the link between Chris Dodd and the AIG bonuses that have ignited the populist fires .
AIG accepts federal bailout money
Chris Dodd writes the amendment to the stimulus bill that limits executive pay for companies that accept bailout money .
This same amendment exempts executive bonuses , allowing AIG to pay their employees the bonuses that they are contractually bound to .
The House and Senate pass the stimulus without reading it
The president signs the stimulus without reading it
AIG pays the bonuses that Chris Dodd ’s amendment required to be paid
The people are outraged
Obama is outraged , as is the house and senate
Politicians blame AIG and greed
It is learned that Chris Dodd wrote the amendment that guaranteed the bonuses
Chris Dodd denies he wrote the amendment
Chris Dodd admits he wrote the amendment but that the wording was changed from what he had written and nobody knows who changed it
Chris Dodd admits that he wrote the amendment that was voted on but someone in the Obama administration told him to
We learn that Chris Dodd was the largest recipient of campaign donations from AIR
We learn that Obama is number two on that list
If the chronological events listed above were not enough to make you believe that Dodd and Obama had an interest in making sure that the AIG executives received their bonuses perhaps this story about Chris Dodd ’s wife will make you a believer .
In addition to being the politician that AIG contributed the most money to it appears as though Chris Dodd ’s wife was on the board of an AIG controlled company .
Is n’t that quite the coincidence ?
What are the chances that the man who agreed to let AIG pay out the bonuses that have come under fire just happened to be the largest recipient of campaign donations ?
And what are the chances that the largest recipient of AIG campaign donations just happens to have a wife who worked on the board ?
It all must be a big coincidence .
Right ?
So the whole news world was up in arms recently because of this newscast referring to Barack and Michelle Obama " fisting " each other in the White House , the speaker blissfully unaware of the unsettling slang definition of the term .
And while we can all laugh at that lady and her obliviousness , the truth is there are all sorts of everyday words that , in the right crowd , will draw the same muffled laughter as the fisting gaffe up there .
Such as ...

This year the Academy attempted to give their presentations a sense of legacy .
By having a wave of presenters who represented past winners in the category , nominees got a sense of the talent that the winner would be joining .
In theory it was a nice idea , giving a grander sense to the history of the Oscars .
In practice , however , it was a disaster , replacing the typical clips that show why a person was nominated with long winded speeches about why the person was nominated .
Hopefully , this is a disaster the Academy will avoid in the future .
How could such an excellent idea be executed so terribly ?
Actually , the execution should n’t surprise us .
It feels like every time the Academy attempts to pay homage to its long history , the viewers suffer , whether it ’s lining up all of the living Oscar winners to recognize their former accomplishments , or having five different presenters honor the current nominees with praise .
Here specifically are a few reasons why this year ’s attempt at presenting nominees was a big mistake .
I know quite a few actors who love their job because they get to bring someone else ’s words to life .
They get to create a character , but do n’t have to figure out what to say themselves .
Not that I ’m giving full credit to the presenters for what they had to say about their respective nominees ( I ’m sure they had writers helping them ) , but this complimentary presentation style put too much emphasis on the opinions of the presenters .
Winning an Oscar in the past does n’t give their opinion more power than others , particularly those whose job is to give their opinions .
Besides , I do n’t think there was a single presenter up there who does n’t have an embarrassing selection somewhere in their career , showing their opinion may not always be the best .
Leave the critiques of performances to those who are n’t judged on their own performances .
The Oscar presentation should be about the nominees - recognizing those who have accomplished the best from the previous year , and singling out the best of the best .
That ’s all part of that , “ it ’s an honor just to be nominated , ” bit , right ?
By putting so much focus on the award presenters , it shifts the spotlight off of those nominated and onto the presenters .
I know in my household we stopped paying attention to the nominees and started guessing who was going to present - would they pick Sally Field ( whose Oscar classic acceptance moment was n’t even used in the montage ) or Halle Berry ?
Berry , by the way , did n’t help the spotlight being shifted at all , by comparing her nominee ’s film ( Melissa Leo in ) to her own Oscar nomination .
Who is this evening about , Berry or Leo ?
It would have done well for the presenter to remember that .
Obviously , the intent of having five former winners present the awards was to build a sense of legacy - these are all people who previously won , and soon another will join them .
While it might be cool receiving compliments from the like of Sir Anthony Hopkins or Tilda Swinton , not everyone wants to get their praise from former winners .
Look at Robert Downey Jr , who had his nomination presented by Cuba Gooding Jr , who has followed up his Academy win with movies like , and , and who proceeded to turn his compliments of Downey into a ( hopefully humorous ) complaint about taking roles away from black people .
Just because these people won an award in the past does n’t always make them a proud example of what an Oscar winner should be .
One of the repeating jokes of the evening was how host Hugh Jackman and presenters like Jack Black had n’t actually seen all of the movies nominated for Oscars - a sentiment I ’d say probably holds true for a lot of the viewing audience .
I always look forward to the Oscars ’ awards presentations because they put a spotlight on one key moment of the film - an outstanding performance or pivotal creation on film .
Often , the power of that one brief clip is what compels me to finally see a movie I had put off or otherwise ignored .
This year we got no clips , especially in the acting categories , so I do n’t feel all that intrigued in finding outsome of these winners took top honors .
If I were a studio exec , I ’d be more than slightly annoyed with this presentation format , knowing that losing out on that brief screen time may have just cost me additional ticket sales or rentals .

SEOUL , Feb 5 ( Reuters ) - North Korea may be preparing to test fire its longest range ballistic missile , possibly toward Japan , media reports have said .
( For a full story , double - click on [ ID : nSP393526 )
Here are questions and answers as to why North Korea might test launch its Taepodong - 2 missile :
WHAT DOES THE NORTH STAND TO GAIN BY LAUNCHING THIS MISSILE ?
If the launch is successful , North Korea will have a missile with a maximum estimated range of 6,700 km ( 4,200 miles ) , designed to carry a nuclear warhead that can hit U.S. territory but not the continental 48 states .
This would for the first time pose a direct security threat by the North to the United States .
The North , which already has hundreds of rudimentary missiles , would be able to test its multi-stage rocket systems and increase its ability to produce long - range missiles .
HOW BIG A THREAT IS THE TAEPODONG -2 ?
The only time North Korea has fired the missile was in 2006 when it managed just a few seconds of controlled flight and broke apart in less than a minute .
It has a crude multi-stage design and poor guidance system and takes weeks to prepare for launch .
U.S. spy satellites can easily monitor the preparations and it should be relatively easy to destroy long before launch .
Experts have said North Korea does not yet have the technology to miniaturise a nuclear device to use as a warhead .
But the North has been working on placing biological and chemical weapons on missiles .
WHAT DOES NORTH KOREA RISK BY TEST - FIRING THE MISSILE ?
Another failed launch would be a major embarrassment for Pyongyang which has little beyond its military threat to win concessions from the outside world .
That , and the high cost for the impoverished state , may make it reluctant to risk a second launch .
Its leaders may be happy to simply imply a threat by moving around missile - related equipment , knowing it will be seen by U.S. intelligence and raise alarm with the new U.S. government .
On the other hand , the international community has few options left to punish the North for a launch .
North Korea is already subject to U.N. sanctions stemming from its 2006 ballistic missile test in July and nuclear test a few months after that .
The United States has already called for a suspension of aid promised under a six - way nuclear deal while Japan and South Korea have blocked channels that sent cash and food to the impoverished state .
WHAT WILL NORTH KOREA SAY ABOUT THE LAUNCH ?
North Korea will likely claim that a launch of the Taepodong - 2 is for its civilian space and satellite programme and argue that under international law , it has the right to peacefully explore space .
It will argue that its rival Japan already has a rocket programme and its neighbour South Korea is developing one .
A successful launch would be portrayed as a mighty symbol of leader Kim Jong - il 's ideas and shore up his leadership after a suspected stroke in August raised questions about his grip on power .
The North would also tell its people that it has launched a rocket to carry a satellite ahead of its rich Southern neighbour while signalling to new U.S. President Barack Obama that Pyongyang should not be ignored .
WHEN MIGHT A LAUNCH TAKE PLACE
The North may time a launch to coincide with a meeting on March 8 of its Supreme People 's Assembly .
Its state media has been heralding the event and the role leader Kim will play .
It would be difficult for the North to launch one by the time of Kim 's 67th birthday in Feb. 16 .
Another possible date is April 25 , the anniversary of its Korea People 's Army .

When lower level government officials are the gift - givers , the purchases are usually made with state money , or are paid for by private entrepreneurs .
“ The government officials are not really buying it  they have modest incomes , ” said Radha Chadha , co-author of “ The Cult of the Luxury Brand ” and an expert on luxury brands in Asia .
“ Somebody else does the buying and gifts the stuff to them . ”
That is what is apparently happening in Beijing this month as party cadres and their friends search out brand names like Ferragamo , Dior and Cartier .
Luxury companies celebrate these few weeks for the holiday - like boost in sales they provide .
But China publicly condemns such corruption .
When asked whether such gift - giving takes place , Chinese officials offer strong denials .
“ Where have you heard this crazy news ? ” said Jiang Hongbo , a media relations official working with delegates from Heilongjiang Province in northeast China .
Yang Zhi , a liaison official from the Xinjiang region in far western China , was more indignant .
“ Do you think it ’s possible we are busy sending gifts and hobnobbing with officials during such serious meetings ? ” he said .
Publicly , big luxury brands are tight - lipped about the practice of gift - giving in China .
Louis Vuitton declined to comment this week , as did Salvatore Ferragamo .
Many other leading brands did not return phone calls .
Jonathan Seliger , managing director in China for Dunhill , was circumspect when asked about purchases intended for government officials .
“ Dunhill has always been a popular brand among Chinese businessmen and government officials , ” he said .

The MSL finals are almost here .
- I ’m still not on the stage yet , so for now , I do n’t really feel anything …it ’s just like usual …
This is the first time you ’re entering the finals , you seem excited .
- This is the first time , so I need to win it , and get a good beginning … when you see all the second - place finishers , it ’s really depressing …[ laugh ]
Your opponent is Jangbi .
- He is a very strong opponent , but I think as long as I prepare , I can beat him .
Thoughts on the maps ?
- Whatever .
Seems like they ’re advantageous to me .
I personally did n’t like Sin Chupung - Ryeong , even though there ’s a Zerg advantage … so during the preparation process , I guess I grew to like it … I have n’t really practiced that map a lot , but after practicing , I discovered that the map ’s pretty good as Zerg .
There are 2 or 3 other maps that have a Zerg advantage , so from the map standpoint , I have an edge .
You ’ve had great momentum lately .
- Recently I ’ve got in the zone and wanted to work harder than everyone else , so I often practice until very late , and I believe that hard work will pay off .
What ’s the most important part of this final ?
- The first match might determine it …in most Bo5 ’s , whoever wins the first game tends to win the series .
If I win the first game , I would have confidence for maybe even a sweep …
Your game has been steadily improving in BoX ’s lately .
- Before , when I failed twice in these BoX’s , I was put on the same team as Nada for an All - Star game , and learned a lot from him about techniques for BoX’s .
He gave me a lot of suggestions that have helped me a lot .
Back then , I played the game with naivety .
Now , I ’ve been thinking a lot more , and improved a lot in terms of mindgames , so I ’ve been having good results .
Your team has high expectations for you .
- I do n’t view these kind of expectations as pressure , because it ’s not only for the team , I myself also want to win .
After the MSL finals you ’ll have Winner ’s League Playoffs , do you feel pressured ?
- I ’ve been preparing for both .
I reduced my downtime to practice more … ForGG has some pressure I think , but he is very capable of winning , and he came from Oz .
I think he will put up a good fight .
Word before the games ?
- I ’ve never been able to stand on the finals stage before , and messed up a lot …now that I ’m finally here , I will practice hard and show everyone the face of a champion .
Anything to say to Jangbi ?
- I heard you ’ve been practicing hard , but I want to say , if you want to give me a good fight , you need to practice at least 2 - 3 times more than me , so I hope you practice hard .
[ laugh ]
---
Jangbi
You ’re almost at the finals , how do you feel ?
- Because of prior experience , it ’s nothing new .
The feeling ’s the same as preparing for the Ro8 and the Ro4 .
Unfortunately , you got second last season .
- It ’s very regretful … I ’m really curious to what it feels like to win , and now that the opportunity ’s in front of me again , I want it more than ever .
You do n’t believe that mindgames are very important in Bo3 ’s and Bo5s .
- I never really took note of stuff like that .
Even though I have a lot of room to improve , I personally believe that if you lost in a BoX , it ’s just because your opponent prepared better than you .
People say you did well in terms of mindgames in the match against Stork .
- To be honest , I cracked .
I usually play very safely , but I gambled a lot , and prepared all - in strategies .
Good thing it had a good result …
Thoughts on Luxury ?
- Even though I have n’t faced him , I can tell that he ’s an offensive player .
I will take note of all - in strategies and prepare accordingly .
Stork played against Luxury a lot .
- After the Ro4 ended , I took Stork hyung out for a drink .
The awkward situation diffused itself completely , he said he would help me with everything he has .
[ laugh ]
Even though I won , I ’m really sorry , and , thank him .
You ’re labeled as one of the Kings of Second Place .

Thoughts on the map order ?

Stork hyung says that the second map , Carthage , is way too difficult .
If you ca n’t win the first game , you ’ll be even more disadvantaged in the second game .

- I ’m still not on the stage yet , so for now , I do n’t really feel anything …it ’s just like usual …- This is the first time , so I need to win it , and get a good beginning … when you see all the second - place finishers , it ’s really depressing …[ laugh ] - He is a very strong opponent , but I think as long as I prepare , I can beat him .
-Whatever .
Seems like they ’re advantageous to me .
I personally did n’t like Sin Chupung - Ryeong , even though there ’s a Zerg advantage … so during the preparation process , I guess I grew to like it … I have n’t really practiced that map a lot , but after practicing , I discovered that the map ’s pretty good as Zerg .
There are 2 or 3 other maps that have a Zerg advantage , so from the map standpoint , I have an edge .
- Recently I ’ve got in the zone and wanted to work harder than everyone else , so I often practice until very late , and I believe that hard work will pay off .
- The first match might determine it …in most Bo5 ’s , whoever wins the first game tends to win the series .
If I win the first game , I would have confidence for maybe even a sweep … - Before , when I failed twice in these BoX’s , I was put on the same team as Nada for an All - Star game , and learned a lot from him about techniques for BoX’s .
He gave me a lot of suggestions that have helped me a lot .
Back then , I played the game with naivety .
Now , I ’ve been thinking a lot more , and improved a lot in terms of mindgames , so I ’ve been having good results .
- I do n’t view these kind of expectations as pressure , because it ’s not only for the team , I myself also want to win .
- I ’ve been preparing for both .
I reduced my downtime to practice more … ForGG has some pressure I think , but he is very capable of winning , and he came from Oz .
I think he will put up a good fight .
- I ’ve never been able to stand on the finals stage before , and messed up a lot …now that I ’m finally here , I will practice hard and show everyone the face of a champion .
- I heard you ’ve been practicing hard , but I want to say , if you want to give me a good fight , you need to practice at least 2 - 3 times more than me , so I hope you practice hard .
[ laugh ] ---- Because of prior experience , it ’s nothing new .
The feeling ’s the same as preparing for the Ro8 and the Ro4 .
- It ’s very regretful … I ’m really curious to what it feels like to win , and now that the opportunity ’s in front of me again , I want it more than ever .
- I never really took note of stuff like that .
Even though I have a lot of room to improve , I personally believe that if you lost in a BoX , it ’s just because your opponent prepared better than you .
- To be honest , I cracked .
I usually play very safely , but I gambled a lot , and prepared all - in strategies .
Good thing it had a good result …
- Even though I have n’t faced him , I can tell that he ’s an offensive player .
I will take note of all - in strategies and prepare accordingly .
- After the Ro4 ended , I took Stork hyung out for a drink .
The awkward situation diffused itself completely , he said he would help me with everything he has .
[ laugh ]
Even though I won , I ’m really sorry , and , thank him .
- I ’ve seen those opinions , I view them as jokes .
I think a lot of people probably wish that I was one of those players [ laugh ]
But honestly , I definitely will not be .
Winning is the way to go .
-The maps are Zerg favored , so I need to win the first game .

Vuze , the popular BitTorrent client formerly known as Azureus , has received a major update which allows users to automatically convert and play downloaded videos on the iPhone , iPod , Xbox 360 and the PS3 .
" Now playing , on all your screens " is Vuze 's new tagline .
Over the past year , Vuze has been slowly transitioning to an all - in - one BitTorrent application where users can search , download and play videos from the Vuze network and other torrent sites .
The latest addition to the client takes yet another step forward .
The BitTorrent client has added a new feature that integrates Vuze with several media devices .
It allows users to automatically convert and transfer downloaded videos to iTunes , and stream the files to the Xbox 360 and PS3 .
“ With today ’s release , we ’re unlocking HD content and giving it wings to get from the computer to the other screens in our lives : TV and Mobile , ” Vuze CEO Gilles BianRosa told TorrentFreak .
“ We think this is a big deal because a large majority of our users actually have these devices at home .
Also , consumers want to control and own their content , an ‘ Open Home Theater ’ , if you will . ”
Vuze currently supports Apple devices including the iPhone and the iPod .
The PS3 and Xbox 360 are the two gaming consoles that integrate with Vuze as well .
More devices may be added in the future but no decisions have yet been made on which ones , Torrent Freak was told .
In a recent poll , most Vuze users indicated that iPhone / iPod support was most wanted .
Vuze ’s integrated device support
Once device support is turned on in Vuze , users can drag and drop downloaded video onto their device of choice .
Vuze will then convert the video into the appropriate format and add it to the device ’s library .
For iTunes , Vuze will import the video into your iTunes library so it can be transferred to your iPhone , iPod or Apple TV .
For the PS3 and Xbox 360 , Vuze will stream the videos from your PC or Mac directly to your game console .
Drag and Drop to convert video and transfer it to any device
The device support is a great feature for users who want to have an easy all - in - one solution that not only downloads video , but also makes it ready to play on other devices .
Although Vuze has been focusing mainly on video lately , the client can still download other content as well .
It is good to see that Vuze is using the feedback from its users to improve their client , although it is impossible to please everyone and some may still prefer a more lightweight client .
That said , the Vuze all - in - one solution will especially appeal to novice BitTorrent users , but even for the most die - hard users the new features will make a great addition .

Prop. 8 baker claims Chronicle caused hate mail
Making the rounds in the blogosphere is the tale by Maureen Mullarkey , who supported Proposition 8 , the measure approved by California voters in November that bans same - sex marriage in the state .
Mullarkey 's story , titled " The New Blacklist " and published in the conservative Weekly Standard magazine , starts like this :
" Strange times we live in when it takes a ballot initiative to confirm the definition of marriage as the union of a man and a woman .
Stranger still when endorsing that definition through the democratic process brings threats and reprisals .
" In November , the San Francisco Chronicle published the names and home addresses of everyone who donated money in support of California 's Proposition 8 marriage initiative .
All available information , plus the amount donated , was broadcast .
My name is on that list . "
Mullarkey said The Chronicle report resulted in vile harassment and threats that came to her home .
" It is one thing to read hate - filled mail on a computer screen .
It is something else to have it in hand , " she wrote .
" At the end of the week , when it started coming to my house , I filed a police report . "
But her version of the facts is n't true .
The newspaper did not print her home address or the addresses of other donors .
Mullarkey , an artist , contributed $ 1,000 to the Prop. 8 cause .
But her donation to a statewide initiative was public information , available on the Web site of the California secretary of state .
The Prop. 8 donor database , which was provided to newspapers by the Associated Press , did n't include Prop. 8 supporters alone , as Mullarkey strongly suggested .
It was weighted 2 - 1 in the other direction , including 96,000 records of donors who were against Prop. 8 and 46,000 in favor of it .

Ancient male fish may have had a long , articulated organ for mating .
Placoderms may have copulated in a similar way to sharks .
The Museum of Victoria
Fish swimming 380 million years ago may have engaged in penetrative sex in a manner similar to modern sharks , a new study has revealed .
The finding , discussed in a Nature video , also shows that reproduction by internal fertilization was much more widespread in early jawed vertebrates than was previously believed1 .
John Long of Monash University in Clayton , Australia , and Kate Trinajstic of the University of Western Australia in Perth had previously been part of a team that discovered small plates of armour inside a number of fossilized armour - plated placoderm fishes2 .
The group showed that , rather than being dinner , these smaller plates were actually embryos ( See : The oldest pregnant mum ) .
Now , along with Zerina Johanson of London 's Natural History Museum , they show that the pelvic girdles of one species of extinct placoderm — Incisoscutum ritchiei — may have had long , articulated pieces of cartilage attached , which the fish could have used during copulation in a similar way to the claspers that male sharks use to penetrate females .
" We have an expression that humans like to get a leg over , " Long says .
" But these placoderms actually like to get a leg in . "
Walter Shapiro , writing on The New Republic , takes a dive into President Barack Obama ’s press conference last night and concludes all of this media exposure is to set voters at ease .
“ It was telling politically that Obama 's strongest answers Tuesday night were in defense of his budget -- the issue that is almost certain to dominate Congressional debates and the TV talk shows in the weeks ahead .
When a questioner invoked Republican outrage over the deficits that even Obama 's budget concedes will pass the $ 7 - trillion mark over the next decade ( the Congressional Budget Office last Friday estimated $ 9.3 trillion in red ink ) , ...
Fears of a depression and an anxiety epidemic , caused by the recession , are forcing the government to offer psychological help to millions of people facing unemployment , debt and relationship breakdown .
Sufferers will be referred to psychotherapists for expert counselling via an advice network linking Jobcentres , doctors ' surgeries and a new NHS Direct hotline .
Under the plan , which will involve training 3,600 more therapists and hundreds more specialist nurses , psychotherapy centres will be established in every primary care trust by the end of next year .
The moves , to be unveiled by health secretary Alan Johnson and work and pensions secretary James Purnell today , reflect growing anxiety in government that there will be a surge of people who become mentally ill and , as a result , could find themselves unemployed for the long term .
Johnson said last night that he was determined to go " further and faster " to help people who were " affected psychologically by the recession " .
He added : " In the current economic downturn , the potential exists for more people to become anxious or depressed .
If someone is feeling down after losing their job , the best solution is a new job and we are helping people find them wherever possible .
But , in some cases , depression and anxiety can be a barrier to getting another job . "
Johnson will announce that 81 " talking - therapy services " , offering cognitive behavioural therapy , a method by which people are encouraged to look more at potential solutions than the causes of their difficulties , will be set up this year - a 25 % increase on the planned number .
A network of employment support workers will be set up at every centre to give advice on how to get back to work .
While doctors will initially put sufferers in touch with therapists , ministers want to move towards a system in which people could refer themselves by walking into centres and asking for treatment .
Ministers have already pledged to invest £ 173 m to plug glaring gaps in the provision of mental health services .
But , as unemployment moves past the 2 million mark , much of the funding is to be accelerated and brought forward to this year , with the focus switching to mental health problems .
The NHS Direct phone service will be expanded , with nurses who are trained to spot signs of depression offering advice , while primary care trusts are to be told to use £ 80 m of savings accrued as a result of the cut in VAT to commission new debt advice and family counselling services .
Around 6 million adults in the UK currently suffer depression or anxiety , and many of these are on incapacity benefit .
Around 40 % of long - term sickness benefit claimants are known to be affected by depression .
Ministers are worried that past recessions have led to huge rises in the numbers of long - term unemployed .
Purnell said it was vital to tackle the issue early .
" We know pushing people onto inactive benefits can lead to a lifetime of dependency .
We are working across government to give the help people need to stay in , or get back to , work . "
Paul Corry , director of public affairs at mental health charity Rethink , said the moves were a welcome step .
But he urged government to do more .
" We are already seeing increasing numbers of distressed people contacting our advice service with fears that employers may target them for redundancy , with problems over home and debt - protection policies excluding mental health problems , and frustration that the jobs market is slamming doors in their faces .
" Fast - forwarding plans to roll out psychological services is a very welcome move , but we also need firm interventions in the labour market to stop employer discrimination , and with mortgage lenders to protect people 's homes from repossession . "
Claire Tyler , chief executive of Relate , a charity dealing with couples and family relationships , said it was essential that people were also informed by the government about charity help on offer :
" We have seen a substantial increase in demand for its emotional support services since the recession has hit home . "
Professor Richard Layard , a co-author of the London School of Economics ' Depression Report and a former adviser to government , said the moves to expand provision amounted to the " most important development in the treatment of mental health since the war " .
• Job cuts are on the cards at high street fashion retailer Principles after administrators announced that 66 stores were to close over the coming weeks .
Washington , DC / Rolling Stone Magazine / Business - Entrepreneur Section -
A spokesperson for Michelle Obama said the First Lady was ecstatic that her Victory Garden , planted only last week to combat the higher cost of imported Marijuana from War Torn Mexico , was already paying dividends .
Following the opening of the White House Medical Marijuana Dispensary , Fat Boy Pharmacy , noted in The Spoof only a few weeks ago , the spokesman said Michelle became concerned when the street price of imported weed skyrocketed due to a military operation in Mexico which led to limited availability of the product as well as the loss of several thousand " Pot Heads " , decapitated in the resulting gang wars .
The garden , tended by a host of ACORN volunteers , a horde of Obama semi-related relatives from Kenya currently seeking Political Asylum , and fertilized by organic Water Buffalo Poop from the Washington Zoo , the crop has grown like crazy .
In addition to providing ample medication for the bipolar cabinet members , and mentally challenged congressional leaders , the relaxing weed has spurned another Obama profit center to compliment the T - Shirt , Bobble Head Doll , autographed book , and religious " Obama Rising " Statue mega business .
Cuttings from the miraculous plants are now available by mail order , and are said to be so popular that they are backordered .
Marketing experts said they have never seen such a public demand for a product since The Pet Rock , and the Chia Pet and even Billie Mays has said he would do infomercials for " next to nothing " just to be involved in the madness .
A great deal of the success , of course , must be given o Attorney General Eric Holder , who waived any penalties for selling " Mail Order Marijuana " , a ruling closely following his mandate making Washington , DC , the 13th place in the nation , along with 12 states , allowing medical marijuana to be sold .
Conservatives in town are n't so sure everything has been on the up and up in the White House since the Øbama Marketing Machine has taken over everything from Banks , to Electricity , Designing Detroit 's Vehicles , national health care , and now the legalized drug industry .
A mellow VP Joe Biden says everything is under control in the capitol .
" Just because you see a cloud over the capitol and in the Congressional Hallways does n't mean we 're Pot Heads ... with everything going our way , we 're just High On Life ! "
Biden shrugged off news reports surfacing today that his 27 year old daughter was caught on tape snorting 3 lines of coke at a private party .
" That was n't Ashley , " snorted the VP , " she 's got a good government job and would n't risk it over a few lines of blow , after all WE control the Drug Business in the White House now , and she would n't have to leave home without IT ! "
First Lady Michelle Obama is keeping pace with her hugely popular husband , earning positive ratings among more voters than previous first ladies have had at this stage in their husbands ’ terms .
Mrs. Obama gets favorable marks from 49 percent of voters in a CBS - New York Times poll out yesterday , with just 5 percent seeing her unfavorably .
Another 44 percent said they were undecided or needed more information about her .
Still , that has Mrs. Obama leading the recent pack of first ladies in approval numbers .
At the start of her husband ’s first term , Laura Bush had a 30 percent favorable rating .
Hillary Rodham Clinton , while she would go on to become a lightning rod for GOP criticism , began with a 44 percent approval rate when Bill Clinton took office in early 1993 , and had a disapproval rate of 16 percent .
Defense attorneys are for the first time submitting a controversial neurological lie-detection test as evidence in U.S. court .
In an upcoming juvenile - sex - abuse case in San Diego , the defense is hoping to get an fMRI scan , which shows brain activity based on oxygen levels , admitted to prove the abuse did n't happen .
The technology is used widely in brain research , but has n't been fully tested as a lie-detection method .
To be admitted into California court , any technique has to be generally accepted within the scientific community .
The company that did the brain scan , No Lie MRI , claims their test is over 90 percent accurate , but some scientists and lawyers are skeptical .
" The studies so far have been very interesting .
I think they deserve further research .
But the technology is very new , with very little research support , and no studies done in realistic situations , " Hank Greely , the head of the Center for Law and the Biosciences at Stanford , wrote in an e-mail to Wired.com .
Lie detection has tantalized lawyers since before the polygraph was invented in 1921 , but the accuracy of the tests has always been in question .
Greely noted that American courts and scientists have " 85 years of experience with the polygraph " and a wealth of papers that have tried to describe its accuracy .
Yet they are n't generally admissible in court , except in New Mexico .
Other attempts to spot deception using different brain signals continue , such as the EEG - based technique developed in India , where it has been used as evidence in court .
And last year , attorneys tried to use fMRI evidence for chronic pain in a worker 's compensation claim , but the case was settled out of court .
The San Diego case will be the first time fMRI lie-detection evidence , if admitted , is used in a U.S. court .
According to Emily Murphy , a behavioral neuroscientist at the Stanford Center for Law and the Biosciences who first reported on the fMRI evidence , the case is a child protection hearing to determine if the minor should stay in the home of the custodial parent accused of sexual abuse .
Apparently , the accused parent hired No Lie MRI , headquartered in San Diego with a testing facility in Tarzana , California , to do a brain scan .
The company 's report says fMRI tests show the defendant 's claim of innocence is not a lie .
The company declined to be interviewed for this story , but its founder and CEO , Joel Huizenga , spoke to Wired.com in September about the technology .
" This is the first time in human history that anybody has been able to tell if someone else is lying , " he said .
Though the company 's scientific board includes fMRI experts such as Christos Davatzikos , a radiologist at the University of Pennsylvania , some outside scientists and bioethicists question the reliability of the tests .
" Having studied all the published papers on fMRI - based lie detection , I personally would n't put any weight on it in any individual case .
We just do n't know enough about its accuracy in realistic situations , " Greely said .
Laboratory studies using fMRI , which measures blood - oxygen levels in the brain , have suggested that when someone lies , the brain sends more blood to the ventrolateral area of the prefrontal cortex .
In a very small number of studies , researchers have identified lying in study subjects with accuracy ranging from 76 percent to over 90 percent ( pdf ) .
But some scientists and lawyers like Greely doubt that those results will prove replicable outside the lab setting , and others say it just is n't ready yet .
" It 's certainly something that is going to evolve and continue to get better and at some point , it will be ready for prime time .
I 'm just not sure it 's really there right now , " said John Vanmeter , a neurologist at Georgetown 's Center for Functional and Molecular Imaging .
" On the other hand , maybe it 's good that it 's going to start getting tested in the court system .
It 's really been just a theoretical thing until now . "
No Lie MRI licensed its technology from psychiatrist Daniel Langleben of the University of Pennsylvania .
Langleben , like the company , declined to be interviewed for this article , but offered a recent editorial he co-authored in the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law on the " future of forensic functional brain imaging . "
From the editorial , it 's clear that Langleben is a bit uneasy that his work has been commercially applied .
He draws a clear distinction between " deception researchers " like himself and " the merchants of fMRI - based lie detection " and describes the " uneasy alliances between this industry and academia , brokered by university technology - commercialization departments . "
Langleben has pushed for large - scale trials to determine the efficacy of fMRI - based deception - spotting .
But in an interview conducted in late 2007 , he doubted whether No Lie MRI and its competitor , Cephalos , had the resources to conduct the type of trials he wants .
" We need to run clinical trials with 200 to 300 people , so we can say , ' This is the accuracy of this test , ' " Langleben told Wired.com .
" But only two or three companies are trying to develop the technology .
Do those companies have deep pockets ?
No .
Do clinical trials cost a lot ?
Yes . "
In September , Huizenga said the company was trying to get a grant for a study on a large group of people .
" To date there really has been no study that has tried to optimize fMRI for lie detection , " he said .
But even if the science behind a technology is n't fully established , Brooklyn Law School 's Edward Cheng , who studies scientific evidence in legal proceedings , said it might still be appropriate to use it in the courtroom .
" Technology does n't necessarily have to be bulletproof before it can come in , in court , " Cheng .
He questioned whether society 's traditional methods of lie detection , that is to say , inspection by human beings , is any more reliable than the new technology .
" It 's not clear whether or not a somewhat reliable but foolproof fMRI machine is any worse than having a jury look at a witness , " Cheng said .
" It 's always important to think about what the baseline is .
If you want the status quo , fine , but in this case , the status quo might not be all that good . "
But the question of whether Cheng 's fMRI can be " somewhat reliable but foolproof " remains open .
Ed Vul , an fMRI researcher at the Kanwisher Lab at MIT , said that it was simply too easy for a suspect to make fMRI data of any type unusable .
" I do n't think it can be either reliable or practical .
It is very easy to corrupt fMRI data , " Vul said .
" The biggest difficulty is that it 's very easy to make fMRI data unusable by moving a little , holding your breath , or even thinking about a bunch of random stuff . "
A trained defendant might even be able to introduce bias into the fMRI data .
In comparison with traditional lie-detection methods , fMRI appears more susceptible to gaming .
" So far as I can tell , there are many more reliable ways to corrupt data from an MRI machine than a classic polygraph machine , " Vul said .
Elizabeth Phelps , a neuroscientist at New York University , agreed there is little evidence that fMRI is more reliable than previous lie-detection methods .
" When you build a model based on people in the laboratory , it may or may not be that applicable to someone who has practiced their lie over and over , or someone who has been accused of something , " Phelps said .
" I do n't think that we have any standard of evidence that this data is going to be reliable in the way that the courts should be admitting . "
All these theoretical considerations will be put to the test for the first time in a San Diego courtroom soon .
Stanford 's Murphy reported that the admissibility of the evidence in this particular case could rest on which scientific experts are allowed to comment on the evidence .
" The defense plans to claim fMRI - based lie detection ( or “ truth verification ” ) is accurate and generally accepted within the relevant scientific community in part by narrowly defining the relevant community as only those who research and develop fMRI - based lie detection , " she wrote .
Murphy says that the relevant scientific community should be much larger , including a broader swath of neuroscientists , statisticians , and memory experts .
If the broader scientific community is included in the fact - finding , Greely does n't expect the evidence to be admitted .
" In a case where the issues were fully explored with good expert witnesses on both sides , it is very hard for me to believe that a judge would admit the results of fMRI - based lie detection today , " Greely said .
But that 's not to say that lie - detection wo n't eventually find a place in the courts , as the science and ethics of brain scanning solidify .

To my knowledge -- and from personal experience -- Chas Freeman as DCM [ Deputy Chief of Mission , # 2 to the Ambassador ] in Beijing was a stalwart supporter of human rights who helped many individuals in need .
Not political bluster , but intelligent and courageous action .
He is strong in both wisdom and integrity .
Chas Freeman is one of the most brilliant , analytical , balanced and skeptical people I have known in the last four decades .
I first knew him as a young State Dept China - watcher and was so impressed I persuaded State to stake him to a year at Harvard Law School so he could finish his JD and hone his skills in international law .
Chas had left HLS after two bored , ho - hum years to join the Foreign Service , but when he returned he took full advantage of the opportunity and , if memory serves , had a perfect third year record .
I have not been close to him since that time but we have occasionally crossed paths and I always benefited from and enjoyed the experience .
Chas is a keen observer , a wicked wit and a fearless critic .
It is ludicrous to portray him as a " panda hugger " who endorses the slaughter of June 4 or someone who can be seduced by Saudi enticements .
As far as I know , he has always been fiercely independent , and an enemy of " group think " , and I will be glad to have him analyzing Israeli politics and policies as well as other problems .
In 1973 , when Chas was helping to establish the pre-Embassy U.S. " liaison office " in Beijing , a time when the Cultural Revolution led PRC officials to obscure their titles from foreigners by identifying themselves as " responsible member of the department concerned , " Chas had his own name cards printed in Chinese and English bestowing the same sobriquet on himself .
I congratulate Admiral Blair on selecting Chas to be " responsible member of the department concerned " and certainly will think less of President Obama and his advisors if they back down .
For the record here are two interesting statements on Chas Freeman and his fitness for public office , by people deeply familiar with the China - related part of his experience and outlook .
Quick points of context :- I do n't think anyone seriously contends that Freeman 's views on China are the central reason for the opposition to him .
As Andrew Sullivan convincingly ( IHMO ) demonstrated , the real argument , for better or worse , concerns his views on Israel . -
On the other hand , his most often - quoted view about China -- that the regime erred mainly in waiting too long to crack down on the Tiananmen Square demonstrations -- has added to the argument that he is a doctrinaire " realist " who has no time for ideals of any sort . -
The two people whose views I quote below have absolutely unquestionable standing to speak on this subject .
One is Sidney Rittenberg , who first went to China with the US Army in 1945 and ended up spending 35 years there , 16 of them in solitary confinement for alleged espionage and disloyalty to the Mao regime .
The other is Jerome A. Cohen , of NYU Law School and Paul Weiss , who has been tireless in his efforts for legal reform in China and was instrumental in freeing John Downey , who had been held in Chinese prison for two decades after the Korean War .
Both of them strongly support the expansion of individual liberties and civil society in China .
Both of them strongly support Chas Freeman and his candidacy for his now - disupted job .
After the jump , a long email Rittenberg sent me today about Freeman .
Here , comments each of them made on a private China - related discussion group , quoted with their permission .
Read these and ask yourself : based at least on the China part of his background , does this sound like a man so far beyond the range of reasonable opinion that he must be prevented from holding appointive office ?

Congressional Democrats have reached a milestone with the highest recorded approval ratings since the party took control of both chambers in the 2006 election , according to the latest Gallup polling .
Nearly four in ten , 39 % , of Americans approve of Congress , a rating which has been on a steady incline — it ’s an eight point jump from last month , and a 20 point jump since January .
It ’s also the most positive approval ratings for Congress since Feb. 2005 , when Republicans were still in control .
As Gallup notes , it ’s a notably quick turnaround from 2008 , which marked record low congressional approval ratings .
The approval ratings are largely fueled by Democrats , a majority of which , 57 % , approve of Congress ’s performance .
Republican approval ratings of Congress remain low , but even they have seen a slight bump from 17 % in January to 22 % today .
Democrats have also doubled their support among independents since January , rising from 17 % then to 34 % now .

I use the term laptop loosely , of course , because they have n't invented a term to describe what this machine really is .
Portable computer might be more appropriate :
The 11 - pound W700ds would crush the femurs of most undernourished geeks , and it 's clearly designed to be parked on a desk ( and , given the nearly $ 5,100 price tag , secured with a sizable chain , too ) .
If you read our review of the W700 , you 'll grok our thoughts on the tablet and color - correction features of this machine .
Here they seem wholly unchanged , and again the gorgeous , incredibly bright 17 - inch display is more than ready to collect your average Pixar animator 's drool .
If he 's a real spitter , why , just reach to the right side and pop out a secondary display for more real estate — here you get a bonus 10.6 - inch LCD , not as beautiful as the primary panel , alas , oriented in portrait mode .
While jaws drop when this trick is first performed , in real life the secondary display does n't have as much utility as you 'd think .
You can park IM windows here and whatever toolbars you use ( obviously this was created with Photoshop jockeys in mind ) , but it 's generally too small for dropping web pages or your e-mail client .
Under the hood , the W700ds has been quietly upgraded to a 2.53 - GHz Core 2 Extreme and dual 200 - GB hard drives .
The 4 GB of RAM , 64 - bit version of Vista and Nvidia Quadro FX 3700M GPU remain the same as the pitifully mono - screened W700 .
With its newly enhanced firepower , the W700ds broke all of our general - app laptop performance records ( nearly 15 percent faster than the W700 ) , and it rocked our gaming benchmarks too .
For the permanent record the scores on PC Mark05 were 8449 and PC Mark Vantage were 5490 .
Ask the W700ds to give you all the power in the world , and it complies .
All it asks for in return is , like , all your money .
And a ruptured disc or two .
Hmmm …how can I freak this ?
Let me see …
This is not a typical TSF interview .
I know many of our readers do n’t like Skip in the least .
They think he is loud , off point and some actually think he is racist .
Nevertheless , it is our job to bring you the best interviews the web has to offer regardless of subject .
We all know these conversations are unedited transcripts and while they usually run long , the content speaks for itself .
I happen to have a profound respect for Skip , because he speaks the truth regarding Barry Bonds .
Skip is one of the few mainstream journalists who openly proclaim Barry as the best ever–regardless of the specter of steroids .
I also respect Skip because while doing the necessary research , I realized how talented he is in his approach to journalism .
His purpose is to strike a chord , thus drawing the reader in emotionally when your senses are at a frenzy .
I was a little surprised Skip was as reserved as he was eloquent during our talk –which gave me a key to his persona on and off the set of 1st Take .
Simply put , he ’s very intelligent and knows his stuff whether you like him or not .
The show is the show and you all know the premise is all about the debate .
Debates as you know , have the potential of boiling over the surface and no matter how tempered points are made within the constraints of production , there is always a chance voices will carry across the set and ultimately make your TV speakers pop .
Skip touches on a myriad of topics , so please read without prejudice , for some of this will surely get your attention .
This is Part I of II .
Michael Tillery : OK Skip , let ’s begin with barbecue and OKC .
Skip Bayless : I was born into a barbecue restaurant in Oklahoma City to a Mother and Father–neither of which made it through high school .
I was the first born soon after they decided to start a small almost hole in the wall barbecue restaurant to see if they could make it .
During their courtship , my Father nicknamed my Mother Skip–as in you are the skipper of this ship meaning you tell us where we are going tonight and you tell us what we are going to do .
The moment I was born , and my Father gazed upon me for the first time , he said , “ There is my skipper . ”
They already agreed to name me after him — John Edward Bayless the II–and that went on the birth certificate , but from the first moment it just stuck and they called me “ Skip ” or early on “ Skipper ” .
Not once in my life … not once by either parent … was I ever referred to as John Edward , not even in anger like “ John Edward Bayless , you stop that ! ”
I did n’t even know it was my name ( well vaguely ) until I got to junior high at that point when they first call rolls and it was John Bayless and the kids from my grade school said “ What ? ! ” .
Eventually , I legally changed my name to Skip because the other only got in my way and my Mother finally agreed I should do that .
In a nutshell , I was the black sheep of my family so to speak , because I initially fell in love with sports and nobody in my entire extended family liked sports .
Everyone had a cooking background , restaurant background … grand father had a drive - in restaurant .
My younger brother gravitated into that .
I do n’t know if you are aware of him Michael …
Mizzo : Yes ,
Rick the famous chef and Chicago restaurant owner .
While he ’s come up , why did n’t he take the chef position in the White House offered by the Obamas ?
Skip : I ca n’t speak for him .
All I know is that his Chicago restaurant won National Restaurant of the Year last year , that President Obama and his wife have long loved it and that I ’m very proud of my brother because I grew up in that business and know how difficult it is to merely stay open from year to year .
So . he followed right in the footsteps and even though I was alone in that regard , I liked sports .
I loved sports .
I was obsessed with sports .
I played everything and I was pretty good right away because I was big for my size and just naturally pretty athletic .
I had no idea where it came from .
So my dream–as you had one early on ( baseball ) –was to play .
All the way through up to ninth and tenth grade , I was convinced I was going to play something professionally –or at least in college .
Basketball and baseball were my two loves .
Then I quit growing and everyone else kept growing .
You know how that goes and I ended up being a better baseball player in high school than I was a basketball player –although I still love and play a lot of basketball .
When I was a high school junior , by complete fate–although I think it was a God thing –I wound up in the advanced English class taught by the journalism teacher .
She just had one class a year other than her four or five journalism classes and I fell into her class .
The first week of school , she assigned us book reports because she wanted to see how we wrote .
Of course , I chose a sports biography on Y. A. Tittle –the former New York Giants quarterback .
There ’s a famous photograph of him kneeling … bloody nose , spud faced .
It ’s a famous Sports Illustrated cover or something .
I chose this , went through it and wrote my one page book report and handed it in on Thursday .
On Friday , classed as class was ending , the teacher wanted to see me after class .
My buddies looked at me like I was already in trouble in the first week of school .
She was a scary lady .
Very intimidating with a big loud voice that was almost witch like to me .
She had a very scary presence .
I eased up to her desk and she told me I was going into journalism .
I said , “ What ? ! ” and she said , “ You can write ! ” .
I said , “ Ho…how … how do you know ? ” and she said , “ I know .
I just read your book report and you ’re gonna come in and write a sports column for me with the school paper . ”
I told her I had no interest .
At that point , I still had a fantasy to play and she told me she knows and goes to the games .
She said she did n’t care and it was even better that I played .
She told me , despite my disinterest , that she did n’t need me to come in and edit copy or write headlines and do all those journalism things , she just wanted me to write her sports column twice a week .
We had two school papers a week .
Against my better judgment , I did it .
My teammates thought it was way beneath my dignity to be a reporter type .
They also thought I was crossing the line , because to them , the reporter was like being akin to the water boy or the assistant trainer because of the course of the next two years , I had to interview a few of the star players while I was playing on their team .
The more I did it , the more I liked it .
The more I did it , the better I got at it .
My senior year , she entered me into a program without me even knowing it .
It was a competition they have once a year where they give a big scholarship to Vanderbilt University , the Grantland Rice Scholarship .
He was a famous sportswriter who went to Vanderbilt .
They bring in sports writers every year after the Kentucky Derby … they try to get four or five to stop by Nashville and they go through all of these entries .
You have to send in x number of clippings .
They choose the winner of a full scholarship .
I was only vaguely aware of it until one night in May of my senior year in high school and I walk through the door and my Mom told me someone called from a place called Vanderbilt .
I knew right away what she was talking about .
I knew I had somehow won this thing .
I called and they told me congratulations and that they needed to know by tomorrow morning whether I was going to accept or they were gonna give it to the first runner - up .
I ’d never been to Nashville or Vanderbilt .
I ’d had a girlfriend who was one year behind me in high school and I just did n’t want to leave .
I was going to go to University of Oklahoma , major in journalism and just see what happened .
Of course I accepted .
It was the scariest thing I ’d ever did and the greatest thing I ’d ever did because people in this business know the Grantland Rice Scholarship .
So I was able–upon graduating in a pretty tight market–to actually get a couple of doors to open that I did n’t deserve to open .
Mizzo :
Give me a rundown of your stops in the game .
I went first to the Miami Herald for a couple of years .
I went to the Los Angeles Times for a couple of years .
Of course , I immediately wanted to be a columnist and it was difficult in those days to become one .
The sports editor at the Times loved me like a son and told me I was n’t ready .
I was 25 years old and he said I needed 10 years in this business before I was experienced and knowledgeable enough to write a column .
I did n’t buy it and one thing led to another .
The Dallas Morning News were looking to compete in their market against a legendary columnist named Blackie Sherrod–a rival at the Dallas Times Herald .
He is a Texas institution .
He was invincible and indomitable and owned that market for years and years .
He was old school , close to Darrell Royal ( most wins all time at Texas ) and the Texas program .
He was extremely gifted .
More of a Texas style wit and wisdom writer .
The Morning News hired me to be their columnist at 26 and take him down .
People in the business told me nobody will ever take him down .
I went in with that mandate to at least compete with him and I did .
I did it my way .
My columns were more topical than his .
I ’m not as talented as he was but I could write .
Straight off the news from the heart .
No holds barred , no sacred cows .
Honest , well reported , well researched …go for the throat .
I was able to make an instant splash in that market–at least hold my own .
There was no way I could beat him at his game , but I could beat him with my game –which I did .
I started winning awards and drawing most of the attention in the market largely by the topics I selected .
I was writing about things he would n’t choose to write about .
About three years passed and his paper came after me and actually hired me away from the Dallas Morning News just to hurt them …just to sting them and bring me over to Blackie Sherrod ’s paper .
He was so outraged by that maneuver , he then basically quit and was hired by the Morning News .
So basically we swapped places in the market .
It was completely bizarre .
From that point , I spun more into books just because I find the Dallas Cowboys to be the most fascinating franchise in all of sports –including your Yankees or anyone else you want to throw out there .
Their history is spellbinding , supremely writable and reportable .
I only wanted to write one book and basically wrote three because they wrote me .
They took me over and I just could n’t stop .
Those books came in ’ 90 , ’93 and ’ 96 .
During that period –because of my knowledge of the Cowboys –I began to do more and more at ESPN .
At first it was on Sunday mornings on Sports Reporters .
This started clear back in ’ 89 if you can believe that in its infancy .
Dick Shaap , who was running the show at the time , was a big fan of mine .
I started doing that regularly in the early nineties which led to the very first live debate on ESPN .
It was a pre-MNF show that began in ’93 called Prime Monday .
ESPN brought Michael Wilbon , Mitch Albom and me to Bristol each Monday to do this live scripted debate .
We had it scripted out beforehand –which I never do anymore .
In those days they were so fearful of it because they were not sure where it would go and it was so compressed in its time frame , that the three of us would sorta script out where we wanted to go and try to stay on course as much as we could because we were on live TV debating each other .
It started to click and it worked .
It was the first of its kind in that format and became three sports columnists debating –different that the Sports Reporters discussion .
I was the original live wire and I especially began to debate with Wilbon –with whom I was very good friends .
I found I could push his buttons better even if we were going by the script .
I could have fun with him and go at him to get a rise out of him .
He ’s more opinionated sometimes than one would know .
I found that he would rise up on live TV and come back at me .
It was interesting because it was fun .
It was provocative .
The producers –though leery of it to start with–began to warm up to it and got more and more comfortable with the level of it .
I could get a little more louder than just the monotone discussions you would see on ESPN or every TV station you ’d watch .
It began to take a life of its own and led to all the spin offs .
The evolution was your various shows like PTI , Around the Horn and 1st and Ten .
That was the start of it .
I remained in newspapers .
I went on and did the Chicago Tribune for three years as their lead columnist and probably would have stayed there but I had a squabble with the editor of that company .
Mizzo :
That was 650 word limit enforced by Ann Marie Lipinski ?
Skip : Yeah…very simple , but a deal killer for me .
I know it would be hard to understand for anybody if you ever had to write to a space , but my columns over the years were typically 850 words .
It ’s because I ’m more of a reporter columnist .
I poll people .
I know people .
I work at it .
I ’m going to inform you –if possible –while I ’m going to provoke your thought .
I ’m going to take a stand , but I ’m going to back it up .
Maybe I ’m going to enlighten you along the trail , but I never thought 850 words read long to me .
If you have a lot to say , that ’s about right .
In fact , while I was at the Tribune , my ( sports ) editor , who was a fortunately a big fan of mine , encouraged me on various topics to write longer .
There were days I went 1200 words and I do n’t think they read long because I had the goods .
There were days when I wrote 850 and maybe it did n’t seem a little long because I did n’t have as much to say , but I know I could regularly fill 850 with no problem .
So one day the lady who ran the Tribune ( Lapinski ) had her Tribune spread out before her and wondered what was different about the sports section .
She said the column was not contained down the left side of the page like all of her other sections were –business or local or blah , blah , blah .
No they were n’t .
We had two prominent columnist–myself and Bernie Lincicome , who went on from there to Denver over the same view .
I know this sounds petty to some , but they said that we would anchor our sports page on the left side like all the others .
Well , that ’s all well and good , except you ca n’t contain it on the front .
We would jump it inside .
Maybe we would run a fourth of it on front and the rest of it inside on page three , four , seven or eight .
In this format on the left side , it reduced 850 to 650 .
No big deal ?
Well , it was to me .
Chopping that extra two hundred was like taking my blood away from me .
Mizzo : 650 is bad .
Skip :
It was just a killer for me and my psyche .
I marched right in and said “ Please do n’t do this to me . ”
She said it was fine and that I would learn to love this .
So , I gave it a try .
I tried it for six long months and I liked it less by the day to the point I told my sports editor that I could n’t take it anymore .
I was so unhappy with it .
I was not myself .
I could n’t do what I do and he agreed with me .
He told me if he was me , he would look to do something else .
I told him I could go somewhere else and work if I wanted to and he told me to go tell her ( Lapinski ) that –to try one more time .
I went in and basically delivered the ultimatum .
She basically smiled and told me it ’s been nice , so I left .
The city –well the people who cared about sports –was basically in shock .
I did n’t ever radio and TV interview and told the truth about what happened .
I have no animosity towards her .
I just thought she missed the boat and took a stand off what she could n’t back .
It became a pride issue with her and a life blood issue with me .
For my last newspaper stop , I chose to go back to my original thing which was Knight Ridder Corporation –which was Miami Herald and their flagship paper was the San Jose Mercury News .
They wanted me to write a column for the chain–namely the Detroit Free Press and various other papers .
The one draw for me in the Bay Area besides I like to live there was Barry Bonds .
I walked out of Michael Jordan ’s life ; I was blessed to know him the in the last couple years and I walked right into Barry Bonds ’ 2001 season .
It was absolutely one of the most amazing things I ’ve personally been able to witness .
Again , I was blessed .
I did that until the end of Barry and then I got a call from Mark Shapiro , who was running ESPN .
He started this show called Cold Pizza and it was going nowhere .
He tried to make it a sorta morning variety show loosely based on sports , but it just was n’t connecting with the audience .
It could n’t find an audience .
Shapiro asked me to help bring the show up out of the ratings toilet .
He paired up Woody Paige and I for debate and bring a sports component to a non-sports show .
Woody stayed for a couple of years and then decided to go back to Denver .
Then we started this rotation .
I do n’t know what the plan was originally , but we sorta fell into the fact that this was really fun for me because I get to debate someone different every two to three days .
I ’m high energy , high passion to a fault and for a while it began to wear Woody out .
It ’s great bringing in the rotation .
We have ten , twelve different people and we ’ll bring in other various people for one day stands .
It ’s great because their passion will be high because they are only going to do it for a couple of days .
They can get revved up , come in and try to match my rpm and then they can go rest for a couple of days and get geared back up for their real job .
It started working and they liked it , we moved from New York City to Bristol , Connecticut and hear we are .
Mizzo :
Why do you feel it necessary to exclusively have a Black debate partner ?
Skip : Once Woody
Paige left our show , and we began to audition new debaters , I pushed for Black or minority partners because a day rarely passes without a racial component to a sports issue , and our show never shies away from tackling the most controversial of these issues .
It is obviously impossible to have a credible , healthy discussion or debate without both sides represented .
Sometimes I ’ll defend the Black perspective — see Barry Bonds — and sometimes a Black debater will defend the White perspective — as happened recently with Stephen Bardo taking up for Michael Phelps and me continuing to criticize him as a role - model fraud .
The previous Monday , Jemele had blasted the predominantly White media for giving Phelps a pass because that White media has been so quick to condemn Black athletes for similar behavior — and I whole - heartedly agreed .
I had no sympathy for Michael Vick ; some of my Black partners did .
This gives our show great balance and the freedom to take on topics many shows would not .
Mizzo :
After the Lapinski rift , it seemed like you stopped writing even though you are a great writer …
Skip :
When I first came on and Mark left , we had a big regime change .
The deal was for me to do the show and also write for ESPN.com .
I would n’t have come without the writing component to start with .
I had no idea what it was going to take to do the show on a daily basis .
When Mark hired me , he was n’t sure what the job was .
He could n’t tell me what it would require .
In fact , when I first arrived in New York City , I vaguely thought Woody and I would do one segment a day for five minutes reacting to the biggest story of the night .
It would be something I could do with my left hand … a little sideshow job … then I would go write my column .
When we first me , Mark told me he had an idea to call it 1st and 10 .
Originally on the show , they gave us much more time than we even get now .
Now we get a significant portion of the bigger show 1st Take .
1st and 10 is the show within the show .
Ten topics and we would do about 45 minutes of the 2 hour Cold Pizza show .
It began to wear me out .
It ’s a lot of work to keep up on a nightly basis with everything going on in sports .
You ca n’t play favorites or say you are just a football fan or college basketball .
No you can ’t .
you better like the NBA and college basketball and golf and horse racing … everything … tennis .
You better be ready to walk in the door tomorrow morning and discuss whatever happened of any magnitude the night before .
If I fried myself on anything , it ’s just being prepared .
I watched games incessantly .
Some nights four or five at once .
I have to be up by five for the early meeting .
The point is , it really started wearing on me to the point that for two years I wrote columns for ESPN.com until I was just worn out from it .
Also during that period I started my relationship with Stephen A. Smith .
We were doing a thing for Sundays called Old School , New School .
It was a Sunday morning SportsCenter debate .
I had to really prepare hard for it .
We would do three topics on Sunday Morning .
My only off day was Saturday and we would have a conference call with the producer where we selected the three topics .
I would do my homework on that day , collect my thoughts , do research and get up Sunday morning and get the thoughts in my head .
You had to basically memorize anything you want to take to battle with you because you could n’t have notes and you had no teleprompter .
You had to be ready to go because with Stephen A. , I had no idea of where it might go .
Over that 2 year plus period , I never worked so hard in all my life .
I loved it to the point where once Mark left , I had a chance when my next deal came up to focus the deal on television –which I did .
I can still write if I choose too , I just have n’t .
I can write books –which I definitely will .
My ultimate calling is to write books again .
I ’ve got ten in my brain right now .
It ’s backed up and people wanting me to write books for them and I will .
I got so caught up in TV .
Thank God and let me find some wood to knock on here … the ratings have steadily risen to the point that show against a lot of odds has become a success .
I ’m very proud of it and invested emotionally and psychologically in it .
I ’m going to ride that tiger until it throws me off and it probably will at some point .
In my soul , I ’m a writer and I will return to that at some point soon .
Mizzo :
For the sake of the interview Skip , could you elaborate on your time in Miami , L.A. and Dallas ?
I just want to be thorough before we get into Part II .
Skip : Sure .
To give you an idea of what the business was at this time , newspapers dominated the landscape , dominated local television , dominated what little talk radio there was .
It was all about newspapers .
In Miami , the Miami Herald ruled .
I came in as the low man on a tall totem pole with another writer from my rival school the University of Tennessee .
The sports editor told both of us we were on trial .
He said one of us would be promoted in six months and one of us wo n’t be .
He said either of us might not make it in the business and it was up to us to rise in the department .
We each had to start in bureau offices .
They sent me to West Palm Beach bureau and to Fort Lauderdale bureau .
It was a competition to see who could rise to join the staff in downtown Miami .
It was cold blooded , survival of the fittest writer .
I do n’t know how –because it was rough–but I somehow won the competition .
Once I got downtown , I rose quickly .
They let me do more and more .
I was in an incredibly stodgy and conservative department .
Extreme editing .
They tried to edit any personality out and I fought and fought but survived and flourished there in the end .
In my summers at Vanderbilt , I went back home to Oklahoma City to the paper I grew up reading called the Daily Oklahoman .
It ’s a very good paper .
The sports columnist there was my mentor and idol named Frank Boggs .
He wrote a letter for me that helped me win that Grantland Rice Scholarship .
He let me do more than just interning at the paper and I had more responsibilities than a lot of the staff .
It was the most fun I ’ve ever had in my life .
I was getting up early ever morning and playing golf , going in during the afternoon and interviewing people I never thought I ’d interview and writing big features .
At the end of the summer he said he ’d like to hire me full time when I graduated and I said “ Done .
I ’ll do this .
I ’ll come back ” .
That was our agreement .
Two days before my graduation , my phone rang in my dorm room at Vanderbilt .
The whole time I ’d planned on going back to Oklahoma City .
On the phone was Frank Boggs and he told me he would not allow me to come back to OKC because of how little they could pay me .
This is 1974 and he was offering me 150 dollars a week .
He just told me that I could n’t do this .
His point was he was fearful I would sorta get trapped there .
That I would come home and never leave .
He told me no .
I told him I did n’t have a job and he told me he would get me a job .
The next morning , he just started calling everyone he knew in the business … you know covering Super Bowls or the Masters .
One was the Miami Herald , so he opened that door for me .
I flew down the next day to interview and got the job and flew back for graduation .
He also called the L.A. Times .
He talked with the famous Jim Murray –who was a buddy of his and I got on the radar at the L.A. Times .
When they finally had an opening two years into my Miami Herald stay , the sports editor called me out of the blue and told me he wanted me to come to L.A.
I ’d never been west of the Rocky Mountains .
He did n’t even want to fly me out for a visit .
He told me he ’d been following my work on the Knight Ridder wire in Miami and said he wanted to hire me .
I wanted to see L.A. I wanted to go to the West Coast .
It was great .
I never covered a team , they let me write features and investigative pieces .
It was a great ride for two years and as I told you earlier , my constant clash with my sports editor , who was like a father to me , was I wanted to write a column .
I would ask him to let me write one inside on page 6 and he would tell me no .
Editorial ?
Nope .
Jim Murray wrote a column and we had another guy who wrote notes column on page 3 named John Hall but that was it .
We went back and forth .
It was a time where newspapers were awakened that sports was selling newspapers and that these young gun columnists could come into a newspaper war market and attract attention and readers .
It happened already with guys my age .
Mike Lupica had gotten a column in New York and a guy you probably wo n’t remember named David Israel had gotten one in Chicago .
Both of them were in that mold of fiery , shoot from the hip , young gun columnists of that era and I wanted to be one .
I had a chance to go to San Francisco and to Washington to the old Washington Star .
I turned those down because I ’m from the Southwest and spent a lot of time in Dallas .
When that came up , it just clicked for me .
It was a great newspaper war and I knew I could make a lot more money in that kind of battle situation .
It was also great .
It was survival in Miami and attempting to become a columnist at the L.A. Times .
Mizzo : OK Skip .
Last segment for Part 1 .
I want to get into your books .
What made you write these books ?
The first one being God ’s Coach : The Hymns , Hype , and Hypocrisy of Tom Landry ’s Cowboys .
Skip :
The first one came after writing hundreds and hundreds of daily columns written about Tom Landry ’s Cowboys .
I found him and the team intensely captivating and compelling .
I ’d gotten close to many , many players who ’d become ex players that had many , many untold stories about Coach Landry , Tex Schramm and Gil Brandt , who ran the Cowboys .
When Jerry Jones swooped in from Arkansas , bought them and as you know , removed Coach Landry in favor of Jimmy Johnson his “ roommate from Arkansas ” though they were n’t that close , but we did n’t know that at that point .
When all that came down , it was such a stunner that once the smoke cleared , I realized I was sitting on a pretty good book once he ’d been deposed .
It just seemed so obvious this was my time to write my first book .
One thing led to another and I connected with an agent in Chicago who told me to send her a proposal .
She told me it was the best proposal she ’d ever seen .
I knew it was n’t the execution of the proposal , it was just what I knew and what I had n’t been able to write in all those Landry years .
I may have touched on it in bits and pieces , but I never managed to pull it all together .
There were so many stories I could n’t get away with while he was in power .
They were just too volatile and they belonged in a book .
She sold it to the first publisher she showed it too–Simon and Schuster because they were really hot for it .
The problem was they wanted it to be written like making “ newspaper deadlines ” because they wanted it to come out by the next football season and Coach Landry was told to leave a little later after the season was over .
I had a month to research and three months to write .
Trust me and I know you know writing well enough to know it ’s just not enough time to do what I tried to do .
It almost put me in an early grave because I barely slept for four months .
Of the three books I wrote , he ( Landry ) gets the one I ’m most proud of and probably the one that got the least acclaim .
The writing , the reporting , the structure of it , the execution of it … I do n’t think I could do much better than that book .
I was extremely proud .
It sold OK– but not great –because and the quote I got from my editor was “ It is going to hit the market and just explode . ”
It sold well and made them some money , but it did n’t connect because I do n’t think people were ready to read the truth about Tom Landry .
It was the unvarnished truth about that whole regime –for better or for worse .
It was n’t completely negative , but there is just a lot of hard truth in it about the compromises that were made by a Christian who coached a game played on Sundays .
That ’s why it ’s called God ’s Coach .
The editor put a subtitle on it that I was always squeamish about and I think it was a little bit of a turn off .
My friends told me this .
The Hyms , Hype and Hypocrisy of Tom Landry ’s Dallas Cowboys was just a little strong .
It was n’t all about that .
There was a lot of greatness in it .
There was a lot of goodness in it .
It was just an unflinching look at those 29 years of the rise and fall of that classic franchise in sports .
When I was finished , I was finished … onward , outward .
It was back to my newspaper column .
Six months later , I realized this guy Jimmy Johnson was something .
I had never encountered a force quite like him .
He was a coaching force of nature created a force field around what had become a sleepy facility out there in Valley Ranch that was so irreverent , yet so effective , that I started to realize right away that good stuff was about to happen .
As you remember , they went 1 - 15 the first year but you could just see it coming .
He was gonna clean house completely and run Everson Walls outta town –which he did right away–and start fresh .
Once they got Michael Irvin healthy –he wrecked his knee in the first year–and they drafted Emmit Smith in the second year , it just started to pop .
A year and a half passed and my publisher asked if I was sure there was n’t another book here –the Jerry Jimmy Cowboys ?
I told them I did n’t know .
We went back and forth and finally signed a deal to do a second book preseason 1992 and it was going to be a season inside this crazy new Cowboy outfit .
The publisher did n’t really care if they went 8 - 8 or 9 - 7 or missed the playoffs or whatever happened .
Lo and behold , they shocked everyone and themselves by winning the Super Bowl .
I was collecting my information all along that trail the entire way and wound up with a Super Bowl in my lap .
That was even a tighter deadline .
That was a 2 month write .
It became a look into the new dynasty in the NFL .
The crux of that book –which was highly controversial –was and this was completely unreported in Dallas , was the growing clash between the “ best friends ” Jimmy and Jerry .
No one had touched that .
I was able , because i took the time to do it by hanging around Valley Ranch , to see it in action .
It was really escalating by the end of the year to the point that one of the people who worked under them predicted to me that they wo n’t make it another year .
That was the end of my book , The Boys : The Untold Story of the Dallas Cowboys ’ Season on the Edge , “ This would be short lived .
Enjoy it while it lasts . ”
I just got barbecued in Dallas , Texas for writing that .
None of my colleagues knew anything about it .
Every talk show was saying this was a fabrication and never happened .
It was an exaggeration .
It was knock down , knock down , knock down .
I took a terrible beating over that book .
Even Jimmy was upset about things in the book .
He went off on me .
He went after me after practice and told me I would not be allowed on the practice field again .
To Jerry ’s credit , when I went to training camp , the first day it opened next year in Austin , Texas , Jerry walked right over to me and told me he believed every word that I wrote .
That I nailed it all and that I was allowed around his football team any time I wanted to be around his football team .
He said “ I am the boss and I will remain the boss . ”
It took a year and that was a rough ride for me , because you know they won a second Super Bowl .
Shortly after that victory over Buffalo , Jerry Jones in a fit of rage at the owner ’s meeting in Orlando fired Jimmy Johnson .
As soon as that news hit in Dallas , I was finally vindicated because it was the shock of all shocks .
That was the most shocking story I ’ve been apart of in sports and that hit Dallas , Texas .
It was just unfathomable the owner fired the coach that was poised to win a third straight Super Bowl–an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl .
It made complete sense to me and I can’t believe they made it as long as they did .
To complete the trilogy for you , I did the book , said that ’s it , I ’m out and the next book will be on pro basketball .
I almost did a NBA book in this period with Simon and Schuster .
I just could n’t figure out if I was going to have much time to do what they wanted me to do and still write my damn column .
That being said , what does Jerry Jones do ?
He turns right around and hires Barry Switzer ?
From the University of Oklahoma to the Dallas Cowboys ?
Mizzo : Something else big falling into your lap huh ?
Skip : Yes !
Oh my God !
I had grown up and Oklahoma Sooner and I knew Coach Switzer a little .
Not a lot , but a little .
I had some dealings with him .
I was intrigued by him .
He had been deposed in ’89 at Oklahoma for what he called the “ rapin ’ , dopin ’ shootin ’ at my dormitory . ”
They had gone straight outlaw there .
Mizzo : Charles Thompson ?
Skip : Charles Thompson was selling drugs out of the jock dorm on campus .
He was selling cocaine and got busted .
It became a disaster , but I did think he was a really good college football coach–if you could tolerate his morals or not .
He was a wild man .
Foremost , I knew he would be great copy and the prospect of Barry Switzer taking Jimmy Johnson ’s team that was poised to win several Super Bowls was just too good .
Right away , Barry comes in and I reconnect with him .
He liked me and he was very open with me .
Then a shock–not on the scale of Jimmy Johnson being fired –that a quarterback he recruited to the University of Oklahoma was n’t digging the way Barry coached the team he basically ran .
Troy ( Aikman ) and Jimmy clashed early , but they had become very close and Troy was cut out of the Jimmy mold in that both of them were perfectionists … driven and extremely dedicated to severe practices .
Hard , punctual and demanding practices .
Here comes good ole ’
Barry in the door and he ’s like “ What the hell ?
We have practice at three and if you guys want to show up at 3:15 … what the hell . ”
Troy started going crazy right away in the first camp .
He did not like it and began to voice to his boys in the media that this was not going to work .
It began a little feud between them that began to brew prior to that year that was under the surface .
That year …and you might remember … they ended up in San Francisco and frankly , thanks to Troy ’s horrendous start , they fell behind 21 - 0 in the NFC Championship game .
Then Troy and Michael began to battle back and they ended up losing …
Mizzo : 38 - 28 .
Skip : Yep .
They should n’t have .
They were just better .
Emmit was hurt that game .
He had a pulled hamstring , tried to go but was n’t effective .
That opened the floodgates of emotion .
We went into the next camp and it became open warfare between Barry and Troy .
In those days , I called my agent and said you are n’t going to believe this but I am sitting on one of the most incredible soap opera stories that you could ever imagine .
The coach and the quarterback are getting to the point where they do n’t even speak to each other .
My agent asked me if I wanted to shop this and if anybody would buy it and I did n’t know .
I said it ’s incredible .
It ’s better than God ’s Coach or The Boys .
She said that we should try .
I did another proposal and she had like seven or eight publishers interested in it .
Auctioned it off and it ended up with Harper Collins .
It was gonna be another season inside another extremely talented , extremely troubled football team .
If I could have written my proposal after the year , my proposal would have been ten times richer and stronger than it was before the year because it became better than fiction what happened as the season unfolded .
Again , open warfare between Aikman and Switzer .
I was close to Barry and also his daughter , Kathy –who basically lived with him .
She was a close friend of mine , so I was privy to a lot of things most people were n’t privy to .
The first thing that came up was that Norv Turner had left to go coach the Redskins .
Troy loved Norv Turner because he was his quarterback coach the first Super Bowl go around .
They were like big brother , little brother .
Barry became convinced that Troy wanted to get Barry fired and Norv hired in Dallas .
I believe there was a lot of truth to that .
Barry claimed –and I know this seems out there , but the facts are the facts –that Troy played less than his best in both Washington games .
You know how that rivalry is .
The ‘ Skins were n’t that good and beat the eventual Super Bowl Champions in both games –including the one in Texas Stadium .
It was n’t as Switzer described it as “ throwing the games ” , he just thought Troy ’s heart was n’t in those games in part because he just wanted to get Norv Turner back and the quickest way to get the Cowboy coach fired was to lose to the rival , Redskins .
In the second Redskins game on December the 3rd , 1995 , at Texas Stadium , an incident occurred during the game in which Kevin Williams –the little wide out from ( University of ) Miami–ran a wrong route according to Troy .
It was a route that during practice that week , Kevin Williams and Michael Irvin and the other receivers were cutting up and goofing around .
They were n’t running with any discipline and because of that inattention to detail in practice , Kevin Williams ran a wrong route on a 3rd and 8 play in this home loss to the Redskins that caused a misfire and an incompletion .
When they came to the sidelines and according to numerous people within earshot , Troy Aikman calls Kevin Williams a n word out of rage .
Well as you well know , this would just not fly on the sideline of a pro football game or any locker room .
It was just not allowed .
Sorry , you cannot cross that line .
One of the assistant coaches , John Blake , who is now recruiting for the University of North Carolina and had another sensational recruiting class , was apparently Switzer ’s right hand guy at Oklahoma and became the head coach at Oklahoma .
John
Blake told me that he heard it and was just outraged over it .
He was stunned by it .
It spread very quickly through the Black players on the team .
Switzer was closer to the Black athlete than he was the White athlete for the most part .
Switzer had a deep heart for the plight of the Black athlete .
He was not going to accept the n word from his quarterback in anger in some sideline fit .
The secretary called Troy that night and told him to be in Barry ’s office at 9 in the morning .
Troy came in thinking Barry was gonna give him a pat on the back and of course Barry laid down the law and told Troy either he was going to apologize to the rest of the team when they came in today at 1:00 pm or he was going to have to apologize for Troy .
Troy was so angered by that ultimatum that he just ( according to Troy ) launched right out of that office and the two of them refused to speak to each other from December 4th all the way to the Super Bowl that they won in spite of each other .
This lead to incredible mudslinging back and forth and I ’m sure you know about this and it became the flash part of the book but should n’t have been .
It was just another wanna be incredible incidents between the two but , the Troy Aikman gay rumors had been in Dallas for several years .
I did talk radio in Dallas and I would get at least one call a week from someone asking if Troy Aikman is gay .
I would hear about the various incidents and would not pay too much attention to them until Switzer asked me at one point if it was true .
I told him I did n’t know .
His quote was , “ You know this is incredible .
I gotta take all this shit off this kid and he ’s queer ! ”
He challenged some of the other reporters also telling them to tell the truth about Troy and saying he ’s a hypocrite .
He was saying here he is doing all these commercials for Brut cologne and Acme Brick in Dallas … these sorta macho adds … and he is not what he appears to be .
It went all the way to the period where I was writing the book and Barry called me one day at home and asked me what ’s going on .
He said he heard I was having trouble with Aikman–which I certainly did because I was trying to write the book .
Troy would call me at home saying I ca n’t write this and I can’t write that .
It really was n’t about the gay stuff .
It was about the n word and game throwing .
Barry would say he ’s just afraid you are gonna write the gay stuff .
I told Barry I had no idea and nor do I care if he ’s gay or not .
It definitely became part of the clash and mudslinging between the two of them .
Again , Barry just went off on this tirade saying many security people have told him about this incident and this and this and this .
So I just wrote it became the clash between the two .
My only regret about the book is that it does not say that Aikman is gay .
I had no idea and nor do I care to this day .
A number of the Black players –with whom I was close –contended that he was bisexual .
They did n’t like him to start with because he was distant , knee jerk emotional , quick tempered .
His friends on the team loved him for one reason and that was because he could play .
When it was time to play , he performed .
Deep down … trust me …the stars on that team … the Black players … and you know who they are … they did n’t like the guy ( Aikman ) .
I wrote , Hell - Bent : The Crazy Truth About the “ Win or Else ” Dallas Cowboys , and it ’s the best read of each of my three books .
Maybe not the best writing –once again extreme deadline .
I also knew I had to go back and live with them because I had no plans on leaving Dallas .
I wish I could have written it even harder than I did because I felt like I tip toed through some of it .
I wish I had sledgehammered it because it was the truth and everyone who knew what was going on inside the locker room told me the book was a terrific job and that I nailed it .
Because I did .
It ’s exactly what happened .
All I heard from people around the country who did n’t read the book was , “ You outed Troy Aikman ? ”
I did n’t .
The coach definitely thought he was gay and a lot of his teammates thought he was gay .
More than that , they thought he was racist and they thought he was trying to get Barry Switzer .
I basically think he did get Barry Switzer before it was over .
So those are the tales of my books .
Mizzo :
All I can say is wow .

Amazon's ( AMZN ) - Get Report press release says everything you need to know about its brand - new Kindle 2 portable electronic book - reading device .
As a matter of fact , it 's all said in the first paragraph :
" Amazon.com , Inc. introduced Amazon Kindle 2 , the new reading device that offers Kindle 's revolutionary wireless delivery of content in a new slim design with longer battery life , faster page turns , over seven times more storage , sharper images , and a new read - to - me feature .
Kindle 2 is purpose - built for reading with a high - resolution 6 - inch electronic paper display that looks and reads like real paper , which lets users read for hours without the eyestrain caused by reading on a backlit display .
More than 230,000 books are now available in the Kindle Store , including 103 of 110 current New York Times Best Sellers and New Releases , which are typically $ 9.99 .
Top U.S. and international magazines and newspapers plus more than 1,200 different blogs are also available .
Kindle 2 is available for pre-order for $ 359 at and will ship February 24 . "
( AMZN ) - Get ReportMonday 's big rollout of the new device in midtown Manhattan was strangely emotionless .
From Amazon boss Jeff Bezos ( who rarely smiled or seemed excited during the presentation ) to renowned author Stephen King ( who has written a new short story for the new device ) to any of the other Amazon officials on hand — the introduction of the Kindle 2 was underplayed to the max .
( AMZN ) - Get Report I wonder why ?
Amazon ( Stock Quote : AMZN ) says the original Kindle has been a very successful seller .
The company wo n't say how many it 's already sold but you can surmise that they 're selling well if there 's a second - generation model .
In addition to selling devices , they 're also selling online books .
Sort of like what Apple ( Stock Quote : AAPL ) ( AAPL ) - Get Report does with iPods and the iTunes Store except that Amazon downloads files , via a built - in 3G modem , directly to their device not needing the use of a personal computer .
( AMZN ) - Get Report ( AAPL ) - Get Report But , aside from all the things the Kindle 2 does right ( smaller physical size , more internal memory , a better screen and battery life , more new book titles and newspaper / magazine subscriptions to choose from plus a new audio Read - To - Me feature ) the Kindle 2 is priced in the exact same ballpark as one of those little Netbook computers that are all the rage these days .
Netbooks are real computers that can handle many real computer tasks -- such as surfing the Web , word processing , spreadsheet writing and nearly anything you can do on larger computers .
( AMZN ) - Get Report ( AAPL ) - Get Report
The Kindle 2 is , for the most part , a single - purpose device .
You basically buy and download material then you can choose from six text sizes , add bookmarks , notes , and highlights , read ( not write ) personal documents such as Microsoft Word and PDF , and view images , search ( only ) the Web , Wikipedia.org , Kindle Store , and Your Kindle Library where customers ' purchased content is stored .
Curiously , when I went to the Amazon.com 's front page to read about the Kindle 2 , I noticed there was also an advertisement in the adjacent right - hand column for the new Asus Eee PC 1000HE ( $ 379 ) .
I could n't make this up if I tried .
( AMZN ) - Get Report ( AAPL ) - Get Report
There are other e-book readers on the market ( by Sony and Franklin ) and there are also a number of downloadable e-book reader programs made for smartphones by Apple , T - Mobile ( DT ) - Get Report and Google ( GOOG ) - Get Report , Palm ( PALM ) , Microsoft ( MSFT ) - Get Report and others .
According to published reports , Google has already made more than 1.5 million books available for free via iPhone or Android devices .
( AMZN ) - Get Report ( AAPL ) - Get Report ( DT ) - Get Report ( GOOG ) - Get Report ( PALM ) ( MSFT ) - Get Report
In a nutshell , the Kindle 2 is a clever handheld device perfect for reading material that you download from the Web .
It is priced similarly to many current Netbooks but can't do nearly as many tasks .
On the other hand , a Netbook would not be my first choice for reading e-books but does other lots of other things very well .
If you enjoy reading and you 're willing to shell out about $ 400 ( $ 359 plus sales tax , etc. ) then Amazon 's Kindle 2 is the perfect solution .

What is up with all these puppy mills in the state of Missouri !
You probably thought I was joking when I brought this up last week .
Obviously I ’m serious - this happens like every week here in this state !
Here is a video of this story .
BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Austria and Hungary reaffirmed their sovereign right on Monday to ban growing genetically modified maize after EU environment ministers squashed more attempts by the European Commission to lift the restrictions .
In a stinging rebuff to the EU ’s executive arm , an overwhelming majority of countries -- at least 21 out of the bloc ’s 27 member states -- voted against draft orders for Vienna and Budapest to end their GM crop bans within 20 days .
EU law provides for national GMO bans under certain circumstances if the government can justify the prohibition .
It was the third time that the Commission had tried to get Austria ’s bans lifted and the second time for Hungary , with all the attempts roundly rejected by ministers in the past .
National GMO bans are the only area of EU biotech policy where countries can muster enough consensus under the bloc ’s complex weighted voting rules to secure an agreement .
On applications for new GM products , for example , they are always deadlocked , leading to default approvals by the Commission .
Hungary ’s ban relates to MON 810 maize , developed and marketed by U.S. biotech company Monsanto and the only GM crop that may so far be commercially grown in the EU .
The Commission first tried to get the ban lifted in February 2007 .
Austria has also banned cultivation of MON 810 maize , as well as that of T25 maize , made by German drugs and chemicals group Bayer .
EU ministers rejected Commission plans to get those two bans lifted in June 2005 and December 2006 .
“ We have completely prevailed .
This is for me as if Austria won the European football championship , ” Austria ’s Environment Minister Nikolaus Berlakovich told a news conference , calling the ministers ’ vote an “ historic success . ”
One of the EU ’s most GMO - wary member states , Austria , is the only remaining country cited in the World Trade Organization case filed against the European Commission by major GM crop growers Argentina , Canada and the United States that still applies bans on specific GM products .
Austria used to have a ban on the import and processing of both GM maize products but was ordered to lift them in May 2008 .
UNIMPRESSED
European consumers are well known for their skepticism , if not hostility , to GM crops , often called “ Frankenstein foods . ”
The biotech industry says its products are as safe as conventional equivalents .
European biotech association EuropaBio called the vote a “ political side - step , ” saying it was incomprehensible that some EU countries had chosen to ignore scientific evidence on the safety of the two GM maize types .
The EU has not approved any GM crops for commercial growing since 1998 , when MON 810 maize first gained its authorization .
And last month , EU biotech experts failed to get a consensus to approve similar orders for France and Greece to scrap bans on growing MON 810 maize , escalating the decision to ministers .
Green groups , along with Germany ’s Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel , were unimpressed with the Commission ’s fruitless attempts to force Austria and Hungary to end their GMO bans .
“ I cannot imagine that a U.S. government would be so engaged for a European company if its citizens were that much concerned , as the Commission is engaged for an American company , ” Gabriel told a news conference .
Marco Contiero , Greenpeace EU GMO policy director , called the vote a “ major embarrassment ” for the Commission , saying : “ For the fourth time , EU governments have rejected a Commission proposal to lift national bans on GM crops . ”

In a pool of water just a football field away from Lake Michigan , about 1,000 tons of highly radioactive fuel from the scuttled Zion Nuclear Power Station are waiting for someplace else to spend a few thousand years .
The wait just got longer .
A lot longer .
President Obama ’s proposed budget all but kills the Yucca Mountain project , the controversial Nevada site where the U.S. nuclear industry ’s spent fuel rods were to spend eternity .
There are no other plans in the works , so for now the waste will remain next to Zion and 103 other reactors scattered across the country .
Obama has said there are too many questions about whether storing waste at Yucca Mountain is safe .
His decision fulfills a campaign promise , but it also renews nagging questions about what should be done with the radioactive waste steadily accumulating in 35 states .
Advertisement
During his confirmation hearings , Energy Secretary Steven Chu said the waste could safely remain at nuclear plants while another plan is worked out .
Reversing course from previous administrations satisfies critics in Nevada , including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , but triggers another round of political maneuvering and regional bickering in Congress .
“ We are drifting toward a permanent policy of keeping extremely toxic waste next to the Great Lakes , and that cannot stand , ” said U.S. Rep. Mark Steven Kirk ( R - Ill . ) , who echoed industry officials in calling for an independent panel of scientists and engineers to find a solution .
Obama , too , is calling for more study .
More than 57,000 tons of spent fuel rods already are stored next to reactors , just a few yards from containment buildings where they once generated nuclear - heated steam to drive massive electrical turbines .
The lack of a permanent solution poses a serious challenge to the industry ’s plans to build more than 30 new reactors .
Existing nuclear plants produce 2,000 tons of the long - lived waste each year , most of which is moved into pools of chilled water that allow the spent -- but still highly lethal -- uranium - 235 to slowly and safely decay .
Uranium - 235 has a half - life of nearly 704 million years -- meaning that half its atoms will decay in that time .

But containment pools never were intended to store all of the spent fuel that a reactor creates .
The idea was that the cool water would stabilize the enriched uranium until it could be sent to a reprocessing plant or stored in a centralized location .
Instead , it keeps piling up .
Although industry officials insist the waste is safely stored in fenced - off buildings lined with concrete and lead , there are concerns that a leak or a terrorist attack could create an environmental catastrophe .
Many of the nation ’s nuclear plants are close to highly populated areas or next to bodies of water .
As power companies run out of space in their containment pools , they increasingly are storing the waste above ground in concrete and metal casks .
“ We continue to ask the federal government to provide a clear solution for what the long - term storage of spent fuel will be , ” said Marshall Murphy , spokesman for Exelon Nuclear , the owner of all seven nuclear plants in Illinois .
Advertisement
Until now , the solution was Yucca Mountain , 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas , which Congress chose in the late 1980s as a permanent repository .
Federal officials spent the last two decades -- and billions of dollars -- preparing to bury spent fuel in a series of fortified tunnels drilled into the mountain .
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission still plans to hold hearings about Yucca Mountain , but without further funding the project will be a very expensive hole in the ground .
The repository ’s apparent demise is part science and part politics .
Recent studies have shown that water flows through the mountain much faster than previously thought , which raises concerns that radioactive leaks could contaminate drinking water .
Industry critics say the government ’s inability to come up with a permanent burial ground for highly radioactive waste is another reason the U.S. should wean itself from nuclear power .

“ President Obama made the absolutely correct decision , ” said Dave Kraft , director of the Nuclear Energy Information Service , an industry watchdog .
“ Unfortunately for the nation , it comes about 15 years and $ 10 billion too late . ”

The Cry of My Soul
Photo by Simón Pais - Thomas
We had a blissfully fun time in Hawaii , filled with sun , laughter , and relaxation .
It was truly an occasion of celebration for love and life .
But in life , the opposite extreme also exists within the same time and space continuum .
Shortly after returning from our honeymoon , while still wearing our ear - to - ear smiles , we got news that my grandpa Lozier passed away on the day of our flight home , at the age of 95 .
I was deeply saddened by this news and spent the next three weeks in silent mourning .
Suddenly , all the problems created by my imagination seemed insignificant and petty , and I began to ponder my own mortality .
I reviewed the previous week , and regretted fighting with my mom in Hawaii .
I regretted making her sad and angry with my immature and occasionally lingering teenage ways .
I regretted not spending more time with grandma and grandpa Lozier .
I regretted not spending more quality time with my parents while in Hawaii .
I regretted all the time I spent thinking hateful thoughts about things I had no control over .
I wished I could take it all back .
I felt sorrow at the realization of lost time , and that I could never get it back again .
This is a record of what I ’ve learned over the past few weeks in my pondering of life , death and regret .
Personal Story
Coincidentally , Jeremy had gone overseas for work during this time , and I spent these weeks in my own solitary retreat , reflecting on these emotions .
I had turned off the internet and the phone , and spent my time wandering between coffee shops and restaurants and parks , always with a book in my hand – usually fiction , so I could allow my mind to escape into someone else ’s fantasy .
I allowed myself to become absorbed with reading , people - watching , and thinking .
But when we are alone with our thoughts , our “ pain - body ” always finds a way to rear its ugly head and push the bad thoughts to the front .
Despite things looking incredibly happy and positive for me , my mind wandered through thoughts of injustice , of guilt , of pain , and of the past which I could not change .
What ’s worst , my mind painted scenarios and stories that justified those heated thoughts that caused me the pain .
I struggled .
I struggled with battling my own mind , my ego , and the reoccurring vision of injustice and regret .
And then it happened …
I read a passage in “ The Time Traveler ’s Wife ” that shook me out of the negative state I was in .
It said :
“ Everything happens the way it happens .
Once and only once . ”
“ Ah !!
It ’s so simple ! ” I said to no one and everyone at the same time .
I closed my eyes and savored the words .
I thought of each of the immediate problems that were bothering me , and repeated the sentence , as an application over the problem statement .
And miraculously , it was the answer to all my “ problems ” .
A sense of peace washed over my Being .
I smiled .
What I Learned
We love problems .
Our ego thrives on problems .
Even when everything is going as planned , we find a way to create conflicts , issues , and unhappiness in our own lives .
We allow our fears of the future and regrets from the past to consume much of our conscious attention .
We feel that we are unable to let go of grievances , of unfairness that we endured , of regrets .
We feel unable to forgive someone who has hurt us , or seemingly took advantage of us , or who treated us unfairly .
We grasp onto these thoughts and hang onto them for “ dear life ” , yet simultaneously , they are causing us the pain from which we want to be freed of .
It ’s a vicious cycle , that takes us no where we actually want to be .
So what do we do ?
The antidote that worked well for me was to ponder this sentence whenever my mind drifted towards a memory from the past that is causing me pain , “ Everything happens the way it happens .
Once and only once .
And there is nothing I can do to change it .
It is what it is .
Life is short , I do n’t want to dwell on this anymore .
Let ’s move on ! ”
This moment is all that we have .
This moment is the only thing that is real , and in this moment , life happens .
Let ’s not pollute this moment with our past , which is no longer here .
“ But wait , I do want to be happy ” , you may say .
Great !
Then let ’s stop dwelling on the past !
I am learning that there is no such thing as a mistake , rather everything that ’s ever happened is part of our experience in this life , and it contributes towards our growth and development .
Everything is the way it is , and it ’s beautiful .
Accept and allow the past to be .
What Can We Do ?

1. Forgive
“ Forgiveness is the fragrance the violet sheds
on the heel that has crushed it . ”
~ Mark Twain
Forgiveness is n’t to “ let them off easy ” for the people you hold grudges against , but a gift to yourself , to allow the healing process to start .
Nobody will benefit this more than you .
And by you being well , you will spread the fragrance of wellness , compassion and joy to others who come in contact with you .
Being unable to forgive is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die .
It pollutes our inner space and disturbs our inner stillness .
It ’s easy to say , but much tougher to act upon .
It ’s true , but it does n’t mean that we should give up trying , and continuously working on our ability to forgive others , and ourselves .
Forgive our family members , forgive our ex-lovers , forgive our ex-friends , forgive those scenarios that did n’t go our way , forgive those strangers who may have unknowingly hurt us .
Know that by forgiving them , we are liberating ourselves to enjoy a happier future .
We have nothing to prove .
It ’s not worth it .
Deepak Chopra has a guided meditation CD that includes the forgiveness process .
If you are having a hard time doing so on your own , I recommend it .
2. Death Bed Exercise
A better way to spend our energy , I believe , is to focus on something that we do want .
If you found out that you were going to die tomorrow , or within the next month .
Would you still be holding on to your regrets , resentments and problems ?
Wo n’t they seem petty in comparison ?
Grab some paper and sit down somewhere you wo n’t be disturbed or disrupted .
Close your eyes and imagine that you are on your death bed , you ca n’t move , you ca n’t speak .
Knowing that you only have a day or two left , and then you ’re gone forever .
Make the images as real as possible , and feel the feelings of being in that position .
Now , imagine all the things you might regret not doing in your life time .
Write them down , as fast as possible , without editing .
Alternatively , imagine all the things you are grateful for from your life ( things that your older self has experienced ) , things that are most important to your older self , during the last stages of your life .
Write them down .
In your current state of consciousness , these are the things most important to you .
Make these your priorities , and focus on these things , instead of things from your past that haunt you and hurt you .
3. Follow Your Heart
Create time for yourself , every week ( everyday if you are brave ) to spend on something you are passionate about .
Do something that expresses your creatively , or something that you enjoy quietly .
Listen to your heart and follow its whispers of desire .
Take up drawing , acting , dancing , cooking , singing , jogging , music , photography , or writing .
Learn a new language you ’ve always been curious of .
Get lost in a wonderful book .
Work on a project that aligns with what you want to see exist in this world .
And if you do n’t know what your passions are , do n’t worry , create the time anyways , and with enough exploration , you will be sure to fill that space with something that expresses yourself .
Trust me , in time , you will find your passion .
In the meantime , to do something that feeds your soul .
4. Visual Cues
Momentarily , I find myself slipping and giving into the allures of my mind and pain - body .
Please be patient with yourself when this happens .
It ’s okay to fall backward sometimes , as long as you are moving forward as a whole .
I found it helpful to post visual cues around the house to remind me of the power I have in shifting my emotional state .
I have printed and posted the following on my wall near my desk :
“ Everything happens the way it happens .
Once and only once .
And there is n’t anything we can do to change it .
Accept the past as the past , and accept that everything happened which serves us for a happier future .
Let it go . “
Find a quote or a saying that you connect with , and helps to ground you to the power of the present moment .
Either post it on a wall where you can see it , or put it on a small card and carry it with you in a journal or wallet .
Parting Words
Life is a journey of experiences , of learning , of growth , of loving , and ultimately , of contribution .
But among the hectic demands of daily life , we forget why we are here and what matters to us most .
Our judgment becomes clouded , and we forget to connect authentically and intimately with others .
We forget to find meaning , we drift away from our passion and we forget to live in Joy .
Sometimes , life takes a traumatic turn before we are shaken awake , and become reminded that we wo n’t live forever , that our time in this physical body is limited , and to reflect on questions like ;
What can I do to contribute to this world ?
What do I want to leave behind ?
How do I want to spend my time ?
Can I forgive this person in order to end the suffering for myself ?
How can I make every minute count ?
** What is most important to you ?
What thoughts are running through your head that are causing you to suffer ?
Share your stories and thoughts with us in the comment section .
See you there !
In loving memory of Augustin Lozier , 1914 - 2009 .
Want to start a startup ?
Get funded by Y Combinator .
Watch how this essay was written .
February 2009
One of the things I always tell startups is a principle I learned from Paul Buchheit : it 's better to make a few people really happy than to make a lot of people semi-happy .
I was saying recently to a reporter that if I could only tell startups 10 things , this would be one of them .
Then I thought : what would the other 9 be ?
When I made the list there turned out to be 13 :
1. Pick good cofounders .
Cofounders are for a startup what location is for real estate .
You can change anything about a house except where it is .
In a startup you can change your idea easily , but changing your cofounders is hard . [ 1 ]
And the success of a startup is almost always a function of its founders .
2. Launch fast .
The reason to launch fast is not so much that it 's critical to get your product to market early , but that you have n't really started working on it till you 've launched .
Launching teaches you what you should have been building .
Till you know that you 're wasting your time .
So the main value of whatever you launch with is as a pretext for engaging users .
3 . Let your idea evolve .
This is the second half of launching fast .
Launch fast and iterate .
It 's a big mistake to treat a startup as if it were merely a matter of implementing some brilliant initial idea .
As in an essay , most of the ideas appear in the implementing .
4. Understand your users .
You can envision the wealth created by a startup as a rectangle , where one side is the number of users and the other is how much you improve their lives . [ 2 ]
The second dimension is the one you have most control over .
And indeed , the growth in the first will be driven by how well you do in the second .
As in science , the hard part is not answering questions but asking them : the hard part is seeing something new that users lack .
The better you understand them the better the odds of doing that .
That 's why so many successful startups make something the founders needed .
5 . Better to make a few users love you than a lot ambivalent .
Ideally you want to make large numbers of users love you , but you can't expect to hit that right away .
Initially you have to choose between satisfying all the needs of a subset of potential users , or satisfying a subset of the needs of all potential users .
Take the first .
It 's easier to expand userwise than satisfactionwise .
And perhaps more importantly , it 's harder to lie to yourself .
If you think you 're 85 % of the way to a great product , how do you know it 's not 70 % ?
Or 10 % ?
Whereas it 's easy to know how many users you have .
6 . Offer surprisingly good customer service .
Customers are used to being maltreated .
Most of the companies they deal with are quasi-monopolies that get away with atrocious customer service .
Your own ideas about what 's possible have been unconsciously lowered by such experiences .
Try making your customer service not merely good , but surprisingly good .
Go out of your way to make people happy .
They 'll be overwhelmed ; you 'll see .
In the earliest stages of a startup , it pays to offer customer service on a level that would n't scale , because it 's a way of learning about your users .
7 . You make what you measure .
I learned this one from Joe Kraus . [ 3 ]
Merely measuring something has an uncanny tendency to improve it .
If you want to make your user numbers go up , put a big piece of paper on your wall and every day plot the number of users .
You 'll be delighted when it goes up and disappointed when it goes down .
Pretty soon you 'll start noticing what makes the number go up , and you 'll start to do more of that .
Corollary : be careful what you measure .
8. Spend little .
I can't emphasize enough how important it is for a startup to be cheap .
Most startups fail before they make something people want , and the most common form of failure is running out of money .
So being cheap is ( almost ) interchangeable with iterating rapidly . [ 4 ]
But it 's more than that .
A culture of cheapness keeps companies young in something like the way exercise keeps people young .
9 . Get ramen profitable .
" Ramen profitable " means a startup makes just enough to pay the founders ' living expenses .
It 's not rapid prototyping for business models ( though it can be ) , but more a way of hacking the investment process .
Once you cross over into ramen profitable , it completely changes your relationship with investors .
It 's also great for morale .
10 . Avoid distractions .
Nothing kills startups like distractions .
The worst type are those that pay money : day jobs , consulting , profitable side - projects .
The startup may have more long - term potential , but you 'll always interrupt working on it to answer calls from people paying you now .
Paradoxically , fundraising is this type of distraction , so try to minimize that too .
11 . Do n't get demoralized .
Though the immediate cause of death in a startup tends to be running out of money , the underlying cause is usually lack of focus .
Either the company is run by stupid people ( which can't be fixed with advice ) or the people are smart but got demoralized .
Starting a startup is a huge moral weight .
Understand this and make a conscious effort not to be ground down by it , just as you'd be careful to bend at the knees when picking up a heavy box .
12 . Do n't give up .
Even if you get demoralized , do n't give up .
You can get surprisingly far by just not giving up .
This is n't true in all fields .
There are a lot of people who could n't become good mathematicians no matter how long they persisted .
But startups are n't like that .
Sheer effort is usually enough , so long as you keep morphing your idea .
13 . Deals fall through .
One of the most useful skills we learned from Viaweb was not getting our hopes up .
We probably had 20 deals of various types fall through .
After the first 10 or so we learned to treat deals as background processes that we should ignore till they terminated .
It 's very dangerous to morale to start to depend on deals closing , not just because they so often do n't , but because it makes them less likely to .
Los Angeles Times reporter Mike Dorning has some important information ( 3/6/09 ) absent from coverage of Dr. Sanjay Gupta ’s recent surgeon general candidacy – “ For several years , Gupta has been co-anchor of a CNN - produced healthcare show distributed monthly via flat - screen TVs provided free to doctor ’s offices ” :
The show is sponsored by healthcare , consumer and pharmaceutical companies that want to get their message directly to patients , according to the website of AccentHealth , a privately held company that distributes the programs and sells them to advertisers .
Dr. Quentin Young–who heads Physicians for a National Health Program , a group that advocates for single - payer , Canadian - style national health insurance and other changes in the present system–and other critics cited occasions when Gupta favorably mentioned sponsors ’ brand - name drugs .
“ His record is not a good one here , ” Young said .
While Dorning gives space to such unsupported CNN platitudes as “ Gupta ’s on - air comments had always been under the editorial control of CNN and unrelated to any advertising contracts ” and “ Dr. Gupta has no relationship with the advertisers of the program–monetarily , editorially or otherwise , ” regular FAIR readers have known of Gupta ’s untrustworthiness for years ; for more critique of CNN ‘s medical coverage , see our current Action Alert : “ CNN : Single - Payer Is So ’90s : Medical Reporter Warns Against ‘ Government - Run Health System ' ” ( 3/12/09 )
Last year we started a pilot of Google Phone Search where users from Hyderabad and Delhi could call a toll free number and search for local businesses or movie showtimes .
We believe that speech recognition and voice access to information is a very important technology for India because it helps us reach users who may not have access to PC or are on the move all the time .
Starting today , users in Mumbai and Bangalore can also call the same toll free number 1-800-41-999-999 at no cost from any phone to search for local business and movie showtimes and get the results by SMS .
For example , if you are looking for pizza delivery businesses you can call and say " pizza " and your area name ( like Bandra in Mumbai or MG road in Bangalore ) to get listings near you .
We are continuously working towards improving our speech recognition technology but it is still not perfect and it may not recognize you at times .
We will transfer your call to an operator after 2 recognition failures who can assist you with your query .
So go ahead and try Google Phone Search for free and send us your feedback on how we can serve you better .
A certain amount of schadenfreude could be expected when the loudest guy in the room pipes down and accepts blame .
Media critics pile on Cramer , CNBC
When Robert Gibbs was asked Friday about Jon Stewart 's grilling of CNBC " Mad Money " host Jim Cramer , the White House press secretary flashed a smile , and told reporters that he " enjoyed it thoroughly . "
Gibbs reaction to the Thursday " Daily Show " interview is n't surprising , given that he and President Barack Obama have been complaining a lot lately about the white noise of " cable chatter " in the midst of financial crisis .
But is the public also ready to tune out the talking heads ?
Advertisement
Media critics , at least , seem to be .
Variety proclaimed Thursday 's " Daily Show " interview — which followed an eight - minute monologue last week in which Stewart bashed CNBC for “ cheap populism ” and bad predictions — " the most foolish appearance by someone whose name sounded like ' Cramer ' since ' Seinfeld ' went off the air , " while others called it " a beat - down " ( The Chicago Tribune ) ; " a massacre " ( Huffington Post ) ; and a " remarkable public service [ in ] gutting Cramer " ( The Baltimore Sun ) .
A certain amount of Schadenfreude could be expected when the loudest guy in the room pipes down , and accepts blame — and Cramer admitted to being " wrong " four times on Thursday night .
But much of the piling on seemed to be less about Cramer than about how cable news — and particularly cable business news — covers serious topics in what are , for most Americans , serious times .
" You knew what the banks were doing , and yet were touting it for months and months , " Stewart said .
" The entire network was .
And so now to pretend that this was some sort of crazy , once - in - a - lifetime tsunami that nobody could have seen coming is disingenuous at best and criminal at worst . "
The never publicity - shy Cramer skipped a scheduled appearance Friday on " Morning Joe " that was billed as his first chance to discuss the " Daily Show " debate ; host Joe Scarborough noted on Twitter that Cramer " had a late night . "
And TVNewser reported that MSNBC asked producers to leave the Stewart - Cramer interview out of their shows , with CNBC hosts also saying little about the interview .
That 's a far cry from CNBC 's initial reaction to Rick Santelli 's rant on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange last month .
At that time , the business network — as well as NBC and MSNBC — continued hyping the incident for days , while the CNBC website highlighted classic Santelli rants — before the reporter , who now seems to be somewhat under wraps , canceled a scheduled interview on " The Daily Show . "
" CNBC produces more than 150 hours of live television a week that includes more than 850 interviews in the service of exposing all sides of every critical financial and economic issue , " said CNBC spokesperson Brian Steel in statement Friday .
" We are proud of our record and remain committed to delivering coverage in real - time during this extraordinary story and beyond . "
Chris Roush , who teaches business journalism at the University of North Carolina , said that when it comes to covering the economic crisis on cable , " the more that CNBC allows its reporters and anchors to state their opinions instead of simply reporting facts , the more it will hurt CNBC in the long run . "
The increasingly opinionated dispatches from CNBC 's stars parallels MSNBC ’s shift during the 2008 campaign to more aggressively opinionated commentary , and could similarly overshadow the actual reporting done by the business network ’s rank - and - file .
Even so , Roush contends that incorporating opinion into reporting on business different than doing the same with political coverage .
" When you state an opinion and you 're wrong " in business news , " you cause people to lose millions or billions of dollars , " said Roush .
" Stating opinion with business news is extremely dangerous .
Stating politics in political news is not as dangerous because people know that the person is stating their political viewpoint . "
And while political prognostications are more subjective , Cramer talking up Bear Stearns stock days before it tanks is a quantifiable mistake .
Still , viewers have at times grown weary of cable television 's need for heated political debate shows — most notably , following Stewart 's October 2004 appearance on CNN's " Crossfire . "
There , Stewart told hosts Tucker Carlson and Paul Begala that they should " stop hurting America . "
" I'm here to confront you , " Stewart said , " because we need help from the media and they 're hurting us . "
Stewart was declared the victor by many in the media after that appearance , and less than three months later CNN pulled the plug on the 22 - year - old right - left shout - fest .
Upon the cancellation of " Crossfire , " network president Jon Klein noted the Stewart critique , telling the Washington Post that " he made a good point about the noise level of these types of shows , which does nothing to illuminate the issues of the day . "
Carlson , reached Friday , described Stewart as " a partisan demagogue . "
" Jim Cramer may be sweaty and pathetic — he certainly was last night — but he's not responsible for the current recession , " Carlson told POLITICO .
" His real sin was attacking Obama 's economic policies .
If he had n't done that , Stewart never would have gone after him .
Stewart 's doing Obama 's bidding .
It 's that simple . "
Begala said that " as an Overpaid TV Guy myself , I hate to see the Overpaid TV Community ripped apart in this time of crisis . "
As to whether Stewart 's takedown could again impact cable punditry , Begala said he had " no clue . "
And simply because media pundits hyperventilate when Stewart wags his finger , it does n't mean network executives will respond accordingly .
Three years after the " Crossfire , " appearance , Stewart blasted Chris Matthews , describing the MSNBC anchor 's self - help - styled book " Life 's a Campaign " as a " recipe for sadness . "
Although Matthews dubbed it " the worst interview I 've ever had in my life " — and it became a YouTube staple —
Matthews continues shouting on a nightly basis .
The now famous " Crossfire " appearance came after Stewart made similar criticisms of the network in a little - noticed 2002 interview with Howard Kurtz .
Beyond Stewart ’s takedown and the television critics frothing at the mouth , CNBC brass will surely be looking at the numbers to see if the recent publicity ’s been a good thing .
It ’s too soon to tell , but early numbers show a slight dip .
Portfolio ’s Jeff Bercovici noted Friday that looking at the first three days this week , CNBC 's Business Day programming block dropped 10 percent in the key adults 25 - 54 demographic , and 11 percent overall .
“ Meanwhile , ‘ Mad Money ’ was also down 10 percent in the 25 - to - 54 demographic , ” wrote Bercovici , “ but only 4 percent among all viewers — suggesting that maybe some of those bored college kids who watch Jon Stewart did , in fact , tune in to find out exactly what is the deal with this Jim Cramer character . ”
But the problem extends further than Cramer ’s “ Daily Show ” sit-down , according to Andrew Tyndall , an independent television news analyst and proprietor of the Tyndall Report website .
" It is not the shouting that Stewart is objecting to at CNBC , " Tyndall said .
" It 's the shilling . "
Tyndall explained that the " raison d'etre ” of a network like CNBC is to persuade viewers that " the best measure of prosperity in an economy is the value of financial assets , " and that the markets are rational , efficient , and civic - minded .
But as the country 's mood shifts , such highly paid , highly opinionated business pundits might run into trouble if successfully depicted as being in the pocket of Wall Street rather than fighting for Main Street .
" The reason voices are raised is because the disagreement is stark and crucial , " Tyndall said .
" The entire neo-liberal economic orthodoxy is at risk of being discredited .
If that goes , CNBC 's foundational identity goes with it . "
To the Editor :
“ Apple ’s Long - Awaited Shift on Music ” ( editorial , Jan. 9 ) seems a bit outdated in its characterizations of the music industry .
We are in the midst of a remarkable period of experimentation and innovation , embraced by music labels of every size that continue to distribute their music through a stunning array of different digital business models .
As a result , we expect that digital music formats will account for some 30 percent of the industry ’s revenues in 2008 , up from virtually nothing a few years ago .
Long before the recent announcement by Apple , record companies had sold their music free of digital rights management , or D.R.M. , technologies through online sites like Wal - Mart and Amazon.com .
( For the record , the Recording Industry Association of America does not “ champion ” D.R.M .
As a trade association , we defend the right of our members to protect or not protect their works as they choose . )
Our community still suffers enormously from the theft of music online .
Every survey confirms that a vast majority of the music downloads are done illegally .

Together with his mom , dad , 9 - month - old sister Stella and 16 party guests , Liam celebrated his second birthday at his new home outside Los Angeles with the help of toys from the movie Cars , a car - shaped cake ( from Beverly Hills bakery Hansen ’s Cakes ) and a performance by his favorite music group , The Jumpitz .
“ Liam is obsessed with the animated movie Cars , ” says his mom , “ and I made him a little red car racing jumpsuit with a Liam name patch on it . ”
Liam and his friends also enjoyed a blow - up ball pit in his living room and a small petting zoo in the backyard .
The Jumpitz , a five - member children ’s performance group , helped the intimate group sing “ Happy Birthday ” to Liam before the cake cutting .
Says Spelling : “ The cutest was when he got to dig his hands into the giant red car cake and Stella was right into it as well ! ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration lacks access to food safety tests that could have helped identify problems at a peanut plant at the center of one of the biggest food recalls in U.S. history , members of Congress said on Thursday .
The salmonella outbreak traced to a Peanut Corp. of America plant in Blakely , Georgia , has sickened more than 550 people , more than half of them children , and may be linked to eight deaths .
“ We would like to have more information .
There is no question , ” Stephen Sundlof , director of the FDA ’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition , told a hearing of the Senate Agriculture Committee .
Under law , a company does not have to notify the agency if it discovers salmonella or other contamination .
The only time FDA can require information from a plant is if tainted product was shipped from it .
In the case of Peanut Corp. of America , the FDA says the plant found 12 instances of salmonella since 2007 , only to retest the product to obtain a negative result before illegally shipping the products for sale .
The FDA and the Justice Department are conducting a criminal investigation of the company .
“ I ’d like to see some people go to jail , ” said Patrick Leahy , a Democrat from Vermont .
“ This was a company that should have shut things down immediately . ”
‘ GAPING HOLE ’
The FDA also puts a lot of faith in states that frequently conduct their own plant inspections , committee members said .
States are not required to share the information with the agency .
“ It seems to me that is one gaping hole , ” said committee chairman Tom Harkin , an Iowa Democrat , who at one point waved peanut products in the air .
Harkin asked the FDA to release records to Congress detailing contracts and inspection reports with state departments of agriculture that check private companies .
The peanut outbreak is the latest in a series of incidents involving lettuce , peppers and spinach that have eroded public confidence in food safety and renewed calls for change at the FDA .
President Barack Obama this week promised a thorough review of the agency .
The current outbreak has led to the recall of more than 1,300 products ranging from crackers and pet food , and has involved dozens of manufacturers including Kellogg Corp and General Mills Inc. PCA last week expanded the recall to include all products made at the plant since January 2007 .
Several bills have been introduced in Congress proposing food safety overhauls .
The most popular focus on giving FDA more money and authority and splitting the agency to create a separate organization in charge of food safety .
“ Many elements of a reform plan ... could be accomplished quickly and deliver real benefits to consumers , ” said Caroline Smith DeWall , a director of food safety at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest .

I picked up a DVD copy of Wes Craven ’s The Last House on the Left from a bargain bin a few years ago .
It was the first time I ’d seen the movie …and I hated it .
I found no real redeeming qualities .
The directing choices seemed random , the violence over - the - top ( and somehow both disturbing and cheesy ) , and the acting atrocious .
I shoved the disc on my shelf and have n’t looked at it since .
I mean , there are quite a few hardcore fans of the original , and I ’m always willing to admit I ’m wrong .
On a second viewing , I appreciate the movie much more but still can’t quite say I like it .
Here ’s the short story :
The movie is not well made , wildly uneven in tone , and not fun to watch .
It ’s a not - very - good movie .
But there is a lot of really interesting things going on , and the plot goes in directions you would n’t expect ( especially in 1972 ) , so it ’s a movie you really want to like .
The plot revolves around Mari , a seventeen - year - old girl living in a rural old house .
She heads out to the city with her friend , Phyllis , to see a concert ( the aptly named band BloodLust , we ’re told ) .
While in town , Mari tries to score some weed and ends up being kidnapped by a group of what the radio describes , in obscene and dramatic detail , as murderers , rapists , addicts , and all around wild - animals .
Now , I ’m about to spoil some of the plot , but if you ’ve seen the trailer for the remake you already know all these twists and turns .
You have to love Hollywood advertising .
Needless to say , serious torture and sexual abuse ensue in the woods , and both girls are killed in horrible ways .
When the gang fails to start their car , however , they end up relying on the courtesy of Mari ’s worried parents , staying in the couple ’s home for the night .
Of course , Mom and Dad realize what has happened to their daughter as well as who is responsible .
Retribution becomes the name of the game .
The movie ’s problems as well as its most compelling themes come from its total identity crisis .
It ’s part comedy , part art film , and part torture - porn .
These genres are n’t interestingly mixed and incorporated like a well - made Tarantino film .
Instead they crash inappropriately into one another keeping the audience from taking anything seriously or finding anything truly funny .
There is even a scene , inserted into the middle of the movie ’s main torture sequence , where two bumbling cops try to hitch a ride on a chicken truck by climbing on the hood .
They keep falling off .
It ’s HILARIOUS !
( and wildly inappropriate ) .
Do n’t say it ’s not interesting , though .
What Craven manages to do is create three distinct worlds –the parents ’ world of the perfect , moralistic nuclear family , Mari ’s world of naive 70′s teenage free love , and the gang ’s world of unfettered violence and depravity–and show them crashing violently into each other .
If it were done a little more carefully or artfully , it could have been brilliant .
As is , it never gets beyond thought - provoking .
More than that , the movie is surprisingly shoddy in its filmmaking .
Scenes are poorly shot with awkward pans , tilts , and snap - zooms , and the camera will often linger on a background element ( or even just the ground ) with little or no meaning .
It ’s very clear that Wes is learning his art .
I see this one as a filmmaking stepping - stone to the classic A Nightmare On Elm Street , so I can forgive a lot .
There are a few very well handled moments , though–one in particular , and it happens to be the most intense part of the movie .
Krug , a fantastic , animalistic and manipulative movie - villain , has his way with Mari .
In the aftermath , there is a montage scene of Mari reeling and the gang having a rare moment of remorse .
Mari leaves the frame and the gang follows , realizing for a brief moment what they have already done and what they must do now to cover their tracks .
It ’s all done without dialogue , and it ’s a great preview of coming attractions for Craven–who I still contend is , above all , an actor ’s director , working with his performers to create truly memorable characters .
This is one of those rare movies that is n’t very good but is worth talking about at length .
You can look at almost every scene and try to find a meaning and purpose , but I ’m not sure how much was intended .
It ’s unfortunate that these ideas and themes are undercut at every turn by bad writing , sloppy editing , and amateur filmmaking .
The remake comes out this week , and watching the original has made me cautiously optimistic .
I ’m fine with having this story told in a polished way .
I ’m fine with putting some money behind it .
What I ’m not fine with is making this movie a standard horror flick .
Notice in my description of the original , “ horror ” never entered into the picture .
Yes , the events are horrible , but the goal of the movie is never to scare you .
There are no creeping moments and no jump - scares .
The movie is very overt and straightforward .
This new one runs the risk of being too slasher - film for its own good .
There is one very good way to handle this remake , though .
Keep the ideas and themes , keep the dark humor , and keep the focus on character and disparate socio-political situations , but blend all of these things in a more competent and cohesive way .
I doubt we ’ll get that based on the trailer ( which I enjoyed , but more for its music choice than anything ) , but hope I ’m very wrong .
It looks like the filmmakers churned out a standard revenge / horror flick with lots of torture , stalking , dark shadows and jump scares .
I love that in some movies , but that ’s not what a “ re-imagining ” of Last House needs to be .
Instead , it should be a true remake of the original with a little more finesse and skill put into it .
This is one of those movies that , should a remake be done well , could actually surpass the original .
Here ’s hoping …
Several months ago a survey was started to find out what people are using for GUI development and what they ’re looking for from the various toolkits .
Well the results have been published and you can look them over for yourself .
Apparently JRuby / Swing are n’t exactly taking over the GUI development landscape , although I ’d like to see the results from just developers pursuing commercial applications as I believe many of the GUI toolkits ( such as Shoes ) simply are not usable for this use case .

Researchers and students seeking to enter the United States routinely encountered difficulties in the months after the Sept. 11 attacks , but as security checks became faster and more efficient , most could count on receiving a visa or a visa renewal in about two weeks .
That appears to no longer be the case .
“ I started hearing this back in early November , ” said Amy Scott , assistant vice president for federal relations at the Association of American Universities .
“ We are very concerned that we are losing ground here , that people are missing the opportunities to come to the U.S. , to teach , conduct research or just participate in a conference . ”
John Marburger , President George W. Bush ’s science adviser , said in an interview in the February issue of the magazine Seed that “ it should be easier to get into the U.S. as a student , ” adding , “ We really need to be careful about our openness to the world . ”
According to “ Beyond ‘ Fortress America , ’ ” a report in January by the National Academy of Sciences , universities around the world now have the research equipment and infrastructure to compete with their American counterparts .
When the United States puts up barriers , the report said , “ foreign universities are well positioned to extend competing offers . ”
Or as Danielle Guichard - Ashbrook of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology put it : “ There are other countries that want these folks .
They are the best of the best .
They have other options . ”
Ms. Guichard - Ashbrook directs the International Students Office at M.I.T.
Foreign students eventually make it to campus , she said , although the path may be slow and bumpy and they do not necessarily arrive on time .
Problems typically occur if they leave the United States  for family visits or scientific meetings abroad  and then find they need a new visa to return .
She told of one student from the Middle East who agonized when he was called home to the bedside of his dying father for fear he would not be allowed back to his classes .
He made the trip , she said , and his return was delayed .
Update : First , everything is fine !
The ISS is safe , and the astronauts are alive and back to work .
Here 's the story .
Today at 16:39 ( UT ) , a small piece of space debris passed by the International Space Station .
Orbit predictions put it close enough to the ISS to be a real danger , though the actual collisions odds were low .
Astronauts closed all the hatches in the station and moved to the Soyuz escape module to wait it out .
After the debris passed safely , they emerged , opened up all the hatches , and got back to work .
It 's still not known as I write this just how close the debris passed .
It was a piece of a used booster called a Payload Assist Module , a device used to boost satellites from low Earth orbit up to geosynchronous orbit .
Robert Pearlman from CollectSpace told me :
This object is the " yo weight " from a Delta PAM - D stage ( used to launch GPS 37 in 1993 ) .
The yo weight is a small mass attached to a 1 - meter - long cable , used to tumble the stage after separation from the payload so it does n't recontact .
The mass is probably less than 1 kg , but because it 's basically a piece of string , the cross-section is large for its mass .
A 1 kg mass moving at a relative speed of several kilometers per second could have done vast damage to the ISS , especially since it was not compact like a chunk of metal , but extended .
It could have torn a huge hole in the station , and I imagine the astronauts are breathing a huge sigh of relief .
The good news here is that this object , though small , was tracked well enough to give the astronauts on the ISS plenty of time to evacuate ... and do n't overlook the fact that the astronauts did a great job handling the situation ( whereas I would be very busy screaming and wetting myself ) .
This was an extraordinary event handled by extraordinary people .
My sincere thanks to those who took care of it , and congratulations as well .
Also , my thanks to Nancy Atkinson of Universe Today for breaking this story and updating Twitter so fervently .
Here is my original post on this :
Nancy Atkinson is on top of the story that a small piece of orbital debris might hit the space station at 11:39 Central ( US ) time , less than 40 minutes from the time I write this .
Astronauts on board are preparing for this potential impact .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The Obama administration has promised to fix big financial firms with a helping of " tough love . "
But even stronger medicine -- such as breaking up troubled banks and starting new ones -- may be necessary .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said Tuesday that the administration seeks to restore the flow of credit in the economy by offering $ 1 trillion in financing for consumer and business loans , a $ 500 billion plan to induce private investors to buy troubled assets from banks and $ 50 billion for foreclosure relief .
But some investors and economists are urging policymakers not to pour more scarce resources into troubled banks that are still run by the executives who got them into trouble in the first place .
Instead , they say , the government -- confronting a deteriorating economy and a cast of financial executives that 's largely unchanged despite the near collapse of their industry -- should be setting up incentives to create a healthier and more sustainable financial system down the road .
That means finding a way to cut the too - big - to - fail crowd down to size .
" Without a tough government - imposed framework , intervention on this scale will be hard for people to swallow , " said Richard Ferlauto , director of corporate governance and pension investment at AFSCME , the biggest U.S. public worker union .
" They 're going to need to be quite tough . "
Buy common stock and start swinging the ax
The key to devising a workable financial rescue plan , economists say , is to draw in new capital for troubled banks while creating incentives for their investors to exert real control over management .
This can be done by forcing troubled firms to attempt to raise capital in the markets , including from their existing owners .
If the banks are n't successful in doing so , the government should pour in new capital while taking appropriate compensation -- in common stock rather than preferred , for instance -- that would then be sold off as soon as is practical .
Ross Levine , an economics professor at Brown University , said if the government starts buying common stock in banks , it will show that it is serious about taking control of troubled institutions and protecting the taxpayer .
" If you go refilling the bank accounts of the architects of this crisis , people are going to have an emotional reaction , " said Levine .
" You can't make the recovery plan a direct gift to the existing owners and managers of these enterprises . "
If the government actually owned common stock in banks , it would allow regulators to have more of a say in how the banks are managed going forward .
That could make it easier to break up the big banks , which some experts think makes sense .
The near collapse over the past year of Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) shows that the so - called financial supermarket model does n't work for anyone but executives , Ferlauto said .
Shareholders , bank customers and taxpayers have all been short - changed in the creation of these dysfunctional institutions , he said .
Shares of Citi and BofA are trading near their levels of two decades ago despite receiving of some $ 400 billion in government support .
" You need to find a way to break these banks into pieces with a business focus , " said Ferlauto .
" You need to find a way to get retail banking going again . "
New banks needed to kick start lending again
Forcing big banks to downsize may not be enough to end the crisis , though .
Some think that the scope of the problems confronting all the big U.S. financial firms -- including healthier banks like JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) -- will make it more difficult for Geithner 's bank rescue effort to work .
With the economy expected to weaken further this year , more heavily indebted companies will probably be forced into default .
Falling home prices and rising unemployment will also likely lead to increased losses in banks ' mortgage and credit card portfolios .
" The banks are impaired by declining asset prices , particularly in real estate , and that is n't going to change any time soon , " said Igor Lotsvin , who runs Soma Asset Management in San Francisco .
" The solvency problems are only going to get worse , because delinquencies in a number of asset classes are going to rise sharply this year . "
With this in mind , Lotsvin and partner David Chu , whose Soma Isosceles fund returned 34 % in 2008 thanks in part to successful short bets against big bank stocks , said there 's a need to start new banks to lend in the place of the troubled existing firms .
They are n't alone in advocating that concept : Paul Romer , an economist at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research , wrote in an op - ed piece last week in the Wall Street Journal that the government could support $ 3.5 trillion in new lending capacity by using the remaining TARP funds to seed new banks instead of fixing the old ones .
Not everyone is sold on this notion , though .
Levine called the idea " impractical , " saying banks are repositories of information and business connections as well as conduits for money .
" These institutions -- even the troubled ones -- are immensely valuable to society , " Levine said .
" Trying to go around them wo n't work . "
Nonetheless , the debate highlights what Geithner and his colleagues most certainly realize : the banking problem wo n't be fixed quickly .
" There are no obvious decisions here , " said Chu .
" No one is saying this is going to be easy . "
Texas babies ’ blood used in research without consent Babies ’ blood used in research without parents ’
OK
Samples screened for birth defects then stored indefinitely for scientific study
AUSTIN — For almost seven years , the state has been indefinitely storing blood from nearly all newborns in Texas without their parents ’ consent for possible use in medical research .
The blood is collected as part of a 44 - year - old state - mandated newborn screening program in which hospitals , birthing centers and midwives draw blood from a baby ’s heel — parental consent is n’t required for that , either — so the state can test for a host of birth defects .
The state either discarded the blood after six months or , more recently , stored it for three years before destroying it .
But starting in 2002 , the state health department began collecting and keeping blood indefinitely for current or future medical research , a practice that has been the subject of a legal challenge in Minnesota .
Five dots of blood are collected on paper for the screening and then stored .
Under the health department ’s policy , the samples can be used by the medical community for things such as cancer research , birth defects studies and calibration of lab equipment , said Doug McBride , spokesman for the Department of State Health Services .
The law does n’t require that parents be told how the blood might be used .
But if parents are aware of the blood draws , Texas law lets them opt out only for religious reasons .
Parental consent is n’t obtained , McBride said , because “ requiring permission might be more costly and could require more time of hospital staff .
But our real concern would be for the babies with detectable disorders that were n’t detected because their parents declined the screening — babies who had no say in that decision . ”
The blood spots are stored at Texas A&M University ’s School of Rural Public Health , and each card bears a code number instead of a name , McBride said .
The names matching those codes are kept at the state health department and are not released to researchers without parental consent , McBride said .
The state considers the stored samples to be “ de-identified . ”
Since 1965 , Texas law has required the screening of newborns for birth defects , and the state now checks for 27 different health conditions — ranging from a gene that can cause severe mental disability to sickle cell anemia .
In 2002 , the state health department ’s Birth Defects Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch asked that the blood be stored for research rather than discarded ; the department ’s leadership agreed .
It contracted with Texas A&M in 2006 to store the samples because the agency did not have room to keep them indefinitely , according to a Nov. 15 , 2006 , health department memo .
The agency says in the memo that it did not need to change state law to store the blood samples because “ the agency ’s position has been that health - related research that uses these blood spots is consistent with this agency ’s overall mission . ”
The same memo said the department considers the blood samples to be “ state records , ” which state law allows agencies to store indefinitely .
Practice concerns father
Quinn Godfrey , a 32 - year - old father of two from San Antonio , said he had no idea when his daughter was born three years ago that newborn blood was being collected or stored indefinitely .
“ My concern is they might not be able to do much with it right now , but 10 years from now ?
They could do a lot with it the way technology is going , ” Godfrey said .
When his second child was born Feb.
9 , Godfrey said , he objected and asked to have an outside lab do it .
But when he was told that was n’t possible , he gave in , he said .
Researchers in Texas said they hope to allay any parental concerns by pointing to the good being done with the blood and the future benefits to society .
“ I ’m using it to extract genetic variations and causes of certain birth defects : cleft lip and cleft palate and club foot , ” said Jacqueline Hecht , a professor of pediatrics and vice chairwoman for research at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston .
Hecht gets selected blood samples of children known to have those defects from the state ’s birth defects registry , but the names are excluded , McBride said .
By knowing the genetic fingerprints of disorders , researchers can suggest ways to prevent birth defects , Hecht and others said .
Hecht said she considers privacy concerns to be overblown because she and her colleagues have no idea to whom the blood belongs .
“ There are a lot of hoops you have to jump through ” to use samples , she said , such as getting approval from an institutional review board , which looks out for patients ’ rights .
“ I do n’t see what the issue is . ”
But if the stored blood is so scientifically beneficial , “ why is n’t it more publicized ? ” asked Godfrey , the San Antonio father .
“ It just seems like they ’re being awfully sneaky about it . ”
James Harrington , director of the Texas Civil Rights Project , said that although his three grown children were all born in Texas , he had no idea of the practice and was “ stunned by the whole thing . ”
Harrington said he has no problems with screening newborns for birth defects but said he opposes storing samples without consent .
“ I believe it ’s a violation ... of unlawful search and seizure , ” he said .
“ We ’re dealing with the most confidential information we have , and ( for the government ) to say , ‘ Trust us , ’ ... I find it impossible to believe . ”
McBride said , “ There is nothing illicit , untoward or threatening going on .
The purpose is to save lives , not to steal them . ”
He ’s heard no complaints , he said .
“ I would bet most parents are n’t aware in Texas , ” said Twila Brase , a nurse who is president of the Citizens ’ Council on Health Care in St. Paul , Minn .
The nonprofit , which has advocated patient and physician relationship rights since 1998 , is fighting the practice in Minnesota after learning about it six years ago , she said .
“ Our greatest concern is that this blood is being stored unbeknownst to the parents , and genetic research is being conducted without the consent or knowledge of the parents , ” Brase said .
“ And it ’s available for whatever legislators would decide to do with it in the future .
When parents here discovered that , they got absolutely steamed . ”
What surprised Brase and others even more than not requiring parental consent was what they call the “ warehousing ” of the blood samples .
Minnesota has stored more than 815,000 samples in the past 11 years , and as in Texas , no law authorizes that , Brase said .
Texas has stored 4.2 million samples since July 2002 — two per child , McBride said .
McBride said the state is bound by state and federal laws to protect the privacy rights of patients so it would not release the names to researchers or anyone else without parental consent .
Andrew Olshan , chairman of the epidemiology department at the University of North Carolina , said there is strong interest among researchers in creating a national database drawing on research from the samples to help solve the riddles of what causes autism , cancer and various birth defects .
He said the potential benefits outweigh privacy concerns .
But a Texas medical ethicist said parental consent should be obtained at the time the blood is drawn .
“ Even if something is a social good , there can be a social harm , ” said Dr. Howard Brody , director of the Institute for the Medical Humanities at the UT Medical Branch at Galveston .
“ It ’s important to have trust in the scientific community ... and the more things that are done without consent , the more trust goes down . ”
Notes for using Unicode with Python 2.x
Python is very Unicode friendly , but there are still a few quirks that people new to the language ( or not so new ! ) need to assimilate in order to use Unicode effectively .
To avoid going over old ground , for a primer please see this excellent article on using Unicode with Python .
Here , I want to talk about some of the corner cases remaining after you 've absorbed the great advice in that article .
This is not , of course , to say that Unicode support in Python is in any way buggy .
Nay , Python 's Unicode support is a unique snowflake , perfect in its own special way .
It 's just us flawed humans who have trouble appreciating fully its snowy beauty , especially if we 're not Dutch .
And of course , all strings are Unicode in Python 3.0 .
That and the new syntax for extended iterable unpacking are the two main reasons I 'm looking forward to Python 3.0 .
But alas , we 'll have to enjoy the unique aspects of Unicode in Python for a bit more , now .
Input
I like to keep my programs as bastions of sanity , where all text is handled as Unicode .
I thus try to put gatekeepers on all code accepting input , passing it on to the rest of the program logic as Unicode .
Programs that fail to do this often break when dealing with text input that they were sure would be fine as " ascii . "
One example of this is file paths .
Programmers generally expect paths to be in nice , ASCII characters , and that 's why their scripts often break when I run them on my Japanese system .
For example , on my system the Desktop folder contains Japanese characters :
C: \Documents and Settings \Ryan Ginstrom\デスクトップ\
When a random python script breaks when run from my Desktop folder , I peek inside , and it 's invariably because the programmer never expected the path to contain characters that could n't be expressed as ASCII .
Put it into Unicode as soon as you get it .
As mentioned in the article above , the codecs module makes reading text files as Unicode very simple :
import codecs
unitext = codecs . open ( " / data.txt " , encoding= " utf - 8 " ) . read ( )
There are just a couple of twists to watch out for when using the codecs module .
It obviously can't guess the encoding ; you 've got to figure this out yourself .
open ( ) converts the UTF - 8 byte - order mark ( BOM ) ( ' \xef\xbb\xbf ' ) into the UTF - 16 BOM character ( ' \ufeff ' ) , while removing the UTF - 16 and UTF - 16BE BOMs .
This might not be what you expected .
Because of these shortcomings unique aspects of the codecs module , I normally use the chardet module in a custom function to get a random ( i.e. user - supplied ) text file as Unicode :
def bytes2unicode ( bytes , errors= ' replace ' ) :
" " " Convert a byte string into Unicode Have to chop off the BOM by hand .
Usage :
text = bytes2unicode ( open ( " txt " , " rb " ) .read ( ) )
" " " bytes2unicodebytes , errors=somefile.rb encodings = (( codecs . BOM_UTF8 , " utf - 8 " ) ,
( codecs .
BOM_UTF16_LE , " utf - 16 " ) ,
( codecs .
BOM_UTF16_BE , " UTF - 16BE " ) ) for bom , enc in encodings :
if bytes.startswith( bom ) :
return unicode ( bytes [ len ( bom ) : ] , enc , errors=errors ) #
No BOM found , so use chardet
encoding = chardet.detect ( bytes ) .get ( ' encoding ' , ' ascii ' )
return unicode ( bytes , encoding , errors=errors )
Output
As I mentioned , I like to get my text into Unicode as early as possible , and keep it as Unicode as late as possible .
Ideally , I 'd like to just output my text as Unicode , and let the output stream take care of the encoding ( if any ) .
That 's why when I need to output Unicode as a stream of bytes , I use the codecs module for files , and wrap the output stream otherwise .
This is needed , for example , when using cStringIO , which chokes on Unicode .
#coding : UTF8
import cStringIO myval = u" 日本語 " out = cStringIO.StringIO ( )
print >> out , myval
Error message :
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
File " C:\workspace \SpamTest\uni2.py " , line 8 , in < module >
print >> out , myval
UnicodeEncodeError : ' ascii ' codec can't encode characters in position 0 - 2 : ordinal not in range ( 128 )
I can fix this by wrapping out with a class that intercepts the write ( ) method , and converts Unicode strings to the specified encoding just before writing .
class OutStreamEncoder ( object ) :
" "
Wraps a stream with an encoder Wraps a stream with an encoder usage :
out = OutStreamEncoder ( out , " - 8 " )
" " " OutStreamEncoderutf def __init__( self , outstream , encoding ) :
self.out = outstream
self .encoding = encoding def write ( self , obj ) :
" " "
Wraps the output stream , encoding Unicode
strings with the specified encoding
" " " if isinstance ( obj , unicode ) :
self.out.write(obj.encode(self.encoding ) )
else :
self.out.write( obj ) def __getattr__ ( self , attr ) :
" " " Delegate everything but ' write ' to the stream " " " return getattr( self.out , attr )
Now the example above works :
" 日本語 " myval = u out = cStringIO. StringIO ( )
out = OutStreamEncoder ( out , " utf - 8 " )
print >> out , myval
IDLE
IDLE has its own peculiarities regarding Unicode .
It actually handles Unicode like a champ , but it assumes that everything you type at the command prompt is in the file - system encoding .
Since I 'm on a Japanese system , this is " mbcs . "
You can thus get into some odd states :
>>> #
A unicode string of multibyte chars as bytes …
>>> u " 日本 語 "
u ' \x 93 \x fa \x 96 { \x 8c \x ea '
>>> #
This is what it should be
>>> unicode ( " 日本語 " , " mbcs " )
u ' \u 65e5 \u 672c \u 8a9e '
The general way to avoid these problems in IDLE is using sys.getfilesystemencoding ( ) .
>>> import sys
>>> print unicode ( " 日本語 " , sys .
getfilesystemencoding ( ) )
日本語
Doctests
doctest is so full of snow - flaky uniqueness , I could put cherry syrup on it and call it a snow cone .
Note in the example below that my " is_asian " function 's doctests contain a Japanese character ( 日 ) .
#coding : UTF8 # 0x3000 is ideographic space ( i.e. double - byte space )
IDEOGRAPHIC_SPACE = 0x3000 def is_asian ( char ) :
" " "
Is the character Asian ? >>> is_asian ( u'a ' )
False
>>> is_asian ( u'日 ' )
True
" " " return ord ( char ) > IDEOGRAPHIC_SPACE
Running doctest on this gives a rather cryptic error :
Failed example :
is_asian ( u'日 ')
Exception raised :
Traceback ( most recent call last ) :
File " C: \Python25\lib\doctest.py " , line 1228 , in __run
compileflags , 1 ) in test.globs
File " < doctest __main__.is_asian [ 1 ] > " , line 1 , in < module >
is_asian ( u'日 ')
File " C:\workspace \SpamTest\uni1.py " , line 15 , in is_asian
return ord ( char ) > IDEOGRAPHIC_SPACE
TypeError : ord ( ) expected a character , but string of length 3 found
It turns out that doctests can't handle Unicode characters .
It 's making the same " string of utf - 8 bytes as Unicode characters " error as IDLE , and thus interpreting one character ( " 日 " ) as three .
So we have to trick doctest by taking the repr value of the Unicode text ( I usually stick the actual characters in a comment above it ) .
Here 's a repaired version , which runs without errors :
def is_asian ( char ) :
" "
Repaired version of doctests Repaired version of doctests >>> is_asian ( u'a ' )
False
>>> # u'日'
>>> is_asian( u'\u65e5 ′ )
True
" " " is_asianchar return ord ( char ) > IDEOGRAPHIC_SPACE
To see the silver lining in this , at least it encourages you to keep your complicated tests in unit tests , and save doctests for simple , illustrative purposes .
Conclusion
Unicode support in Python is actually quite good — much better than most languages .
And it will get even better with Python 3.0 .
In the meantime , however , there are a few gotchas to look out for when using Unicode in Python .

The money war over Proposition 8 shows no signs of letting up .
Opponents of the measure , which banned gay marriage in California , said today that they plan to file a second complaint with the state alleging the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints deliberately did not disclose its financial contributions to the Yes on 8 campaign .
Californians Against
Hate already filed one complaint with the California Fair Political Practices Commission , sparking an ongoing investigation of whether the church violated campaign finance laws .
The church has repeatedly said it did not violate any rules and was not trying to hide how much the church gave .
Records released last month show the church donated about $ 198,000 to the Yes on 8 case .
“ I ’m calling this Mormongate , ” Fred Karger , founder of Californians Against Hate , told the Associated Press .
“ I think there ’s been a massive coverup . ”

Feb 13 , 2009 ( CIDRAP News ) – Because of a suboptimal match between this year 's flu vaccine and circulating influenza B viruses , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has recommended changing one of the three strains used in flu vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere next fall and winter .
The WHO 's choices for the two influenza A strains remain the same as last year , according to new reports published on the WHO Web site this week .
The agency recommended keeping the influenza A / H1N1 and A / H3N2 variants used in this year 's vaccine , both of which are labeled Brisbane strains .
The influenza B component of this year 's flu vaccine was from the Yamagata lineage , but the proportion of strains from the Victoria lineage continues to increase and has become predominant in many countries , the WHO said .
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's ( CDC's ) most recent flu surveillance report , for the week of Feb 1 through 7 , said that of 78 influenza B viruses that were characterized , 55 belonged to the Victoria lineage .
Health officials in the United States have discussed including both lineages in the seasonal vaccine to address the unpredictable prevalence of the influenza B strains , especially since a vaccine against one lineage offers little protection against the other .
Last year the WHO recommended a total vaccine makeover for the 2008 - 09 flu season because of a mismatch to circulating strains the previous season .
Each February the WHO assesses the flu virus strains in circulation before picking the strains for the next Northern Hemisphere flu season .
It takes about 6 months for vaccine manufacturers to grow the viruses in chicken eggs and formulate them into trivalent ( three - strain ) vaccines .
Changing one or two strains is not unusual .
The WHO recommends the following for next season 's vaccine :
For the H1N1 component , a strain similar to A / Brisbane / 59/2007
For the H3N2 component , a strain similar to A / Brisbane / 10/2007
For the B component , a strain similar to B / Brisbane / 60/2008 - like virus , replacing B / Florida/4/2006
The Brisbane strains of H1N1 and H3N2 will be used in this year 's vaccine for the Southern Hemisphere , where the flu season runs from May through October , according to the WHO .
However , the influenza B component of the Southern Hemisphere 's vaccine is similar to B / Florida / 4/2006 .
In its full report on the strain selection , the WHO said that between September 2008 and January 2009 , Africa , the Americas , Asia , Europe , and Oceania all reported influenza activity .
Though levels were lower than in the same period last year , activity was higher in some European countries , including the United Kingdom , Norway , Portugal , Spain , Poland , and the Netherlands .
In the Northern Hemisphere , countries such as Japan , Tunisia , and European countries reported regional outbreaks of H3N2 in December and January .
In the United States , H1N1 viruses predominated , while in Canada , B viruses were more common .
H1N1 strains that show resistance to the antiviral drug oseltamivir ( Tamiflu ) , one of two neuraminidase inhibitors recommended for treatment , predominated in most regions of the world .
No such resistance was seen in H3N2 or B viruses , and there were no reports of viruses resistant to zanamivir ( Relenza ) .

Four illegal immigrants caught sneaking into Britain inside 32ft fake Christmas tree
Illegal immigrants hid inside a lorry carrying an artificial Christmas tree destined for a display in Northampton ( file photo )
Four illegal immigrants sneaked into the country hidden in a 32ft artificial Christmas tree , it was claimed .
They were discovered inside a lorry at a council depot in Northampton .
The aluminium and nylon tree - and two other smaller ones - were destined for the town centre 's Christmas display .
But staff at the depot opened the vehicle to discover the men , and immediately dialled 999 .
A spokesman for Northamptonshire Police confirmed that four men - two from Iraq , two from Iran - were arrested and are being questioned by officers from the UK Border Agency .
A spokesman for the agency told the Northampton Chronicle : ' Following their arrest after being found in a lorry , four suspected illegal immigrants were apprehended and transferred to our specialist teams of officers . '
The French driver of the lorry is not thought to have been aware that the men boarded the vehicle .
But Northampton Borough Council denied that the lorry was carrying Christmas decorations , claiming the vehicle was at the depot to pick up paper for recycling .
In a separate incident , UK Border Agency officials caught a group of Iraqi illegal immigrants trying to enter Britain by hiding in a lorry full of ham .
The five men were found in Calais in a Polish - registered truck headed for Haverhill , Suffolk , as it boarded a ferry to Dover .
The men were handed over to the French authorities .
I ran across an interesting post on programming .
reddit called Anecdote Driven Development , or Why I Do n’t Do TDD .
The article focused on testing , but what I found most interesting was the part about how long a method or function should be :
I recently wrote some code for Class :: Sniff which would detect “ long methods ” and report them as a code smell . [ … ]
Ben Tilly asked an embarrassingly obvious question : how do I know that long methods are a code smell ?
I threw out the usual justifications , but he would n’t let up .
He wanted information and he cited the excellent book Code Complete as a counter - argument .
I got down my copy of this book and started reading “ How Long Should A Routine Be ” ( page 175 , second edition ) .
The author , Steve McConnell , argues that routines should not be longer than 200 lines .
Holy crud !
That ’s waaaaaay to long .
If a routine is longer than about 20 or 30 lines , I reckon it ’s time to break it up .
Regrettably , McConnell has the cheek to cite six separate studies , all of which found that longer routines were not only not correlated with a greater defect rate , but were also often cheaper to develop and easier to comprehend .
I ’d never heard this before , but this is great , because it verifies what I ’ve believed for a long time …
That which obscures my code is bad
Last year I wrote a post called If this is Object Calisthenics , I think I ’ll stay on the couch where I argued ( among other things ) that making your methods as short as possible is NOT a good idea .
My justification was that it just makes the code more complicated : “ That which obscures my code is bad . ”
But this is even better …actual empirical evidence .
I do n’t have a copy of Code Complete , so I did a bit more research to see if I could find the actual studies .
I found a good summary here ( links added by me ) :
McConnell cites the findings of several studies of the correlation between the size of routines and the cost and / or fault rate of routines .
Some findings which favor longer routines are : Routine size is inversely correlated with errors , up to 200 lines of code .
[ Basili and Perricone , 1984 ]
Larger routines ( 65 lines of code or more ) are cheaper to develop per line of code .
[ Card , Church , and Agresti , 1986 ; Card and Glass , 1990 ]
Routines with fewer than 143 source statements ( including comments ) had 23 % more errors per line of code than larger routines .

Routines averaging 100 to 150 lines of code need to be changed least .

Hmmm .
It looks like the studies are all about 20 - 25 years old .
I wonder if — or how — the results would apply now .
I took a quick look at the papers ( the ones I could get my hands on ) , and the programming languages used were : Fortran [ Card ‘ 86 ] , Pascal and Fortran [ Lind ‘ 89 ] , and a mix of custom languages ( one being PL / 1 - like ) and assembly [ Selby ‘ 91 ] .
Does anyone know of any more current results ?
( Greg ? )
It would be interesting to see if this can be shown with more modern languages .
But intuitively , it makes sense .
In her book Software Engineering : Theory and Practice , Joanne Atlee summarizes it nicely :
Card and Glass ( 1990 ) point out that the design complexity really involves two aspects : the complexity within each component and the complexity of the relationships among components .
By making your methods shorter , you ’re just trading one kind of complexity for another .
Update :
In the comments , Stephane Vaucher pointed to a much more recent study ( from 2002 ) : The Optimal Class Size for Object - Oriented Software .
They point out that the conclusion that shorter methods are more error - prone is misleading , at best :
The observed phenomenon of smaller components having a higher fault density is due to an arithmetic artifact .
First , note that the above conclusions were drawn based exclusively on examination of the relationship between fault density versus size [ … ]
However , by definition , if we model the relationship between any variable X and 1/X , we will get a negative association as long as the relationship between size and faults is growing at most linearly .
Another way of putting it is : short methods may have more defects per line , but they still have fewer defects overall .
There may be a justification for not making methods too short , but these studies do not provide one .
The one sure thing is that the more code you write , the more bugs you will have .

4.0 out of 5 stars With savings of $ 54,000 , who can resist ?
US Economist James Galbraith Financial Crisis Caused by a ' Culture of Complicity '
While the world talks about new ways to save struggling banks , there are a handful of economists who think some banks should n't be saved at all .
American economist James Galbraith told Manager Magazin that it might make more sense to break them up and start over .
" People have spoken for a long time about taking someone from virtual racing and seeing if they can do the real thing , but nobody has had the courage to do it until now , " he said .
" We are here to help Lucas through what is a completely new experience .
During practice , he was only two seconds a lap slower than myself and the rest of the team , which shows how far he has come in the short time he has been with us . "

In the Internet we see our greatest hope for freedom and for the continual progress of humanity .
In the Internet we see the anachronistic and obsolete institutions of society being pushed aside for a new dawn of better things .

1 - Your Own Personal Bailout
A thought experiment for libertarians : Imagine that circumstance has left you heavily exposed to one of the high profile business implosions we 're seeing every day .
Maybe a few years ago you put a good chunk of change in Bank of America bonds , when they were AAA rated and looked as secure as cash .
Maybe you 've spent decades as an engineer at GM , and your salary and investment portfolio are heavily tied to the fate of that company .
Maybe you were inspired as a teen by the " money is the root of all good " speech in Atlas Shrugged , you moved to New York to be among the skyscrapers , and climbed the ladders of finance until you landed a job at Bear Stearns or Lehman .
What would you do when the bailout train came rolling your way ?
Extend the experiment a bit further .
You married your high school sweetheart .
You bought a house .
You had kids .
They are counting on you to bring home the paycheck , especially now that times are tough and there are no jobs to be had .
If your company goes under , your family will be ruined .
The economy is tanking all around you .
You 're watching as all sorts of people are getting handouts of taxpayer money .
You need for Bank of America to get a bailout or else you will lose your shirt on those bonds .
You need GM to get an " emergency loan " or else you are out of a job .
But you 're a libertarian .
You understand just how destructive these bailouts are .
You know they are morally reprehensible .
They are against everything you think you stand for .
Maybe you tell your friends that you do n't want any bailout money .
But what do you secretly want in your heart ?
Do you really wish the government would leave your company to fail ?
Do you really want to be denied your own bailout ?
To all libertarians , I now pose the dilemma of Your Own Personal Bailout :
If you could vote for or against a nice big government check written specifically for you , on a secret ballot , knowing full well that every day people all around you are voting to take large chunks of taxpayer change for themselves , what would you do ?
This , in a nutshell , is the problem with democracy .
It is also why we advocates of liberty will never bring about lasting change via electoral politics .
2 - The Real Digital Revolution
Amazon and eBay , plane tickets and stocks , Facebook , iTunes , Wikipedia , Google , Smart Phones , Telecommuting , and a whole lotta free porn -- in the beginning ( 1993 ) we knew that the Internet 's growth from a military tool to a worldwide mass communication device was revolutionary .
Here we are .
The revolution has arrived .
While the business schools and Thomas Friedmans of the world see the digital revolution in terms of changing methods of business and communication , those who look at a higher level , at how the digital revolution has changed our very ideas and thoughts , are all reaching the same conclusion .
The Internet is making society much more libertarian .
Again from Eric Garris in 2005 :
Whereas the establishment media echoed the administration line about weapons of mass destruction during the run-up to the Iraq war , the Internet was bursting with dissent and exposure of the lies .
Whereas the imbedded establishment media are dependent upon the good graces of the emperor and his cabinet , the Internet is saturated with independent thought and criticism ....
And the truth is winning , and the Internet is winning in the market of information and news media .
The history of modern libertarianism in America can be neatly divided into two parts : before and after the Internet .
Before the Internet , libertarians communicated in newsletters and mail order catalogs , they gathered infrequently in select locations , and their most effective tool for getting the word out was the Libertarian Party .
Now , in the post - Internet age , libertarian views are expressed on websites with extraordinarily wide readerships , libertarians form social networks on the web , they dominate the political debate in the blogosphere .
That last part is most important .
The Internet is the world 's decentralized way of organizing all its information , and because it is market driven , the best , most useful information rises to the top .
At one time , libertarian thought was so shut out of the mainstream that wealthy businessmen tried to form a network of free market think tanks so there would at least be something to counter the leftists who owned all of academia and the media .
Now , thanks to the Internet , it is readily clear to all thinking Americans that the Federal Reserve is the primary cause of our current financial crisis , that the War in Iraq is based on lies , that the War on Drugs is a monumental failure .
As of this writing , Meltdown by Tom Woods is # 12 on the NY Times Bestseller List and sales of Atlas Shrugged are through the roof .
Rick Santelli's libertarian rant from the floor of the Chicago Exchange not only happened on national television , but went viral on the Internet .
The sheer act of going onto the Internet and writing down our ideas for others to see , of participating in a debate from which we were excluded before the Internet , has caused an explosive growth in the libertarian movement .
From an article last fall in Reason :
In 1970 , the Harris Poll asked Americans , ' Regardless of how you may vote , what do you usually consider yourself 'a Republican , a Democrat , an Independent , or some other party ? '
Fully 49 percent of respondents chose Democrat , and 31 percent called themselves Republicans .
In 2007 , the latest year for which data is available , those figures were 35 percent for Democrats and 26 percent for Republicans .
The only real growth market in politics is voters who decline political affiliation , and the only political adjective seemingly gaining in popularity is 'libertarian .
One would think that the strength of libertarianism online would translate into more libertarianism in our politics .
It has n't .
While anonymous individuals of the libertarian persuasion continue to crush ideological opponents in comment threads and message boards all over the web , libertarian ideas continue to get crushed in Washington .
Why is that ?
3 - How did you answer the personal bailout question ?
For decades , the mantra throughout the libertarian movement has been " educate the people . "
Libertarians believed that change would come when enough people had seen the light , and our primary job was simply to spread the word .
A critical mass would come about , and Americans would elect politicians who worked to reduce government and protect our freedoms .
In a 2006 Zogby poll , 59 % of voters identified themselves as fiscally conservative and socially liberal .
44 % were willing to describe their views as libertarian .
Earlier this month , a Fox News poll found that the majority of Americans think the federal government is too big today , and by a 20 percentage point margin , Americans would rather pay lower taxes and have a smaller government rather than pay higher taxes for larger government .
Is the problem that Americans still do n't understand the power of free markets ?
Six in ten Americans opposed the first auto bailout , but it passed .
Americans were strongly opposed to the first $ 700 billion bailout and called their Congressmen in unprecedented numbers to oppose it , but it passed .
A majority of Americans are unhappy with the wars in the Middle East , and elected Obama in large part out of that opposition .
Since his election , he has increased troop levels in Afghanistan and increased funding to Israel for their own war effort in Gaza .
We 've reached a critical juncture in the history of libertarianism .
That Holy Grail of libertarianism , educate the people , has been happening to great effect , but our government is growing faster than ever !
Sure , the dinosaurs still herd together in places like DailyKos , universities , and Massachusetts , but their numbers are rapidly shrinking relative to ours .
The Internet has blown open the debate and in just a few years libertarians have torn down centuries of bad ideas and outright lies , leaving the plain truth available for anyone to see , and it is quite clear that people do see it .
It is quite clear that people want to elect politicians to achieve it .
But even when America votes for a smaller government , they get a larger one .
Even when millions of us call our representatives and demand they vote for smaller government , they vote for larger government .
Throughout the land , large and growing numbers of people from all demographics now understand the value of freedom and free markets .
What they do n't understand is that voting is not going to get them there .
This simple insight goes against everything they 've been taught since childhood .
It asks people to step entirely outside of the political debate and question whether there is anything to debate at all .
It asks an ordinary , socially acceptable Constitutionalist to become a free market radical .
4 - How Do We Get From Here To There
I have for you a rare but real sliver of optimism in these dark times .
Yes , government is growing faster than ever .
Yes , Congress and the Federal Reserve are growing more destructive every day .
Yes , it feels like we libertarians have accomplished nothing .
But we 're actually quite close , and the Internet has given us the tools we need to finish what we 've started .
No , I 'm not about to take you on a " crypto anarchist " rant .
From Jim Bell 's " Assassination Politics " to John Perry Barlow 's " Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace , " I am aware I am just the latest in a long line of libertarians claiming the Internet can save us .
Via the Patriot Act and other legislation , the government has effectively put off the day when strong encryption allows us all to conduct our business in private and bring about our dream society .
What I see libertarians doing to great effect is just the opposite .
Instead of rabidly seeking out privacy ( one of our favorite words ) , libertarians are using the Internet to turn up the volume on their message .
As explained above , the message is getting out there .
The only reason it has n't worked yet is that we are shouting at Washington , and Washington is incapable of listening .
But in the midst of all that shouting , we 've accomplished an important first step .
Even though libertarians are losing in the public policy arena , they are winning the public policy debate .
A rapidly expanding number of Americans want and understand the need for smaller government .
Change will happen when those Americans understand that they cannot shrink the government at the ballot box .
In 2008 , libertarians showed they are capable of causing a real stir .
The Ron Paul campaign , with its record fundraising , its widespread and spontaneous grass - roots support , the huge , enthusiastic turnout at rallies around the country , was unlike anything I 've ever seen in libertarian activism .
Yes , it all fizzled out when it came time to vote in the primaries , and that 's precisely the point .
How could Ron Paul possibly get anywhere telling voters in Iowa that he was opposed to agricultural subsidies , telling old people in New Hampshire that the entitlements were bankrupt , telling autoworkers in Michigan and Ohio that he was in favor of free trade ?
Even people who understand that liberty is best cannot resist the lure of their own personal bailout .
That is why libertarians must stop making the case that we need our politicians to shrink the government , and must start making the case that our government is a hopeless enterprise that cannot be reformed until it is first abandoned .
I can hear some of you now ... I make this case all the time , I 've been making this case for years , you say .
Make it more !
And leave the philosophical arguments for later .
The non-voting libertarians won the ethical debate years ago , but the voting libertarians are still more numerous and visible because they want to get out there and do something .
We need to share the difficult truth with these people that their efforts in the political arena are hopeless .
We need to remind them that libertarians have already won the hearts and minds of America and still Washington grows .
We need to explain to Libertarian Party types that the most powerful force in a democracy is not the will of the people , it is the phenomenon of your own personal bailout .
Imagine if the energy , organization , and money behind the 2008 Ron Paul campaign were instead focused on an educational effort about why government can never do anything except grow , about why it truly does n't matter if it 's McCain or Obama or Palin or Clinton or Republican or Democrat , about how even the most intelligent , principled man in Washington must insert earmarks into every bill to hold onto his seat .
Imagine a blimp flying across the country bearing the message " Do n't Vote . "
These are efforts that would move us toward a free society , and we 're much closer than we 've ever been .
The financial crisis has put tens of millions of Americans in a desperate place , where they now understand that the way we 've been doing things is severely flawed .
Washington 's response , with tens of trillions of new debt , trillions more in new money being printed , bailouts for bankrupt megacorporations and witch hunts when the executives take the money , all the while , nary a word about the entitlements bomb that lurks in the distance -- these things are undermining the stability of our society , and in response , we are witnessing the rise of an increasingly authoritarian state .
Americans are baffled by this , thinking they elected Obama precisely to halt the creeping fascism they saw under Bush .
Some of us know that the government grows and our freedoms shrink not because some devious man is orchestrating his own dictatorship , but because it is the nature of government to grow , period .
When the rest of the world understands this too , maybe then we can finally figure out how to get off our current road to ruin , and give no one else the chance to vote for their own personal bailout .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan ’s NEC
Corp will halt production and sales of personal computers in the Asia - Pacific region around July , a spokesman said on Saturday , in a move that would see it pull out completely from the loss - making PC business overseas .
NEC , which has the top PC market share in Japan , last month signaled a withdrawal from the PC business in Europe , Africa and the Middle East amid slumping demand and tough competition .
NEC has warned it would post a net loss of 290 billion yen ( $ 2.96 billion ) for the business year ending this month , and is accelerating restructuring efforts , which include pulling out from weak businesses and cutting more than 20,000 jobs worldwide .
Competition with rivals such as Hewlett - Packard Co and Dell Inc has been fierce and NEC sold its retail PC business in Europe in 2006 .
NEC sells about one - sixth of its annual global sales of 3 million PCs outside Japan .

If the phrases " scruffy - looking nerf herder , " " stay on target " and " I thought they smelled bad on the outside " have special meaning for you , there 's a good chance that the film " Fanboys " will , too .
Set in the suburban Midwest of 1998 , " Fanboys " follows a group of obsessive " Star Wars " fans who hit the road to the Bay Area with a plot to break into George Lucas ' Skywalker Ranch and attempt to steal an unreleased copy of " Star Wars : Episode I - The Phantom Menace . "
" Fanboys " is directed by Kyle Newman and stars Jay Baruchel ( the least - narcissistic character from " Tropic Thunder " and the goofy boxer Danger in " Million Dollar Baby " ) , Sam Huntington ( TV's " Cavemen " ) , Chris Marquette ( TV's " Joan of Arcadia " ) , Dan Fogler ( " Balls of Fury " ) and " Gossip Girl " Kristen Bell ( the title character in " Forgetting Sarah Marshall " ) .
The film mixes humorous proud - to - be - geeky elements with the serious fate of one of the friends , Linus ( Marquette ) , who has terminal cancer .
Cameos from Seth Rogen , William Shatner , Billy Dee Williams ( Lando Calrissian in " Star Wars : Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back " ) and original Princess Leia Carrie Fisher add to the self - deprecating fun .
We checked in with Bell , 28 , who plays Zoe , the fanboys ' only friend who happens to be a girl .
By e-mail , she shared some of her thoughts about the new film , as well as the mojo of " Star Wars " character Chewbacca the mighty Wookiee .
Q: At what point did it occur to you that you wanted to act in this film ?
A : I first met Kyle , the director , who was , for lack of a better word , " geeked " about the script .
After reading it , I thought it was so special and pretty accurately portrayed a group of people who live and breathe for " Star Wars . "
I thought it would be a cool love letter to " Star Wars " fans .
Q: Which scene was the hardest to complete without laughing ?
A : Every scene the boys had me rolling .
And my character is so sarcastic and cynical they made it very hard to keep a straight face .
Q:Roughly what percentage of the esoteric " Star Wars " jokes did you understand before getting involved with " Fanboys " ?
A : Ha ha ha !
Not many .
But living alongside only " Star Wars " references for two full months , I can now say I understand about 75 percent of it all .
Q : " Star Wars " fans are a tough breed .
What kind of feedback have you received from those who have seen previews ?
Anything surprising ?
A : It 's amazing how much heart " Star Wars " fans have .
They came out of the woodwork and helped us with costumes and hard - to - find props and were extras in the film .
I feel bad they have been waiting so long for it to be released .
Q: Was your preparation for this role any different from what you 've done for your other films ?
Did you watch all of the " Star Wars " movies ?
A : I did watch all of the original " Star Wars " movies before starting to film , and it is obvious why they are still so popular .
Q: From what we 've heard , there were several alternate endings .
Was the final one your favorite , or is there another one you especially like that we can look forward to seeing on the DVD ?
A : There are two versions of the film .
In the original script , Linus has cancer and that is the catalyst for breaking into Skywalker Ranch : one last road trip .
Some people felt that was too heavy , and ( the script ) was revised and we reshot some scenes so he is not sick but gets a slight concussion from a car accident on the road trip .
Q: Do you have a favorite memory or anecdote from being on the set of " Fanboys " ?
A : Well , my least favorite memory would have to be the scene in which Hutch ( Fogler ) was scraping his toe jam off on the bed and flicking it at me .
Because it was not prop toe jam .
Q: Hypothetical scenario :
You 're a senior in high school .
Boba Fett , Han Solo , Darth Vader , Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian all ask you to be their date to the prom .
Whose invitation do you accept ?
A : I would accept Chewie 's invite .
Because he makes me laugh , and he looks like he 's a great cuddler .

OTTAWA – Ontario shed another 35,000 jobs in February as Canada 's manufacturing heartland suffered the full force of the worsening global recession .
The province 's employment loss was nearly half of the 82,600 jobs that disappeared nationally last month , Statistics Canada reported today .
The latest snapshot shows a 7.7 per cent national unemployment rate , nearly two points higher than it was 12 months ago .
And in Ontario , where goods - producing industries have been particularly hard hit by the collapse of export sales to the shrivelled United States market , the jobless rate was even higher , at 8.7 per cent -- the worst since in more than a decade .
Unemployment in Toronto was running at about 8.3 per cent -- up from 7.8 per cent the previous month , StatsCan estimates .
The continuing employment crunch added to suspicions that the Canadian economy is headed for a worse - than - forecast downturn this year and raised new questions about whether Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's economic stimulus measures are adequate to offset the bleak business conditions .
" Horrendous , " commented Liberal finance critic John McCallum .
" The numbers keep getting worse . "
It 's too soon to say for sure if the Conservatives ' Jan. 27 budget will have to be updated with a larger economic stimulus package , but it certainly may be necessary , McCallum said .
" It looks like we are on a path where more will have to be done , " he commented .
Speaking today in London , Ont. , Harper said that despite rising job losses , the country will face a labour shortage when the recession ends .
Harper said these are tough times , but Canada must prepare for the economic recovery and the need for labour it will bring .
The federal budget , which contains $ 35 billion in new spending and tax measures meant to boost economic activity over two years , has now been passed by the House of Commons and the Senate .
McCallum said the latest employment survey adds weight to the more gloomy predictions for the economy this year .
TD Bank economists released an analysis saying : " February 's numbers confirm our pessimistic outlook for Canadian employment .
We believe that we 're only at the half - way mark for the total job losses over this recession , and forecast the national unemployment rate will rise to 10 % by year - end . "
The picture is decidedly bleak in Ontario .
Even though the province has only 39 per cent of the country 's working - age population , its job losses since October total 160,000 , more than half of all employment losses nationally ( 295,000 ) in that period .
" Regrettably no , I 'm not surprised , " Finance Minister Jim Flaherty told a Toronto radio station from England , where he is attending a meeting of global finance ministers .
" The overall numbers are not going to be good for some time , even though they 'll be better than they would have been because of the economic stimulus " in the budget , he said .
" But the reality is , we 're going to have a difficult year . "
NDP MP Libby Davies said the Conservative response to rising unemployment has been inadequate .
" The unemployment rate is closing in on 8 per cent , and what 's the finance minister saying ?
He 's saying he 's not surprised , " Davies said in the Commons .
" He even expects the losses to continue the whole year , admitting that Conservative policies are not working .
When will this government change course and actually create the jobs that Canadians need ? "
With the housing boom over , the bulk of the employment decline in February was in construction , which shed 43,000 jobs .
There were also losses in professional , scientific and technical services , as well as in natural resources and educational services .
The agency saidone hard - hit segment of the labour force has been young male workers .
Employment among men aged between 15 and 24 has decreased by 104,000 in the past four months .
And the only industries with job pick - ups in February were manufacturing and agriculture , both industries where employment remains down from a year ago .

VIENNA — Think of it as a galactic garbage dump .
With a recent satellite collision still fresh on minds , participants at a meeting in the Austrian capital this week are discussing ways to deal with space debris -- junk that is clogging up the orbit around the Earth .
Some suggest a cosmic cleanup is the way to go .
Others say time , energy and funds are better spent on minimizing the likelihood of future crashes by improving information sharing .
The informal discussions on the sidelines of a meeting of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , which began Feb. 9 and ends Friday , arose from concern about the collision of a derelict Russian spacecraft and a working U.S. Iridium commercial satellite .
The Feb. 10 incident , which is still under investigation , generated space junk that could circle the Earth and threaten other satellites for the next 10,000 years ; it added to the already worrying amount of debris surrounding the planet .
Nicholas L. Johnson , NASA 's chief scientist for orbital debris , said about 19,000 objects are present in the low and high orbit around the Earth -- including about 900 satellites , but much of it is just plain junk .
He estimated that included in the 19,000 count are about a thousand objects larger than 10 centimeters ( 4 inches ) that were created by last week 's satellite collision , in addition to many smaller ones .
He predicted that if more junk accumulates , the likelihood of similar collisions -- currently very rare -- will increase by 2050 .
To Johnson , the " true solution " in the long run is to go get the junk -- or push it away to a higher altitude before it has time to crash into anything .
" Today 's environment is all right but the environment is going to get worse , therefore I need to start thinking about the future and how can I clean up sometime in the future , " he said .
Johnson is the co-lead of an International Academy of Astronautics study that is exploring ways of extracting space debris from Earth orbit .
Some of the suggestions sound pretty spaced out .
One proposes attaching balloons to pieces of debris to increase their atmospheric drag and bring them back to Earth faster .
Another , said Johnson , foresees attaching a 10 - mile ( 16 - kilometer ) electrodynamic tether to debris that would generate a current , which then could be controlled from the ground enabling technicians to bring it down .
Many scientists are skeptical about the possibility of a cleanup .
Richard Crowther , the chief British delegate to the meeting , suggested extracting debris from space was costly and risked causing more collisions or explosions that , in turn , would generate more debris .
Crowther , an expert on space debris and so - called Near Earth Objects , suggested it was important to improve information - sharing about the location of objects in orbit to minimize future crashes since each collision creates more debris , further congesting Earth orbit .
" The information to a large extent is out there , but the owners of the data tend to keep the information to themselves , " Crowther said , acknowledging that the U.S. has been " very good " about making its data publicly available .
To Brian Weeden , technical consultant at the nonprofit Secure World Foundation , the ideal scenario would involve the creation of a global network that would funnel data on the whereabouts of space debris into a clearing house for all .
" The vision we have is a network where a number of different countries -- each of which has a sensor or radar -- contributes data from that sensor or radar to a central location , " Weeden said .
The European Space Agency has begun a program that goes part way toward meeting that goal by monitoring space debris and setting up uniform standards to prevent future collisions far above the planet .
Launched in January , the 50 million euro ( $ 64 million ) program -- dubbed Space Situational Awareness -- aims to increase information for scientists on the ground about the estimated 13,000 satellites and other man-made bodies orbiting the planet .
But a worldwide system is unlikely to be created any time soon .
While the U.S. , France and others have expressed informal interest , no state has pledged official support , Weeden said .

Free Staters and Free Keene Bloggers went to Milford this morning for the arraignment of recently arrested Mike Barskey .
Mike was mentioned in a posting earlier this week , but his arrest is unrelated to the Keene Freedom Festival , but is for non-appearance on another non-violent driving offense .
While at the arraignment , it is reported that Jesse Maloney , best known for his Keene flag burning , and Charlie , a new Keene mover , were arrested for disorderly conduct .
Jesse was inside the courtroom when he was asked to remove a cap on his head .
He refused to do so , and was arrested .
Meanwhile , Charlie , not in the courtroom yet , was asking court officials about the hat rule .
The following is from FreeKeene ’s Dale :
Apparently he was asking them about the hat rule , was not even walking into the courtroom , was simply asking about it , then someone said “ that ’s assault ! ” out of the blue , which he was never charged with btw , so it was obvious flakey .
He was ordered to take his hat off , and did n’t immediately comply but instead merely asked what the law was about hats and whether it was an order or a request , and again I remind that he has as of yet made no motion at all to enter the courtroom where the “ hat rule ” applies .
Suddenly Charlie is being thrown up against a wall and cuffed for disorderly conduct .
Jesse and Charlie have been released with a court date set for February 25th .
The discussion continues : NHFree.com Forum
GRAND RAPIDS -- Police found only " tablespoons " of marijuana in Grand Valley State University student Derek Copp 's off - campus apartment the night he was shot by police during a drug raid , his lawyer said this afternoon .
" To my knowledge , the raid resulted in the seizure of a few tablespoonfuls of marijuana , and nothing more , " attorney Fred Dilley said in a statement .
He said his concern is the manner of the search carried about by the West Michigan Enforcement Team , or WEMET , on Wednesday night .
Copp was shot in the chest , and is recovering after suffered injuries to his ribs , lung and liver .
Dilley is also concerned about " the apparent lack of justification whatsoever for the use of force much less deadly force in executing a search warrant .
The campus and Allendale communities are asking why ?
Why burst into a college student 's apartment with a gun drawn for a few tablespoonfuls of pot . "

ARCHIVES | SEARCH How Big is Downadup ?
Very Big. Posted by Mikko @ 11:21 GMT
Downadup worms attempt to call home .
They do this by trying to connect to various Web addresses .
And if the worm finds an active Web server at one of these domains , it will download and run a particular executable — thus giving the malware gang a free hand to do whatever they want with all of the infected machines .
They could build a large botnet for example .
The framework is in place .
Normally malware uses only one or maybe a handful of websites .
Such sites are generally easy to locate and shut down .
Then there is Downadup .
It uses a complicated algorithm which changes daily and is based on timestamps from public websites such as Google.com and Baidu.com .
With this algorithm , the worm generates many possible domain names every day .
Hundreds of names such as : qimkwaify .ws , mphtfrxs .net , gxjofpj .ws , imctaef .cc , and hcweu .org .
This makes it impossible and / or impractical for us good guys to shut them all down — most of them are never registered in the first place .
However , the bad guys only need to predetermine one possible domain for tomorrow , register it , and set up a website — and they then gain access to all of the infected machines .
Pretty clever .
But we can play this game as well .
So we 've determined the possible domains and have registered some of them for ourselves .
Which means the infected machines will also connect to us .
We could attempt to manipulate the infected machines .
But of course we wo n't .
In fact , we wo n't be doing anything at all to them – not even disinfect them – as that could be seen as " unauthorized use " .
That is illegal , at least in many jurisdictions .
( Doing something without being asked is also a very large ethical question … )
Look but do n't touch is the golden rule .
But this looking and listening does gain us a unique visibility inside and we can see just how large the number of infected machines is .
Right now , we 're seeing hundreds of thousands of unique IP addresses connecting to the domains we 've registered .
A very large part of that traffic is coming from corporate networks , through firewalls , proxies , and NAT routers .
Meaning that one unique IP address that we see could very well be 2,000 infected workstations in real life .
Toni Koivunen from our Response Team has used some additional tricks to come up with an estimate on just how many infected machines there really are .
Toni 's final count is : 2,395,963 infections worldwide .
This figure is conservative ; the real number is certainly higher .
It would make for one big badass botnet .
And where in the world are these infections ?
We 're glad you asked .
We resolved the IPs to countries and here are the results .
Number of IPs Registered country of the IP 38,277 China 34,814 Brazil 24,526 Russia 16,497 India 14,767 Ukraine 13,115 Italy 11,675 Argentina 11,117 Korea 8,861 Romania 6,166 Indonesia 5,882 Chile 5,531 Taiwan 5,162 Malaysia 4,392 Germany 4,261 Philippines 3,958 United States 3,719 Colombia 3,307 Spain 3191 Thailand 2,871 Kazakhstan 2,828 Venezuela 2,685 Mexico 2,518 Europe ( resolved to EU ) 2,337 France 1,901 Bulgaria 1,789 United Kingdom 1,655 Pakistan 1,636 Turkey 1,544 Saudi Arabia 1,399 Hungary 1,389 Iran 1,272 Poland 1,259 Macedonia 1,193 Japan 1,052 Portugal 1,029 Vietnam
These are the raw unique IPs ; you could think of this as China having 38,277 infected companies , not persons .

Kritarchy
by Frank van Dun ( http://users.ugent.be/~frvandun/)
The purpose of this note is to provide a short introduction to the political system of kritarchy and to explain some of the theoretical concepts on which it relies , in particular ‘ natural law ’ and ‘ justice ’ .
Kritarchy is the political system based on equal justice for all , which is to say on respect for natural law .
It differs from other political systems by its consistent adherence to and application of the rules of justice .
Even courts of law , police forces and other organisations that look after the day - to - day business of maintaining law , are denied any power , privilege or immunity that is not in conformity with natural law .
A kritarchy ’s police forces cannot lawfully use their weapons and coercive powers save for maintaining law , that is for defending the natural rights of people and remedying their violation .
In contrast with their counterparts in the statist political systems that prevail in today ’s world , in a kritarchy courts of law and police forces do not constitute and are not incorporated into a coercive monopoly .
Every person is entitled to offer judicial or police - services to willing others ; no person can be forced to become a client of any court of law or police force against his will .
In short , in a kritarchy judicial and police - services are offered on a free market , which is the natural law of the human world in so far as exchanges of goods and services are concerned .
Because of its commitment to equal justice for all , a kritarchy does not know the usual political distinction between subjects and rulers .
It lacks a government in the modern sense of the word , i.e. an organisation with coercive powers that claims a right to the obedience or to the use of the labour or the property of those who inhabit or reside in the area over which its coercive powers are effective .
Governing and taxing people by public or private force are no functions of the political system of kritarchy .
People are to be left free to govern their own affairs , either individually or in voluntary association with others — and this means that in governing his own affairs each is required to leave others free to govern their own affairs .
In this sense , freedom is the basic law of a kritarchy .
It follows that a kritarchy can only exist in societies where , and as long as , the commitment to justice is sufficiently strong to defeat the endeavours of those who use unlawful methods such as aggression , coercion or fraud to further their ends or evade responsibility and liability for the unlawful wrongs they have caused to others .
While it is theoretically conceivable that freedom can be maintained by no more than unorganised spontaneous actions of self - defence , in a kritarchy the commitment to justice takes shape in its political system , which consists of a free market for the organisations of justice ( i.e. courts of law and police forces ) and the means for preserving its integrity .
The term ‘ kritarchy ’ , compounded from the Greek words ‘ kritès ’ ( judge ) or ‘ krito ’ ( to judge ) and ‘ archè ’ ( principle , cause ) , appears to be coined in 1844 by the English author Robert Southy .
In its construction it resembles more familiar political terms such as monarchy , oligarchy and hierarchy .
‘ Kritarchy ’ is mentioned in among others Webster ’s Unabridged Dictionary , The Oxford English Dictionary and the American Collegiate Dictionary .
According to its etymological roots , a kritarchy is a political system in which justice ( more exactly the judgment that seeks to determine justice ) is the ruling principle or first cause .
Similarly a monarchy is a system in which one person is supposed to be the ruling principle or first cause of every legal action , every other person being no more than an obedient subject of the monarch .
In an oligarchy a few persons ( the oligarchs ) , acting in concert but without a fixed hierarchy among them , are thought to be the source of all legal actions .
In the modern system of parliamentary sovereignty , for example , the members of parliament constitute an oligarchy .
All members have equal standing within the parliament .
However , the results of their deliberations and decisions are supposed to bind all people who , because of their citizenship or residence , are assumed to be subject to the authority of the state .
If ‘ monarchy ’ denotes rule by one person and ‘ oligarchy ’ rule by a few , it is tempting to understand ‘ kritarchy ’ as referring to rule by judges .
However , the use of the word ‘ rule ’ should not mislead us into thinking that the rule of judges is like the rule of monarchs and oligarchs , much less that it is a particular sort of oligarchy .
Monarchs and oligarchs aspire to political rule , i.e. the ability and power to enforce obedience to their commands , rules , decisions and choices on their subjects .
In short , monarchs and oligarchs rule by a mixture of direct command and legislation .
Judges , on the other hand , are supposed not to legislate but to find ways and means to settle conflicts and disputes in a lawful manner .
They do not seek to enforce obedience to their commands as such , but respect for law , which is an order of things that is understood to be objectively given and not something that answers to whatever desires or ideals the judges may have .
In contrast with other political systems , where they have been incorporated as magistrates into a system of political rule and empowered to use coercive means to drag citizens and residents before their benches , judges in a kritarchy have no subjects .
Monarchs and oligarchs impose , or allow their servants ( judges , prosecutors ) to impose , their rulings on those of their subjects on which they want to impose them .
In other words , they ‘ pick ’ their subjects ( which is the root meaning of the Latin ‘ legere ’ , from which the word ‘ lex ’ for legislated or statute law is derived ) .
In a kritarchy on the other hand , judges do not choose which persons will appear before them .
Instead , people desiring to have their conflicts and disputes resolved by judicial judgment will ‘ pick ’ their judge .
The distinctive characteristic of a kritarchy is therefore that it is a political system without the institution of political rule .
If one thinks of it as ‘ the rule of judges ’ , one should remember that these judges enjoy no particular privileges or special powers .
It is ‘ the rule of law ’ , not the rule of legislators , judges or any other category of privileged officials .
There are many historical and even recent examples of kritarchy or near - kritarchy , and also of attempts to use constitutions and other fundamental charters ( such as the Magna Carta , the Bills of Rights of the Glorious Revolution in the United Kingdom and the original amendments to the Constitution of the United States of America , the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen ) to introduce elements of kritarchy as checks on the powers of states and governments .
Unwritten customary laws memorised by tribesmen , such as to this day the Hherr of the Somalis , the Madh’a of the Afar and the Gada of the Oromo , often provide strong support for the decentralisation of power that is characteristic of kritarchy , even if they derive their authority merely from custom and not from a conscious and explicit commitment to natural law .
At the end of the second millennium before Christ , the Jews lived in a system described in the biblical book of the Judges .
Their ‘ judges ’ were not judges in the technical sense of the modern legal systems .
They were influential respected men who provided leadership and counsel without having power to coerce or tax .
The history of Celtic and Germanic peoples both before and during their confrontation with Roman imperialism , is also replete with examples , as is the medieval period after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West .
Kritarchies were firmly established in medieval Ireland until it fell victim to British expansionism , in Ireland [ I believe the author means Iceland here ] where it lasted until the middle of the thirteenth century , and in Frisia where it survived into the sixteenth century .
In the first half of the nineteenth century the European immigrants who settled in the Mid-West and the Far West in North America developed their own brand of kritarchy .
In Africa and Asia tribal societies have continued to the present day to adhere to some form of kritarchy , if they have not been submerged in the statist structures imposed by the colonial powers and the indigenous political rulers who took over in the post - colonial period .
While these historical realisations or near - realisations of kritarchy may suggest that it is a primitive political system , it should be borne in mind that most of them fell victim to conquest or to the firm hold on power established by military lords in times of war , who turned ostensibly temporary structures for the mobilisation of men and resources into a permanent apparatus of political rule .
It is certainly true that kritarchies are ill equipped to make or endure war for long periods of time .
If that is a serious weakness , it is also a great virtue .
In any case the vulnerability of kritarchies in the face of massive militarily operations is comparable to that of a small or technologically backward state confronting the might of a large or technologically advanced neighbour .
Moreover it is problem that we may acknowledge without losing sight of what a kritarchy has to offer for more ‘ normal times ’ .
We began this note with the statement that kritarchy is the political system based on equal justice for all , that is to say on respect for natural law .
What does this mean ?
The terms ‘ justice ’ and ‘ natural law ’ may seem to many to be extremely vague if not meaningless .
Some even consider ‘ natural law ’ to be a discredited notion , an intellectual throwback to a prescientific age .
It is alleged that there is no such thing as natural law or that what is called ‘ natural law ’ is nothing more than an ill - defined set of background principles that may help legislators and judges to keep their decisions from evoking moral outrage among the public at large .
However , in discussing kritarchy we have to pierce through the veil of confusion that is woven from these current phantom - notions of natural law .
We should therefore take some pains to explain the precise meaning and operational value of the terms ‘ justice ’ and ‘ natural law ’ .
The search for the true origin , nature and function of natural law is an old one .
The first known scholars of human society in the West were the ancient Greeks , who made a sharp distinction between natural and conventional or artificial law .
The so - called sophists of the fifth century BC came up with the notion of the human world as arising out of , distinguishing itself from and protecting itself by the progressive perfection of social and technical skills in a ruthless and dangerous natural environment .
They also made the distinction between the human world and the particular societies that arise from that world and fall back into it like waves on the surface of the sea .
For them the human world was the world of human history as it appears to one who wants to know how people cope with the problems of survival and more particularly what people do to one another .
Noting the permanence of the human world and contrasting it with the transient and merely local significance of particular societies , they began the search for natural law or the fundamental order of the human world , while debunking the claims of universal , divine or moral truth made by various political thinkers on behalf of some particular real or imagined society and its ‘ way of life ’ .
Their opponents countered by developing metaphysical theories .
With these they purported to show that ‘ true nature ’ cannot be apprehended by the senses or by experience , but only by complex systems of abstract thought that are beyond the comprehension of the common run of mankind .
The main political thrust of their argument was that this ‘ true nature ’ does indeed vindicate some particular way of life and / or shape of political organisation .
In short , denying that nobody should be presumed to ignore the law of human relations , they advanced the claim that without the guidance of experts like themselves , people would never attain anything but a lawless , at best inferior if not chaotic condition of existence .
These metaphysical theories , in combination with older views on the rule of the gods , left many people under the impression that natural law has little to do with nature as it can be observed , but is instead the understanding of what the way of life and the legal rules of an ‘ ideal society ’ or a society under the direct rule of the gods would have to be .
As a result the distinction between the natural universal and permanent order of the human world and the artificial transient and local orders of particular societies became blurred as more and more political , ethical and religious claimed the sanction of natural law .
The same happened to the distinction between the rights and duties that have their ground in the natural conditions of human interaction and those that happen to be granted or imposed by rulers seeking to mobilise their subjects according to their own religious or ideological inclinations .
Nevertheless , even within the general framework of metaphysical and theological speculation the attempts to discover and elucidate those distinctions were not abandoned .
In his De Vita Spirituali Animae of 1402 , Jean de Gerson , a theologian and rector at the Sorbonne University in Paris , laid the foundations for the development of a category of human rights that even God would have to respect .
In the turbulent period of the religious wars in Europe that was soon to follow , the concept of natural rights became a prominent weapon in the intellectual arsenal of persecuted minorities and later of a more general resistance to the claims of absolutist rulers and the ambitions of power - grabbing politicians .
It is little wonder that natural law and natural rights became significant influences on the process of constitution making in the western states of the eighteenth and nineteenth century .
As a result freedom and property were , at least for a time , given a degree of legal protection that is rare in the history of political rule .
At the same time the advances of economic and sociological science tended to promote the general acceptance of the philosophy of natural law .
Is was understood that within the constraints of natural law — that is to say in societies in which freedom and property are relatively safe from private and public aggression — the desire for wealth and personal betterment leads men onto the road of material progress .
Unfortunately , towards the end of the nineteenth century this understanding gradually gave way to the notion that material progress ( ‘ progressive evolution ’ ) is the ‘ natural law ’ of the human world .
Consequently , wealth and welfare were taken to be the true ‘ natural rights ’ of men , and ‘ justice ’ was re-interpreted to mean the efficient production and ‘ fair ’ distribution of wealth .
Economic and social policies , and the theories that inspired them , began to wear down the constraints of natural law that had not long before been accepted in constitutions and legislative enactments .
Despite this setback more or less original work in the field of natural law continues to be done , some of it — such as the works of Ayn Rand and Murray Rothbard — reaching large audiences worldwide .
Other significant work received much less attention , for example Frank van Dun ’s book on the fundamental principle of law ( 1982 in Dutch ) , which makes a clear distinction between the question ‘ What is natural law ? ’ and the question ‘ Why should people respect natural law ? ’ and provides rigorously argued answers to both .
Nevertheless , for the great majority of intellectuals ‘ natural law ’ is still little more than prescientific metaphysical speculation , while some of those who would otherwise have been sympathetic to it , have now subscribed to the belief that economic analysis and efficient policy have superseded the science of law and the quest for justice as the main safeguards of order in the human world .
In order to clarify the notion of natural law , we have first of all to dispel the common idea that in ‘ natural law ’ the word ‘ law ’ stands for a command , rule , norm or other directive statement , or that it states an exception to such a directive .
According to that interpretation a law commands , forbids or permits — as if the meaning of a ‘ law ’ is that something ought or should be done or omitted , or that doing or omitting it is left to the discretion of those to whom the law is addressed .
In short , ‘ law ’ is used here as the translation of the Latin word ‘ lex ’ , the original meaning of which was connected to the mobilisation of armies and the organisation of military campaigns , and which later came to denote any general rule or command issued by the highest political authorities .
What is wrong with this interpretation ?
First of all , it is no more than a historical accident that the word ‘ law ’ came to be used as the translation of ‘ lex ’ .
It was also and more properly used to translate the Latin ‘ ius ’ , which has nothing to do with the exercise of political authority .
‘ Ius ’ denotes a bond or obligation arising out of a personal commitment made in solemn speech ( ‘ iurare ’ , to swear ) and in a more general sense the order of human affairs that arises out of such mutual commitments .
In other words , ‘ ius ’ presupposes a condition in which people meet as free and equal persons and arrange their affairs by mutual agreements , contracts or covenants .
This is in clear contrast to ‘ lex ’ , which presupposes that one man can unilaterally oblige another .
From this etymological perspective it is no wonder that those who have tried to interpret natural law as ‘ lex naturalis’ , have been led to formulate complicated metaphysical and theological theories to explain how nature can be a legislator or how one can separate from the various ‘ directive forces of nature ’ ( urges , inclinations , desires and the like ) those that deserve to be included in the list of ‘ natural laws ’ and those that do not ( and therefore have to be considered ‘ unnatural ’ or ‘ against nature ’ ) .
None of these theories have been able to convince even sympathetic sceptics .
Without the hypothesis of a divine legislator , who for some unfathomable reason prefers to encrypt his commands in nature , theories of ‘ leges naturales ’ get nowhere — and with that hypothesis , non-believers can only conclude that they are conjured up out of thin air .
There may in the end be only one very thin excuse for using the term ‘ natural law ’ in the sense of ‘ lex naturalis ’ : just like the leges of a political authority , which bind or oblige people without their consent , the natural laws are supposed to oblige everyone regardless of anyone ’s consent .
However , that analogy gives us no clue as to how we can determine the directive content of any natural law .
It merely identifies it as an unspecified something that is like a ‘ lex ’ in that it has the power to oblige without consent , but also unlike a ‘ lex ’ it that it is not backed up by the power to enforce .
Unlike the French ‘ loi ’ or the Italian ‘ legge ’ the English word ‘ law ’ does not derive from ‘ lex ’ .
Its etymological root is the Germanic ‘ laeg ’ , which denotes order , while its opposite ‘ orlaeg ’ denotes the dissolution of order , confusion and in particular a condition of war .
‘ Law ’ in this sense refers to peace , freedom and friendly relations — the absence of warlike actions that turn people into enemies and threaten their freedom by exposing them to the risk of injury , death , slavery or loss of property .
The Latin word for warlike action is ‘ iniuria ’ , that is to say an action that is not in conformity with ius .
Thus , ‘ ius ’ and ‘ law ’ seem to be conceptually ( though not etymologically ) related .
Both refer to a condition of order in human affairs that is characterised by the absence of warlike interaction .
It should immediately be clear that ‘ law ’ in this sense does not suggest a directive content .
Law is not a command , rule or norm , nor is it a collection or system of such directive elements .
It is an objective condition that many people may and in fact do value .
As such it may inspire them to formulate rules of conduct that help to bring it about or to restore it when it is impaired .
We may call such rules ‘ rules of law ’ , but we should then always remember that they are only related to law as means to an end — and that they deserve to be called rules of law only because they have the establishment or restoration of law ( or ius ) as their end .
For that reason they may also be called rules of justice , because the literal meaning of ‘ justice ’ ( Latin : iustitia ) is ‘ what is conducive to ius ’ .
In other words , justice is what aims at the establishment of the condition in which people interact on the basis of mutual consent .
Justice is respect for law in the sense of ‘ ius ’ .
Justice does not imply respect for the laws ( leges ) that might be enforced by the authorities , except in those cases when they are genuine rules of law .
If ‘ law ’ means order and not command , rule or norm , ‘ natural law ’ is no longer a mystifying concept .
It stands for the natural order of the human world .
It is in this sense that the term ‘ natural law ’ enters into the definition of kritarchy .
The question before us is :
What is the natural law or order of the human world ?
Order in the human world certainly implies that there is no confusion among persons .
This is the case when words , works and actions can be traced to their true authors and when their consequences — to the extent that these objectively or materially affect others — are either borne by the authors themselves or else by willing or consenting others .
When human affairs are in order , no person need fear that others realise their projects , or take credit for his words , actions or works at his expense but without his agreement .
No one can successfully hide his own responsibility for what he said , did or brought about .
There is then no confusion as to who is innocent or guilty of a crime , who owes a debt to whom , who was and who was not a participant in some particular undertaking or practice , who participated voluntarily and who was forced or tricked to participate , which exchanges were concluded by mutual consent and which were not , and so on .
Order or law in the human world is that condition in which each person is free from the threat of injurious actions from others , able to live his life and to enjoy his property in an environment of peaceful , friendly relations .
‘ To each his own ’ is therefore the defining characteristic of law .
To maintain that order requires respect for it , i.e. justice , as the guiding principle of human action .
That respect includes the constant will to leave or if necessary to return to each his own — that is to say the will to avoid causing physical damage to the person , work or property of any other , to honour lawful contracts and to provide full restitution or compensation to those to whom one has nevertheless caused unlawful harm , as well as the will not to hinder those who seek lawful remedies for unlawful wrongs done to themselves or others .
The foregoing certainly defines a coherent notion of order or law in the human world — but is it the natural order , the natural law of the human world ?
In order to answer that question we have to take a closer look at the human world .
It is first of all a world constituted by the existence of many different and separate yet similar natural persons who are alike in their freedom , i.e. their capacity for independent action , speech and thought and for communicating their thoughts , intentions and expectations to one another in a rational way .
In almost all cases humans are by nature physically separate and in many respects different beings , and in those extremely rare cases when they are not physically separate — as with Siamese twins — they are nevertheless distinguishable persons who can separately take credit or be held to account for what they say or do because they too are individually free agents .
Now the concept of law , as it was described above , qualifies as a concept of natural law if and to the extent that the distinctions that constitute it are objective facts of nature .
That is without doubt the case .
Human beings are naturally distinct , indeed separate beings .
Therefore , it is certainly possible in principle to identify the true author(s ) of any particular words , works or actions , however difficult the attempt may prove to be in actual situations .
There is in principle an objectively true answer to questions about the authorship of anything done or said by human beings , and therefore also about the extent of any person ’s lawful property — that is to say , as we shall see shortly , the extent of his right .
Questions as to what is mine and what is thine , can be answered with reference to objective facts .
But then there is also in principle an objectively true answer to the question whether one person ’s sayings or doings do or do not cause unlawful harm to another by invading or infringing upon the latter ’s right .
In order to avoid misunderstanding , we should note that not all objective or even natural distinctions enter into the definition of natural law .
Age , gender , length and weight of body , colour of skin or hair , proficiency in mathematics or any number of other properties or characteristics that are or conceivably might be ‘ given by nature ’ , are not taken into account .
They are properties or characteristics of individual persons , but their presence or absence to a greater or smaller degree in any individual does not determine the answer to the question whether that individual is a person or not .
In their multifarious combinations they account for a great many differences among persons , but that is all they do .
No matter how different persons are in any dimension of shape or talent , they are all persons because of their innate or genetically given freedom of action , speech , thought and rational communication .
In that crucial respect they are all alike .
Freedom is indeed the reality of a person , his very being .
It is physically impossible to take away a person ’s real freedom without at the same time destroying him as a person ( by killing him or driving him insane ) .
Now it is certainly true that the destruction of a person ’s real freedom can come about as the result of many causes , but not all of these are relevant from the perspective of natural law .
It is only when such causes originate within the human world , i.e. from the actions of another person , that the question of the lawful or unlawful character of the destruction of a person ’s real freedom arises .
This is so because natural law is the order of the human world as such , constituted by the existence of many different and separate human beings .
If there is no way to separate a person from his real freedom without destroying both at the same time , it is possible — and unfortunately easy enough — to destroy a person ’s opportunities for exercising his personal capacities without destroying him .
We need to distinguish between a person ’s real freedom and his organic freedom , the latter being his activity or work as a person .
It is again undeniable that any number of circumstances and accidents can cause a temporary or definitive destruction or limitation of a person ’s organic freedom , but again and for the same reason that we noted before , it is only when such causes originate within the human world that the question of their lawful or unlawful character arises .
Once the notion of natural law is properly understood as the order of the natural world of free persons , it is easy to grasp the concept of natural right .
The word ‘ right ’ can be used in two different but related senses : the one captures the static aspect of a right , the other its dynamic aspect .
In the static sense a person ’s natural right is the place or space he occupies lawfully in the natural order of the human world — it is his property .
That space is first of all determined by his physical being as a person , and is therefore immediately filled by his real freedom .
Because a natural person ’s presence is marked not just by his simply ‘ being there ’ but also by his activity and work — which in almost all circumstances is the condition of his existence and survival — his work is also constitutive of his place in the human world and therefore of his natural right .
Here we meet the dynamic aspect of a right .
An obvious qualification must be noted here , because as we have seen already a person ’s work or actions can interfere with and even destroy another ’s organic freedom and thereby step outside the order or law of the human world .
It is therefore only by his lawful activity , that is in so far as he respects the rights of others , that a person can add to his natural right .
In the dynamic sense a right denotes any personal action or pattern of behaviour that is in accordance with natural law .
Just as ‘ natural right ’ in the static sense denotes space lawfully occupied by a person ’s being and work in the natural order of the human world , just so ‘ natural right ’ in the dynamic sense denotes lawful activity , i.e. activity that is respectful of that order .
Natural law and natural rights are two sides of the same coin .
Thus , a person ’s natural right denotes the space of real and organic freedom that coincides with his being and his work .
It is therefore as objectively ascertainable as they are .
The distinctions that constitute the natural law being facts of nature , natural law is an objective category — and so are natural rights .
Answering questions such as ‘ What is natural law ? ’ and ‘ What facts are to be taken into account in discovering the extent of a person ’s rights ? ’ does not by itself provide an answer to the question why we should respect natural law or the natural rights of others .
Why should we respect others as the free persons they undoubtedly are ( except perhaps to metaphysicians who invoke their own elaborate abstractions to deny the separateness of persons or even their existence as agents ) ?
In what way can natural law be ‘ obligatory ’ if it is not some rule backed by force or powerful opinion but an objectively identifiable condition of the human world ?
In what way can the fact that one has no right to do something be a compelling reason for not doing it even if one has the power to do it , wants to do it and stands to profit from doing it ?
And why should the fact that one has a right to do something constitute a compelling reason for others not to interfere unlawfully with his doing it , even if they can and want to interfere and expect to be better off as a result of their interference ?
There are usually many prudential arguments in support of a positive answer to such questions — but often also many prudential arguments in support of a negative answer .
Even in well - ordered societies crime does pay occasionally !
Taken together , such arguments can lead to no better conclusion than that a person should respect natural law when in his estimation the arguments for doing so outweigh those for not doing so , but not when the balance tilts the other way .
No absolute obligation can emerge from such deliberations .
That is not surprising because their purpose is not to answer the question whether we should respect natural law , but only the question whether in the particular circumstances of the case we can profit more by doing one thing rather than another .
In their wish to ascribe absolute and unconditional obligatory force to natural law , many have been tempted to place its source outside the human world itself , for example in some metaphysical , divine or supernatural domain .
Unfortunately , for most people , that move merely obscures the issues , if it does not completely mystify them .
Fortunately , however , such a move is also unnecessary .
The question as to whether we should respect the natural order of the human world is not the same as whether it is at all times in every person ’s interests to do so , no matter what his interests might be .
It is a question that arises only in the context of human interaction , where one person faces another , and not in the context of solitary deliberation .
In the face - to - face context , the question is whether each of us should respect the rights of the other .
It turns out that he who would attempt to argue that he should not respect the other ’s natural rights , inevitably involves himself in dialectical contradiction by denying the very conditions he is presupposing in presenting his argument as something to be taken seriously by his opponent as well as by himself .
It would be as if he was saying : I am taking you seriously and I expect you to take me seriously , therefore I expect you to take me seriously when I say seriously that I should not take you seriously .
In short , he would be saying : I respect you , therefore I should n’t — which is absurd .
There is in fact no way in which the proposition that we — you and I — should respect each other , can be defeated in any rational argument between us .
But the order or law of the human world is precisely that condition in which people are prepared to enter into rational argument , each taking the other seriously , and to carry out the commitments they undertake in so talking to one another .
This is exactly what the word ‘ ius ’ conveys .
Consequently , if we take ourselves seriously , the conclusion that we are under the obligation to respect one another , is inescapable .
This fundamental obligation entails that each is bound to respect others as long as they respect him , and that each has a right to the respect of others as long as he respects them .
These are not empty formulas .
The persons they refer to are real beings .
By applying the fundamental obligation to the facts of the human world , especially the separateness and distinctiveness of persons , we can derive the natural rights ( and corresponding duties ) of human beings , progressively extending the argument by taking seriously the rights derived in its previous steps .
With respect to the more basic dynamic natural rights , the argument might proceed according to the following pattern .
Because their innate or genetically given capacity for independent action , speech and thought is the determining factor of their particularly human mode of existence , human beings can and indeed must think , speak and act .
The natural right to do these things cannot be rationally denied in a lawful manner .
That is so because any denial that pretends to be rational would involve thinking , speaking and acting and would therefore assert its own unlawfulness .
Only by refusing to think and speak ( even to oneself ) , by behaving without thought can one ‘ deny ’ these natural rights , but then that denial has no rational aspect whatsoever and places the denier outside the order of the human world .
Thinking implies judging and making choices , accepting one idea , opinion , plan or valuation , or rejecting it for another , while remaining conscious of the alternatives that were rejected .
Every action carries with it the long shadow of what was not but could have been done instead .
Thus , human beings can and must choose .
Making choices is an inevitable and therefore necessary condition of man .
Choosing not to choose is still to make a choice , and to wander through life without making choices , with no consciousness of any might - have - been , is not possible for any human being who is not raised to be a mute pet in the care of others .
Being human implies the right to think , speak , judge , make choices and act .
To deny these rights to any human person is to deny his very being .
But such a denial logically entails that the denier renounces his own rights and makes himself an outlaw .
Taking the static and the dynamic aspects together , we see that a person ’s natural right is that part of the world a person can point to while saying truthfully ‘ That is my right ’ , and that it is also some activity about which he can say truthfully ‘ That is what I have a right to do ’ .
John Locke ’s famous formula ‘ Life , liberty and property ’ is a useful summation of natural rights .
Life and property exemplify the static aspect of a person ’s natural right , while liberty ( that is organic freedom constrained by the natural order of the human world ) exemplifies its dynamic aspect .
From the perspective of natural law a person is entitled to say that his life , liberty and property are his right .
It does not make sense for him to say that he has a right to any life , liberty or property but his own .
Natural rights are therefore not to be confused with the so - called ‘ human rights ’ of the United Nations ’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 .
On the basis of that Declaration I can say that I have rights to life , liberty and property , but not to my life , liberty or property .
That is so because in order to guarantee others their ‘ human rights ’ the political authorities must be able to arrange my and everybody else ’s life , liberty and property according to their own estimation of what is feasible and appropriate ‘ in accordance with the organisation and resources of each state ’ .
The operational essence of the doctrine is that my ‘ human right ’ gives the state a legal ground for taxing you and subsidising me , while your ‘ human right ’ gives it a legal ground for doing the opposite .
Both rights together provide it with a legal ground for taxing and subsidising as it sees fit .
From a philosophical perspective the ‘ human rights ’ of the Declaration are all variations on the Hobbesian theme that human beings have an enforceable ‘ right ’ to have their needs and desires satisfied at the expense of the life , liberty and property of others — a ‘ right ’ that can have no place in natural law because its enforcement would entail massive violations of natural rights .
The perversion of the notion of natural law that was introduced in the mid-seventeenth century by the famous apostle of the absolute state , Thomas Hobbes , had as its starting point the idea that men have a natural right to anything they desire , even if getting it involves killing or enslaving others .
In short , every man ’s natural right is to rule the world ( if he can ) — or , equivalently , injustice is man ’s natural right ( if he can get away with it ) .
Noting that only chaos can follow if every person were to act according to that ‘ right ’ not to respect others , Hobbes did not retrace his steps to check the absurd premise of his argument .
Instead he went on to argue that the only way out of the unorganised injustice that is man ’s ‘ natural condition ’ , is to organise ( i.e. monopolise ) injustice in the form of the state .
Thus Hobbes founded the characteristic philosophy of the modern state , that the basic human right is satisfaction of desire and that the main business of the state is to use political power to determine whose desires shall be satisfied to what extent and at whose expense .
Note however that in his system ‘ justice ’ is nothing more than the consequence of the organisation of a legal monopoly of coercion designed to enforce obedience to the legal directives of the powers that be .
Law , right and justice , in the proper understanding of these terms , have no place in that system , yet it is the basis of the ruling political ideology in the West , of its doctrine of ‘ human rights ’ no less than of its reverence for the political system of democracy .
It may well be true that democracy is the worst of all systems of political rule except for all the others , but it is nevertheless a system in which some presume to have the right to govern the rest regardless of their consent .
As such it is still unacceptable from the point of view of natural law as well as incompatible with the political system of kritarchy .
The fundamental defect of democracy is not that people vote to determine which individuals shall be their political representatives .
The central defect and in fact irreparable defect of democracy is that it embodies the ‘ right ’ of the representatives to rule over those who voted for them as well as over those who did not .
It allows the elected rulers to violate the natural rights of people with impunity , at least if they do so in a proper legal way by specifying in advance and in sufficient detail how it should be done , by which magistrates or officers of the state , where people can complain if they feel their rights are improperly violated , and so on .
As in other systems of political rule , there is in a democracy no independent police or judiciary to which people can appeal .
A democracy outlaws all independent sources of protection of natural rights as a matter of constitutional necessity , in order to make sure that no natural rights can be invoked against the legal rights of democratic rule .
Democracy is often presented as ‘ government by consent ’ , but that is never more than the consent of a majority — and in many democracies not even that .
As a political device democracy is no doubt a great invention .
Regular elections provide a rough mechanism for ensuring an alignment of rulers and a sizeable part of the subjects over which they rule .
They thereby help to prevent or minimise the violent confrontations and unrelenting repression and exploitation that are permanent risks in other systems of rule .
Nevertheless , they are a practice that has no basis in natural law .
To understand this , it suffices to ask how a person could lawfully authorise another to do what he himself has no right to do .
The question is pertinent , because , to repeat , democracy is a system of political rule in which there is a distinction between the rulers and the ruled , and between the legal rights of the rulers and those of the ruled .
If you would attempt to do to your neighbours what a democratic government does to its citizens — say tax them , fix their hours of work , force them to accept the money you have printed or to send their children to schools of your choice — , you would very likely ( and in any case should ) end up in jail .
Not even a democracy allows you to do such things .
Nor does it allow you to do them in conspiracy with others .
But it does allow you to have someone else do them on your behalf and in your name !
All you have to do is vote for a ‘ political representative ’ .
The mystery of democracy is that ‘ representatives ’ are invested with powers the people who empowered them are not ( and should not be ) allowed to exercise .
Of course , the mystery is only apparent .
It disappears as soon as we recall the Hobbesian foundation of democracy : there is nothing wrong with injustice as long as it is properly monopolised , and democracy is an appropriate means for doing so .
More fundamentally , in a democracy every voter is assumed to have the right to decide who should control the coercive monopoly and rule everybody else in the state .
That is obvious in the admittedly unlikely case that you are the only voter to turn up at the polls .
Then your vote decides which party should take over parliament and the government — as if you were an absolute ruler picking his counsellors and ministers .
Leaving no room for the idea that human beings are natural persons in a natural world , the current legal and political ideology makes any man or woman an artificial being — a ‘ citizen ’ — whose very essence is defined and created by the legal rules of the state to which he or she belongs .
Within the state human beings as such have no rights , except in so far as some legal authority regulates their existence and freedom .
That is why the Universal Declaration in its articles 6 and 15 names ‘ a legal personality ’ and ‘ a nationality ’ among the things people have a right to .
From the point of view of the Declaration ’s underlying philosophy , a legal personality and a nationality — in a word ‘ citizenship ’ — must be eminently desirable , for they are nothing less than the necessary conditions of legal existence in the state .
Without them a person is a nobody .
Once we abandon the perspective of natural law for that of legal rule , we must admit that what a person has a right to do or to call his own , depends not on what he is or does , but on his status in the legal order in which he happens to find himself .
He becomes an artificial person in an artificial order , like a piece of wood that is assigned different ‘ rights and duties ’ depending on whether it is used in a game of chess , checkers or backgammon .
The glorification of such artificial legal orders is very common in contemporary legal and political thought , where fiction seems to triumph invariably over reality .
Artificial orders are based on artificial or imaginary distinctions and on the neglect of or disregard for natural distinctions .
Thus we may think of orders that arbitrarily or systematically refuse to acknowledge certain persons as persons .
Other examples of artificial law proceed by defining some or all persons as being in all or some respects ‘ part ’ of others , to which they are therefore said to belong .
Some go so far as to define human beings as parts of non-existent imaginary or fictitious persons .
In fact , however , natural persons are not ‘ parts ’ of other natural persons or legal fictions .
They may become members in some association or society , and in that sense become ‘ participants ’ in its activities , but that does not imply that they are thereby mysteriously transformed in mere ‘ parts ’ of a person — and it does not imply that the association is a person in its own right .
No matter what the philosophical pretensions behind the constructions of artificial law may be , they all share a common practical implication .
They deny the freedom and / or the equality of at least some human persons , and thereby provide a spurious justification for the claim that from the perspective of law some human persons either do not exist at all or exist only in so far as they are ‘ represented ’ by others .
Thus , by denying natural law and the natural distinctions that constitute it , they conjure up an idea of law that makes the non-consensual ‘ government ’ of one person by another seem ‘ lawful ’ .
It should be sufficiently clear by now that ‘ natural law ’ is not a question of idle speculation , but of natural fact .
In this sense a kritarchy is a political system based on respects for the facts ( though not necessarily for the artefacts ) of the human world .
Respect for natural law is therefore an objective category of human action .
Human actions that respect law are lawful and therefore just .
Those that do not , are unlawful and unjust .
Justice in the general sense is the art or skill of acting in conformity with law , with due regard for the rights of other persons .
In the particular ‘ technical ’ sense it is the art or skill of discovering rules , methods and procedures that effectively and efficiently provide for the defence and , if need be , fortification and restoration of the law of the human world .
The discovery , refinement and systematisation of such rules , methods and procedures are the proper province of jurisprudence as a rational discipline .
In an evolved kritarchy jurisprudence is the business of specialists , jurists , who supply their skills in an open market to individuals and organisations , but also and perhaps primarily to courts of law , police forces and other organisations that are involved in enforcing respect for natural law and helping people to make their actions conform to the requirements of justice .
As noted before , in a kritarchy neither the courts of law nor the police forces nor any of the other organisations that make justice their business , have any legal monopoly .
Their clientele and membership remain free to shift their demand from an unsatisfactory to a hopefully more satisfactory supplier of justice .
Consequently , courts of law and police forces have a strong economic incentive to avoid using violence or other coercive means , say to compel a person to appear in court , unless they have good reason to believe that he is guilty as charged or is obstructing the course of justice and sufficient insurance to cover their liabilities .
Not being above the law , the courts and police forces of a kritarchy run the risk of being charged with unlawful behaviour in another court , if they deprive others of their freedom or other rights when justice does not require it .
That other court might be a competitor or a cooperation of several of its competitors .
It might also be a parliament , i.e. a representative body that acts as a public guardian of the law .
Such a parliament would sit only as a court of law .
It does not have the power to govern or to make laws that restrict anybody ’s rights .
However , it can be an effective agent of justice if it commands sufficient authority to convince the public that the courts of law or police forces that it convicts , are not worthy of the public ’s trust ( thereby destroying their economic base ) , or to bring about a collective effort of other organisations of justice to enforce its verdicts against recalcitrant convicts .
Because the courts in a kritarchy need the consent of all parties if they wish to avoid the risk of using violence against an innocent person , they need to offer sufficient guarantees of competence and impartiality .
They need to do so both to elicit the cooperation of the accused and defendants , and to assure the plaintiffs and claimants , who initiate the proceedings , that their verdicts are unlikely to be contested in another court .
Short of seeking a monopoly by the violent elimination of its competitors , an organisation of justice has no alternative but to build up a solid reputation for justice .
Working out the details , conventions and protocols for an operationally efficient system of justice is no mean task .
Like every other significant practical undertaking it involves knowledge of the general principles of law as well as experimentation with different types of organisation for the supply of justice .
It is the task of applying entrepreneurial creativity to recombine available social , technical , administrative and financial resources and skills so as to improve the outlook for effective justice .
It is not likely that this task can be carried out with any consistency within the stifling confines a legal monopoly .
On this conviction , the case for kritarchy rests .
The European Union has been urged to call for an independent inquiry into possible war crimes committed during Israel 's 22 - day military offensive in Gaza .
Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) wrote to EU foreign ministers to seek their backing for an inquiry into its " allegations of serious violations of international law [ by Israel and Hamas ] ... which may constitute war crimes " .
The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights estimates that 1,434 Palestinians , including 960 civilians , were killed in the offensive .
Alleged violations by Israel include using 155 mm artillery and white phosphorus in built - up areas .

HRW says it has documented six cases in which troops fired on groups of Palestinians holding white flags .
And it claims Israel used an " unjustifiably expansive definition " of military targets to attack civilian facilities connected to Hamas .
The letter accused Hamas and other Palestinian groups of committing war crimes by launching hundreds of rockets into Israel , killing three Israelis since 27 December .
It says Hamas 's use of civilian homes and areas to monitor or attack Israeli forces violates requirements to protect civilians .
Mark Regev , spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , said the military had attempted to protect civilians by acting " as surgically as possible " .

Being a comprehensive and complete enumeration of the Operatic Elements of the Perl 6 Language , assembled and drawn with dedication and diligence by M. Lentczner as a service to both the Community and the Republic .
May this simple presentation with various illustrative devices increase Knowledge & Understanding amongst practitioners in the art of Software .
Third Edition , February 14th , Two Thousand Nine
Several years ago , I saw Larry Wall give a short talk about the design of Perl 6 .
At some point he put up a slide with a list of all the operators - well over a hundred of them !
Sitting in the audience , I had a sudden inspiration , but it took a few months to get around to drawing it .
In 2004 I put the first version of this chart up on my web site and fired an e-mail off to the perl6 mailing list .
It got slash - dotted .
While I was on vacation .
At least the server did n't crash .
Several years have passed , and the Perl 6 design has evolved quite a bit .
This past Fall several people contacted me about updating the chart .
I took up the challenge .
I used both Synopsis 3 : Perl 6 Operators , and the de facto parser for Perl 6 , STD.pm , as sources for the operator information .
Thanks to : Carl Mäsak for encouraging me to update the chart ; Patrick Michaud for reviewing it ; Larry Wall for being willing to discuss the minutiae of meta - operator parsing with me ; and all the members of # perl6 for helping me explore the language .

There ’s no time to wash away the smell of sour milk from the baby ’s skin , so the mother wipes the dozing infant ’s face with the filthy bib hanging from his neck .
“ WIC cares about me , ” it reads , a reference to the free food program for poor women and children .
Social worker Ladore Winzer has just told the mother she will detain the 11 - month - old boy and process him this night into foster care .
It ’s after dusk and the slim , efficient social worker , late returning home to her own family , is stuck for now in the middle of this ghetto vista .
Cars swerve around a lampshade ; a graffiti tribute to a dead man runs across a cinder - block wall ; a hunched homeless man pushes his cart across the grass - tufted sidewalk .
“ If I ’m good , can I get my baby back in three months ? ” the mother asks , conjuring a weak smile in an attempt to seal the proposal .
Chances are Winzer will not be making the decision .
A computer will .
The process starts with a tip to Los Angeles County ’s child abuse hotline .
Over the course of a typical week , the Department of Children and Family Services receives 3,000 calls .
Those that meet the legal threshold -- as determined by the computer and verified by a worker -- are routed to investigators like Winzer .
The process is usually inaccessible to outsiders because of child confidentiality rules , but over four days The Times had the rare opportunity to witness it .
Upstairs from the Hawthorne branch ’s stark waiting room , where a guard stands watch , the phone rings at Winzer ’s desk .
A caller to the hotline has reported seeing three young children wearing torn clothing on the broken sidewalk outside a Popeye ’s chicken .
Nearby , a colleague fields a report of a 7 - month - old baby hospitalized after being sodomized .
Another worker responds to an allegation that a young mother has abandoned her infant with her ex-boyfriend ’s parents .
At their computer terminals , Winzer and her colleagues begin translating the allegations into answers that fit neatly into the multiple choice questions asked by the computer program called Structured Decision Making , or SDM .
If a parent has a drug or alcohol problem , the computer adds one point to the score ; no prior referrals subtracts a point .
An allegation of excessive discipline , defined as “ torture , ” adds another point .
The system provides a series of questionnaires for different stages of an investigation .
Social workers ’ answers to certain questions prompt action .
In a safety assessment , for example , a caregiver found not to be supervising or feeding a child must be directed to immediate assistance ; otherwise the computer requires that the child be detained .
After about two dozen entries on the risk assessment questionnaire , the computer kicks back a level of risk : low , moderate , high or very high .
Critics say SDM mechanizes a decision - making process that only human beings can fully comprehend .
The questionnaires , they argue , fail to take full advantage of social workers ’ experience and intuition .
Others -- including many who use SDM on a daily basis -- say it provides objectivity in answering key questions where there once was subjectivity :
Should a parent be investigated for abuse or neglect ?
Should a child be removed from the home ?
Should a child ultimately be reunited with his or her parents ?
As a case moves from one point to the next , the answers to SDM ’s questionnaires build a complete dossier .
Because Los Angeles County ’s child protection system works like an assembly line , no single person follows a case from beginning to end ; only the computer does .
Although humans can overrule the computer , SDM ’s call has stood in 91 % of decisions in the county on whether to open an investigation , 92 % of recommendations on removing a child from a home and 99 % of decisions on whether to return a child .
There is evidence that favoring math over emotion works .
Studies show that actuarial statistics used by SDM predict the likelihood that a child will be abused or neglected with a precision never obtained when humans made decisions on their own .
But SDM is only as good as the information humans enter into it .
Since it went into widespread use in Los Angeles County seven years ago , there have still been high - profile cases of children left in abusive households .
“ If the social workers do n’t do their investigation properly , if they do n’t analyze the case thoroughly , it will be garbage in and garbage out , ” said Trish Ploehn , director of the family services department .
Hope for a good outcome
In a conference room at the Hawthorne office , veteran social worker Wendy Luke seems full of hope .
“ I think you really want to do whatever it takes , ” she tells a mother whose four children have been in foster care for weeks .
The children -- three boys and a girl ages 4 to 10 -- were removed from the mother ’s care after a police officer responded to a prank 911 call and found them home alone , wrestling in their underwear .
One had burned another with a spatula while trying to fry an egg .
None went to school .
According to SDM criteria , the home was unsafe and the children had to be removed .
Now , Luke is working to resolve the safety issues identified on the computer questionnaires .
To get her children back , the mother needs to reduce her risk factors from high to moderate on SDM ’s scoring system .
The mother , estranged from the violent , alcoholic father , says she is overwhelmed working as a grocery cashier from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. with no help .
Luke asks her to name her strength as a parent .
“ The only strength I see right now is me wanting to get my kids back , ” she says , adding that she made limited calls to her children ’s foster homes because it was too upsetting to be apart .
What was her plan to reunite her family ?
“ I have no idea how to answer that .
The best plan is .
. . .
I have no idea , ” the mother says , releasing the words into the air slowly .
“ If I answered you as a mother , I would say I want them back right now .
But it would be the same , with no one to watch my kids .
I can say that everything will be fine , but I would be lying . ”
Luke and her teammates offer the woman assistance getting on waiting lists for child care and mental health counseling .
Although her SDM score was hurt by a previously substantiated case of neglect , she can reduce her points if she can show that she is sober .
Luke tells her that if she complies with parenting classes and random drug and alcohol testing , she can be reunited with her children within 180 days of their removal .
The mother , with big hoop earrings , stark eye makeup and a hardened and weary disposition , writes it all down on a napkin .
An attempt to do better
Not long ago , the decision about whether to investigate a case and whether to remove or return a child was left almost entirely to social workers .
The result , the family services department determined , was standards that were applied scattershot .
Choices could be improperly influenced by individual experience and unconscious bias .
Even the best decisions were often backed up by sparsely written case reports , sometimes just a paragraph long .
“ We would get cases of detained children and not be able to understand why the social worker made the decision they did , ” said Michael Nash , the presiding judge of the county ’s children ’s court system .
In the worst cases , social workers failed to remove children from homes where they were later killed .
Even as some children died , the department suspected that too many others were detained .
A small city lived in foster care , population 52,135 in 1997 .
But how would the county do better ?
The work would have to be done with the same corps of social workers whose low pay , low level of experience and high turnover rate were blamed for many of the department ’s shortcomings .
A social worker starts at $ 35,200 a year ; among those out investigating in the field , two - thirds have fewer than five years ’ experience with the department ; 7 % of the department ’s 3,700 social workers quit each year .
In 1999 , social workers at the Santa Fe Springs office began using SDM to score families ’ risk .
The system was expanded department - wide in 2002 .
The number of children in foster care is now about 21,000 .
A system supporter
Winzer embraces SDM under the belief that it provides her a solid basis to navigate unfamiliar circumstances , often colored by differences in race , class and sensibilities .
But she knows the system , which is used in areas across the nation , is prone to manipulation .
An anonymous tip underscores this issue .
The allegation ?
A young girl had been sexually assaulted by her mother ’s boyfriend .
It ’s the third time the allegation has been received in as many months , and the girl must be examined by a doctor again .
The accusation is related as if it were an eyewitness account , yet it provides an address for the mother and daughter that is long outdated .
As Winzer listens over the phone from her bare cubicle , the mother explains that she believes the anonymous tipster is her estranged husband who is angry about her new boyfriend .
“ I know , ma’am .
There is nothing I can do , ” Winzer says .
The girl is already classified because of additional factors as being at “ high risk ” for abuse and is in jeopardy of being placed in foster care .
Now she must undergo an intrusive and time - consuming medical examination .
Winzer hangs up the phone .
“ She ’s tripping , ” Winzer tells the social worker in the next cubicle , “ because this is a totally bogus referral .
You know this is the husband trying to put this on the new boyfriend . ”
Another major question is why investigations involving black children result in detentions four times more often than investigations of white children .
Although a racial disparity existed before the switch to SDM , Department of Children and Family Services officials had hoped it would be mitigated by the computer .
Instead , the disparity has worsened slightly over the course of SDM ’s use .
Now suspicion is centering on the system ’s use of factors that may disadvantage black families .
For example , SDM counts prior referrals against a parent even if they are not substantiated , though substantiated referrals have greater weight .
Studies show that black families are more likely to be the subject of referrals , perhaps because of bias and because they more often come into contact with mandated reporters such as social service workers and police .
Richard Wexler , executive director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform , said that SDM presents the “ veneer of objectivity ” but that the use of previous referrals is a “ self - reinforcing ” mechanism that unfairly raises risk scores .
Raelene Freitag , director of the Children ’s Research Council , the organization that developed Structured Decision Making , defends the inclusion of earlier referrals as appropriate .
The continued racial disparity , she says , may have more to do with unequal access to the programs that help families stay together than bias in SDM .
Backed by computer
It ’s midafternoon when Winzer sets out to investigate a priority call .
A tip has come in that the mother of an 11 - month - old boy is using drugs again .
A Compton native , Winzer had wanted to be a police officer , but her mother vetoed the plan .
Social work seemed similar in many ways .
The door is open to the mother ’s apartment , so Winzer knocks on the wall .
“ Hello , ” she calls out , “ this is Children ’s Services .
Ms. Winzer . ”
The 40 - year - old mother , Darlene , emerges from the apartment in a T - shirt from her faith - based drug treatment program and greets Winzer with an open smile .
The apartment is sparely furnished with a couch , a mattress on the floor , a playpen doubling as a crib and a bicycle with a flat tire .
The floor is strewn with compact discs .
Winzer ’s posture has stiffened , as she steels herself for an investigation that may end badly .
The computer program ’s analysis will count points against Darlene because the family services department has already removed 3 - and 15 - year - old children from her care .
The points will rise further because she has been the subject of 13 referrals to the child abuse hotline since 1999 .
This might not have mattered if the mother had not told a counselor at her drug treatment program that she had relapsed .
Revealing a certain lack of guile , she tells the story again to Winzer .
Over the course of an all - night jag the previous weekend , she says , she smoked up to 15 rocks of crack cocaine and swallowed a handful of sleeping pills .
The baby was with a friend , she says .
“ My whole life is designed around not using , and I used , ” she says .
Winzer asks for information to contact the baby ’s father , but Darlene is not even able to provide a full name .
“ His name is Kevin , as far as I know .
He goes by so many names , ” she says .
Winzer consults with the office and agrees with supervisors that the mother ’s Structured Decision Making score is now through the roof .
The social worker confides to a reporter that she ’s thankful to have the computer program ’s process backing up her assessment , making sure that all factors are considered .
Fifteen minutes later , she is strapping the baby into a child seat in the back seat of her truck .
The mother sits on the couch , her head in her lap , her body heaving in sobs .
Because of the boy ’s young age , two processes begin simultaneously : one to reunite him with his mother ; one to find a permanent adoptive family .
The outcome will be heavily influenced by how well the mother is able to improve her SDM score .
Before the social worker leaves , Darlene says her Section 8 housing and welfare assistance is largely dependent on her ability to retain custody .
“ You do n’t know when I will get my child back ? ” she asks again .
“ That all depends on you , ” Winzer tells her .

The discovery is reported in the Feb. 10 , 2009 edition of " PLoS Biology , " a journal published by the Public Library of Science .
We were trying to synthesize compounds that could help us learn more about how cancer exploits normal growth controls
Once we made it , though , we found it was even better than we thought it would be at blocking mTor signaling .
It does everything that rapamycin does and more .
I hope the new drug can be used to treat a range of cancers
We will work with clinicians to test it against a number of types of cancer - colorectal , lung , breast , multiple myeloma and others .
We want to first find the cancer that is most sensitive to it .
We are extremely excited about the potential of targeting mTOR in this way to treat a number of cancers , although we are aware that there are many hurdles to reaching the finish line
A new drug that blocks cancer 's main source of growth has been created in the lab and proven effective in mice , scientists are reporting .
It is now being readied for clinical trials in patients .
Far more potent than similar compounds already in clinical trial , the drug short - circuits the normal ability of cells to sense the need to grow and divide -- a signal that cancer cells exploit to spread in the body .
The scientists are working with clinicians to test the drug 's effectiveness against a range of cancers that have proven difficult to treat .
The discovery is reported in the Feb. 10 , 2009 edition of " PLoS Biology , " a journal published by the Public Library of Science .
The research was led by scientists at the University of California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) and the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center .
Senior author of the paper is Kevan Shokat , PhD , Howard Hughes Medical Investigator and professor of cellular and molecular pharmacology at UCSF .
Normally , in response to growth signals , a multi- protein unit in cells called mTOR integrates information about the cell 's nutritional and energy needs , and prompts the cell to manufacture key proteins for cell growth .
But cancer exploits this signal for its own growth .
Clinical trials are underway to stymie cancer proliferation by using a drug called rapamycin -- marketed as Rapamune - - or related compounds to block the growth signal cycle .
The new drug greatly improves on rapamycin 's effectiveness , the scientists reported .
The name mTOR stands for " mammalian target of rapamycin . "
Of serious concern to clinicians , rapamycin and related drugs can actually promote cancer at the same time they thwart it .
This happens , the scientists found , because the drugs only partially block the cells response to a growth signal .
When this happens , the drugs end up augmenting the growth signal itself because a feedback process in the cell kicks in to assure adequate nutrition .
With the feedback system in play , cancer cells can regain needed nutrients and continue to proliferate .
The new drug totally blocks this feedback loop , said Shokat , who also is a faculty affiliate at the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences , known as QB3 , which is headquartered at UCSF .
" We were trying to synthesize compounds that could help us learn more about how cancer exploits normal growth controls , " he explained .
" Once we made it , though , we found it was even better than we thought it would be at blocking mTor signaling .
It does everything that rapamycin does and more . "
The new drug succeeds because there are two mTOR signal pathways , and it blocks both , the scientists found .
Rapamycin only blocks one , and so allows the growth - signaling system to still function .
The scientists think that the drug 's total blockage of the nutrient - sensitive mTOR and its feedback loop offer a major advance over rapamycin based drugs , which have been approved to treat only renal call carcinoma effectively .
" I hope the new drug can be used to treat a range of cancers , " Shokat said .
" We will work with clinicians to test it against a number of types of cancer - colorectal , lung , breast , multiple myeloma and others .
We want to first find the cancer that is most sensitive to it . "
The new compound has been dubbed a TORKinib because it inhibits the mTOR signal .
UCSF has applied for a patent and licensed the patent to a startup biotech company , co-founded by Shokat and colleagues , to advance its use in clinical trials to treat cancer .
mTOR is known as a kinase , a ubiquitous type of signaling molecule - there are more than 500 different kinases in the body - that essentially switches proteins on or off .
The switch is one of the most common interactions in the body .
The kinase adds a small molecule known as a phosphate group to the protein , and that single action either turns on the protein or dampens its activity .
Like all signaling systems in the body , the one involving mTOR goes through many steps to accomplish its duties .
The different steps form a cascade that can ramp the signal up or down , depending on the conditions of the cells or tissues .
These kinase cascades are embedded within complicated feedback loops , such as the one activated by rapamycin .
Research on the mTOR pathway is of increasing interest to drug companies , Shokat said .
Since mTOR acts " upstream " and " downstream " of other key kinases that are found to cause cancer -- such as the much - studied kinases PI3K and Akt -- he thinks blocking it will short - circuit the many feedback loops cancer cells use to generate and maintain a growth signal .
" We are extremely excited about the potential of targeting mTOR in this way to treat a number of cancers , although we are aware that there are many hurdles to reaching the finish line , " Shokat said .
Lead author on the paper is Morris E. Feldman , a graduate student in Shokat 's lab .
Shokat 's colleague , Davide Ruggero , PhD , who studies cancer 's effect on protein synthesis , is also a coauthor .
Ruggero is assistant professor of urology in the UCSF Helen Family Comprehensive Cancer Center .
Other coauthors are Beth Apsel , PhD , a graduate student in chemistry and chemical biology ; and Zachary Knight , PhD , a postdoctoral scientist in Shokat 's lab during the research project .
Also : Aino Uotila and Robbie Loewith in the department of molecular biology , University of Geneva .
The research was funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
The private company co-founded by Shokat is called Intellikine .
He is the chairman of its scientific advisory board and holds stock options in the company .

“ Dollhouse ” finally flicks the Awesome switch
I completely understand why my colleague John Paulsen bailed on “ Dollhouse ” earlier in the season .
The show was running in place , a series of self - contained episodes with nothing hanging in the balance .
The only takeaway from a couple of the shows was that the dolls were still remembering things after they had been wiped , and were keeping this a secret from their handlers and Topher .
The subplot involving FBI Agent Paul Ballard seemed stuck as well .
He knows the Dollhouse exists , but has neither the proof nor the support of the agency to pursue it .
Yawn .
Then came last Friday ’s episode , where “ Dollhouse ” creator Joss Whedon launched the show into space .
He first played with the idea that Echo , Victor and Sierra were engaged in a secret alliance with the news that Sierra had been having sex and was suddenly terrified of Victor .
It does n’t take long for Boyd , the Dixon to Echo ’s Sydney Bristow , to realize that the perp is a fellow handler , and DeWitt gives the handler a choice : take out Mellie , the nosy neighbor of Agent Ballard who Knows Too Much , or get sent to the Attic .
( Man , I ca n’t wait until they finally show us what that place looks like . )
Ballard , who ’s out getting takeout and realizes that Mellie is in danger , races back while making a call .
We see Mellie ’s phone ringing as the handler is slowly choking the life out of her .
Then the answering machine picks up , and we hear … DeWitt .
“ There are three flowers in a vase .
The third one is green . ”
Ta -da , instant can of whoopass .
Mellie beats the snot out of the handler , killing him in seconds .
Then DeWitt says , “ There are three flowers in a vase .
The third one is yellow . ”
Poof , she ’s back to being “ normal ” Mellie .
Holy crap .
“ Do n’t arrest me yet .
She has n’t heard my bit about the KFC bowls , it kills ’em every time . ”
This was awesome on a number of levels .
For starters , I never suspected that Mellie was a doll .
She does n’t quite have the body type that the other dolls have , though that actually makes her a perfect choice for a role like this .
Second of all , the dolls can be activated and deactivated by remote voice command ?
Again , holy crap .
I ’m assuming that the third flower in that metaphorical vase is red .
What happens to a doll when she uses that line ?
Does it make them catatonic ?
Whedon also pulled another neat trick in doing a story where someone uses the Dollhouse for harmless , and rather sweet , purposes .
Patton Oswalt guest starred as an Internet millionaire who planned on surprising his wife with a brand new house , but she was killed in a car accident on her way to see it .
So every year on the day of her death , he hires a doll to relive that moment that he never had with his wife .
Awwwww , is n’t that cute ?
Gee , maybe the Dollhouse is n’t so bad after all , right ?
Mmmmm , would n’t go that far , but it does make the ethical aspects of programmable people slightly grayer than it would appear on the surface .
The episode ’s Big Reveal , though , was the fact that there is a mole in the Dollhouse , and they used Echo to send a message to Agent Ballard that he has an ally on the inside .
On the surface , it would appear that the only person with the ability to slip that kind of thing under Topher ’s nose would be his underutilized assistant Ivy , but does she have access to enough information to bring the Dollhouse down , and would she have known that there are over 20 Dollhouses around the world ?
Doubtful , which is why my money is on Dr. Claire Saunders ( my beloved Amy Acker ) as the mole .
She was horribly disfigured by Alpha , which gives her motive , and as their medical chief of staff , she would have access to lots of data .
Plus , you have to know that Whedon is n’t going to recruit Acker for the show and then have her spend most of the time on the bench .
The problem with all this , of course , is that it ’s possible Whedon waited too long to get the show rolling .
The show is n’t cheap , and Fox certainly has it in its sights when time comes to trim the budget .
It needs a huge spike in ratings — it actually needs a better time slot , but that ’s another story — but will they get one ?
If Whedon delivers another episode as great as this one , that should be enough to rally the Browncoats into action .
Stay tuned .
I just can't get over how well that self - policing policy has worked for our national food supply !
Federal officials have released a tidal wave of fresh recalls in the past 24 hours as they connect the dots in the supply chain of tainted peanut - related products .
The latest recalls by 25 companies listing dozens of items include Walgreen 's chocolate candy with peanuts , Best Brands peanut butter cookie dough and Hain Celestial 's frozen pad Thai dinners , including one made for Trader Joe's .
On Saturday , Harry and David of Medford joined the recall , pulling Olympia Delight Trail Mix products , and Berkeley , Ca. - based Clif Bar and Co. pulled eight more of its protein bars .
The recall has reached a fever pitch since it was expanded to include all products - from roasted peanuts to peanut butter -- from Peanut Corporation of America 's plant at Blakely , Ga. , where Food and Drug Administration investigators found two strains of salmonella and evidence that on 12 occasions in 2007 and 2008 the company sold food even after it had tested positive for salmonella .
In a startling revelation on Saturday , the Atlanta Journal Constitution said the president of Peanut Corp. , Stewart Parnell , serves on an industry advisory board that helps the U.S. Department of Agriculture set quality standards for peanuts .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Nearly 1,300 computers in more than 100 countries have been attacked and have become part of a computer espionage network apparently based in China , security experts alleged in two reports Sunday .
The network was discovered after computers at the Dalai Lama 's office were hacked , researchers say .
Computers -- including machines at NATO , governments and embassies -- are infected with software that lets attackers gain complete control of them , according to the reports .
One was issued by the University of Toronto 's Munk Centre for International Studies in conjunction with the Ottawa , Canada - based think tank The SecDev Group ; the second came from the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory .
Researchers have dubbed the network GhostNet .
The network can not only search a computer but see and hear the people using it , according to the Canadian report .
" GhostNet is capable of taking full control of infected computers , including searching and downloading specific files , and covertly operating attached devices , including microphones and web cameras , " the report says .
The discovery of GhostNet grew out of suspicions that the office of the Dalai Lama had been hacked .
His staff sent a foreign diplomat an e-mail invitation to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader , but before the Dalai Lama 's people could follow up with a phone call , " the diplomat 's office was contacted by the Chinese government and warned not to go ahead with the meeting , " according to the Cambridge report .
Watch CNN's John Vause report on the network »
An investigation resulted in both reports .
Both found links to computers in China , but the researchers did not conclude who they thought was behind the " malware , " or malicious software .
" Chinese cyber espionage is a major global concern ... [ b ] ut attributing all Chinese malware to deliberate or targeted intelligence gathering operations by the Chinese state is wrong and misleading , " according to the Canadian report titled , " Tracking GhostNet : Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network . "
" The sheer number of young digital natives online can more than account for the increase in Chinese malware , " it adds .
But the report also points out that China is among a handful of countries , including the United States , Israel and United Kingdom , that are " assumed " to have considerable computer espionage capabilities .
Attempts by CNN to contact the Chinese government in Beijing and its American embassy and consulate offices were unsuccessful on Sunday , as the offices were closed .
However , a spokesman for the Chinese consulate in New York dismissed the idea China was involved when speaking to The New York Times .
" These are old stories and they are nonsense , " Wenqi Gao told the Times .
" The Chinese government is opposed to and strictly forbids any cyber crime . "
Hackers gained access to computers in the Dalai Lama 's office by tricking computer users into downloading e-mail attachments that had been carefully engineered to appear safe , according to the authors of the Cambridge report , titled , " The Snooping Dragon : Social - malware Surveillance of the Tibetan Movement . "
" The attackers took the trouble to write e-mails that appeared to come from fellow Tibetans and indeed from co-workers , " according to the report , authored by Shishir Nagaraja and Ross Anderson .
Once the attackers gained an initial foothold , " they also stole mail in transit and replaced the attachments with toxic ones , " the report adds .
The Dalai Lama investigation led to the discovery of hundreds more infected machines in locations from The Associated Press in Britain and Deloitte and Touche in New York , to the ministries of foreign affairs in Indonesia , Iran and the Philippines .
The office of the prime minister of Laos was also snared , as was a single non-secure computer at NATO , according to the Canadian report .
Infected computers " checked in " with control servers as early as May 2007 and as recently as March 12 of this year , the report adds .
Attempts by CNN to verify the reports ' allegations with NATO , the Laotian government and the Dalai Lama 's organization in India were not immediately successful on Sunday .
The attack has broader implications , Nagaraja and Anderson warn , since a single person could carry out a similar one .
" Even a capable motivated individual could have carried out the attacks we describe here , " they say .
The computer systems of businesses are almost certain to be hacked by similar means , if they have not been already , the experts claim .
" Social malware will be used for fraud , and the typical company really has no defense against it , " since it is so expensive and inconvenient , for example , to keep sensitive information or processes on computers with no Internet access .
" We expect that many crooks will get rich before effective countermeasures are widely deployed . "
The Information Warfare Monitor Web site , where the Canadian report was released , was down Sunday afternoon .
GhostNet is not affiliated with GhostNet Inc. , a business technology company .

The financial crisis may have turned much of Wall Street ’s wealth into dross , but a select group of hedge fund managers has managed to maintain a golden touch that might make King Midas blush .
As major markets and economies careened downward last year , 25 top managers reaped a total of $ 11.6 billion in pay by trading above the pain in the markets , according to an annual ranking of top hedge fund earners by Institutional Investor ’s Alpha magazine , which comes out Wednesday .
James H. Simons , a former math professor who has made billions year after year for the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies , earned $ 2.5 billion running computer - driven trading strategies .
John A. Paulson , who rode to riches by betting against the housing market , came in second with reported gains of $ 2 billion .
And George Soros , also a perennial name on the rich list of secretive moneymakers , pulled in $ 1.1 billion .
Of course , their earnings were not unscathed by the extensive shakeout in the markets .
In a year when losses were recorded at two of every three hedge funds , pay for many of these managers was down by several million , and the overall pool of earnings was about half the $ 22.5 billion the top 25 earned in 2007 .
Does anyone remember how many Democrats voted for Ronald Reagan ’s tax cuts in 1981 ?
Of course not , because it does n’t really matter .
What matters is that Reagan used the economic misfortune of his time to defund government in the ultimate hope of reducing its role in America ’s economic life .
Liberal Democrats were horrified , and stood in angry opposition .
More conservative Democrats trimmed around the edges but ultimately got on board because they themselves had grown distrustful of their party ’s economic orthodoxy , and because the people they represented wanted to give Reagan a chance .
The liberals , who generally held safe seats , spent the 1980s in sulking defiance , while many of the more conservative Democrats , who represented Southern and Western areas that were rapidly turning red , lost their seats despite their best efforts to play nice with Gipper .
In other words , nothing the Democrats did really mattered .
They were set pieces in Ronald Reagan ’s play .
He seized the moment to change America ’s political economy , and because his efforts seemed to work — because Americans felt better off in 1984 than they had four years before — he reaped the rewards and Democrats paid the price .
When it comes to Obama ’s stimulus plan , everyone has an interest in pretending the Congressional Republicans matter .
Today the flip side is true .
When it comes to Obama ’s stimulus plan , everyone has an interest in pretending the Congressional Republicans matter .
Conservative commentators pretend they do because they see the stimulus debate as the first shot in the battle for the soul of the post - Bush GOP .
Liberal commentators pretend they do because attacking the Congressional GOP is the closest activity to Bush - bashing still available , and thus , it comes naturally .
( Thankfully for them , Dick Cheney keeps opening his mouth .
If they ’re really lucky , he ’ll get a show on Fox . )
The mainstream media pretends Republicans matter because they want drama , and they know that the only real drama in the stimulus fight is whether it passes with bipartisan support or not .
They also like the idea of seeing Barack Obama stumble .
They ’ve grown tired of the Obama - as - messiah narrative , and are eager for the next act , in which the hero stumbles and shows he ’s human after all .
Failing in his efforts at bipartisanship would be such a stumble .
But it ’s all much ado about nothing .
In policy terms , to be sure , Republican critiques of the stimulus are important :
We ’re engaged in an extraordinary experiment in whether Keynesian economics works , and whether it works more effectively through spending or tax cuts .
But politically , the critiques are irrelevant .
The Obama stimulus will pass .
For a while , the economy will almost certainly remain bad .
If by 2011 and 2012 , it starts to markedly recover — as the American economy did in 1983 and 1984 — Obama will get the credit , no matter how many Republicans voted with him .
Blue states and districts will grow bluer , and many of the Republicans who represent them will lose , or else retire before they can .
( See Gregg , Judd ) .
Republicans in safe conservative states and districts will keep their jobs , and watch Obama ’s triumph in brooding insignificance .
If , on the other hand , the stimulus fails , and the economy is no better when Obama begins campaigning for re-election than it is today , all Republicans will benefit , whether they backed the stimulus or not .
( Although by that time the country will be so desperate and irate that we could see serious independent candidacies , latter - day Francis Townsends and Huey Longs promising all manner of populist rescue schemes . )
So relax , Republicans .
It ’s out of your hands .
The other team is at the foul line with no time left on the clock .
If they hit the shots , you lose .
If they miss , you win .
Whether you offer words of encouragement or jeers of disapproval , it does n’t really matter .
You ’re spectators in someone else ’s game .

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : sparsebit 0.5 - Sparse Bitmaps for Pattern Match Coverage
sparsebit - Sparse Bitmaps for Pattern Match Coverage http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/sparsebit
This library packages the functional peal paper ' Sparse Bitmaps for Pattern Match Coverage ' submitted to ICFP 2009 by Ki Yung Ahn and Tim Sheard .
You can look up the tutorial - like paper and the talk slides , which are availabel at : http://kyagrd.dyndns.org/wiki/SparseBitmapsForPatternMatchCoverage
Abstract : Pattern matching coverage over Algebraic Data Types( ADTs ) has most often been studied in the context of pattern compilation algorithms .
However , it is worth considering the pattern matching coverage problem in isolation , since general solutions will be independent of the specifics of any implementation or language .
We define an intuitive and mathematically well - established bit masking semantics for pattern match coverage .
We design and implement a sparse bitmap data structure , which realizes this semantics in a compact and flexible manner .
This bitmap data structure supports computing coverage solutions of large programs incrementally from coverage solutions of sub-programs .
It can also be used as a common data representation for pattern coverage shared between different tools ( e.g. , compilers , linting tools , software analysis tools ) that need pattern match coverage information .
Additional source files Type.hs and TestType.hs packaged with this library provides the examples and QuickCheck extracted from the paper to demonstrate how to use this library .
====================================================================
Some additional notes : Personally , I am very happy to upload my first project on Hackage .
If you are looking for simple and elegant way of describing pattern match coverage or testing exhaustiveness of pattern matching , we hope this may give you a better insight .
This is a reference implementation , but I think it is still usable to some extent .
One might want to define monadic version of the library functions and operators since the type representation in the program analysis tools might be monadic for implementation reasons ( easy to generate fresh type variables ) and performance reasons ( to exploit sharing while unification of type variables ) .
And in such cases , more optimized implementation of tensor product may be possible as well .
And there are some other issues discussed in the paper as well .
I was not able to make the haddock documentation appear in Hackage , although I have no problem generating documentation using " cabal haddock " locally .
It would be nice if there is a way to see some diagnose of warning or error messages why haddock failed on Hackage .

Giving bonuses to executives at Lloyds Bank would be " completely wrong " , Tory leader David Cameron has said .
Payments totalling £ 120 m are reportedly to go to workers at Lloyds - which is 43 % state - owned - despite record losses at the bank 's subsidiary HBOS .
Mr Cameron told the BBC that it was " not possible " to rule out a full nationalisation of the institution .
The Lib Dems said the bonuses would reward " failure " .
Ministers said lower - paid workers should not miss out .
But Lloyds said its staff deserved " financial recognition " for hitting targets .
A Lloyds spokesman stressed that no decision had been finalised on this year 's bonuses , although the group 's five executive directors have all voluntarily agreed to forego any bonus they may be awarded for 2008 .
HBOS - bought by Lloyds with government backing last year - is set to record a loss of nearly £ 11bn , raising concerns that it may need more help from the state .
' Incompetent ' Employment Minister Tony McNulty said staff on lower salaries should not forgo their bonuses , but the issue was totally different for senior executives .
" I would draw the line between senior managers , board members , executives , those responsible for the business model and strategy that got them into the mess , they should n't get a penny , " he said .
Reports of £ 120 m in bonuses come amid speculation that the government - which has already poured £ 17bn into the group - may be forced to take a majority stake in Lloyds , or even nationalise it .
Asked whether staff should get extra cash , Mr Cameron told BBC One 's Politics Show : " Basically no .
Those banks that are owned by the taxpayer or where the taxpayer has a large stake - it 's completely wrong to be paying bonuses . "
He added : " The prime minister seems to have been sleeping on the job and the government seems to have been completely incompetent on this . "
Mr Cameron also said : " I would n't deny the teller in the bank one or two thousand pound bonuses if they are on a modest salary .
Times have changed , circumstances have changed and it's important the banks recognise that
Hilary Benn , environment secretary
Your views on bonuses " Bonuses to the board , to senior executives , to big traders , to the big managers - that 's completely wrong when it is out of government money . "
Asked whether Lloyds had to be nationalised , Mr Cameron said : " It may have to be .
We can't rule it out .
It may happen . "
Lloyds TSB shareholders voted 95.98 % in favour of the takeover of HBOS last year .
As part of government plans to recapitalise the banks , Lloyds TSB and HBOS receive £ 17bn of public money between them .
' National interest ' Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show : " We are getting into nationalisation accidentally ...
The group may well have to come back to the government ....
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" We have these banks that are almost nationalised and they have to be run in the national interest .
The government 's got to be more decisive . "
On the Lloyds bonuses , Mr Cable said : " There are contractual problems that have to be overcome , but as a general policy position no bonuses should be paid to banks that have failed and are dependent on the taxpayer .
" We should be quite clear about that .
There is a longer - term question about how you have a bonus system and how you do create incentives and prevent people taking cash that creates excessive risk .
" But those big long - term reforms have to be kept separate from today 's problems , which are not using taxpayers ' money to pay out very large bonuses , for the most part , to very highly paid people who have failed as business people . "
' Political pressures ' Environment Secretary Hillary Benn told Sky News : " If you are talking about bank tellers getting their performance - related pay , I do n't think anyone 's going to quarrel with that .
" But when it comes to large bonuses for bankers , some self - restraint is required and I think the public rightly looks askance if people do n't do that .
" Times have changed , circumstances have changed and it's important the banks recognise that . "
A Lloyds spokesman said : " We are a retail and commercial bank where most colleagues earn approximately £ 17,000 a year .
" We have been stretching performance targets and if they are met we believe it is right that colleagues receive some financial recognition .
" In most cases this means an annual bonus of £ 1,000 or less . "
Last week Chancellor Alistair Darling told RBS failure should not be rewarded with huge bonuses , but says he cannot rule out pay - outs for some bank staff .
The comments came as reports put the potential total bonus figure at up to £ 1bn for the company 's 177,000 workers .

Environment correspondent , BBC News website
The experiment may have been compromised by voracious amphipods
The biggest ever investigation into " ocean fertilisation " as a climate change fix has brought modest results .
The idea is that putting iron filings in the ocean will stimulate growth of algae , which will absorb CO2 from air .
But scientists on the Lohafex project , which put six tonnes of iron into the Southern Ocean , said little extra carbon dioxide was taken up .
Germany 's environment ministry had tried to stop the project , which green campaign groups said was " dangerous " .
Leaders of the German - Indian expedition said they had gained valuable scientific information , but that their results suggested iron fertilisation could not have a major impact , at least in that region of the oceans .
" There 's been hope that one could remove some of the excess carbon dioxide - put it back where it came from , in a sense , because the petroleum we 're burning was originally made by the algae , " said Victor Smetacek from the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven .
The Southern Ocean cannot sequester the amount of carbon dioxide that one had hoped
Victor Smetacek
" But our results show this is going to be a small amount , almost negligible . "
Previous experiments , which have been going on for at least a decade , had indicated that iron particles could stimulate the growth of phytoplankton - algae - and that when the phytoplankton died , they fell to the sea floor , meaning that carbon taken from the air was effectively locked away on the bottom of the ocean .
Following fertilisation of a 300 sq km patch of ocean , Lohafex , too , saw a burst of algal growth .
But within two weeks , the algae were being eaten by tiny creatures called copepods , which were then in turn eaten by amphipods , a larger type of crustacean .
The net result was that far less carbon dioxide was absorbed and sent to the sea floor than scientists had anticipated .
" What it means is the Southern Ocean cannot sequester the amount of carbon dioxide that one had hoped , " concluded Professor Smetacek .
Growing concerns
One key issue appears to be the type of algae that grows in response to the extra iron .
Earlier experiments had found diatoms blooming - organisms with a protective silica casing .
But in the Lohafex area , the diatom population could not increase because the waters were depleted of silicic acid , the substance that is later converted to silica .
Some scientists have long argued that the iron fertilisation vision was flawed because lack of iron was not always the factor limiting growth ; and this result appears to provide some backing for that contention .
But Kenneth Coale , director of Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in California , who has led several iron fertilisation experiments , said the initial burst of phytoplankton growth was consistent with previous findings .
" To date we 've conducted experiments in what amounts to 0.04 % of the ocean 's surface , " he told BBC News .
" All have indicated that iron is the key factor controlling phytoplankton growth , and most have indicated that there is carbon flux ( towards the sea floor ) - this is one that did n't . "
A key aim for the future , he said , was to understand better the various ecosystems contained in the ocean in order that fertilisation could be conducted in areas containing the " right " kinds of organism .
Satellites can spot phytoplankton blooms in the process of formation
The Lohafex expedition , which used the German Polarstern ship , was controversial from the outset , with Greenpeace leading demands that it be stopped .
The campaign group said tipping iron filings into the sea amounted to pollution , and was forbidden under international agreements including the UN Convention on Biological Diversity , which at its 2008 meeting had called for a de facto moratorium on such experiments except at small scale in coastal waters .
" There are two things that concern us , " said Greenpeace scientist David Santillo .
" Firstly , there 's the direct impacts from the experiments themselves , and as the scale of the experiments has gone up and up there 's much greater potential for those direct results , " he told BBC News .
" But a second and broader concern is that if we 're going to be pursuing this as a climate mitigation strategy , then we 're looking at a state of the world where we rely on manipulating the ocean on a truly huge scale and that would undoubtedly have large and possibly irreversible effects on ocean ecosystems . "
The German government put the expedition on hold earlier this year because of these concerns , but subsequently allowed it to proceed .
A commercial company , Climos , is planning a much larger experiment that could cover up to 40,000 sq km of ocean .
It hopes eventually to receive funding through the global carbon market if it can demonstrate that the technique can sequester large quantities of the greenhouse gas .
Compared with most other geo-engineering " fixes " for climate change , an added benefit of iron fertilisation in principle is that it would also combat ocean acidification , which appears likely to threaten marine organisms such as coral and snails in decades to come .

" I take this action after 11 years of dedicated , honorable service to AIG .
I can no longer effectively perform my duties in this dysfunctional environment , nor am I being paid to do so .
Like you , I was asked to work for an annual salary of $ 1 , and I agreed out of a sense of duty to the company and to the public officials who have come to its aid .
Having now been let down by both , I can no longer justify spending 10 , 12 , 14 hours a day away from my family for the benefit of those who have let me down . " via Op - Ed Contributor -- " Dear AIG , I Quit ! " -- NYTimes.com
Like a lot of people , I read Wednesday 's New York Times editorial by former AIG Financial Products employee Jake DeSantis , whose resignation letter basically asks us all to reconsider our anger toward the poor overworked employees of his unit .
DeSantis has a few major points .
They include : 1 ) I had nothing to do with my boss Joe Cassano 's toxic credit default swaps portfolio , and only a handful of people in our unit did ; 2 ) I did n't even know anything about them ; 3 ) I could have left AIG for a better job several times last year ; 4 ) but I did n't , staying out of a sense of duty to my poor , beleaguered firm , only to find out in the end that ;
5 ) I would be betrayed by AIG senior management , who promised we would be rewarded for staying , but then went back on their word when they folded in highly cowardly fashion in the face of an angry and stupid populist mob .
I have a few responses to those points .
They are 1 ) Bullshit ; 2 ) bullshit ; 3 ) bullshit , plus of course ; 4 ) bullshit .
Lastly , there is 5 ) Boo-Fucking - Hoo .
You dog .
AIGFP only had 377 employees .
Those 400 - odd folks received almost $ 3.5 billion in compensation in the last seven years , a very large part of that money coming from the sale of credit default protection .
Doing the math , that averages out to over $ 9 million of compensation per person .
Ask yourself this question :
If your company made that much money , and the boss of the unit made almost $ 280 million in just a few years , exactly how likely is it that you would n't know where that money was coming from ?
Are we supposed to believe that Jake DeSantis knew nothing about Joe Cassano 's CDS deals ?
If your boss and the top guys in your firm were all making a killing selling anything at all -- whether it was rubber kayaks , generic Levitra or credit default swaps -- you really would n't bother to find out what that thing they were selling was ?
You 'd really just mind your own business , sit at your cubicle and put your faith in the guys up top to fill you in if there was something you needed to know ?
This would be a believable claim for an employee of some other wing of AIG , a company with well over 100,000 employees .
But DeSantis works for tiny , 377 - person AIGFP , a unit that had only two offices -- one in London and one in Greenwich , Conn .
And we 're talking about financial professionals , the most shameless group of tirelessly envious gossips ever to walk the face of the earth .
The likelihood that Cassano would pull in $ 280 million for himself , and his equally greedy , hopelessly jealous employees would n't know not only exactly how he made that money but every last ugly detail about his life -- from what skank he 's sleeping with to what side of his trousers he hangs on -- is almost zero .
I know plenty of people who work in this world , and I 've met very few who did n't hate with every cell in their bodies anyone in their own companies who made more money than they did or got bigger bonuses at Christmastime .
Gossiping about each others ' bonuses , and bitching about each others ' compensation , is the national pastime for these people .
So forgive me if I do n't buy this story that poor Jake and his buddies did n't know about Cassano 's CDS business .
Also , there 's this : let 's just say , Jake , that you 're telling the truth , that you do n't know anything about this toxic portfolio .
If that 's the case , then why the fuck does anyone need to retain you at an exorbitant salary to help unwind that very portfolio ?
If these transactions are n't and never were your expertise , then where the hell is your value here ?
When I spoke to Christine Pretto , the AIG spokeswoman , and asked about those bonuses , she said that AIG needed to retain people like you in order to take advantage of your " knowledge of these transactions . "
So if you do n't have knowledge of these transactions , what are you being paid for ?
Your winning attitude ?
Then there 's the matter of Jake 's other job offers .
About that :
It was apparent as early as last February that Cassano had basically destroyed not only the unit but perhaps AIG itself .
The company announced over $ 11 billion in losses around that time .
If I'm Jake DeSantis , and I 'm really innocent , I 'm looking for a job that very instant .
And I 'm taking the first good job anyone offers me .
Because by then I 'd have realized that I was working for the latest version of Enron .
That the man I 've been working for the last six or seven years has turned out to be one of the most irresponsible Wall Street villains of all time , a man who single - handedly destroyed the 18th - largest company in the world .
If I 'm Jake DeSantis , I 'm quitting out of moral disgust , because I do n't want to be associated with this kind of behavior .
The only reason I 'd stay is if I did n't have a choice .
Which I feel sure is what happened here .
If Jake DeSantis did n't take advantage of an opportunity to get a better job elsewhere with a company that did n't hide billions in losses and make $ 500 billion bets with money they did n't have , that 's his fucking problem .
The notion that I the taxpayer have to pay this asshole a million - dollar bonus because he turned down a better job at a less - guilty company is repugnant to begin with ; the notion that he stayed at AIGFP because he expected me to pay him this bonus makes me hate him even more .
But it 's all moot , because I feel quite sure it 's a lie .
As one trader for another firm told me not long ago when I asked what he thought about the need to pay these " retention bonuses " to these " valued employees " at AIGFP :
" Yeah , right .
Who would hire these guys ?
They 'd stay for a dollar if you offered it to them , much less a million . "
I mean , half of Wall Street is unemployed right now .
There are plenty of unemployed traders out there whose resumes do n't include such entries as " Worked for years at small unit of AIG that helped destroy the universe ; throughout that time was completely ignorant of burgeoning global disaster unfolding 5 feet from my desk . "
The idea that other companies would be so eager to pass over the seas of truly innocent available people in order to scoop up some still - employed veteran of AIGFP -- and that they would be so enthusiastic in their pursuit of said AIGFP employees that AIG would need to pay those AIGFP folks million - plus retention bonuses to get them to stay -- is so ludicrous it almost defies comment .
Show me , anywhere , the Wall Street firm that 's willing right now to spend more than a million dollars poaching still - employed midlevel executives like DeSantis , when they can just put an ad in the paper and have 500 recently unemployed CEOs begging for work at almost any salary in five minutes .
So the idea that the rest of Wall Street is breaking down AIGFP 's doors to lavish its idiot personnel with million - dollar offers is just utterly preposterous .
The fact that DeSantis expects us to believe this is insulting in itself .
Also , remember , DeSantis until this year was probably the recipient of performance bonuses .
This year , obviously , there was no performance , so AIG doled out these " retention " bonuses instead .
And the value of these retention bonuses is seriously in question if AIG never really needed to pay extra to retain this personnel , which I personally believe they did n't .
I personally believe these " retention " bonuses were a ruse cooked up by management to suck a few more dollars out of the company before it sank to the ocean bottom .
So if DeSantis is " owed " these bonuses , it 's only in the sense that someone up above agreed to cheat the shareholders by paying these bonuses when they were n't really necessary ; they were n't " earned " in any real sense .
But all of this is really secondary to the tone of DeSantis ' letter .
He acts like he 's a victim because he did n't get to keep his after - tax bonus of $ 742,006.40 in the middle of a global depression .
And he really loses his fucking mind when he writes :
" None of us should be cheated of our payments any more than a plumber should be cheated after he has fixed the pipes but a careless electrician causes a fire that burns down the house . "
First of all , Jake , you asshole , no plumber in the world gets paid a $ 740,000 bonus , over and above his salary , just to keep plumbing .
Second , try living on a plumber 's salary before you even think about comparing yourself to one ; you 're inviting a pitchfork in the gut by even thinking along those lines .
Third , Jake , if you were a plumber , and the electrician burned the house down -- well , guess what ?
If you and that electrician worked for the same company , you actually would n't get paid for that job .
Out in the real world , when your company burns a house down , you 're not getting paid by that client .
It 's only on Wall Street , where the every - man - for - himself ethos is built into an insanely selfish and greed - addled compensation system , that people like you expect to get paid in a bubble -- only there do people expect their performance bonuses no matter how much money the shareholders lose overall , no matter how many people get laid off after the hostile takeover , no matter how ill - considered the mortgages lent out by your division were .
You expect that money because you think it 's owed to you .
But what money ?
The money is gone .
Your boss , if not you , set it all afire .
You want the money , but where exactly do you think it 's coming from ?
Do you just not understand that that money now would have to come out of someone else 's pocket ?
That it would have to come from middle - class taxpayers , real plumbers , people who did n't make millions over the years in equity and commodity trading ?
Here 's the real problem with people like Jake DeSantis .
Throughout this whole period , they never were able to connect the dots -- to grasp the fact that when they skimmed a million here or a million there off the great rivers of capital that flowed through their offices , that that money came from somewhere , from someone .
To them , it was n't someone else 's money , it was just money , and why should n't they have it ?
It 's remarkable that when DeSantis , in his letter , touts the reason he deserves his high compensation , all he can talk about is how much money he made : " The profitability of the businesses with which I was associated clearly supported my compensation . "
For a guy like this , his worth as a human being is wrapped up in buying a bag of beans for $ 10 and selling it for $ 11 .
He states this like it 's a law of nature : he was a good equities - and - commodities trader , therefore he should make a lot of money .
Only a person with a habitually overinflated sense of self - worth could think he deserves a $ 700,000 retention bonus , even if it has to be paid by taxpayers , when in reality no one " deserves " that much money .
It may be that some people do get paid that much , but most people who make that much money have enough sense to realize their cushy lifestyles are an accident of fate , of birth , of class , not something that is " supported " by some unwritten natural law of compensation .
Hey Jake , it 's not like you were curing cancer .
You were a fucking commodities trader .
Thanks to a completely insane , horribly skewed set of societal values that puts a premium on greed and severely undervalues selflessness , communal spirit and intellectualism -- values that make millionaires out of people like you and leave teachers and nurses , the people who raise your kids and clean your parents ' bedpans , comparatively penniless -- you made a lot of money .
Good for you .
Consider yourself lucky .
But your company went belly - up and broke , almost certainly thanks in part to you , and now you do n't get your bonus .
So be a man and deal with it .
The rest of us do , when we get bad breaks , and we 've had a lot more of them than you .
And stop whining .
Jesus Christ .

About author I 'm a political reporter for Rolling Stone magazine , a sports columnist for Men 's Journal , and I also write books for a Random House imprint called Spiegel and Grau .
My main ambition in life is to someday strangle that chick in the Progressive Insurance commercials who is always waving her hands back and forth and screaming , " Discount ! ! ! "
Anyone who has suggestions for how to dump her body without being caught is welcome to write to me .
I already have plenty of plastic and a staple - gun .
I ’ve driven lots of cars .
I ’ve wallowed like a Russian oligarch pig in the gorgeous mud of a $ 1.6 - million Bugatti Veyron .
I ’ve spit tailpipe fire across the midnight Mojave at the wheel of a Lamborghini .
I ’ve brushed gape - mouthed peasants aside with the chrome cowcatcher grille of a Rolls Royce Phantom .
Yet I have never driven a car half as advanced , as futuristic , as blind - with - science as the Honda FCX Clarity hydrogen fuel - cell vehicle .
Nor one so expensive .
More on that in a moment .
But first , let ’s get this out of the way : Hydrogen fuel - cell technology wo n’t work in cars .
It ’s a tragic cul - de-sac in the search for sustainable mobility , being used to game the California Air Resources Board ’s rules requiring carmakers to build zero-emission vehicles .
Any way you look at it , hydrogen is a lousy way to move cars .
Advertisement
Face it : Fuel - cell technology has been eclipsed by vastly cheaper , here - now advances in batteries and plug - in electric vehicles .
To knit together even the barest network of H2 refueling stations would cost billions .
And , in any case , the fuel itself , whether produced by cracking natural gas or hydrolyzing water ( consult your freshman chemistry texts ) , represents a horrible energy return on investment .
Some illustrative math :
It takes about 60 kilowatt - hours of electricity to gin a kilogram of hydrogen from water .
The FCX Clarity ’s tank holds about 4 kilograms of H2 and that gives it a range of about 270 miles on 240 kWhs .
The all - electric Tesla Roadster has a 53 - kWh lithium - ion battery and a range of 220 miles .
So the Tesla ’s per-mile costs in electricity are roughly one - quarter what they are in the FCX Clarity .
Should hydrogen partisans care to debate these questions -- and go down like Zeros over the Mariana Islands -- I ’ll meet you on the field on honor .
Calculators at dawn .

If any other company but Honda trotted this thing out , I ’d barf with skepticism .
But Honda is dead earnest about hydrogen , and it is only its relentless , year - after - year improvement in this technology , and the extraordinary treasure Honda throws at it , that makes me think that the company knows something I do n’t -- well , that and the army of PhDs at its command .
Yet as I see it , there are only two reasons to build the car .
First , major manufacturers must begin complying with California ’s mandate that each sell 7,500 zero-emission vehicles between 2012 and 2014 .
Fuel - cell vehicles get extra points in meeting this quota .
Of the 200 FCX Claritys Honda intends to build , it will lease almost all of them in Southern California .
( Interested customers can apply for a lease online at www.fcx . honda.com . )
The carmaker wo n’t say what the program cost for the vehicle is , but I estimate about $ 400 million , which pencils out to $ 2 million per vehicle .
That makes my four - door test car the most valuable automobile I ’ve ever driven by a margin of about one whole Ferrari 430 .
Advertisement
The second reason Honda might have had for building the FCX Clarity : Nothing invested in this project goes to waste .
The car ’s state - of - the - art fuel cell can be amortized in Honda ’s portable power generation division ( the company makes awesome generators ) .
And since a fuel - cell vehicle is essentially an electric vehicle with a hydrogen heart , all the technology -- the glossy aerodynamics ; the powerful , quiet and compact 100 kW ( 134 hp ) electric motor ; the new space - saving coaxial gearbox -- can be rolled into future electric and plug - in electric projects .
Perhaps obscured by questions of practicality and cost is the fact -- and it is a fact -- that the FCX Clarity is the most beautiful car to ever wear the big H on the nose .
It ’s just gorgeous , a big garnet - red teardrop falling from the cheek of the future , a sweet stanza of robot - written poetry .
The reason the FCX Clarity could take such a compelling shape is that it did n’t have to be molded around the big , immovable lumps of a conventional sedan .
There ’s no gas engine up front , so the cabin could extend dramatically forward like a mid-engine car .
The large and steeply raked windshield falls away from the driver , and the roof - supporting A - pillars are exceptionally thin .
The result is a wonderful cab - forward view , a panorama you wo n’t see anywhere else but on the back of a motorcycle .
Likewise , with the small fuel cell stack ( about the size of a desktop PC ) situated between the front seats , and the lithium - ion battery and hydrogen tank stuffed over the rear axle , the car ’s cabin has room to stretch out .
The FCX Clarity is huge on the inside , like Lincoln - Town - Car huge , and the trunk is a spacious 11 cubic feet .
The whole is encapsulated in singlet of wind - swept modernism .
Advertisement
To underscore the car ’s eco-friendly mission , Honda uses petroleum - free resins and bio - based fabrics to construct the interior , and it really is wonderful stuff .
Rich textures abound , including a tasteful wainscoting of walnut on the dash and doors .
God only knows what all this costs .
When I think about all the tooling used to build a mere 200 cars , I feel faint .
The other bewitching thing about the FCX Clarity is the instrument panel .
The 3 - D display centers on an animated ball .
When you are driving efficiently , with gradual acceleration and long coast - downs to recharge the battery , the ball is small and blue and happy .
When you start horsing around , the ball gets big and yellow and angry , as if to say :
You ’re wasting hydrogen , stupid .
Do you even know what hydrogen costs ?
How does the FCX Clarity drive ?
Exactly as you ’d expect an electric Honda Accord to : eerily smooth , flawless in operation , confident and lively .
The whack - bang of an internal - combustion engine , with the myriad second - order vibrations and gear whine , is supplanted by the ghostly murmurings of distant electrons , and so the gestalt of the car is serene , even tranquilizing .
Behold , the grand and lovely futility of the FCX Clarity .
It ’s hard to scold something so wonderful , so I wo n’t .
Just bring me one that I can plug in .

Mahatma Gandhi on !
Palestine written in 1938
The Jews In Palestine
By Mahatma Gandhi
Published in the Harijan
26-11-1938 .
Several letters have been received by me , asking me to declare my views
about the Arab - Jew question in Palestine and the persecution of the Jews in
Germany .
It is not without hesitation that I venture to offer my views on
this very difficult question .
My sympathies are all with the Jews .
I have known them intimately in South
Africa .
Some of them became lifelong companions .
Through these friends I
came to learn much of their age long persecution .
They have been the
untouchables of Christianity .
The parallel between their treatment by
Christians and the treatment of untouchables by Hindus is very close .
Religious sanction has been invoked in both cases for the justification of
the inhuman treatment meted out to them .
Apart from the friendships ,
therefore , there is the more common universal reason for my sympathy for
the Jews .
But my sympathy does not blind me to the requirements of justice .
The cry for the national home for the Jews does not make much appeal to me .
The sanction for it is sought in the Bible and the tenacity with which the Jews
have hankered after return to Palestine .
Why should they not , like other peoples of the earth , make that country
their home where they are born and where they earn their livelihood ?
Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French .
It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs .
What is going on in Palestine today cannot be justified by any moral code of conduct .
The mandates have no sanction but that of the last war .
Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their
national home .
The nobler course would be to insist on a just treatment of
the Jews wherever they are born and bred .
The Jews born in France are French in precisely the same sense that Christians born in France are French .
If the Jews have no home but Palestine , will they relish the idea of being
forced to leave the other parts of the world in which they are settled ?
Or do they want a double home where they can remain at will ?
This cry for the
national home affords a colorable justification for the German expulsion of
the Jews .
But the German persecution of the Jews seems to have no parallel
in history .
The tyrants of old never went so mad as Hitler seems to have
gone .
And he is doing it with religious zeal .
For , he is propounding a new
religion of exclusive and militant nationalism in the name of which any
inhumanity becomes an act of humanity to be rewarded here and hereafter .
The crime of an obviously mad but intrepid youth is being visited upon his
wholerace with unbelievable ferocity .
If there ever could be a justifiable
war in the name of and for humanity , a war against Germany to prevent the
wanton persecution of a whole race , would be completely justified .
But I do
not believe in any war .
A discussion of the pros and cons of such a war is ,
therefore , outside my horizon or province .
But if there can be no war against Germany , even for such a crime as is
being committed against the Jews , surely there can be no alliance with
Germany .
How can there be alliance between a nation , which claims to stand
for justice and democracy and one , which is the declared enemy of both ?
Or
is England drifting towards armed dictatorship and all it means ?
Germany is showing to the world how efficiently violence can be worked when
it is not hampered by any hypocrisy or weakness masquerading as humanitarianism .
It is also showing how hideous , terrible and terrifying it looks in its nakedness .
Can the Jews resist this organized and shameless persecution ?
Is there a way to preserve their self - respect , and not to feel helpless , neglected and forlorn ?
I submit there is .
No person who has faith in a living God need feel helpless or forlorn .
Jehovah of the Jews is a God more personal than the God of the Christians , the Mussalmans or the Hindus , though as a matter of fact , in essence , He is common to all and one without a second and beyond description .
But as the Jews attribute personality to God and believe that He rules every action of theirs , they ought not to feel helpless .
If I were a Jew and were born in Germany and earned my livelihood there , I
would claim Germany as my home even as the tallest gentile German might , and challenge him to shoot me or cast me in the dungeon ; I would refuse to be expelled or to submit to discriminating treatment .
And for doing this I
should not wait for !
the fellow Jews to join me in civil resistance , but
would have confidence that in the end the rest were bound to follow my
example .... ...
And now a word to the Jews in Palestine .
I have no doubt that they are going
about it in the wrong way .
The Palestine of the Biblical conception is not a
geographical tract .
It is in their hearts .
But if they must look to the
Palestine of geography as their national home , it is wrong to enter it under
the shadow of the British gun .
A religious act cannot be performed with the
aid of the bayonet or the bomb .
They can settle in Palestine only by the
goodwill of the Arabs .
They should seek to convert the Arab heart .
The same God rules the Arab heart who rules the Jewish heart ...
They will
find the world opinion in their favor in their religious aspiration .
There are
hundreds of ways of reasoning with the Arabs , if they will only discard the
help of the British bayonet .
As it is , they are co-sharers with the
British in despoiling a people who have done no wrong to them .
I am not
defending the Arab excesses .
I wish they had chosen the way of non-violence
in resisting what they rightly regarded as an unwarrantable encroachment
upon their country .
But according to the accepted canons of right and wrong ,
nothing can be said against the Arab resistance in the face of
overwhelming odds .
Britain will get its first chance to see Barack Obama this week when a White House cavalcade - complete with armoured limousines , helicopters , 200 US secret service staff and a six - doctor medical team - sweeps into the UK .
Obama will fly into London for his first visit to the UK as president of the United States on Tuesday to take part in the G20 summit in the capital 's Docklands area .
He will not be travelling light .
More than 500 officials and staff will accompany the president on his tour this week - along with a mass of high - tech security equipment , including the $ 300,000 presidential limousine , known as The Beast .
Fitted with night - vision camera , reinforced steel plating , tear - gas cannon and oxygen tanks , the vehicle is the ultimate in heavy armoured transport .
In addition , a team from the White House kitchen will travel with the president to prepare his food .
As one official put it : " When the president travels , the White House travels with him , right down to the car he drives , the water he drinks , the gasoline he uses , the food he eats .
America is still the sole superpower and the president must have the ability to handle any crisis , anywhere , any time . "
US security teams have already carried out three visits to prepare for Obama 's first official visit to Britain .
The first was a " site survey " , the second a " pre-advance visit " which was carried out to pick sites that the president would visit .
Finally there was the " advance trip " , which took place last week .
Its purpose was to set up equipment , sweep venues for electronic bugs , test food for poison and measure air quality for bacteria .
Obama will start his first presidential visit to Europe when he steps down from the US presidential jet , Air Force One , at Stansted airport on Tuesday .
The Boeing 747-200B is fitted with its own gym , electronic defence units and shielding to protect its complex communication devices from radiation from nuclear blasts .
Among the officials on the flight will be a military officer carrying America 's nuclear missile launch codes .
Obama will then be flown to central London in a VH - 3D helicopter known as Marine One .
Again , high - tech security will dominate his journey .
Marine
One is fitted with flares that can be fired to confuse heat - seeking missiles and always flies in groups containing several identical decoy helicopters .
While in town , the president will be guarded by more than 200 US secret servicemen - easily identifiable by their shirt - cuff radios and Ray - Ban sunglasses .
Obama has already had some time to get used their attention .
It was decided 18 months ago , when he was still a presidential candidate , that his African - American background put him at particular risk of an assassination attempt and he was provided with his security guards .
And should anything befall the President , a White House medical unit will be at hand to provide emergency care .
The team consists of surgeons , nurses and other medical personnel and carries supplies of blood of the type AB , the president 's blood group .
At the same time , Obama will be constantly minded by his personal aide Reggie Love , who dials his BlackBerry , fetches his jacket and tie and supplies him with snacks .
First Lady Michelle Obama will also have a coterie of assistants , including a secretary , a press officer and several bodyguards .
It is a striking presence and shows that , for the next few days , London , not Washington , will be the beating heart of American foreign policy .
At the end of the week Obama and his massive retinue will head off for meetings in France , Germany and the Czech Republic , although not before he has indulged in an unprecedented whirlwind of diplomatic activity - he and his advisers will not just be involved in complex summit negotiations , but will also be camped out in London conducting a series of individual high - level mini-summits with the most powerful leaders in the world .
Indeed , despite all the heat and fury over this week 's G20 , the most important work might actually emerge from the meetings that Obama and his team have scheduled on the side , far away from the debate over the economic crisis .
In effect , if the G20 were a party with a guest list , then Obama 's series of mini-summits would be a VIP room ; open only to a select few powerful players and conducted firmly behind closed doors .
The schedule is hectic and the subjects are weighty .
On Wednesday , Obama will hold his first bilateral talks with President Hu Jintao of China .
The meeting of America 's first black president at a time of almost unprecedented economic crisis with the leader of the world 's foremost rising power is historic .
It comes at a time when China has been asserting its international role and taking on the US by talking of replacing the dollar as the main international currency and having a recent naval showdown with a US spy ship in the South China Sea .
On the same day , Obama will also meet Russia 's President Dmitry Medvedev , again in the first face - to - face talks between the two .
Subjects up for discussion will include ways to co-operate to limit Iran 's nuclear ambitions and debate over plans for a US missile shield that Russia views as a hostile act .
But that will be just the beginning .
On Thursday , Obama will hold his first personal meeting with India 's prime minister , Manmohan Singh .
Their discussions will be crucial , given the fact that the explosive situation in India 's neighbour , Pakistan , is the most pressing foreign policy concern of Obama 's administration .
Then , just to add another massively complex problem to an already exhaustive list , Obama will hold bilateral talks with the South Korean president , Lee Myung - bak .
That chat comes against the backdrop of an increasingly erratic North Korea , which is threatening to attack the South and is moving to launch a long - range missile which Japan has said it might try to shoot down .
" He does have a huge amount of challenges to try to tackle , " said Larry Haas , a political commentator and former aide in the Clinton White House .
That is putting it mildly .
But Obama is far from alone in dealing with his intense schedule .
At his London " diplomatic base camp " will be an array of the best and the brightest from his new administration .
Chief among them will be former rival Hillary Clinton , now secretary of state and the public face of American diplomacy .
His famously combative chief of staff , Rahm Emanuel , will also be travelling to London on Air Force One .
Obama 's economic team includes Larry Summers , head of the National Economic Council , and Christina Romer , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers .
The reasoning behind Obama 's sudden flurry of international diplomacy is complex and only partly explained by the number of thorny problems in need of attention .
In fact , Obama is cramming so much diplomacy into such a short time because so far his concerns have all been domestic .
" Even when his attention has to be focused on foreign policy , his mind is still bound to be on the thing that really matters : the American economy , " said Haas .
Indeed Obama has been so consumed by efforts to stop and then solve America 's domestic woes that the White House has barely had time to put its mind to international affairs .
The London meetings offer a rare opportunity to do just that in a highly compressed time frame .
" This is his time to make his pitch to world leaders , " said Christian Weller , a senior fellow at the Centre for American Progress .
It also offers a brief break from dealing with domestic woes , where Obama 's popularity has been slipping slightly in the face of the scandal over AIG bonuses and political splits over his huge proposed budget .
Holding high - powered meetings with world leaders will allow Obama to remind Americans how much the rest of the world still admires him .
It will also be good for the leaders who meet him as they play to domestic audiences .
" Personally , I think every one of those leaders wants to sit down and get a photo opportunity with Obama , " said Dan Mitchell , a senior fellow at the Cato Institute .
" The mere fact that he is the new president has still got something special about it abroad . "
The entourage
Apart from the 200 secret service personnel who will follow Obama on his European tour , the president 's entourage will also include representatives of the White House Military Office , the White House Transportation Agency , the White House Medical Unit , the Marine Corps Helicopter Squadron , the State Department Presidential Travel Support Service , the US Information Agency , the Immigration and Naturalisation Service and the Customs Service .
In addition , there will be staff from the White House kitchen ready to turn out a quick burger should the president suddenly feel peckish .
Michelle Obama will have eight of her own staff , including a secretary , a press officer and bodyguards .
And Obama 's personal aide Reggie Love - called by the president " the kid brother I never had " - will be at hand to provide pens , Nicorette gum , throat lozenges , tea or even aspirins .
The Beast
With its armour - plated body and doors , a raised roof , and reinforced steel and aluminium , The Beast will be Obama 's official car .
It boasts a titanium and ceramic superstructure and a sealed interior forming a " panic room " capable of shielding him from even a chemical weapons attack .
Equipped with a night - vision camera and an armoured petrol tank filled with foam to prevent explosion should it suffer a direct hit , it also has pump- action shotguns , tear - gas cannon , oxygen tanks and bottles of the president 's blood .
Its tyres allow it to keep driving even if they have been punctured .
Marine One
Obama will be ferried from Stansted to the US ambassador 's residence in Regent 's Park , London , in a VH - 3D helicopter .
For security reasons , helicopters are now preferred to motorcades , which are also dearer and more difficult to organise .
Much of the current fleet of 19 presidential helicopters was built in the 1970s and after 11 September 2001 , when it was decided faster and safer helicopters were needed .
But last month Obama said his current presidential helicopter was " perfectly adequate " , a clear sign he is ready to cancel a multibillion - pound contract to replace it .
Air Force One
Using the most famous air traffic control call sign of any US aircraft , Air Force One , the president will arrive in his customised Boeing 747-200B series aircraft .
Beyond its armoured glass in all windows , Obama will have dined in the presidential suite and could even have worked out in his personal gym and taken a shower .
The aircraft has been designed with security as its priority and is equipped with armour - plated wings capable of withstanding a nuclear blast from the ground , flares to confuse enemy missiles and electric defence systems able to jam enemy radar .
Mirror - ball technology in the wings is able to scramble infra-red guidance systems .
More than 200 miles of wiring are specially shielded from electromagnetic interference caused by a nuclear attack .
Should the president feel the need to retaliate offensively , Obama is able to launch a nuclear strike while flying .
The aircraft , among the most photographed in the world , has 85 telephones , 19 televisions , computer suites and faxes to ensure Obama stays in touch with the outside world .
At the rear of the aircraft is Obama 's travelling press corps .
Secret Service
More than 200 Secret Service staff will protect the president during the trip , instantly recognisable by their dark business suits , sunglasses and communication earpieces .
John F Kennedy , Ronald Reagan and George W Bush were attacked while appearing in public .
Kennedy was killed and Reagan seriously injured , while Bush survived when a hand grenade thrown towards his podium failed to detonate .
Secret Service personnel have made three missions to the UK during which they have swept venues for bugging devices , tested food for contamination and measured air quality for bacteria .
Obama was offered bodyguards over a year ago following concern that his African - American roots made him a target .
• The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the record column , Sunday 5 April 2009 .
Above we said representatives of " the Immigration and Naturalisation Service " ( INS ) and " the US Information Agency " ( USIA ) would accompany President Obama on his European tour .
The USIA was closed in October 1999 when its information functions were incorporated into the State Department and its broadcasting services consolidated into the Broadcasting Board of Governors .
The INS ceased to exist in March 2003 with most of its functions transferring to the Department of Homeland Security .

Walter Breuning of Great Falls , Montana , is the oldest living man in the US .
He just turned 112 .
( Women live longer , as we all know ; Gertrude Baines , an African American woman , is 114 . )
One hundred and twelve years on this earth : it is a staggering , an almost biblical , figure .
Walter Breuning was born in 1896 .
This was the year of the first modern Olympics , held in Athens , Greece ; he has lived to see them held in Beijing , China .
Mr. Breuning was also born the same year that the US Supreme Court ( in Plessy v. Ferguson ) established the principle that “ separate but equal ” facilities were compatible with our Constitutional commitments , thereby legitimating racial segregation in this country for more than fifty years ; he has lived to see the election of the first African American to the highest office in the land .
Mr. Breuning was born in the year that William McKinley narrowly defeated William Jennings Bryan in one of the more dramatic and contentious presidential campaigns in modern US history ; he has lived long enough to witness elections of sufficient closeness and contentiousness that they , too , ended up in the Supreme Court , hanging chads and all .
Mr. Breuning has lived through three Congressional declarations of war and more “ police actions ” than any of us can properly count or recall .
The Soviet Union was born and died during his lifetime .
Automobiles did not exist when he was born , yet he has seen men walk on the moon and spacecraft sent beyond our solar system .
The first short two - minute film sequences were screened in Paris in the year of his birth ; he could now call up YouTube sequences many times that length on a laptop computer or iTouch .
It is a different world .
One Hundred and Twelve Years
Mr. Breuning was interviewed by PBS reporters on Monday , and his remarkably engaging and self - effacing personality reminded me of another aspect of the national character that has been far too absent from contemporary rhetoric of late : graciousness , humility , and best of all , gentleness .
Here is a true gentle - man .
Perhaps anyone who lives to the ripe old age of one hundred and twelve with his intellectual and spiritual faculties intact is destined to achieve a certain level of Buddha - soul , but the suppleness and simplicity of Mr. Breuning ’s ruminations on life and the world were moving past measure .
In a time when one scarcely dares to turn on the television if one is not already prepared for catastrophic news , this interview offered more than a beacon of hope ; it was a quiet call to moral arms , a reminder of the ways in which the character of the citizenry contributes directly to the ethical health of the republic .
The cumulative weight of Mr. Breuning ’s simple answers spoke to the importance of the subtle ability to extract the ego from places , and from controversies , where it does not belong .
The car stuck in traffic is not in my way ; I simply perceive it that way .
This person who is so aggravating , at school , in the supermarket , in the casual street - corner encounter , this person is not someone offering frustrating resistance to me and my plans ; this is a person , a person in his or her own right , one whose needs and value and personhood equal , where they do not exceed , my own .
Mr. Breuning was asked , predictably , what the secret to living this long was .
With equal predictability , he said there was no secret .
But what he said next was interesting , and altogether unexpected from a 112 - year - old man living in the depths of a dark Montana winter in a nursing home .
He reminded us that none of us know how much time we ’ve got .
Accidents are the ethical substance of every human life , some far more devastating than others .
“ Nothing ’s certain in this life , ” he said .
But what he said next was especially endearing : “ And that ’s why I like changes . ”
The world does nothing but change ; that was a recurrent refrain in his quiet reflections .
To remain open to such change , to maintain the childlike spirit of egoless abandon and wonder that perhaps , just perhaps , promotes the soulful elasticity necessary to survive in this world for well over a century .
The talk turned — again , predictably enough — to the current economic downturn .
Mr. Breuning was asked how this compared to the Great Depression .
There is no comparison , he opined .
No one today can imagine the situation then .
His face turned uncharacteristically serious as he described the situation then .
Multiple families were reduced to living in a single apartment , a home in which perhaps only a single person was working to support them all .
Mr. Breuning was fortunate enough to work for the railroad at the time , but he and all his fellow workers , in order not to be laid off , saw a 10 percent reduction in their salary , a wicked salary cut that was not restored for more than a decade .
I was uncertain whether his descriptions of the Great Depression were designed to give me hope that we are nowhere near that yet , or dread of what ’s clearly still to come .
It was the last exchange that caught me up short , and made me look again at this serene face , the earnest gaze , and the thoughtful eyes , gleaming behind thick glass frames .
There was something in this face that knew , knew something most of us simply have n’t lived nearly long enough to get to .
“ How would you counsel future generations to be a part of their country ? ” he was asked .
His reply was instantaneous , and even lovelier for being so .
Everybody learns from life what ’s going on .
And if they pay attention to everything that people do , especially helping people , that ’s one big thing .
A lot of people think they ’re born for themselves ; I do n’t think that .
I believe that we ’re here to help other people all the way through .
“ A lot of people think they ’re born for themselves . ”
Is this perhaps what Mr. Breuning sees as the central issue facing us in this difficult time ?
Is it the subtle selfishness of our questions ?
How can I live as long as you ?
By not being so attached to living long .
Accept change .
How can I find peace in this time of turmoil ?
By recognizing with Edgar ( in King Lear ) that “ worse I may be yet .
The worst is not / so long as we can say , ‘ This is the worst . ’ ”
How can I achieve serenity , and enlightenment ?
By ceasing to desire it for yourself .
The image of people taking up meditation and other spiritual techniques because they want be enlightened tells the tale .
Approached this way , we never quite see the central point , that so long as I am the desiring one , even if it is enlightenment that I am desiring , then I will never achieve it .
Enlightenment is achieved to reduce the suffering of all sentient creatures , not mine .
That ’s central to the Buddha - mind .
And central , so suggests this remarkably thoughtful 112 - year - old , to the character of a citizenry in the republic ’s time of trial .
“ I believe that we ’re here to help other people all the way through . ”

Only Beer Drinkers Would Understand
In Amsterdam , a world wide convention of brewers was held .
The presidents of many of the world 's greatest breweries were on hand , and many of them decided to go out for dinner together on the first evening .
The waiter asked what they would like to drink , and the CEO of Miller said , " The Best Beer in the world , an MGD please ! "
The president of Budweiser asked for " The King of Beers , make it a Bud ! " .
Adolph Coors requested a " From mountain spring water , the clearest beer , a Coors if you do n't mind . "
And so it went around the large table , each president asking for the brew from his own company as if it was the best .
Finally , the waiter came to Arthur Guinness .
" And you sir ? " he queried .
" I 'll have a Coke ! " was Guinness 's reply .
" A Coke ??!? "
The waiter was shocked .
" Would n't you rather have a Guinness , sir ? "
Arthur looked at the waiter , and gestured to his companions .
" Well , " he said , " If they 're not drinking beer , then neither will I ! "

Commenter Burninator discovered that you do n't even need the .desktop ending in the attachment .
The Gnome and KDE desktops actually read the file , and do n't base their decision to special - case the file on the file - name extension !
So , the critical meta data here ( make this something that can be executed ) is NOT encoded in the filename , as some have suggested , it is actually derived by reading the first line of the file contents .
So , in that respect the desktop environments are not quite as hapless as some had indicated and are not just making the same mistake as Windows has .
On the flip - side of that same discovery :
You can make your attachment now even less suspicious looking .
Rather than naming it something like some_text .odt. desktop , you only need to name it some_text .
That has two nice side effects :
Firstly , email clients will now never know what to do with the file ( no useful extension ) and are more likely to prompt the user to save the file to disk .
Thus , you do n't need to get the user to explicitly do that anymore by putting proper wording in your email .
The user will be more or less prompted to do that automatically by the email client .
Secondly , there is now no suspicious file - name ending .
If the Name line in the launcher description file still specifies something like Name=some_text.odt then Gnome at least will actually show THAT as the name of the file , rather than the actual file name on disk .
However , KDE will just show some_text , which is the actual file name .
KDE will only display some_text.odt after the .desktop suffix has been added .
Nevertheless , even in KDE the some_text file remains ' executable ' by clicking on it .
So , while on KDE the user may look at a file without a proper file extension on the desktop , the name and icon can still look convincing and the email attachment did n't have a suspicious suffix .
That , combined with the email client now automatically prompting for it to be saved makes this a good strategy :
No .desktop suffix in the actual name of the attachment .
One more thing about the naming of the file :
You cannot just name the file some_text.odt , since then the filename extension ( .odt in this example ) takes precedence .
The desktop will call OpenOffice if that 's your word processor , based on the extension .
Only if there is no extension ( or the extension is .desktop ? ) will the content of the file be taken into account .
Someone pointed out that the trick wo n't work under KDE when the attachment is not saved on the desktop : KDE only treats launcher files in a special way when they are actually on the desktop .
So , if an email client saves the launcher in another location ( for example a ~ / Downloads directory ) then this would n't work .
Well , I can only partially confirm this !
When I move the launcher into a different directory the exploit still works all the same .
However , the .desktop suffix becomes visible !
This is yet another reason to just drop the .desktop file - name extension altogether .
The editor over at LWM .
net pointed out here that the vulnerability of . desktop files was discussed back in 2006 already .
I would have been surprised if I were the first person to think of this , frankly .
Several commenters felt the need to point out the technical distinction between a virus , a worm and malware .
They pointed out that what I described is just a worm or malware ( they could n't agree ) .
Well , look , I have been in the security industry long enough to know about the technical distinction , about which most people do n't care anymore .
As I mentioned in some responses to those comments :
The popular press and indiscriminating coverage of the topic has completely blurred the line .
Besides , I gave code for automatically spreading of the malware in high - level pseudo code : ... it can start to pilfer through the user 's address book to harvest email addresses ... [ and ] ... can spread itself by email .
So , get over it !
I do n't need to spell out everything in Python code for you , right ?
You can read pseudo - code , right ? :-)
Commenter David F. Skoll suggests that rather than special - casing those launcher files , the first line should merely be something like this :#!/usr/bin/desktop-launch , with the rest of the script following afterwards .
With the execute bit set this would become merely a normal script , which is interpreted by the specified separate ' shell ' or utility , rather than something integrated into the desktop environment .
Very * nix - ish .
I like it .
Many people commented on issues or possible problems with the suggested means of obtaining root privileges .
I can only point out again :
As the article stated , the gaining of root is NOT necessary to successfully infect a system .
That 's why this was in an appendix .
It is not the main point of the article .
A few commenters complained that I was n't talking about anything new .
That with social engineering you can get users to do even complex things like , download an executable , set execute bit and then run it .
Some even say that all you need to do is send an email to a user :
Please type ' sudo rm - rf /' in your terminal and that would have the same effect .
My gosh , how dense are those commenters ?
These kinds of comments completely miss the point .
The necessity of the execute bit for normal execution is a big and useful security feature of * nix OSs , such as Linux .
Non-technical users probably do n't know how to do that !
Non-technical users also do n't know how to open a terminal .
Why do I have to explain this over and over ?
This is some of the typical , damaging arrogance of some Linux users that is at display here .
So , anything that can take ' difficult ' extra steps off the chain of events towards a successful infection greatly increases its chances .
That 's what this article was about :
How to infect a user who just knows how to click with the mouse and has never heard of permissions or execute flags before .
If he had , he probably would n't fall for this anyway .
Other people are talking about how the average Linux user is more technical than the average Windows user .
Look , all I can say is :
Go read the article .
I talk about that , you know ?
Do n't comment on my article until you have read the whole thing , not just the summary .
That 's annoying and wastes everyone 's time .
Geez ...
Yesterday I published an article about How to write a Linux virus in 5 easy steps .
There has been quite an overwhelming response for this .
Within just a few hours this article became my most visited blog post ever .
Wow !
Just goes to show that either the article hit a real nerve , or the other articles on my blog are just really boring .
:-)
Anyway , a lot of interesting feedback arrived , some of which tthrough the comments on Reddit , some in the comment section of my article , some by email and others yet on different forums .
I just want to take a moment to summarise some interesting points :
So , there .
That was a small follow up on the feedback and comments about my '
How to write a Linux virus in 5 easy steps '.

One of my favorite aspects of Python is that it makes practicing TDD very easy .
What makes it so frictionless is the doctest module .
It allows you to write a test at the same time you define a function .
No setup , no boilerplate , just write a function call and the expected output in the docstring .
Here ’s a quick example of a fibonacci function .
def fib(n ) : ''' Return the nth fibonacci number . >>> fib(0 ) 0 >>> fib (1 ) 1 >>> fib ( 2 ) 1 >>> fib( 3 ) 2 >>> fib ( 4 ) 3 ''' if n == 0 : return 0 elif n == 1 : return 1 else : return fib(n - 1 ) + fib(n - 2 )
If you want to run your doctests , just add the following three lines to the bottom of your module .
if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : import doctest doctest.testmod ()
Now you can run your module to run the doctests , like python fib.py .
So how well does this fit in with the TDD philosophy ?
Here ’s the basic TDD practices .
Think about what you want to test Write a small test Write just enough code to fail the test Run the test and watch it fail Write just enough code to pass the test Run the test and watch it pass ( if it fails , go back to step 4 )
Go back to step 1 and repeat until done
And now a step - by - step breakdown of how to do this with doctests , in excruciating detail .
1. Define a new empty method
def fib(n ) : ''' Return the nth fibonacci number .''' pass if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : import doctest doctest.testmod ()
2. Write a doctest
def fib(n ) : ''' Return the nth fibonacci number . >>> fib(0 ) 0 ' '' pass
3 . Run the module and watch the doctest fail
python fib .py **********************************************************************
File " fib1.py " , line 3 , in __main__.fib
Failed example : fib(0 ) Expected : 0 Got nothing **********************************************************************
1 items had failures : 1 of 1 in __main__.fib *** Test Failed *** 1 failures .
4 . Write just enough code to pass the failing doctest
def fib(n ) : ''' Return the nth fibonacci number . >>> fib(0 ) 0 ' '' return 0
5 . Run the module and watch the doctest pass
python fib.py
6 . Go back to step 2 and repeat
Now you can start filling in the rest of function , one test at time .
In practice , you may not write code exactly like this , but the point is that doctests provide a really easy way to test your code as you write it .
Unit Tests
Ok , so doctests are great for simple tests .
But what if your tests need to be a bit more complex ?
Maybe you need some external data , or mock objects .
In that case , you ’ll be better off with more traditional unit tests .
But first , take a little time to see if you can decompose your code into a set of smaller functions that can be tested individually .
I find that code that is easier to test is also easier to understand .
Running Tests
For running my tests , I use nose .
I have a tests / directory with a simple configuration file , nose.cfg
[ nosetests ] verbosity=3 with - doctest=1
Then in my Makefile , I add a test command so I can run make test .
test : @nosetests --config=tests/nose.cfg tests PACKAGE1 PACKAGE2
PACKAGE1 and PACKAGE2 are optional paths to your code .
They could point to unit test packages and / or production code containing doctests .
And finally , if you ’re looking for a continuous integration server , try Buildbot .
Like other large faith groups , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints sometimes finds itself on the receiving end of attention from Hollywood or Broadway , television series or books , and the news media .
Sometimes depictions of the Church and its people are quite accurate .
Sometimes the images are false or play to stereotypes .
Occasionally , they are in appallingly bad taste .
As Catholics , Jews and Muslims have known for centuries , such attention is inevitable once an institution or faith group reaches a size or prominence sufficient to attract notice .
Yet Latter - day Saints – sometimes known as Mormons - still wonder whether and how they should respond when news or entertainment media insensitively trivialize or misrepresent sacred beliefs or practices .
Church members are about to face that question again .
Before the first season of the HBO series Big Love aired more than two years ago , the show ’s creators and HBO executives assured the Church that the series would n’t be about Mormons .
However , Internet references to Big Love indicate that more and more Mormon themes are now being woven into the show and that the characters are often unsympathetic figures who come across as narrow and self - righteous .
And according to TV Guide , it now seems the show ’s writers are to depict what they understand to be sacred temple ceremonies .
Certainly Church members are offended when their most sacred practices are misrepresented or presented without context or understanding .
Last week some Church members began e-mail chains calling for cancellations of subscriptions to AOL , which , like HBO , is owned by Time Warner .
Certainly such a boycott by hundreds of thousands of computer - savvy Latter - day Saints could have an economic impact on the company .
Individual Latter - day Saints have the right to take such actions if they choose .
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints as an institution does not call for boycotts .
Such a step would simply generate the kind of controversy that the media loves and in the end would increase audiences for the series .
As Elder M. Russell Ballard and Elder Robert D. Hales of the Council of the Twelve Apostles have both said recently , when expressing themselves in the public arena , Latter - day Saints should conduct themselves with dignity and thoughtfulness .
Not only is this the model that Jesus Christ taught and demonstrated in his own life , but it also reflects the reality of the strength and maturity of Church members today .
As someone recently said , “ This is n’t 1830 , and there are n’t just six of us anymore . ”
In other words , with a global membership of thirteen and a half million there is no need to feel defensive when the Church is moving forward so rapidly .
The Church ’s strength is in its faithful members in 170 - plus countries , and there is no evidence that extreme misrepresentations in the media that appeal only to a narrow audience have any long - term negative effect on the Church .
Examples :
During the Mitt Romney election campaign for the presidency of the United States , commentator Lawrence O’Donnell hurled abuse at the Church in a television moment that became known among many Church members as “ the O’Donnell rant . ”
Today , his statements are remembered only as a testament to intolerance and ignorance .
They had no effect on the Church that can be measured .
When the comedy writers for South Park produced a gross portrayal of Church history , individual Church members no doubt felt uncomfortable .
But once again it inflicted no perceptible or lasting damage to a church that is growing by at least a quarter of a million new members every year .
produced a gross portrayal of Church history , individual Church members no doubt felt uncomfortable .
But once again it inflicted no perceptible or lasting damage to a church that is growing by at least a quarter of a million new members every year .
When an independent film company produced a grossly distorted version of the Mountain Meadows Massacre two years ago , the Church ignored it .
Perhaps partly as a result of that refusal to engender the controversy that the producers hoped for , the movie flopped at the box office and lost millions .
In recent months , some gay activists have barraged the media with accusations about “ hateful ” attitudes of Latter - day Saints in supporting Proposition 8 in California , which maintained the traditional definition of marriage .
They even organized a protest march around the Salt Lake Temple .
Again , the Church has refused to be goaded into a Mormons versus gays battle and has simply stated its position in tones that are reasonable and respectful .
Meanwhile , missionary work and Church members in California remain as robust and vibrant as ever , and support for the Church has come from many unexpected quarters — including some former critics and other churches .
Now comes another series of Big Love , and despite earlier assurances from HBO it once again blurs the distinctions between The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints and the show ’s fictional non-Mormon characters and their practices .
Such things say much more about the insensitivities of writers , producers and TV executives than they say about Latter - day Saints .
If the Church allowed critics and opponents to choose the ground on which its battles are fought , it would risk being distracted from the focus and mission it has pursued successfully for nearly 180 years .
Instead , the Church itself will determine its own course as it continues to preach the restored gospel of Jesus Christ throughout the world .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Calls increased Tuesday to reveal the financial institutions that got almost $ 40 billion in collateral from American International Group shortly after the government first bailed out the insurer last year .
AIG AIG , - 1.23 % almost collapsed in September after ratings agency downgrades triggered demands for billions of dollars in extra collateral from firms that had bought derivative - based protection from the insurer on complex mortgage - related products known as collateralized debt obligations , or CDOs .
AIG did n't have that much money and faced bankruptcy .
But it was saved by an $ 85 billion emergency loan facility from the Federal Reserve .
By Nov. 5 , the insurer had paid out $ 37.3 billion of that money to counterparties who had purchased a certain type of derivative - based protection from AIG called multi-sector credit - default swaps , according to the company 's third - quarter regulatory filing .
Since then , AIG and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have unwound most of these contracts .
To do this , they offered to buy the CDOs that were originally insured by the agreements .
The counterparties sold these assets at a discount , but were compensated in full in return for allowing AIG to extricate itself from the obligations .
The counterparties also got to keep the $ 37.3 billion in collateral , according to The Wall Street Journal .
The counterparties have never been disclosed publicly .
However , banks that sought and received collateral from AIG included Goldman Sachs GS , - 1.14 % , Merrill Lynch , UBS AG UBS , - 0.54 % and Deutsche Bank AG DB , - 1.89 % , The Wall Street Journal said in November .
Now that the government 's bailout of AIG has ballooned to more than $ 160 billion , some politicians want to know which financial institutions benefited from taxpayer support provided to the insurer .
" AIG has given the counterparties $ 20 billion .
Those people could be just about anybody in the world .
Why wo n't the Fed disclose who those are ? "
Sen. Ron Wyden , D - Ore. , asked Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke during congressional testimony on Tuesday .
Bernanke said the counterparties made " legal , legitimate , financial transactions " with AIG and presumed at the time that the contracts would remain private .
" That is a consideration we have to take into account , " he added .
Sen. Mark Warner , D - Va. , suggested that AIG 's counterparties should have to take a " haircut , " rather than be made whole , because some of them probably did n't do enough due diligence on whether the insurer was financially strong enough to be selling such protection .
" In effect , what we 're saying is , consequently , folks who bought these instruments and that , at some point in their process , should have been doing some level of credit analysis of what AIG was selling who did n't do that credit analysis are going to still come out whole for their lack of appropriate due diligence or responsible behavior , " he said .
" I'm as unhappy as you are about that , senator , " Bernanke replied .
" I just do n't know what to do about it . "
Full disclosure of all AIG 's CDS counterparties is n't needed , but the major counterparties that benefited from government support of the insurer should be disclosed and a fee should be assessed " for the benefit their shareholders received from the U.S. taxpayer , " Joshua Rosner , a managing director at research firm Graham Fisher & Co. , said Tuesday .
" If the government 's AIG support provided protection to Goldman to the tune of $ 20 to $ 25 billion , then should n't they pay the taxpayer something for the utility expense of that protection ? " he added .
Goldman has said several times that its exposure to AIG is n't material and is offset by collateral and hedges .
A spokesman for the firm reiterated that on Tuesday , but declined to comment further .
An AIG spokeswoman said Tuesday that the insurer has n't disclosed its major CDS counterparties and that the information is confidential .
The insurer 's portfolio of credit default swaps was still notionally worth $ 302.2 billion at the end of 2008 , despite government - supported efforts to aggressively unwind it during the fourth quarter .
AIG estimated Monday that another downgrade by ratings agencies would trigger $ 8 billion in collateral and termination payments to counterparties on these contracts .
Some of AIG 's CDS give counterparties another right to terminate the contracts if the insurer 's ratings fall to BBB or Baa2 .
The notional value of these derivatives was more than $ 38 billion at the end of 2008 .

The deepening economic recession has n't stopped members of Congress from throwing lavish events to raise campaign money for the 2010 election .
This weekend , donors to a political action committee run by Rep. Jeb Hensarling are invited to the Snake River Lodge & Spa near Jackson Hole , Wyo. , for a ski outing hosted by the Texas Republican .
The minimum donation : $ 2,500 , according to the invitation , which touts opportunities to take sleigh rides to an elk refuge and snowmobile excursions to the Continental Divide .
Skiing also is on the agenda at a fundraiser this weekend in Vail , Colo. , for Democrat Ed Perlmutter .
Donations range from $ 2,400 for an individual to $ 5,000 for a political action committee .
Donors seeking warmer climes could have joined veteran Democratic Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii for a " Weekend of Aloha " fundraiser at a resort on Honolulu 's Waikiki Beach .
Inouye 's event , held last weekend , started two days after lawmakers passed President Obama 's $ 787 billion plan aimed at jump - starting the economy .
Lawmakers are on a week - long break and return Monday .
" Everyone is tightening their belts , but lawmakers are doing what they have always done : holding fundraisers in exotic locales , " said Nancy Watzman , who tracks political fundraising events for the watchdog group Sunlight Foundation .
" This is the kind of thing that 's out of reach to most people , and it 's pretty much hidden from the public . "
Aides to the lawmakers said the events are driven by the need to raise growing amounts of campaign money .
House and Senate candidates raised nearly $ 1.4 billion to fund campaigns in 2008 , up from roughly $ 1 billion eight years earlier , according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics .
" Almost every member of Congress is fundraising all the time , " said Julie DeWoody , the finance director of Perlmutter 's campaign .
" It 's the reality of running for office and how expensive campaigns are . "
Perlmutter , a Colorado congressman in his second term , opted to host the ski weekend to give " supporters a different way to interact with him and have fun , " DeWoody said .
She would not say who planned to attend .
Hensarling 's fundraising event supports his political action committee — Jobs , Economy and Budget Fund , also known as JEB Fund .
Hensarling aide Dee Buchanan said in an e-mail that the money goes to " conservative candidates who believe in limited government and unlimited opportunity . "
Buchanan did not respond to questions about fundraising goals and who was expected to attend the event .
It was scheduled to begin Thursday night and run through the weekend .
Inouye , chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee , raised about $ 100,000 at last weekend 's event at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort & Spa , according to Helen Milby , his fundraiser .
It was held in Hawaii so Inouye could raise money and carry out constituent work in his home state , she said .
It also " was a great way for people to support tourism in Hawaii , " she added .
About 20 donors , who each raised or gave $ 5,000 , and their spouses came from Washington .
" Some were lobbyists ; some were not , " Milby said .
She said Inouye would " never " allow contributions from special interests to influence his policymaking .
" He 's a great American , and he does what 's right for the country all of the time , " she said .
" That 's his benchmark . "
Ethics rules approved in 2007 bar members of Congress from accepting most gifts , trips and expensive meals from lobbyists and organizations that employ them , but did not impose restrictions on campaign activity .
" The same person who ca n't buy a meal for a senator can go to the fundraiser , have a nice meal … and give contributions , " said Stephen Weissman , of the Campaign Finance Institute .
" This is a real problem . "
The posh venues are n't restricted to fundraising events , either .
Earlier this month , House Democrats held their annual retreat at Kingsmill Resort & Spa near Williamsburg , Va. House Republicans headed to The Homestead , a mountain resort and spa in Hot Springs , Va. , for their policy retreat .
The lawmakers used campaign funds to pay their expenses .
But the non-profit Congressional Institute helped underwrite staff travel and overhead expenses for the Republican gathering , said Matt Lloyd , a spokesman for the House Republican Conference .
He confirmed that participants included lobbyists who help fund the institute , which hosts seminars for lawmakers and conducts public policy research .
The getaway was approved by the House Ethics Committee , he said .

Britain 's days as the fastest growing economy in Europe were officially declared over yesterday as the deepest recession in a generation saw consumers turning off the lights and Poles returning home .
While official figures showed the economy contracting at its fastest since 1980 , National Grid said demand for electricity had fallen over Christmas at homes and factories across the land , and Poland confirmed that thousands of its citizens were coming home from Britain and Ireland .
National Grid said it was cutting its forecast for electricity consumption this year because of the recession .
The thousands of people being laid off each week and the hundreds of firms cutting production are reducing demand .
Industry has suffered most in this recession and made the biggest contribution to the slump in national output , which fell by a worse - than - expected 1.5 % in the fourth quarter of last year compared to the third - or around 6 % on an annualised basis .
As the economy had contracted by 0.6 % in the July to September period , Britain now meets the most common definition of a recession - two consecutive quarters of shrinkage .
But some analysts say the country fell into recession last April .
Financial markets took fright at the sheer speed of the economy 's contraction , which outpaced anything seen in the recession of the early 1990s .
The pound slumped to a fresh , 23 - year low against the dollar of just $ 1.35 - a far cry from the peak of $ 2.11 seen last summer - and to an all - time low against the yen .
The FTSE 100 share index fell below the key 4,000 level after the news , although it later recovered to end little changed .
" These figures are the final nail in the coffin for Gordon Brown 's claim to have ' ended boom and bust ' .
The UK economy is most definitely bust at the moment , " said Charles Davis at the Centre for Economics and Business Research .
" It is not just that the UK has entered recession ; it is the size of the contraction ...
The economy is set for the steepest contraction in the post - war era in 2009 . "
Brown admitted the government had not seen what was coming : " What we did not see , nobody saw , was the possibility of markets ' failure .
" We are fighting this global recession with every weapon at our disposal .
We need other countries to work with us and we are asking them to agree with us a common set of measures . "
He criticised David Cameron for having suggested Britain might need to go to the IMF for help in financing its bail - out of the creaking banking system .
But Cameron insisted he was right to warn that the country faced the prospect of an IMF loan for the first time since 1976 .
" I think it 's right to warn about that , I think it 's a responsible thing to do , " Cameron said .
He and the shadow chancellor , George Osborne , mocked Brown 's claims last summer that the economy was better placed than in the past to withstand recession and would grow in spite of the credit crunch .
But TUC chief Brendan Barber blamed bankers and previous Tory governments for the economic mess : " This recession is not bad luck or an inevitable swing of the pendulum .
Its cause is irresponsible behaviour by banks and financial institutions taking advantage of the deregulation started by Mrs Thatcher and president Reagan , and continued to a greater or lesser extent ever since . "
Unemployment was this week reported to have jumped to nearly two million , and analysts say it would be much higher were it not for workers from countries such as Poland returning home .
Poland 's treasury minister Aleksander Grad told the Guardian that the economy there , unlike Britain's , would avoid recession .
Poland 's banks had been regulated tightly and had not got into the toxic derivative products that have brought down banks around the world , said Grad .
National Grid said weekly peak electricity demand would fall by 600 - 1,000 megawatts , the equivalent of a large power plant , over the next year .
The drop will ease the strain on power stations , some of which are facing closure because of age or environmental rules .
It will also reduce CO² emissions .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Former Gov.
Tom Vilsack of Iowa told senators on Wednesday he will promote renewable energy like biofuels and work for “ more nutritious food produced in a sustainable way , ” if confirmed as U.S. agriculture secretary .
Steve MacDougall loads biofuel made from refined soybean oil into his Mass Biofuel truck in Needham , Massachusetts before delivering it to homes in this November 12 , 2007 file photo .

During a confirmation hearing , Vilsack said the Agriculture Department ’s child nutrition programs , which spend $ 15 billion a year , could be a tool for ending childhood hunger by 2015 , a goal set by President - elect Barack Obama .
“ It ’s a challenge we should take seriously , ” Vilsack said , adding , “ We are a powerful and rich country and none of us should be satisfied there are children going to bed hungry . ”
Vilsack was on track for Senate confirmation on Tuesday , the same day Obama takes office , Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin , an Iowa Democrat , said as the hearing ended .
At several points , Vilsack said he would use Agriculture Department programs to encourage production of biofuels and to bring to market new feedstocks .
Corn - based ethanol is currently the dominant biofuel in the United States .
Cellulose , found in grasses and wood , is being developed as the next major alternative fuel source .
“ This is an industry that is in some difficulty , ” Vilsack said , referring to hard times for ethanol distillers due to the U.S. recession and less demand for fuel .
“ Margins are quite small , even for the best producers . ”
Under a 2008 law , USDA can offer loan guarantees for plants producing new - generation fuels , help plants expand output and share the cost with farmers who experiment with biomass crops .
USDA also can support research on biofuels .
“ It ’s important for us to realize it ’s not just corn , and not just the Midwest , that can benefit , ” he said .
Ethanol production is centered in the Corn Belt .
Besides biofuels , Vilsack supported wind , solar and geothermal energy .
Iowa Republican Charles Grassley and North Dakota Democrat Byron Dorgan said they wanted USDA to set stricter eligibility rules for farm subsidies than proposed in a pending USDA regulation .
“ Payment limits are going to be at the top of my agricultural agenda , ” Grassley told Vilsack ,
Obama backed a $ 250,000 - a- year “ hard ” cap on subsidies during the presidential campaign “ so we help family farmers ” and closing loopholes that allow “ megafarms to get around payment limits . ”
Georgia Republican Saxby Chambliss and Arkansas Democrat Blanch Lincoln warned Vilsack against writing unfair regulations .
They cited how Congress overrode USDA on the “ 10 - acre rule ” that would have barred supports to small farmers .
The Southerners also have complained USDA was over - zealous on crop subsidy restrictions .
Also during the hearing , Vilsack said :
-- he would “ leverage the financial commitment of the stimulus bill ” being developed by the Obama administration to boost economic growth in rural America .
-- supported a “ robust farm safety net . ”
-- would “ help families that struggle to make ends meet put food on the table . ”
-- would “ work with those who seek programs and practices that lead to more nutritious food produced in a sustainable way . ”
He said : “ The health care crisis aligns squarely with the need to promote better nutrition in our diets . ”
The nominee also said food safety programs should be modernized to focus on prevention and mitigation , USDA needs a 21st Century computer system and he wanted to prevent discrimination in USDA operations .
working on my graded reader project yesterday , i was really frustrated by how slow it was going .
after profiling , i realized i was spending over 95 % of my time appending strings ; uh oh .
i did something stupid .
the code in question was something like this :
appendToContent str page = page {pageContent = newContent}
where newContent = ( pageContent page ) ++ str
which looks innocent enough to the unwary — after all , you ’re just using the normal haskell append operator , right ?
to see why this is so bad , let ’s take a look at what it ’s doing :
[ ] ++ ys = ys
( x:xs ) ++ ys = x : ( xs ++ ys )
this means that to concatenate two lists , we have to recurse thru EVERY value of the first list .
this means that you ’re essentially calling (++ ) once for every element in the first list .
why does haskell do this ?
let ’s take a look at the definition of a list in haskell
data List a = [ ] | a : List a — ( this is n’t how it ’s really defined ; it ’s built into GHC , but this is how it ’d look . )
this means that a List is either the empty list , [ ] , or a pair of any value of type a and a list of values of type a .
this means there ’s no direct way to access any element in the list but the very first one , so to concatenate two lists we have to traverse every element in the first list , deconstruct it , and reconstruct it .
that ’s not so bad if you are always adding onto the front of a list , because each time you only have to traverse the new elements ; but if you ’re adding to the end of a list ( what i was doing ) , you have to traverse all the old elements of the list .
and each time you append , there are now more elements to traverse the next time .
there are two ways around this :
do n’t append to the end of a list multiple times .
if you have to , use DList or ShowS
since i was working with a String ( just a list of characters in haskell ) , i used ShowS .
so the original code became
appendToContent str page = page {pageContent = newContent}
where newContent = ( pageContent page ) .
showString str
the difference being that now str is of type ShowS , which is to say that for the initial value of pageContent we started with showString “ ” ( showString is a function that takes two strings , and prepends the first to the second ) .
since pageContent starts as a value of type ShowS ( or String -> String ) , we can compose it with more partial applications of showString .
when we finally are done appending , we simply apply pageContent to “ ” ( the empty string ) , and it does all those appends once only , so we only traverse all the elements of each string once .
so .
if you find your haskell code involving a lot of appends / concatenations is slow , make sure you ’re not doing what i did .
if you are , use the showString trick , and it ’ll be much faster .
or if you ’re working with lists of other types , the DList library on hackage should solve your problem in the same way .
just remember to make sure you ’re composing calls , and then applying them to “ ” , because if you do each call one at a time it ’ll be just as slow as regular appends .
( CNN ) --
One in 50 children is homeless in the United States every year , according to a report released Tuesday .
The National Center on Family Homelessness estimates more than 1.5 million children are without a home .
The report , by the National Center on Family Homelessness , analyzed data from 2005 - 06 and found that more than 1.5 million children were without a home .
" These numbers will grow as home foreclosures continue to rise , " Ellen Bassuk , president of the center , said in a statement .
The study ranked states on their performance in four areas : the extent of child homelessness , the risk for it , child well - being and the state 's policy and planning efforts .
The states that fared the poorest were Texas , Georgia , Arkansas , New Mexico and Louisiana .
Connecticut , New Hampshire , Hawaii , Rhode Island and North Dakota performed the best .
Homeless children have poor health , emotional problems and low graduation rates , the study found .
" The consequences to our society will play out for decades , " Bassuk said .
" As we bail out the rest of our nation , it is also time to come to their aid . "
The report offers recommendations such as improved support to ensure that children 's schooling is not interrupted when they lose their homes , and services to address the trauma of homelessness .
Other highlights in the report , " America 's Youngest Outcasts : State Report Card on Child Homelessness : "
• 42 percent of homeless children are younger than 6 .
• African -American and Native American children are disproportionately represented .
• More than 1 in 7 homeless children have moderate to severe health conditions , such as asthma .
• Approximately 1.16 million of homeless children today will not graduate from high school .

They have been lambasted in the press and laughed at by neighbours .
Here , the Chawner family , with a combined weight of 83 stones , describe their distress at unwanted attention and abuse .
Emma Chawner is responsible for one of the most famous ( or infamous ) renditions of Celine Dion 's My Heart Will Go On .
The 19 - year - old from Blackburn first came to the nation 's attention two years ago when she first applied for The X Factor .
In a memorable audition , she was roundly condemned for both her dress sense and singing abilities by Simon Cowell .
He described the dress she was wearing as " like a wedding dress , and then you sang the song out of tune and a bit like a baby " .
But Emma and her family say the criticism dished out by the judges is nothing compared to the abuse they have suffered since .
Abuse Sitting at her laptop , Emma shows me a Facebook group set up about the family .
The tone of the group - which has since been removed - is set by the title : " Get off your fat ass , Emma Chawner and your fat family , and get a job . "
Sometimes I sit there feeling quite hurt that they can't leave my daughters or any of my family alone
Audrey Chawner
It had more than 3,500 members , and contained a string of comments describing the family as fat , lazy and sponging off the state .
" It 's disgusting , they need to get a life , " Emma said .
" They just hate me because I was on The X Factor .
They believe the papers which is n't true .
" There was a comment on there which said , ' If I see Emma Chawner , I 'll kill her , ' and that upset me and I ran upstairs crying . "
The Chawner family say they have become so concerned about the abuse that they have contacted the police .
Emma 's father Phillip pulls out a stack of newspapers to show me what has been written about them .
Flicking through the pages , the headlines all talk about their size and the fact that they are on benefits : Introducing the lardbuckets ;
All that is wrong with Britain ; 83 - stone family 's too fat to work and too busy watching TV to diet ;
The real Tellytubbies .
But Mr Chawner insists that what has been in the papers is inaccurate .
He says they have never asked for more money , with the four of them getting between £ 10,000 and £ 12,000 a year in benefits , not the £ 22,000 quoted in the press .
' Medical problems '
When we were at their house filming , they did not want to pour milk on a bowl of cereal for the cameras .
They were trying to make the packet last a bit longer and did n't want to throw any away .
What is beyond doubt is that the four members of the family are morbidly obese , with a combined weight of more than 80 stones .
But Mr Chawner insists that is down to medical problems , and not their diet .
" It 's not what I have been eating .
I was 27 stone and I am down to 22 .
I have actually lost weight .
They [ the family ] do n't eat a rubbish diet .
" Emma does n't eat in the morning , she does n't eat nothing .
We just eat healthy foods , salads , and that 's it really .
I do n't eat that much at all . "
Emma 's mum Audrey opens her kitchen cupboards .
There are packets of crisps and biscuits , alongside packets of soup , tins of steak and kidney pie , ketchup and crispbreads .
The fridge has a whole chicken , carrots , lettuce and semi-skimmed milk in it .
" We have all tried dieting , even the girls .
They do n't gorge themselves on bars of chocolate .
" People look at me , they stare at you .
It does still hurt deep down inside and , I am sorry , it is just making me feel really hurt and upset .
" Sometimes I sit there feeling quite hurt that they can't leave my daughters or any of my family alone .
" I hope people are going to listen to this .
As I say , we do not scoff ourselves with chocolate or any fattening foods , we just eat what we enjoy and we only have one big meal a day . "
The family say they are still pleased with their appearance on The X Factor and felt proud when Emma was invited back for the finale of the fourth season .
But while they may have enjoyed the fleeting fame of the show , the fallout from the publicity they have had since is proving much harder to handle .
Lancashire Police confirmed that they had received a complaint from the Chawner family about abuse directed at them on the Facebook site .
A spokeswoman said : " We investigated the allegation , but concluded that no offence has been committed .
The matter is now closed . "
Sue Steel , national manager of the Anti-Bullying Alliance ( ABA ) , described the online abuse of the Chawners as " unacceptable " .
She said : " Bullying in any form is wrong and as a society we need to send out the message that it will not be tolerated .
" People may think cyber - bullying is funny but it can actually be very hurtful . "

[ Book Review : Ethics of Money Production .
By Jörg Guido Hülsmann .
Ludwig von Mises Institute ( 2008 ) . 280 pages . ]
Not long ago , the lecture topic in my undergraduate course on corporate finance was ratio analysis .
We were using the financial statements of a publicly traded company that day , so I began the class by demonstrating how students could retrieve these statements from financial - market websites .
As I was navigating through a list of component stocks of the Dow Jones Industrial Average , one student asked a perfectly reasonable question for a student to ask his finance professor : " If you had $ 500 , what would you invest in today ? "
Without hesitating , my response was , " I would buy a half - ounce gold coin and put it in a safe place . "
My attention returned to the web browser and my thoughts to ratios .
However , my answer had surprised the students , and more hands quickly shot into the air .
They wanted an explanation , and their questions came in rapid succession : the economy , the banking sector , the Fed , the government .
Their voices revealed genuine concern and a desire to understand these uncertain times .
It was soon obvious that the lecture on ratio analysis would have to wait for another day .
Anyone who has taught , especially at the college level , understands what happened next .
It was one of those rare moments when the entire class listens attentively and participates in the discussion .
That it occurred with this particular class was even more instructive to me personally .
This was a principles - of - finance course , required not only of finance majors , but of all students pursuing either a major or minor offered by the school of business at my institution .
While the typical principles class contains some highly motivated students who aspire to careers in finance , banking , and accounting , it is also filled with a fair number of students who look upon the course as a sort of dreaded , compulsory disruption to their nonfinance curriculum .
But on this day , they were unified and engaged .
A rare moment indeed !
At this point , the reader might consider this a strange way to begin a book review .
The anticipated segue is provided by a voice in the back row of the classroom , where a rather quiet and normally imperceptible student began the following exchange with me :
" You know , we hear all about these bailouts and stimulus packages coming out of Washington . "
" Yes , I know . "
" Hundreds of billions , even trillions of dollars , right ? "
" That 's right . "
" They do n't really have the money , though , do they ? "
" No , they do n't . "
" And so they are just going to print it , are n't they ? "
" Yes , the banking system is going to print it and loan it to the government . "
" Out of nothing , right ? "
" That 's right . "
" But that 's not right , is it ? "
Just to be clear , the student was not suggesting that the premise was not right , as in not correct .
He was asserting that this massive production of money out of thin air was not right , as in not ethical .
Most heads in the class were either nodding in agreement or shaking in disbelief .
These students may not understand exactly what is happening to the economy in general and the banking sector in particular , or they may not be able to articulate a sophisticated explanation ( not yet , at least ) , but they instinctively know that something is not right .
Fortunately , they have a definitive answer to the question , is it ethical ?
Moreover , it is explained in a way they can easily understand and hopefully pass on .
I am talking about the wonderful new book by Jörg Guido Hülsmann , The Ethics of Money Production .
As my students can attest , it would be difficult to overstate my appreciation for this book .
In fact , I am tempted to conclude my review here and simply say , get it , read it , and then read it again !
If I begin quoting my favorite parts , I will end up retyping the entire book , including the table of contents and the preface ( okay , maybe not the copyright disclaimer ) .
I trust you get the picture .
Dr. Hülsmann has performed a great service to those who either share the instincts of my unsure - but - probing students , or to those whose advanced understanding leads them to hold as a certainty that the ability of our modern banking system to produce money in unlimited quantities is simply unethical .
This verdict may sound radical ( more on that below ) or even crazy ( we can count on hearing that ) , but it can not be avoided and should not be suppressed .
As Hülsmann so ably demonstrates , money production is a problem of justice , and the prevailing legal order ( e.g. , legal monopolies , legal - tender laws , legalized suspension of payments ) has " unwittingly become instruments of social injustice " that " breed inflation , irresponsibility , and an illicit distribution of income , usually from the poor to the rich " ( p. 6 ) .
I will dwell only briefly on the book 's layout and content in order to spend more space speculating on its impact .
The book is separated into three parts .
Part one covers what the author calls the " natural production of money " and offers improvements based on the moral foundations he has laid down .
The second part focuses on inflation and what Hülsmann correctly calls " the perversion of natural money production . "
An important distinction is made in this second part between private and fiat inflation , and includes a chapter ( 13 ) profoundly titled " The Cultural and Spiritual Legacy of Fiat Inflation . "
In part three , a brief history of Western civilization 's monetary systems over the past four centuries is brilliantly analyzed under the author 's keen application of morals and ethics .
Dr. Hülsmann 's approach integrates three elements familiar to those who navigate these parts of the literary world : the Austrian theory of money and banking , philosophical realism , and a Thomistic / scholastic conviction that science and ethics combine in a unified system of knowledge .
Understanding this application is not only helpful in distinguishing the methodology but in explaining its success .
The fruits are disclosed by the author in the preface :
[ A]ll these aspects lead to the conclusion that a free market in money production is ethically superior to its logical alternative : money production based on legal exemptions and privileges .
( p. xi )
Readers of this book will recognize the distinct writing style that Hülsmann shares with so many contemporary Austrian scholars .
The simple but beautiful logic , the prose ( direct , clear , and concise ) , the pace , and the length of this book make it easily accessible to the nonexpert , which is of no small significance given the subject .
I was once told by one of the Christian Brothers who taught me in high school that you know a great book when your ability to finish it is continually thwarted by the pursuit of material contained in footnotes , citations , and references .
Well , count this as one more reason to call The Ethics of Money Production a great book .
Hülsmann states in the introduction that it was not his goal to be exhaustive .
However , the breadth and depth of the scholarship is remarkable for such a short work and provides a rich roadmap for further edification .
It is the potential for further edification that , in my opinion , will prove to be Hülsmann 's most lasting achievement here .
Just as my students sense something is wrong , many of those who are certain something is wrong sense we may be witnessing the death throes of the current world monetary system .
[ 1]
The question on many minds is , what comes next ?
Although it is likely that what comes next will be worse than what we have at the moment ( the audacity of distrust , you might call it ) , it is imperative that people come to understand that a nation 's money system is , at its core , dependent upon justice , ethics , and , yes , morals .
This has enormous implications because it demands participation from more than the usual crowd of banking elites , establishment economists , and any so - called " value - free " economic systems .
As Hülsmann informs his readers , economics deals both with moral beings ( human persons ) and questions that have direct moral relevance ( p. 5 ) . [ 2 ]
The production of money , like the production of any goods or services , relies not only on a legal framework , but also on moral presuppositions of human cooperation ( p. 1 ) .
He argues convincingly that it is precisely this aspect of money ( i.e. , its production and the ethics associated therewith ) that has escaped the attention of commentary in areas ranging from Catholic social teaching on economic activity , through Christian doctrine on money and usury , all the way up to , and perhaps most glaringly , the innumerable ( some might say insufferable ) economic works on money and banking .
The result is a paucity of literature that offers both a thorough grasp of economics and a moral assessment of monetary institutions .
[ 3 ]
The impeccable timing notwithstanding , this book fills a glaring void .
Let us hope it is only the beginning .
My own personal interests lead me to concentrate my enthusiasm especially on the potential for works like The Ethics of Money Production to fill gaps and bring greater clarity on the proper approach for Catholic social teaching regarding the issue of money .
As Hülsmann notes in the introduction ( p. 7 ) , many diverse Catholic writers have arrived at similar ( i.e. , correct ) conclusions regarding the present monetary system .
Unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the prescriptions that have followed their condemnations .
Dr. Thomas E. Woods addressed some of the problems with the many well - intentioned but misguided commentators in his outstanding book The Church and the Market . [ 4 ]
Catholic social teaching ( or claiming papal authority ) is used to promote such socioeconomic systems as distributism , [ 5 ] solidarism , [ 6 ] and the social doctrine of Christ the King , [ 7 ] not to mention thinly veiled partisan ( and most often leftist ) political programs .
[ 8 ]
Some of these propositions appeal to the Catholic - formed intellect , especially the Thomistic approach of Father Dennis Fahey and the Jesuit approach of Father Heinrich Pesch and his esteemed American translator , Dr. Rupert Ederer .
However , they all leave this reviewer either unconvinced ( as in , I can not tell exactly what is being proposed ) or unsatisfied ( as in , that sounds like a variation of the state - imposed privilege system that brought us to this point ) .
Borrowing from the approach of another great Catholic theologian , St. Augustine , we can insist that any proposal for a universal system of money and banking ( and economics for that matter ) must , from a Catholic or Christian perspective , satisfy the demands of all three philosophical divisions : the natural , the rational , and the moral . [ 9 ]
This is not the space to elaborate on any shortcomings of those systems mentioned above using the Augustinian standard . [ 10 ]
Yet , it can be stated here that Hülsmann hits the mark in all of them , i.e. , he makes the natural case , the rational case , and the moral case .
Anyone who wishes to reject or dismiss the arguments and conclusions in The Ethics of Money Production must reckon with this reality .
Not only that , the critic must overcome an ethical case that is built upon a prodigious amount of evidence from the relevant literature .
Before even getting to chapter 1 , Hülsmann builds his case with citations to the first papal denouncement of currency debasement by Pope Innocent III ( Quanto , 1199 ) , the first scientific treatise on money by the 14th - century French bishop Nicolas Oresme , the work of Aquinas and scholastic successors such as the School of Salamanca , and Thomists such as Bernard Dempsey , the Christian reconstructionists , the great Austrian economists such as Menger , Mises , and Rothbard , even Popes John XIII and John Paul II .
Again , this list is only from a short a glimpse of the introduction !
To be sure , Hülsmann does not expressly promote this book as an exposition of what the official Catholic or Christian position should be regarding money and monetary institutions .
But as the title declares , the book is about ethics , meaning it will necessarily integrate all those familiar elements where human action is involved : justice , morals , politics , history , etc .
It is unavoidable then that the Christian , and more specifically the Catholic , philosophical tradition will form the basis of an assessment .
In the book 's conclusion , Hülsmann is justified in pointing out the fundamental agreement between his economic analysis and the concerns of the Church .
Any would - be critic simply cannot dismiss this claim without matching its intellectual rigor and logic .
Perhaps the Church will produce a Frank Sheed on money and economics ( how about " Society , Money , and Sanity " for a start ) , [ 11 ] someone who can filter Aquinas and Augustine down to the street level and into a genuine Catholic position on which all Catholics can agree .
While we might be advised not to hold our collective breath ( Sheed had the advantage of writing his best work in the preconciliar days ) , we can be encouraged by the expanding work of men such as Guido Hülsmann , Thomas Woods , Jesus Huerta de Soto , and many others who deserve mention .
Just as the polis is threatened when the language is corrupted , or just as the faith is threatened when the liturgy is corrupted , the economy is threatened when the currency is corrupted .
The economy , it goes without saying , affects everyone .
Money is the lubricant that connects it all together .
The question is not whether the current institutions will collapse ; the question is what will take their place .
It is a question that demands a Christian response .
One 's faith ( or lack thereof ) is not the issue : I can not imagine anyone who wishes for a return to monetary sanity ( i.e. , an ethical system ) would disagree that the prospects for such a desired result will be furthered greatly if Catholics speak on the issue with a voice that is clear and confident .
Guido Hülsmann offers his conclusions : the current monetary institutions ( central banks , paper money , and fractional - reserve banking ) cannot be justified and should be abolished ; such an act should be greeted as a restoration of monetary sanity and a humane economy .
He admits that his conclusions are radical , but he refuses to hold back his views out of any " misconceived notions of temperance " ( p. 7 ) .
He continues :
However , one must not shy away from taking a strong stance in the face of great evil ; and great evil is precisely what we confront in the present case .
Our goal is not to press a partisan program , however .
We seek merely to acquaint the reader with the essential facts needed for a moral evaluation of monetary institutions .
( p. 7 )
As he discloses in the first lines of the preface , Dr. Hülsmann has intended for some time to " give a concise exposition of monetary theory , with special emphasis on the ethical … aspects of money production " ( p. ix , emphasis added ) .
We are grateful that he did .
Jennifer Thompson - Cannino was certain that Ronald Cotton raped her in Burlington , North Carolina on the night of July 28 , 1984 .
She picked him out of a lineup and , on the basis of her testimony , he was sentenced to life plus 50 years .
However , 11 years later , new DNA evidence established his innocence .
Last night on 60 Minutes , Thomson - Cannino told Lesley Stahl she felt terrible shame .
“ Suffocating , debilitating shame . ”
Two years after his release from prison , she wanted to meet Cotton and ask his forgiveness .
“ I started to cry immediately .
And I looked at him , and I said , ‘ Ron , if I spent every second of every minute of every hour for the rest of my life telling you how sorry I am , it would n’t come close to how my heart feels .
I ’m so sorry . ’
And Ronald just leaned down , he took my hands … and he looked at me , he said , ‘ I forgive you , ' ” Thompson - Cannino remembered .
Eventually , both of them have become close friends and have traveled together telling their story in an effort to reform eyewitness identification methods .

From the ' bad to worse ' files :
According to reports allegedly confirmed by both the 451 Group and blogger
Having problems with Beautiful Soup 3.1.0 ?
Use Beautiful Soup 4 instead .
The parser in version 3.1.0 of Beautiful Soup did significantly worse on real - world HTML than version 3.0.8 did .
The most common problems were the incorrect handling of < script > tags , " malformed start tag " errors , and " bad end tag " errors .
To address this problem , I replaced the 3.1 series of Beautiful Soup with the 3.2 series .
I then replaced Beautiful Soup 3 itself with Beautiful Soup 4 , which can use any of a number of third - party parsers .
This page was originally written in March 2009 , and remains up for historical purposes .
The information on this page is years out of date .
If you use it to make decisions , you 'll probably make bad decisions .
See the Beautiful Soup 4 documentation instead .
Despite the above warnings , I still encounter people who read this page and think that Beautiful Soup is a dead project .
I do n't want to remove the text of this page , because I think it 's important to an understanding of the project 's history .
Instead , I 've taken the step of striking out the no-longer - accurate information .
Hopefully this will help .
What happened ?
Beautiful Soup 3.0.8 uses SGMLParser , found in the Python standard library .
It 's not the best parser ever written , and I 've had to add a lot of code dealing with its quirks , but it can handle most bad tags and a certain amount of < script > weirdness .
It 's been the basis of Beautiful Soup since the first version .
In Python 3.0 , the latest version of Python , SGMLParser has been removed .
The only parser that 's part of the Python 3.0 standard library is HTMLParser , a simpler parser that 's much worse at processing malformed HTML .
In the meantime , an excellent new HTML parsing library called html5 lib has emerged .
It 's very good at processing malformed HTML , but it 's not part of the Python standard library , and at the moment it 's slower than either SGMLParser or HTMLParser .
I no longer enjoy working on Beautiful Soup , but too many people depend on it for me to let the project die just because it depends on code that 's been removed from the Python standard library .
So I wrote Beautiful Soup 3.1.0 , which cleans up the Python 2.x code so that it can be automatically converted to Python 3.0. code .
Part of this change was to switch the underlying parser from SGMLParser to HTMLParser .
The errors you 're seeing are caused by HTML that SGMLParser could handle but HTMLParser can't .
When Beautiful Soup was first released in May of 2004 , there were no lenient HTML parsers that were easy to program , only the ones embedded in web browsers .
Now there are lots of programmable lenient HTML parsers , and most of them are better than SGMLParser , let alone HTMLParser .
These days , Beautiful Soup is useful for its Unicode handling and its tree - traversal methods .
Parsing is longer a competitive advantage for Beautiful Soup , and I 'd be happier if I could get out of the parser business altogether .
What will happen in the future ?
1 . In the future , Python 3.0 will be the standard version of Python .
There will be no SGMLParser anymore , and versions of Beautiful Soup prior to 3.1.0 will stop working .
2 . In a future version of Beautiful Soup , you 'll be able to specify which parser you want to use to parse a given document .
The supported parsers will probably be HTMLParser and html5lib , but you 'll be able to write some code to hook up any parser to drive the Beautiful Soup tree builder , and then run BS methods on the result .
What can I do about this right now ?
1 . You can pretend that Beautiful Soup version 3.1.0 was never released .
Version 3.0.8 still works fine on Python 2.3 through 2.6 .
2 . You can use html5lib .
That library has a Beautiful Soup tree builder that will yield standard Beautiful Soup objects .
It depends on Beautiful Soup to run .
3 . You can use ElementTree .
If you want the Beautiful Soup API , you can use Element Soup to feed the HTML into Beautiful Soup once ElementTree has cleaned it up .
4 . You can use lxml .
It does n't have all of Beautiful Soup 's tree - traversal methods , but it 's a fast and easy - to - use parser .
5 . You can do some of the work yourself , and send me the result .
3.1.0 includes the start of the refactoring work for making the parser pluggable , moving HTMLParser code into a parser class .
This is the point where I 'm supposed to ask for money .
But money wo n't solve this problem .
I 'm always happy when someone sends me donations because of Beautiful Soup , and I used to describe these donations as " supporting Beautiful Soup development . "
But that 's not really accurate .
To justify further Beautiful Soup development I need time , not money .
Gifts of money feel more like thank - yous for the work I 've already done .
I have a full - time programming job that pays well but is n't very flexible .
If I get a $ 100 donation , I can't take an hour off from work and work on Beautiful Soup .
If I take a day off , I 'd rather spend it doing something other than programming .
To make the time for Beautiful Soup development , I 'd need enough money to make it my job , and that 's too much money to ask for or to expect .
To summarize , Beautiful Soup is a hobby that I do n't really enjoy and that 's similar to the work I do all day .
It 's competing against other hobbies and committments I have , hobbies and committments that are more enjoyable and significantly different from my day job .
So when I say you can do some of the work yourself , I 'm not being snarky .
That 's a legitimate option for getting this code written faster .
Update :
For easier access to the source , I 've put Beautiful Soup 3.0 and trunk on Launchpad , so you can make and publish your own branches .
Questions are being raised about the distribution of funds raised by the Sound Relief concerts in Melbourne and Sydney , after it was revealed that just over half of the proceeds will be going to charity .
Hundreds of thousands of music fans attended the simultaneous events in Melbourne and Sydney at the weekend to raise funds for Victoria 's bushfire victims and those affected by Queensland 's floods .
Australians gave generously , with ticket sales exceeding $ 8.8 million .
Advertising had said that 100 per cent of the ticket price would go to charity , while big - name performers including Coldplay and Kings of Leon waived their usual appearance fees .
But now promoters have admitted that some of the money raised is being used to pay for production costs .
It is estimated about $ 5 million will actually go to the charitable funds , while nearly $ 4 million will cover costs like hotel accommodation and sound equipment .
About 118,000 Melbourne patrons bought their tickets believing that all the $ 75 of the ticket price would go to charity .
The concert 's website promised 100 per cent of the proceeds from the Melbourne concert would be donated to the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire Appeal .
In Sydney , half the proceeds would go to the Bushfire Appeal and half to the Disaster Relief Fund for the victims of the Queensland floods .
Promoter Michael Gudinski , who heads the Frontier Touring Company and organised the Melbourne concert , was unavailable for comment .
The PR company representing Sydney promoter Michael Chugg did not respond to ABC 's request for comment .
The Red Cross preferred not to say anything .
Victorian Premier John Brumby is confident though the money raised will be distributed appropriately .
" The organisers made it very clear at the start that all of the artists and musicians were appearing free of charge , " he said .
" They were donating their services , but there would nevertheless be some costs , for example in terms of organisation and hire .
" So they 'll produce a full , orderly set of accounts and I would expect the maximum possible would be donated towards the fund .
" I do n't know whether that would be $ 3 million , $ 4 million , $ 5 million or $ 6 million . "

printable version - email this article How the CIA Steals Money From Taxpayers
by © Michael E. Salla , PhD Monday , Mar. 09 , 2009 at 6:12 PM
In 1989 Catherine Austin Fitts became Assistant Secretary for Housing in Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) .
She began to notice money was not properly tracked as it moved between different HUD departments and there was a lack of proper accounting mechanisms to deal with discrepancies in revenue indicated fraud at an alarming level . [ 28 ]
She attempted to put in place some credible financial tracking mechanisms to identify where the money was going and to identify the responsible individuals and HUD departments , but after 18 months on the job she was suddenly fired by the Bush administration .
Fitts was told the day after she left that her financial reforms through place - based financial accounting and statements  would also be terminated .
Fitts subsequently created her own investment company , Hamilton Securities Group that used specially created computer software for tracking financial flows in the mortgage industry .
In 1993 , Hamilton Securities Group won a contract with HUD to manage its $ 500 billion portfolio .
As a result of its innovative computer tracking of finances called  Community Wizard , Hamilton Securities saved Federal Taxpayers $ 2 billion and according to Fitts " took the world 's breath away . " [ 30 ]
Carolyn Betts , a former Hamilton Securities employee said :
The HUD field office people went absolutely crazy when they saw it .
You could go in with a pointer on a map and get to information on expenditures by each HUD program .
It was a pretty beautiful program and would have become unbelievably powerful . [ 31 ]
Fitts  innovative program was so successful that it was earning special attention from Congressmen with one chairman of an oversight committee in October 1997 favorably commenting on the " eye- popping " results . [ 32 ]
Fitts  program had the potential to revolutionize the way in which large multibillion dollar portfolios were managed .
Vice President Al Gore 's Reinventing Government Initiative gave her firm the Hammer Award for Excellence in Re-engineering Government .
Fitts innovation also came to the attention of powerful individuals who viewed it as a threat to existing way in which finances were tracked in HUD and other federal government agencies that apparently allowed corporations to reap large profits from government inefficiency .
Fitts  pioneering work came crashing down around her in June , 1996 when a qui tam ( whistleblower ) suit was brought against her firm by a rival HUD contractor John Ervin who alleged Fitts committed fraud against HUD to the tune of $ 3.8 million .
According to the Federal False Claims
Act , a qui tam suit has 60 days to be investigated before a federal judge has to reach a conclusion on the substance of the suit and unseal the qui tam so that the defendant can respond to the allegations .
Instead , the HUD Inspector General together with the federal judge in charge of the case took four years before another judge decided the allegations lacked substance , unsealed the qui tam , and dismissed the suit in July 2000 . [ 33 ]
In the meantime , Fitts firm was subjected to 18 audits and investigations , multiple subpoenas for thoupooppooppooppoops of documents , not paid money owed to it by HUD while the investigation was underway , subjected to media leaks and a smear campaign that frightened away potential investors , and ultimately raided by Department of Justice agents in 1998 .
The raid effectively destroyed the Community Wizard program and put an end to Hamilton Securities  efforts to survive the legal onslaught that involved steep legal costs .
At the end , Fitts company went bankrupt , Fitts was emotionally exhausted , but continued to fight for her reputation , repayment from HUD , and exposure of wrong doing by the HUD Inspector General in allowing the qui tam law suit to proceed for four years on a fishing expedition , while simultaneously leaking false information . [ 34 ]
After her experiences in both working with HUD as an employee ( 1988 - 1989 ) and as a contractor ( 1993 - 1997 ) and observing at first hand the chronic state of finances that could not be accounted for under normal accounting rules , Fitts concluded that HUD was being run as a criminal enterprise :
In the summer of 2000 , a member of the staff for the Chairman of the Senate appropriation subcommittee ( with jurisdiction over HUD ) confided to me that they believed that HUD was being run as " a criminal enterprise . "
I responded that I " did not disagree . "
Reaching that conclusion was a long time coming .
It took many years of experience implementing practical and sound reforms to the FHA mortgage system , only to have the system reject any and all efforts to have it become anything other than an integral part of a significant mortgage bubble and a pork and slush fund operation . [ 35 ]
The fraudulent movement of finances through HUD were made possible by poor auditing standards that enabled as much as tens of billions of dollars to go annually missing . [ 36 ]
In a March 2000 report , the HUD Inspector General , Susan Gaffney , reported a high number of adjustments  that had to be made to account for $ 59 billion that could not be located in 1999 :
At the time we discontinued our audit work , a total of 42 adjustments totaling about $ 17.6 billion had been processed in this manner to adjust fiscal year 1998 ending balances .
An additional 242 adjustments totaling about $ 59.6 billion , were made to adjust fiscal year 1999 activity . [ 37 ]
Gaffney argued that the adjustments  were caused by HUDs difficulties in reconciling different computer systems .
An unnamed official within HUD dismissed the idea of the adjustments being solely problems associated with different computers systems :
Everything that has transpired at HUD is not an accident , and it sure is n't a computer glitch .
When you take the different material violations of the most basic financial - management rules and compare them to the time and effort put in to have first - rate systems , it is impossible to explain it as anything other than significant financial fraud . [ 38 ]
Such fraud would not have been possible without collusion at the highest level , the Director of HUD , Mario Cuomo .
Confirmation that the missing $ 59 billion for 1999 was known to Cuomo was disclosed by the unnamed source in HUD :
The losses could be far greater than $ 59 billion , but they do n't know for sure because the audit is n't completed .
Secretary Cuomo is a very smart control freak , so it 's ludicrous to think that he does n't know what is going on . [ 39 ]
Confirmation that losses from HUD were an endemic problem rather than peculiar to 1998 and 1999 comes from the General Accounting Office of Congress that released a report in 2003 stating that in January 2003 , for the 12th year in a row , the HUD OIG [ Office of Inspector General ] cited the lack of an integrated financial - management system as a material weakness in its audit of the department 's financial statements .  [ 40 ]
In short , billions of dollars were annually missing from HUD and no one knew where the money was going .
Fitts analysis of the fraudulent movement of funds through HUD , her initial firing as an Assistant Secretary , subsequent difficulties her company had with HUD [ 41 ] , indicated that she had stumbled on to one of the strategies used by the CIA to generate its secret black budget .
Fitts ultimately came to the conclusion that HUD was being run as a money laundering operation to fund black projects . [ 42 ]
The sums for HUD alone , $ 59 billion for 1999 , were far greater than the official $ 3.5 billion annual estimated budget of the CIA that came from DoD appropriations .
Missing funds from HUD , the participation of the HUD Director in permitting the funds to go missing , and the difficulties suffered by Fitts , point to the CIA being behind the missing HUD funds .
The CIA is the only government agency that has the legal authority to co-opt Federal Agency Directors in permitting billions of dollars to go missing from or laundered through their budgets for transfer into a black budget .
It is worth investigating the destruction of Fitts company , Hamilton Securities Group to identify any CIA fingerprints in covering up the secret transfer of HUD funds into what will be argued to be the CIAs unofficial black budget .
The individual who brought the lawsuit against Fitts , John Ervin , has been described as notorious for filing nuisance lawsuits and " bid protests  .  [ 43 ]
His small mortgage investment firm apparently had , according to one inside source , up to 17 in - house personnel working full time on mountains of paperwork regarding this and other cases .  [ 44 ]
Ervin may simply have been a small time contractor with a chip on his shoulder from losing the HUD mortgage contract to Fitts company .
However , the large number of legal cases his firm was involved in suggests he may have been simply a front for more powerful actors threatened by Hamiltons Securities who wished to cripple it through a damaging court process .
More revealing was the behavior of the federal judge in charge of Fitts case that eventually presided over the case .
According to court transcripts , the initial judge had indicated in 1996 that it would be inappropriate to extend the seal [ on the qui tam ] without evidence and that unless evidence was produced he would not extend the seal again .
The case was then transferred to Judge Stanley Sporkin of the District of Columbias District Court .
According to Uri Dowbenky , Sporkin managed to illegally keep a qui tam lawsuit sealed for almost 4 years .
That could be a judicial record .  [ 45 ]
Sporkin had given multiple 60 - day extensions to further investigate the allegations that he claimed were not limited to the False Claims
Act limit of 60 days that applied to Department of Justice investigations , since the HUD Inspector General had independent subpoena power and chose to continue the investigation . [ 46 ]
Extending the qui tam in this highly dubious manner meant that it was kept sealed thus preventing Hamilton from responding to the allegations , and thus prolonged an elaborate fishing expedition that would financially exhaust Hamilton Securities .
A significant background fact about Judge Sporkin was that he was the General Counsel for the CIA ( 1981 - 86 ) before being appointed as a federal judge to the District of Columbia District Court by Ronald Reagan in 1985 . [ 47 ]
Sporkins CIA background and the continued extensions of the qui tam case that had questionable legal standing and which was finally unsealed and dropped by a new Federal judge appointed to the case after Sporkins retirement in 2000 point to a CIA covert program to destroy Hamilton Securities .
One conclusion that emerges is that Fitts company was targeted since it threatened to undermine and even expose the way the CIA secretly extracted congressional appropriations from or laundered funds through HUD and other government agencies . [ 48 ]
The CIA was using its unique legal status of being able to lawfully transfer Congressional appropriations or laundered money  through other federal government agencies , to fund projects administered by the intelligence community , and to destroy any individual or company that threatened to reveal such a process .
The wide extent of chronic auditing irregularities for most government agencies suggested that it was not just HUD that was used by the CIA as vehicle for siphoning money into its unofficial black budget .
A Senate Committee on government reform investigated the auditing practices of federal government agencies in 2001 , and the Committee Chairman , Senator Fred Thompson , released a report that found that ineffectual auditing practices were endemic and led to billions of dollars going annually missing from most government agencies . [ 49 ]
Rather than restricting itself to the appropriations through the DoD ( the official black budget ) , something Congress was aware of and tolerated , the accounting irregularities of many government agencies were possible evidence that the CIA was accumulating a sizable portion of the actual black budget from other government agencies .

Ever wonder what Pulp Fiction would be like with kids as the actors ?
Probably not , but thanks to the Oxford Film Festival in Mississippi , you have your answer .
Not the greatest of acting of course , but still quite interesting .
I certainly found myself laughing at the end of this .
If you can stand to watch it again , this version actually won an award :
[ HT ] Get the Big Picture
It ’s good to be king .
ABC :
Embattled bank JPMorgan Chase , the recipient of $ 25 billion in TARP funds , is going ahead with a $ 138 million plan to buy two new luxury corporate jets and build “ the premiere corporate aircraft hangar on the eastern seaboard ” to house them , ABC News has learned … .
The Gulfstream 650’s are described by the manufacturer as the “ fastest , ” “ widest ” and “ most comfortable ” private jet ever with superior cabin amenities , an optional stateroom , and 12 interior designs to choose from … .
[ O ] n March 11 , the chairman of JPMorgan Chase , Jamie Dimon , said he could not understand why corporate America has such a bad image .
“ When I hear the constant vilification of corporate America I personally do n’t understand it , ” Dimon said .

Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has won a bid to suspend parliament , blocking an opposition attempt to topple his minority government .
The governor general agreed to Mr Harper 's request , unprecedented in the country , after talks .
If the request had been rejected , he would have had to step down or face a confidence vote he was sure to lose .
Opposition parties had called the vote for Monday , accusing the government of failing to shore up the economy .
Governor General Michaelle Jean agreed to prorogue - or suspend - parliament until 26 January when the government is set to present its economic plan .
Ms Jean - the representative of head of state Queen Elizabeth II - has the right to make a final decision on such matters .
" Today 's decision will give us an opportunity - I 'm talking about all the parties - to focus on the economy and work together , " Mr Harper said after the two - and - a - half - hour private meeting .
For the first time in the history of Canada the prime minister is running away from the parliament of Canada

Liberal leader
Bitter week in politics Read your comments
The Conservatives immediately shut down parliament , ending all debate .
The head of the main Liberal opposition party , Stephane Dion , said he was still committed to bringing down Mr Harper 's government unless he makes a " monumental change " in dealing with the economy and other parties .
" For the first time in the history of Canada the prime minister is running away from the parliament of Canada , " Mr Dion was quoted as saying by AP news agency .
Opposition New Democrat leader Jack Layton called it a sad day .
" He 's trying to lock the door of parliament so that the elected people cannot speak , " Mr Layton said .
" He 's trying to save his job . "
Political drama
A prime minister 's request to temporarily suspend parliament had never been turned down , but nor had such a request been made when the government was certain to lose a confidence vote .
" There is no precedent whatsoever in Canada and probably in the Commonwealth , " constitutional expert Ned Franks told AP news agency .
" We are in uncharted territory . "
At a time like this , a coalition with separatists cannot help Canada

Canadian Prime Minister
The prime minister 's manoeuvre comes at the end of a week of unprecedented political drama , says the BBC's Lee Carter in Toronto .
The constitutional crisis was triggered last week after the Conservatives presented a fiscal update that was angrily rejected by the opposition parties for not including an economic stimulus package and for proposing cuts to the public financing of political parties .
The Liberals and New Democrats signed a deal to defeat Mr Harper in a confidence vote scheduled for Monday and to form a coalition government .
Mr Harper 's Conservatives won a strengthened minority in the 14 October election but are outnumbered in parliament by the combination of the Liberal Party , the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Quebecois .
' Backroom deal '
In a televised appeal on Wednesday , Mr Harper said the opposition pact was a threat to the country 's democracy and economy .
Governor General Michaelle Jean makes final decisions on such matters " At a time like this , a coalition with separatists cannot help Canada , " he said , referring to the Bloc 's desire for independence for Quebec .
" Tonight , I pledge to you that Canada 's government will use every legal means at our disposal to protect our democracy , to protect our economy and to protect Canada . "
Mr Harper called the opposition parties ' power - sharing agreement a " backroom deal " .
Ms Jean cut short a trip to Europe on Wednesday and flew back to Ottawa in an effort to deal with the growing political crisis after the three opposition parties formally advised her of their plan .
Ms Jean 's other options were to have called a general election if the confidence vote went ahead and Mr Harper lost , or to have asked the opposition to form a new government .

Yesterday gave us the six year anniversary of the debacle that is Iraq .
As I was thinking about the whole Iraq situation , I remembered that we were given many , many reasons for going to war .
It started with Weapons of Mass Destruction .
The whole world , including countries half way around the world , were in grave danger .
We must not allow Saddam to develop WMD !
WMD !
WMD !
So , WMD was the number one reason .
That did n’t work out so well and as everyone knows , there were no WMD .
Then , we had Iraqi Freedom .
We needed to get rid of Saddam so that the people of Iraq would be free .
Then there was Bringing Democracy to the Middle East .
Then there was …?
I distinctly remember about 14 different reasons which we were given as justification to create and enforce the Bush Doctrine .
Alas , I can not remember all of them .
Can you help me out ?
What were the reasons you remember we were given to go to war ?
If you have links , that would be awesome .
As Rachel Maddow ’s segment Down The Memory Hole last night proved , the last administration is intent on rewriting history .
Let ’s make sure that does n’t happen .
Oh , and if you ’d like a good read by Josh Marshall , one which I might add was quite prescient , read this .

Good cause , controversial slogan

The women call themselves The Berkshire Babes , six friends who organized a team this year for the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer in Boston May 16 - 17 .
Some of them have walked with other teams in the past .
One helped a nine - member team raise nearly $ 30,000 for the event two years ago , well above the $ 1,800 that Avon requests each team member to collect .
The women recently brainstormed to come up with new ideas to raise funds amid a slumping economy .
Kim Hamberg Wilder , 30 , a real estate agent from Lenox , thought up a catchy , somewhat racy slogan for the event : Beer For Boobs .
" Catchy is what brings people to events , and we were looking to grab the attention of people who do n't normally go to fundraising events , " Wilder said .
They asked Moe 's owner Josh Cohen if he'd be willing to host the event at his bar in Lee on Saturday .
Cohen , whose mother is a breast cancer survivor , agreed , and pledged to donate a portion of the night 's beer sales to the cause .
Moe 's is known for its eclectic menu of microbrewed beers .
The Babes designed pink posters with their slogan : " Beer For Boobs : Drink good beer to benefit the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer . "
The text is enclosed inside a pint glass with a silhouette of a woman 's breasts , complete with nipples .

Dan Miraglia , 47 , a Pittsfield carpenter , noticed the poster at George 's Liquor Store on Elm Street Thursday .
' Totally tasteless '
Miraglia 's mother was a breast cancer survivor .
" I thought it was totally tasteless , " he said .
" In my opinion , it is demeaning toward women and insensitive toward women who have dealt with breast cancer . "

Miraglia wondered if the event would involve a wet T - shirt contest or something even more tawdry .
He called Avon officials yesterday to see if they condoned the poster , and a woman said the company urges its teams to raise awareness in a sensitive way .
" She told me she would look into it , " Miraglia said .
Susan Heaney , director for communications for the Avon Foundation , said her organization hears concerns like this every year as teams attempt to be creative about a sensitive issue .
It seems to invoke a social experiment in what 's acceptable when it comes to the female anatomy .
" Our walkers are empowered to raise funds in whatever creative ways they can , " Heaney said .
" Not to make fun of the situation , but to find uplifting moments in times of sadness .
Some people might find the poster surprising , and some might be reminded to go get a mammogram .
It 's all subjective . "

Heaney said some women even walk in the event wearing fake plastic breasts .
The Avon Walk for Breast Cancer is a two - day , 39 - mile walking event that takes place in nine cities across the United States .
In Boston last year , more than 2,900 participated from 33 states , including 200 breast cancer survivors .
More than $ 6.9 million was raised .
Miraglia thinks the walk " is a great cause , " but the poster could 've been designed " with a little more tact . "
Response mostly positive
Wilder will be joined by Andrea Pignatelli , Adrienne Rynes , Jen Sweeney , Maureen Lee and Sharon Kennedy .
She said she " could see how some people might say the poster 's a little racy , " but the response has been mostly positive .
" Most fundraising events can be stuffy , " she said .
" We wanted to make this fun .
We 're trying to raise money for a good cause , and that 's our ultimate goal . "

Many may be familiar with the Wal - Mart greeter ; the kind smiling individual standing at the opening of one of those mega-stores , ready to say hello .
But DFW residents who know their nuts and bolts also know Elliott 's Hardware 's greeting force , who 're often the perfect sage to ask , " Where can I find a plunger ? " as you walk into the store in pants wet up to your ankles .
Now Elliott's has their sights set on a very specific candidate for adding to their greeting group : Former President George W Bush .
In a letter posted in the Dallas Morning News ( which we 've posted here ) , Elliott 's lists the job perks , including a flexible part - time schedule , ample parking for his security , and an employee discount for his " honey - do " project list .
Sounds like a joke , right ?
" We are offering the position to Mr. Bush in all sincerity , " said Kyle Walters , Elliott 's president and CEO .
" We think it would be a great fit for him as he settles back into life in Dallas . "
So should Dubya take the job ?
Vote on the poll to the left , and tell us why ( or why not ) below .
Barack Obama yesterday appeared to line up behind the Bush administration in support of Israel 's attack on Gaza .
Speaking on CBS's Face the Nation , his chief adviser , David Axelrod , initially repeated the Obama team 's formula that there could only be one president at a time and that president was George Bush .
But he went on to recall comments that Obama made in July at Sderot , the Israeli town that is the target of rocket attacks from Palestinian militants in Gaza .
At the time , Obama said : " If somebody was sending rockets into my house where my two daughters sleep at night , I 'm going to do everything in my power to stop that .
I would expect Israelis to do the same thing . "
A similar sentiment was expressed by Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , on Saturday .
She said : " The United States strongly condemns the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel and holds Hamas responsible for breaking the ceasefire and for the renewal of violence in Gaza . "
She added : " The ceasefire should be restored immediately .
The United States calls on all concerned to address the urgent humanitarian needs of the innocent people of Gaza . "
Gordon Johndroe , the White House security spokesman , also blamed Hamas , whom he referred to as terrorists and thugs .
Rice briefed Obama by phone for about eight minutes on Saturday and further calls are planned to ensure he is up to speed on the issue by the time he takes office .
Although Obama has repeatedly said he would not comment on policy matters until he becomes president on 20 January , he has largely abandoned this in relation to the economic crisis , on which he has spoken regularly over the last few weeks , often at odds with Bush .
So far , Obama has given no hint on his policy on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , though he has said finding a peace plan would be an early priority of his administration .
Before running for president , he provoked suspicion among Israelis and some US Jewish groups when he expressed sympathy for the plight of the Palestinians .
But after winning the Democratic nomination earlier this year he veered in the other direction , voicing strong support for Israel in a speech in Washington to the Israeli lobby group Aipac .
Yesterday , the Washington Post quoted an unnamed senior Bush administration official saying he thought the Israelis launched the attack because of uncertainty over Obama 's policy .
The official said the Israelis acted " because they want it to be over before the next administration comes in " .
He added : " They can't predict how the next administration will handle it .
And this is not the way they want to start with the new administration . "
Israeli officials denied this , saying the Israeli election in February was more a factor than Obama 's take - over .
Bush started his presidency determined not to expend much effort on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict , after watching his predecessor , Bill Clinton , devote his last months in office in a futile attempt to bring peace .
Over the last year , Bush has made half - hearted attempts at reheating peace plans .
Obama 's proposed secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , and various other foreign policy advisers would like to mount another attempt at resolving the conflict .
But Obama has other foreign policy issues competing for his attention such as the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq and the escalating conflict in Afghanistan .
Today , I realised that my customer is running sed for more than an hour and the strange thing is that the input file is no more than a few MB .
Also the pattern in sed is pretty straightforward doing global substitution .
BTW , it is running on Solaris 10
Is this the natural of the problem that takes sed to run that long or sed is inefficient in certain circumstances ?
In this exercise , I created a file with 2000 lines .
The first line has 12 characters and all subsequent lines are having an increment of 12 characters with the last line of 24000 characters .
sed 's / \\\\/@/g;s/\\/@/g' took 35 + minutes on my Sun Fire V440 .
That 's really inefficient .
Okay , sed is definitely not the right tool for his job .
Let 's take a look at the other alternative .
Perl has this " - p " flag that allow your in - line code to be wrap around a
while ( <> ) { ... # your script } loop so that you can write a one - liner .
Guess what ,
Perl took only 5 seconds to finish that substitution .
Hey , that 's a lot of CPU cycles saved !

Why did the Washington Post censor today ’s Doonesbury comic strip ?
Many times over the years , newspapers have chosen not to run Doonesbury comic strips for one reason or another .
Creator Garry Trudeau often focuses on topics that editors and readers find offensive .
Today , the Washington Post was so offended that it refused to run the strip .
What was the topic they found so offensive ?
Was it sex ?
Drugs ?
Crude language ?
No , the topic was the recent layoffs at the Washington Post .
Instead , they ran a “ Doonesbury Flashback ” strip–a rerun .
So much for the WaPo , that vaunted bastion of free speech and truth .
The real question , though , should be , why does any newspaper still run Doonesbury ?
It has n’t been funny in at least 35 years .
It ’s the Janeane Garafalo of comic strips .
Here , thanks to MediaBistro , is today ’s censored strip .

LOS ANGELES 
The state of California  its deficits ballooning , its lawmakers intransigent and its governor apparently bereft of allies or influence  appears headed off the fiscal rails .
Since the fall , when lawmakers began trying to attack the gaps in the $ 143 billion budget that their earlier plan had not addressed , the state has fallen into deeper financial straits , with more bad news coming daily from Sacramento .
The state , nearly out of cash , has laid off scores of workers and put hundreds more on unpaid furloughs .
It has stopped paying counties and issuing income tax refunds and halted thousands of infrastructure projects .
Twenty - thousand layoff notices will go out on Tuesday morning , Matt David , the communications director for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , said Monday night .
“ In the absence of a budget we need to realize this savings and the process takes six months , ” Mr. David said .
After negotiating nonstop from Saturday afternoon until late Sunday night on a series of budget bills that would have closed a projected $ 41 billion deficit , state lawmakers failed to get enough votes to close the deal and adjourned .
They returned to the Capitol on Monday morning and labored into the evening but still failed to reach a deal .
They planned to reconvene at 10 a.m. Tuesday to go at it again .

The fallingremains of two satellites obliterated in a devastating space collision last weekmay be behind weekend reports of fireballs spotted over parts of Texas and Kentucky , local media and weather officials said Sunday .
Earliertoday , residents across parts of central Texas reported numerous sightings of abright fireball streaking across the daytime sky , according to several accountsby local television stations and newspapers .
The Federal Aviation Authorities ( FAA ) issued an advisory to aircraft pilots on Saturday alerting them of potentialhazards from re-entering debris from the in - space collisionof two satellites last Tuesday .
Texas ?s KBTXNews 10 station reported numerous sightings from residents who spotted the fireballsor heard rumbling sounds earlier on Sunday .
The Waco Tribune - Heraldnewspaper cited reports from residents who described hearing an explosion - like soundthat rattled windows and shook houses .
In both reports , FAA officialsattributed the sightings as stemming from re-entering debris from the satellitecollision , though none of the debris appeared to fall all the way to theground .
Last week , thedefunct Russian military satellite Cosmos 2251 slammed into the active U.S.communications satellite Iridium 33 as they flew about 490 miles ( 790 km ) aboveSiberia .
The collision destroyed bothsatellites , creating two large clouds of debris made up of hundreds ofindividual pieces , some of which may remain inorbit for up to 10,000 years , Russian mission experts have said .
Officialsat the U.S. Strategic Command , which oversees the U.S. Defense Department ?
sSpace Surveillance
Network that continuously tracks the more than 18,000 separatepieces of space debris in orbit today , said they did receive a report of the Texassightings on Sunday .
U.S. AirForce Lt. Col. Terry Plumb , a spokesperson for the U.S. Strategic Command , toldSPACE.com that the center received a 911 call from just outside Houston , Texas , butwas awaiting confirmation that it was actually caused by debris from the Iridium 33 - Cosmos 2251 satellite crash .
? We haven ?
treceived any official reports here yet , ?
Plumb said .
Late Friday , similar sky sightings were also received by National Weather Service ( NWS ) centersin parts of Kentucky .
Like Sunday ?s reports , the descriptions of explosions inthe sky and earthquake - like rumbles were attributed to the likely re-entry of debrisfrom the satellite collision , NWS officials in Jackson , Kentucky said in astatement .
? TheFederal Aviation Administration has reported to local law enforcement that theseevents are being caused by falling satellite debris , ? the announcement stated .
?
Thesepieces of debris have been causing sonic booms ?
resulting in the vibrationsbeing felt by some residents ?
as well as flashes of light across the sky .?
A phonecall to the FAA ?s Southern Region branch , which includes Kentucky and othersouthern and eastern states , was not immediately returned Sunday .
Brian Schoettmer , a meteorologist with the Jackson NWS office , told SPACE.com thatresidents across several counties in eastern central Kentucky called theirlocal NWS branches to report the odd sky sightings .
? This was apretty rare call , ?
Schoettmer said , adding that the FAA told his office thatthe reports may have been caused by falling debris from the satellite crash .
?
Reallyrare , actually .?
NASAscientists are tracking the debris from last week ?s satellite crash to determine the risk it poses tothe many science and communications satellites in Earth orbit , including the Hubble Space Telescope .
The debris also slightly raised the chances of debris damagingthe International Space Station , which orbits the Earth at an altitude ofabout 220 miles ( 354 km ) - much lower than the satellite crash site - but the increasein risk is relatively minor , NASA officials have said .
Maximizing space in overcrowded cities is a key value in construction projects nowadays .
The Giken Company from Japan has figured out an ingenious way to apply this principle to storage facilities , by literally turning building - making upside down with fully - automated underground garages for bikes ( and even cars ) .
Giken 's ' Eco- park ' parking structures are secure , simple , and useful .
They 're also quite cool .
Unmanned by attendants , they are defined by a small garage outpost coming out of the ground that would be mistaken for aerodynamic ATMs if you did n't know anything about them .
In order to use it , you 're supposed to find an open hub and place the wheels on the aluminum runway .
Then , in an adjacent slot , you have to swipe your membership card , for which you pay a monthly fee .
Once the machine IDs your account , the doors of the garage open , and a locking base comes out in order to dock the bike .
Then – whoosh !
The bike is sucked into the hub quick and the doors close dramatically .
Within 10 - 25 seconds , your bike has descended into the deep machinery abyss underground .
But do n't worry , it 's safe and sound .
The locking base is switched underground and suspended in place in its own railway .
Each garage includes 144 railways for bikes , which must abide by a certain length , height , and tire size ( at 28 - inches ) .
Still , it 's definitely a space saver .
Check out the video below to see how the process looks like .
So far , I have n't heard of machine complications that would crush bikes or make them fly off their railway .
In fact , Giken is confident about the structure 's ability to handle potential structural damage .
According to its website , Eco-parks are made with prefabricated structural cylinder piles that are ' pressed - in ' to the ground with large piling machines that minimize vibration and noise .
It takes fifty working days to build the structure from start to finish .
Apparently , Giken is one of the leading construction businesses using this tech and has been used before to build tidal / flood defense systems .
Appropriately for this area of the world , the cylinder 's wall structure ( only about 23 ft. in diameter ) is also designed to handle strong earthquakes .
Not surprisingly , Giken has also implemented the system for car garages .
For that , the company needs about 63 feet in diameter to fit an underground cylinder storing fifty cars .
But what if the bike ( or car ) inevitably gets stuck or the city needs to make a repair ?
For that , there 's a cubbyhole that allows a designated engineer to go under and fix it .
Currently , it costs about $ 30 ( in Yen ) for a monthly ticket and students pay half that amount .
What do you guys think ?
Should we try to get these in some of our most crowded cities ?
Would you trust the machine to take care of your car or bike for hours at a time ?
Let us know in the comments below .
If you 've found more of these machines in Japan or elsewhere , let me know at jferm80@gmail.com .

Athletes always need more protein .
If you are n’t sure how much you need , read about how much protein you should eat .
Or maybe you would rather skip straight to protein shake recipes .
If not , read on …
Optimum Nutrition
The problem with most protein powders is that they taste like cardboard .
I found a company called Optimum Nutrition that puts out some great inexpensive protein powder .
I have n’t really bought anything else in several years now .
Optimum Nutrition protein powder tastes pretty good , but we can still realize a ton of benefits by learning to mix it with some of the other healthiest foods .
In my 13 years experience whipping up protein concoctions I have retained a couple favorite combinations .
Get some protein , get some groceries , and enjoy .
My Top 21 Favorite Foods to Mix with Protein Powder
Milk – Just use milk instead of water for more flavor , more thickness , and more calories .
Try goat ’s milk for an extra health kick .
Cream –
Use instead of milk or water for way more flavor and calories .
Fruit – Blend it up and it ’s called a fruit smoothie .
Try strawberries and bananas .
Add fruit to just about all of these other recipes .
Fruit adds vitamins , minerals , and antioxidants so do n’t hesitate to add it to anything .
Nuts –
Mix or blend with walnuts , almonds , pecans , and sunflower seeds .
Adds healthy fats and a nutty aftertaste to everything .
You could probably use peanuts too , but honestly peanuts are n’t that great for you .
All Natural Peanut Butter – Use peanut butter to make Peanut Butter Protein Balls using this recipe .
These are so good .
Oatmeal – Make strawberry or chocolate protein oatmeal for a high fiber breakfast .
I have also added 1/4 cup of raw oatmeal to a plain chocolate protein shake .
Cereal – Cereal is generally not too good for you unless you ’re eating something like Total or Special K , Grapenuts , or Kashi ; and that ’s exactly what I ’m recommending here .
Add a scoop or two of protein powder to your healthy cereal … it ’s perfect because it already has milk !
Cottage Cheese – Just use 1/4 cup of protein powder at the most and add a few drops of water if it gets too thick .
Read a post all about cottage cheese recipes .
Add fruit and nuts as desired .
Optimum Nutrition
Protein Powder Pancakes – Everyone that ’s been reading this blog for a while knows about protein pancakes .
Just add 1/2 a scoop to the mix and a little water to thin it out .
Add fruit and nuts as desired .
Ice Cream or Frozen Yogurt – Blend together for a weight gainer treat .
Add fruit and nuts as desired .
Dessert Mix –
For more junk food , mix the protein powder with brownie mix , cookie mix , or any sort of dessert bread or loaf .
Pudding Mix –
You can make protein pudding with just about any flavor of pudding or protein .
You can choose low fat pudding or regular .
Check out The Hulk Protein Shake for a swell pistachio flavored snack .
Apple Juice and Caramel Flavoring – Mix it with vanilla protein for a caramel apple dessert .
Add fruit and nuts as desired .
Other Juices –
You can also use pretty much any other juice or even Gatorade .
Try orange juice , cranberry juice , and someone one recommended green Gatorade but I do n’t know anything about it .
Yogurt – Particularly low - fat or non -fat yogurt mixed with fruit or vanilla flavored protein powder .
Blend it with fruit for an even thicker fruit smoothie .
Add fruit and nuts as desired .
Pasta Sauce –
Or any other thick heavily flavored sauce .
The catch is that it has to be unflavored protein powder .
Eggs and Egg Whites – Mix unflavored protein powder into any recipe that is primarily made with eggs .
From what I understand , cooking the protein powder somewhat denatures the protein , making it less useful to your body , but it ’s better than no protein at all .
Fact : nearly all macronutrient enzymes are in some way compromised at heats in excess of 160 degrees C. Mashed Potatoes – Once again you ’ll need to use unflavored protein powder , but it will make you feel so much better about eating your mashed potatoes .
Add a splash of milk or cream if the potatoes become too thick .
Sweeteners – Add any type of syrup if you do n’t care about carbs , and add any type of artificial sweetener ( I prefer Splenda ) if you want to avoid sweetening your protein with sugar .
Coffee –
The secret is to mix up a scoop of protein with milk , then add the milk concoction to your coffee .
Homemade protein bars .
Let me know if I ’ve left anything out .
Hopefully between the post and the comments we ’ll have even more than 21 great foods to mix with protein powder .

New Solar Cells Will be Printed Like Money
February 20th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Australian scientists at CSIRO ’s Victorian Organic Solar Cell Consortium ( VICOSC ) are on a quest to make solar cells as easy to print as money .
Trials of the flexible , large area , cost - effective , reel - to - reel printable plastic solar cells will even be conducted by Securency International — a banknote printing company .
CSIRO researchers have devised a way to essentially print organic solar cells onto polymer .
Once the cells become commercially viable , it will be easy — and cheap –to install them over large areas like rooftops .
VICOSC ’s 3 - year $ A12 million project is at its halfway point , with trials six months ahead of schedule .
Members of VICOSC include researchers from CSIRO Future Manufacturing Flagship , University of Melbourne , Monash University .

Liam Neeson tries to be reasonable .
Genre films are beginning to creep back into theaters after the big parade of Oscar - contenders — praise be to God — and one of them , a little actioner called Taken , is now tops at the box - office and deserves a quick hosanna .
( Not that the Oscar nominees are n’t an exciting topic too .
Oh golly no .
I ’ve been meaning to write all about them and somehow just have n’t gotten around to it .
After all , what could be more riveting than making a case for which heart - tugging spectacle should win Best Picture , The Curious Case of Benjamin Button or Slumdog Millionaire ?
Or wondering whether Meryl Streep even has room in her bathroom for another Oscar ?
Stars all keep their awards in their bathrooms , see , to show how joshy and down - to - earth they are !
It ’s fascinating ! )
Taken is a short , punchy B - movie , countering the ever - longer and more brooding big - budget action spectacles we ’ve been seeing for a while now ( the Bournes , the Bonds , the Batmans ) .
Luc Besson , best known for directing La Femme Nikita , The Professional , and The Fifth Element , is producer and co-screenwriter here ( with frequent collaborator Robert Mark Kamen ) , and through his company Europacorp he ’s grinding out consistently lively B-action fare like the Transporter series , assorted Jett Li movies , etc. Besson and director Pierre Morel last gave us the eye - popper 2004 action - fan - fave District B13 .
Their new one , Taken , is an old - fashioned vigilante film about a father rescuing his daughter from sex slavers who will , naturally , die in droves .
The formula is freshened up with some unlikely casting : Liam Neeson as the lethal dad .
Neeson is one of those stodgy respected actors , Irish , obviously , and with all sorts of classic stage roles and prestige pictures to his credit .
He ’s an odd fit for the part of an ex-CIA American with an impressive homicidal skill - set who ’s given it all up in order to repair his relationship with his teenage daughter ( Maggie Grace ) .
But it works pretty well .
Neeson is sad - faced and lumbering and low - wattage , which is great for the early scenes when he goes through the ritual everyday - life humiliations that will key us all up to watch him do maximum damage later .
He lives in a crap apartment in L.A. , and he ’s scorned by his gratuitously mean ex-wife ( Famke Janssen , who really ought to think about whether she needs the money this bad ) and her rich buffoon of a second husband ( Xander Berkeley ) .
Sad Dad also has to take stupid jobs to get by , like guarding a Britney - esque pop singer at a concert where someone with a sensitive ear for music is sure to want her dead .
In his free time , he sits around at home staring at photos of his daughter .
Some action fans will wonder if we needed to see quite so much corny daughter - love and cringy dad- humiliation before getting to the action .
It IS a little weird , the lingering thoroughness of the set - up .
But it makes sense in the long run .
They ’re piling it on in the old - melodrama style , so that when the daughter finally gets abducted while on a trip to Paris , by evil Albanians yet , the violent payback can be unleashed with a whoosh .
When I saw it , you could hear the whole audience settle tensely in their seats , as if to say , “ Okay , NOW it ’s on . ”
Because Neeson is big and slow - looking — in certain shots he looks like Frankenstein ’s monster ’s handsome brother — there ’s a real pleasure in seeing him break somebody ’s face swiftly and efficiently .
He can run , too , with a sort of speeding - train heftiness .
And he looks invariably stoic , with a nice middle - aged melancholy in his creased face .
He ’s even reasonable a lot of the time .
If they ’d just give his daughter back , everybody could walk away .
But they wo n’t .
And this begins to irritate him .
At one point , he shoots somebody who ’s pleading , “ Wait , we can nego — ! ”
It was great to be back in the atmosphere of intense audience involvement after seeing so many films viewed in the dutiful stupor produced by “ quality ” cinema .
There ’s a scene in Taken when Neeson gets jumped , and we all groaned “ Ohhhh ! ! ” in unison .
If there had been time to warn him , someone probably would ’ve shouted , “ Look behind you ! ”
Of course , this kind of audience identification flushes out some unpleasant emotions as well .
I was in an urban downtown theater that ’s going to seed , and there were some of the usual fringe types there , exuding vague menace .
These are often middle - aged men who look broke and on the edge , and each one sits alone in simmering silence .
Occasionally one will boil over and yell something at the screen .
This time around , it was , “ Slap her ! ” , regarding Famke Janssen ’s harpy ex-wife character .
Awkward .
There can be no question that movies like this are built to give an adrenaline rush that ’s stoked , in part , by bitter resentments , crude old prejudices , and weird lusts .
All that daughter - love , for example , devolves into some very peculiar scenes like the one when the girl ’s virginity is being auctioned off to zillionaire creeps in glass booths , and her dad winds up putting in a bid himself .
In order to save her , of course .
But yeesh !
( This calls to mind aspects of Luc Besson ’s earlier work , like , for example , The Professional , which focuses on disturbingly beautiful twelve - year - old Natalie Portman , dressed and acting like she ’s twenty - five .
Besson has her telling baggy - eyed old hitman Jean Reno that she has very strong feelings for him in her , uh , lower - stomach area .
One suspects Besson ’s got issues . )
In short , any sensitivity to aggressive misogyny and racial stereotyping — which are long - standing components of the action film , as well as most of the artworks of Western Civilization , and are more or less the price to be paid for enjoying them — should be checked at the theater door or untold suffering will result .
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is asking Bank of America Corp. BAC , - 1.32 % and a lawyer for Merrill Lynch for information on $ 3.62 billion in bonuses paid by Merrill in 2008 even though the investment firm logged billions in losses , The Wall Street Journal reported late Tuesday on its Web site .
The committee is trying to determine whether it was misled about the timing of the bonuses .
Last week , New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , who is conducting his own probe , said Merrill misled Congress in a Nov. 24 letter that said a decision on the bonuses had not been made even though a decision to speed up bonus payments had been made two weeks beforehand .
Venezuela : OPEC's Dilemma
Venezuela has decided it needs to pump more oil .
It has a simple problem .
The nation ’s income has cascaded as oil prices have fallen from more than $ 140 last summer to under $ 40 now .
What it cannot get in price , the South American nation needs to make up in volume .
The viability of the Chavez government may hinge on its ability to keep the cash rolling in to cover the costs of social programs and the building and repair of the nation ’s infrastructure .
According to Bloomberg , “ Venezuela plans to boost oil output at least 12 percent in a joint venture with foreign investors that will cost more than twice what the government previously estimated . ”
In other words , if the country does not have a full Treasury because it does not have oil revenue , then borrowing to get capital to produce more oil comes at a high price .
Who wants to risk lending to a country that cannot pay its bills ?
Venezuela is beginning to look like a large number of other large oil exporting countries , both inside and outside OPEC .
Canada is being driven into a deep recession because of the falling price of its plentiful crude .
The problem is more acute in Russia .
Iran has indicated that it cannot fund its budget without oil above $ 70 .
Banking systems in some of the large Arab countries are seeking government assistance as their access to capital drops .
The problem is now nearly unsolvable , and it greatly benefits oil consumers .
The dilemma is simple .
As crude prices fall , the only way that Venezuela can bring in more capital is by raising exports .
That floods the market with more supply , taking down prices even further .
Based on that trend , which is not likely to go away , crude is headed under $ 30 .
Douglas A. McIntyre
What is going to happen with the stimulus , that injection of almost $ 800 billion into the economy ?
It s not going to work .
That huge mass of dollars will generate inflation .
The United States economy is becoming Latin- Americanized .
But is that going to create jobs or not ?
It will create jobs artificially .
Many decades ago , the great economist Henry Hazlitt came up with a wonderful example :
Why dont we break every glass window ?
Suddenly , millions of people will be needed to manufacture new window panes and install them .
The economy grows in a healthy manner when businesses discover and satisfy a real need in the market , when they generate benefits and invest part of their earnings .
So , are there good and bad jobs ?
Sure .
Heres another anecdote , attributed to Milton Friedman .
During a visit to China , he was shown a huge dam and saw thousands of workers digging with shovels .
Friedman asked why didnt they use mechanical excavators that would do the job better and faster .
He was told there was a need to give jobs to a lot of people .
Friedman smiled ironically and replied :  In that case , why dont you use spoons instead of shovels ?
That way , youll need a lot more workers . 
The rational objective of any healthy economic activity is to do as much as possible with the least amount of resources possible and in the shortest time possible .
But didnt Roosevelts New Deal increase public spending ?
Yes , and it was a disaster .
In 1941 , when the United States entered World War II , the economy still hadnt emerged from the 1929 Depression .
So , was the war the event that saved the U.S. economy ?
No , it didnt .
That s a widespread superstition .
The European countries that did not participate in the war , such as Sweden and Switzerland , grew more than the United States in those years .
What happened , beginning in 1941 , was that the U.S. economy had touched bottom and was starting to grow .
By the time the war ended and the First World was half - destroyed , the United States was generating half of whatever was produced worldwide .
Wars ruin countries , as was shown in Korea , Vietnam and today in Afghanistan and Iraq .
What originated the current crisis ?
What originates all crises , including those at a personal level : the United States was spending more than it produced .
Specifically , it was spending 106 percent of its production .
But , doesnt the government tell society to keep on spending ?
It does , but , because people are more prudent than the government , they calibrate their expenses well and begin to save , to prepare for a period of recession .
How long will this crisis last ?
According to Steven Pearlstein , who won a Pulitzer for accurately predicting the oncoming disaster , the financial crisis will last through 2009 ; the economic crisis , in general , once credit lines are restored , will last two more years , but nobody knows for sure .
Are the banks and financial institutions most to blame for granting absurd credit terms ?
To a great degree .
The government is blameworthy , too ; it forced those institutions to grant credit because it seemed a good thing for everyone to own a house , even if many had no resources to pay for it .
Should the banks be punished ?
Of course .
Businesses and people must pay for their mistakes .
We must let the market punish those who did their jobs poorly .
That s the way the system purges and perfects itself .
It is not a function of the State to save an enterprise that has lost the favor of consumers .
So , do you believe in the nationalization of banking ?
Yes , bankrupt banks must be temporarily absorbed by the State , even if the shareholders lose their investments ; once they are refloated , they should be privatized again , with new shareholders .
That was done in Sweden in the 1990s , during a similar crisis .
Can the crisis worsen ?
Of course it can .
As happened in the 1930s , another suicidal wave of protectionism can arise .
When Vice President Joe Biden says  Buy American and encourages economic nationalism , hes predicating nonsense .
Societies become wealthy by broadening their free trade , not by restricting it .
Besides , protectionism is an act contrary to the consumers freedom .
That cup of coffee that many gym rats , bikers and runners swill before a workout does more than energize them .
It kills some of the pain of athletic exertion , a new study suggests .
And it works regardless of whether a person already had a coffee habit or not .
Caffeine works on a system in the brain and spinal cord ( the adenosine neuromodulatory system ) that is heavily involved in pain processing , says University of Illinois kinesiology and community health professor Robert Motl .
And since caffeine blocks adenosine , the biochemical that plays an important role in energy transfer and thus exercise , he speculated that it could reduce pain .
So the researcher , a former competitive cyclist , divided 25 fit , college - aged males into two distinct groups : subjects whose everyday caffeine consumption was extremely low to non-existent , and those with an average caffeine intake of about 400 milligrams a day , the equivalent of three to four cups of coffee .
Unexpected results
After completing an initial exercise test in the lab on a stationary bike to determine maximal oxygen consumption or aerobic power , subjects returned for two monitored high - intensity , 30 - minute exercise sessions .
An hour prior to each session , cyclists — who had been instructed not to consume caffeine during the prior 24 - hour period — were given a pill .
On one occasion , it contained a dose of caffeine measuring 5 milligrams per kilogram of body weight ( equivalent to two to three cups of coffee ) ; the other time , they received a placebo .
During both exercise periods , subjects ' perceptions of quadriceps muscle pain was recorded at regular intervals , along with data on oxygen consumption , heart rate and work rate .
" What we saw is something we did n't expect , " Motl said .
" Caffeine - naïve individuals and habitual users have the same amount of reduction in pain during exercise after caffeine ( consumption ) . "
The results are detailed in the April edition of the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism .
Co-authors included Steven P. Broglio of the University of Illinois and Sigurbjorn A. Arngrimsson of the Center for Sport and Health Sciences , Iceland University of Education .
" Clearly , if you regularly consume caffeine , you have to have more to have that bigger , mental - energy effect , " Motl said .
" But the tolerance effect is not ubiquitous across all stimuli .
Even brain metabolism does n't show this tolerance - type effect .
That is , with individuals who are habitual users versus non-habitual users , if you give them caffeine and do brain imaging , the activation is identical .
It 's really interesting why some processes show tolerance and others do n't . "
Regarding the outcome of the current research , he said , it may be that tolerance to caffeine plays no role in the way it diminishes pain during exercise .
Motl said one of the next logical steps for his research team would be to conduct studies with rodents in order to better understand the biological mechanism for caffeine in reducing pain .
" If we can get at the biological mechanism , we can begin to understand why there may or may not be this kind of tolerance . "
Will it help you win ?
Motl previously has conducted other studies on the relationship between physical activity and caffeine , and considered such variables as exercise intensity , dose of caffeine , anxiety sensitivity and gender .
A future research direction might be to determine caffeine 's effect on sport performance .
" We 've shown that caffeine reduces pain reliably , consistently during cycling , across different intensities , across different people , different characteristics .
But does that reduction in pain translate into an improvement in sport performance ? " he said .
Meanwhile , the current research could prove encouraging for a range of people , including the average person who wants to become more physically active to realize the health benefits .
" One of the things that may be a practical application , is if you go to the gym and you exercise and it hurts , you may be prone to stop doing that because pain is an aversive stimulus that tells you to withdraw , " Motl said .
" So if we could give people a little caffeine and reduce the amount of pain they 're experiencing , maybe that would help them stick with that exercise . "
ORLANDO , Fla .  Tiger Woods returned to the top Sunday like some inexorable force , stalking with an almost frightening purposefulness to overtake Sean O’Hair and his five - stroke lead in the Arnold Palmer Invitational .
As has become his custom , Woods delivered the stunning coup de grâce with a flourish on Bay Hill ’s 18th green , sinking a 15 - foot putt in the heart of the hole as darkness fell .
Just as he did a year ago , and as he did in 2001 in his second of six victories in this tournament , Woods waited to erase doubts until every shot had been hit .
Then he stroked the winning putt .
This time it was for a round of 67 and a five - under - par 275 total , one stroke better than O’Hair , who closed with a 73 .
Woods ’s climb from five strokes back matched the largest comeback in his PGA Tour career .
He also came back from five down at the 2000 Pebble Beach Pro-Am .
But there was no cap thrown to the ground in exultation , just a quick two - step to his left as the ball moved toward the hole , and a trademark fist - pump , like a hard right hook to the jaw to those who thought he could not win .
Woods embraced his caddie , Steve Williams , and flashed a megawatt victory grin for the first time in a long time .
He sentenced Mr. Eppolito to life plus 100 years , and fined him $ 4.75 million ; Mr. Caracappa got life plus 80 years , and a fine of $ 4.25 million .
The judge said both men were likely to have “ hidden assets ” from their crimes .
Yet one asset  in plain sight  might not be seized to pay their debts .
Both men have been drawing tax - free disability pensions from the city since they left the Police Department , according to city records .
Mr. Caracappa , who retired in 1992 as a first - grade detective , receives $ 5,313 a month .
Mr. Eppolito , who retired in 1990 as a second - grade detective , is paid $ 3,896 a month .
Because they retired before they were accused of crimes , their pensions will continue .
Moreover , the pensions are not subject to seizure for payment of the fines , said Joseph A. Bondy , the lawyer for Mr. Caracappa .
“ I fought the government for Peter Gotti when they tried to garnish a disability pension , and we won , ” said Mr. Bondy , who defended Mr. Gotti on murder and racketeering charges in 2004 .
Under state law , public pensions are treated as property held in trust for the employees , and periodic efforts to make their forfeiture a penalty for corrupt public employees have failed .
The Daily News reported last year that 450 corrupt former officials , judges and police officers were receiving pensions .
While both men have families , the two are likely to have little use in prison for the tax - free bounty that , in theory , they earned during the years that , a jury found , they were also killing for the Mafia , setting up informants for death or exposure , and poring through confidential police computers in service of the organized crime figures who were providing them with regular payoffs .
The Tesla Roadster , a marvel of design and engineering , has a cool factor of 10 .
But at a base MSRP of $ 109,000 with only small production runs , it is out of reach for the majority of consumers both in price and availability .
It has always been Tesla ’s plan to start up - market and cascade down , using the revenue and momentum to offer more affordable cars in greater supply .
That vision will be one step closer to reality when their Tesla Model S prototype sedan is unveiled on March 26th at the Tesla design studio , located inside the SpaceX rocket factory in Hawthorne , California .
In preparation , the company has released the teaser image above and confirmed an “ anticipated base price ” for the Tesla Model S at $ 57,400 .
Because there is a $ 7,500 federal tax credit available , that should drop real costs closer to $ 49,900 .
Tesla believes that because the car will have reduced maintenance and refueling overhead , lifetime ownership costs will match cars that have much cheaper sticker prices .
Specific details concerning the Model S will be available at launch .

Larry Fitzgerald was scoring for the Cardinals when the coverage was hit
US sports fans in Arizona got a surprise when their TV coverage of American football 's Super Bowl was interrupted by a pornographic film .
Tucson - based KVOA -TV said it was " dismayed and disappointed " after some cable viewers had their match coverage disrupted towards the end of the game .
The company said the material was only seen by viewers of one cable network .
" KVOA will investigate what happened and make sure our viewers get answers , " company president Gary Nielsen said .
" When the NBC feed of the Super Bowl was transmitted from KVOA to local cable providers and through over - the - air antennas , there was no pornographic material , " he added .
Comcast , the cable company whose viewers saw the material , said it was investigating .
Local media outlets reported that they received calls from furious viewers .
The clip showed a woman unzipping a man 's trousers , followed by a graphic act between the two .
" I just figured it was another commercial until I looked up , " viewer Cora King told the Arizona Daily Star .
" Then he did his little dance with everything hanging out . "
The interruption happened just after the last touchdown by the Arizona Cardinals , who lost the match to the Pittsburgh Steelers .
Ron Paul has introduced H.R.1207 : Federal Reserve Transparency
Act of 2009 to Congress and it's been referred to the House Committee on Financial Services .
According to Campaign for Liberty , " The Fed has so far resisted attempts to provide information on how it is spending the bailout money and currently dictates how accountable it will be to Congress .
Since its creation in 1913 , the Fed 's control of money and credit in this country has resulted in a 95 % devaluation of our dollar and the piling up , just in the last year , of almost $ 10 trillion in bailouts and loans . "
You can read the whole bill in less than five minutes !
Unlike the stimulus and omnibus , this one is short and does n't include any pork !

It was probably inevitable that the American left would turn sharply against the war in Afghanistan the moment it was politically opportune .
Still , the speed with which it has done so has been breathtaking .
Time was when the received bipartisan and trans -Atlantic wisdom about Afghanistan was that it was the necessary war , the good war , the no - choice - but - to - fight and can 't - afford - to - lose war , and that not least of everything that made the invasion and occupation of Iraq such arrant folly was that it distracted us from " finishing ...

Chinese characters throughout the world .
The darkest green areas ( Taiwan and South Korea ) use unsimplified characters , China and Japan use their own simplified characters , and the light green areas have done away with them in daily life .
( For the purposes of this post , Chinese = Mandarin .
There are many other types of " Chinese " in existence of course )

Ever wondered how the Chinese language is perceived in Korea and Japan , two countries located right next to China with languages that are originally unrelated but strongly influenced by Chinese characters ?
Well , here 's how .
First of all , the basics : Japanese and Korean have a very similar grammar and word order , and may or may not have originated from the same language a long time ago ( the Altaic language theory , which includes languages like Turkish , Mongolian and Manchu as well ) .
That 's a matter of debate , but from the point of view of the student this is a moot point , because whether or not the languages were originally the same tongue thousands of years ago the similarities they have now make them both incredibly easy to learn compared to a language like English .
That 's why when translating from Korean to Japanese or the other way around it 's largely a matter of retaining the same word order and translating piece by piece , as opposed to having to entirely rearrange the word order as is the case when translating from Korean to English or vice versa .
Chinese characters ( known as hanzi in Chinese , hanja in Korean , kanji in Japanese ) have had a huge effect on the two languages similar to the effect of the Greco - Latin vocabulary present in English , which has pervaded the language so much that it 's impossible to write anything of any great length without using Greco - Latin vocabulary ( I know , I tried translating an article into Germanic - only English and it was pretty much impossible ) .
Korean and Japanese are the same way in that they simply do n't function without these loanwords made from Chinese characters .
About 70 % of the vocabulary in English comes from foreign sources , and the ratio is about the same with Korean and Japanese .
Now , here 's what the two languages look like .
First Japanese : Japanese is written with a mix of hiragana ( for Japanese words , grammatical particles and when you do n't know the kanji for a word or do n't want to use kanji ) , katakana ( mostly for loanwords , places and animal / plant names that used to use kanji ) and kanji .
If you 're Chinese you will probably be able to understand some of the words above but not their context : words like encyclopedia ( 百科事典 ) , who ( 誰 ) , new ( 新 ) , detailed ( 詳 ) , read ( 読 ) , etc. , so better than nothing at all but certainly not enough to understand what has been written .
And since Japanese uses hiragana most of the time to show what role a word is playing in a sentence , knowing the kanji alone wo n't tell you whether this word : 新しいor this word : 新しくないmeans new .
They both use the character for new but the latter actually says ( atarashikunai ) as opposed to the former which says ( atarashii ) .
So kanji play a crucial role in Japanese but kanji are never used alone .
Korean is largely the same , except that its Chinese characters ( hanja ) are now mostly hidden .
It looks like this :
This is what Korea looks like most of the time now , and it 's only every once in a while that you 'll see a hanja character here and there , mostly in the newspaper when writing a person 's name or using hanja in headlines to save space ( 日 for Japan , 中 for China , etc ) .
If you take the three sentences above though and include the hanja as the language used to be written though , it looks like this :
Now once again you have a situation like that with Japanese , with Chinese characters surrounded by unknown grammatical particles that change their role in the sentence , and if you 're Chinese you 'll only understand a few words : peace ( actually means hello ) , hanja , now , opinion , user .
So that 's a basic rundown of the role of Chinese characters in the two languages .
So what does Chinese look , feel and sound like to someone from Korea and Japan ?
The best analogy to give would be this : imagine a language written in Greek letters that only used simplified Greco - Roman vocabulary , and with different pronunciation as well as tones .
You would find words that were only used as word roots in English being used as standalone words , so perhaps words likefor bird ( ornithopter ) , for no or not ( atheism vs. theism ) , for lead ( induct ) , for light ( lumination ) , for " by oneself " ( automobile ) , and so on ... and then shorten the words somewhat , and add tones .
Perhaps auto would sound likewith a falling tone , duc would becomewith a rising tone or something like that .
Also change the word order and simplify the grammar ( no irregular verbs , no more cases for pronouns , etc ) .
Add to that of course a ton of unfamiliar words that are present in that language but never adopted as loanwords in English .
To illustrate this I 'll take the beginning of A Tale of Two Cities and transform it into a Catalan - looking text with fewer consonant endings and a different word order .
The original English : It was the best of times , it was the worst of times , it was the age of wisdom , it was the age of foolishness , it was the epoch of belief , it was the epoch of incredulity , it was the season of Light , it was the season of Darkness , it was the spring of hope , it was the winter of despair ...
Il milló de tempo es , il pitjó de tempo es , il era de saviesa es , il era de stupidesa es , il època de creença es , il època de noncreença es , il stació de Llum es , il stació de Tenebra es , il primavera de sperança es , il hivena de nonsperança es ... This is roughly what Chinese feels like to someone from Korea or Japan .
Now some more basic facts on the current situation : Chinese characters used to have a unified script , but some time after WWII ( I do n't remember the exact dates ) Japan and Mainland China adopted a simplified form .
The two countries each adopted their own simplified forms however , and at the same time Taiwan certainly did n't want to have anything to do with what the PRC was doing , and both Koreas were working toward getting rid of the characters in everyday life , and thus there was no drive for simplification in Korea ( technically they have simplified characters which are largely the same as in Japan but with some resembling Chinese but they are largely unused ) .
This resulted in Korea and Taiwan using the same script for their Chinese characters , but of course since Koreans do n't use them in daily life much at all anymore the majority of people in their 30s or so can't read for than a few dozen .
Here 's what the three systems look like .
First of all , simplification does n't apply to every single character , which means that there are a large number of characters that are still written exactly the same no matter where you are :
There are also a lot of characters that are written in largely the same way but have a few stylistic differences : ( Korea / Taiwan ) ( Japan / China ) ( Korea / Taiwan ) ( Japan / China ) then there are those that have been partially simplified and usually in the same way , meaning that if you know a character in one language and also know how the one part is simplified in another you can then read them all ( kind of like how the suffix - in English usually becomes - in Spanish and - in French ) .
Learning how each country simplifies its radicals in this way will take care of the majority of what you need to know when getting used to another script . ( Korea ) ( Japan / Taiwan ) ( China ) ( Korea / Taiwan / Japan ) ( China ) ( Korea / Taiwan ) ( Japan ) ( China ) That means that every time you see the character on the left you can be almost certain that it will be simplified in exactly the same way in the other two scripts .
The characters in the middle for example have the seven - stroke radical on the left in Korea , Taiwan and Japan , and this is simplified every time to two strokes in Chinese , except for this one : when the radical itself stands alone .
When it's on the left though it is always simplified .
There are also characters that do n't resemble each other much at all or at all in the other scripts anymore : ( Korea / Taiwan ) ( Japan / China ) ( Korea / Taiwan ) ( Japan ) ( China ) ( Korea / Taiwan ) ( Japan / China ) ( Korea / Taiwan / Japan ) ( China ) ( Korea / Taiwan / Japan ) ( China ) ( Korea / Taiwan / Japan ) ( China ) You can see that a lot of the time Chinese stands alone in the simplification it has adopted , which makes it a lot harder to read at first until you 've gotten used to the characters .
That 's why the Chinese in Taiwan is generally much easier for people in Korea and Japan to get used to - Korea because it 's nearly identical to the Chinese characters in Korean , and Japan because 1 ) they resemble simplified Japanese characters more , and 2 ) many educated Japanese also have a familiarity with the traditional characters , called kyuujitai ( 旧字体 ) .
Edit 1 : in response to the first comment .
I 'm fluent in Japanese and Korean , somewhat proficient in Chinese but not even close to fluent .
Having learned the two others before Chinese I find it easiest to read .
Personally I prefer the Japanese kanji , because the unsimplified ones take forever to write ( is just way too many strokes for a character you use all the time - means ) while the simplified Chinese ones are simplified to the point that their etymology is n't as obvious anymore .
For example , which means electricity , is simplified to - the original has theradical on the top and characters with this usually have something to do with weather , but without it on the top it does n't look like anything .
At the same time , the radical does n't take long to write at all so there 's not really much time saved there either .
Another example is ( birth or production ) becoming .
Without thecharacter inside it ( meaning life or raw ) once again the meaning is n't obvious and you 're not saving much time .

You ask , what is our aim ?
I can answer in two words : virtual victory .
Virtual victory at all costs — despite all terror :
The Churchillian imperative is in full force throughout “ Call of Duty : World at War , ” but playing , in addition to being just plain fun , is also an incredibly visceral experience , especially for Jewish players .
Over and above their ease of use , story and visual appeal , video games can also become important cultural experiences when the creators make the world psychologically significant to the user .
By making a World War II video game that is more realistic , and with more opportunities to make choices than any previous one , software developer Treyarch has created a game that can provide deep insights about violence , history and the Nazis ’ significance as psychological demons .
It is also qualitatively superior to other shoot - ’em-ups , because of the elegant game - play and the surprisingly varied pacing of the complexly textured story .

The Reichstag Burns Again : Therapy never felt so sweet .
Video games are instructive in a personal way that books are not , because whatever the limitations , the player makes the decisions :
You navigate a character ( your avatar ) , and that becomes your character .
This process of identification removes your detachment from what is happening on the screen and scatters it into what is happening in your * real * life .
This is the fifth glittering installment of “ Call of Duty . ”
It follows the extremely popular “ Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare , ” which pitted the player against Muslim and Russian Nationalists .
In this installment , you fight in battles from the end of the war , such as Stalingrad , Peleliu and Seelow Heights .
In the U.S. Army in the Pacific theater , you are Private Miller ; when you are in the Soviet Red army , you are Private Dimitri Petreko .
The game culminates in a thrilling battle between the Red Army and the Nazis in the Reichstag .
You fight all the way up to the famous bombed - out dome , then see the defeated German army from the roof and the city of Berlin in ruins .
There is simply nothing in video games that compares to storming the Reichstag .
As a Jew , being involved in virtually ending World War II allows you to experience the closest thing possible to killing the sense of victimhood created by the Holocaust .
And you do it without actually hurting any real people .
In fact , it ’s so satisfying that when you get to shoot down the golden eagle on the Reichstag , while sniping headshots at flame - throwing Nazis , you simply do n’t want the war to end .
This is weird , of course , because the war ’s end is the ultimate goal of the game , as well as your desperately fought aim in real life .
The realistic portrayal of violence in video games is often decried .
But those who would disparage these games for being too brutal would be those who would condemn them for not showing the realities of war .
It is because of its violence that the game ushers in some of the feeling of the intensity of the battlefield .
“ Call of Duty ” is incredibly bloody .
In earlier versions , the graphics were often comical , with grenaded Nazis flying through the air like hurled vacuum cleaners .
But in this one , you can immediately see the stumps of blown - off limbs .
I am pretty sure one of my bullets penetrated someone ’s eye , because he immediately moved his hand up to his eye socket after I shot him .
Bodies crumble instead of toppling .
Corpses remain on the ground or slumped on tanks or hanging out of windows .
The nonviolent atmosphere is also very detailed .
When you have your character look up , the sky looks different depending on the time of day ; when he looks down , you sometimes see puddles .
But you have to be careful when you do either , because if you marvel too long at Treyarch ’s aesthetic achievement , you will get a bullet in the ear .
A real - world side - effect of playing too much “ Call of Duty ” is a particular form of overspill .
Familiar to anyone who has played too much of an electronic game ( I have behind me , as Churchill said , “ many , many long months of struggle and suffering ” ) , overspill is when you see the virtual world in your real world .
Occasionally , walking down the street of Brooklyn ’s Park Slope , I have looked at the roof of a particular brownstone , thinking I should be careful , because “ that would be a great place for Panzershaft . ”
And while some might suggest that this phenomenon is proof that the game can encourage animus toward a contingent “ enemy , ” I can say only that in my case , this overspill was not accompanied by any hateful emotion .
It only made my nannified neighborhood more exciting .
This is the first “ Call of Duty ” where one can play the campaign with other users online .
Through your headsets , you can speak to each other and build camaraderie with your team , sharing the experience of the virtual war .
You also can revisit the sites of the battles and play against other people .
It ’s like a virtual game of Capture the Flag .
The computer assigns you a team , so you might even find yourself fighting on the side of the Wehrmacht , which feels uncomfortable but becomes an educational experience , like seeing “ Das Boot . ”
In my time spent playing the online version , and despite the M rating , I encountered more than a few children who sounded as if their parents still attached their mittens to their coats .
The good thing about playing against kids , however , is that they tend to name themselves things like “ justabanana . ”
So my Xbox would inform me , “ You were killed by justabanana . ”
This sort of feels nice and makes you cheerfully disentangle yourself from the intensity of the game for a moment .
But unwelcome reminders of the real world also spill in , like when you are virtually killed by an adult whose user identity is “ Ihatejews666 . ”
For all the effort that the creators took to make the action convincing , there are serious shortcomings , especially to your freedom .
This highlights the still limited state of video games more than it does the missteps of the games ’ creators .
Most notably , the story consistently pushes you onward to more battle , with barely any freedom to pursue alternatives to fighting .
At one point , I found myself in a decimated Berlin library and tried to get one of the sympathetic minor characters , Chernov , also a writer , to go and look at the collection .
But he just pointed his bayonet forward , telling me that we had to keep up with the troops .
Another time , I did not want to leave Chernov behind to die alone after he experienced a vicious attack from a Nazi who jumped out from behind a pillar , so I tried to put him out of his agony with my rifle .
But the game would n’t let me .
After trying to pull the trigger , I had to move on and leave him .
In addition to having to live with what virtual violent decisions I actually made , I would have to live with what I would have done .
Although “ Call of Duty : World at War ” goes to great lengths to show some of the complexity and tragedy of war , there are no bystanders in the game .
No emaciated Jews or Japanese children running down the street in terror .
The horrors of war are significantly underrepresented .
Realism ?
Yes .
But reality ?
No .
The realism is an aesthetic in service of entertainment .
But , from time to time , the game stakes its claim to be taken seriously .
You watch as two Germans , on their knees , crying “ Bitte , ” are executed by your comrades .
Before you enter the U - Bahn , you , too , are asked by your commander to kill some surrendering Germans .
If you refuse , someone else throws a Molotov cocktail at them anyway .
Because you are in the midst of storming Berlin , you see how war can make one choose killing over capture — but it ’s deliberately jarring .
There is n’t a “ Disarm and send on their way ” button in the game , and it would be hard , I imagine , to press it in real life .
The surprising benefit of the game was that throughout my entire life , since sneaking into the synagogue library with David Yagobian and paging through a book of Nazi medical experiments , I have had nightmares about Nazis .
Jewish summer camp did n’t help .
In games like “ Call of Duty , ” you get unlimited lives ; you keep playing the game until you are victorious .
It ’s a safe place .
When your character dies , you may have to go back to a checkpoint , but this is simply inconvenient , never tragic or final .
You will always have another chance to kill your demons .
One morning , I woke up extremely aware that I had just had a Nazi dream .
No surprise , given that I wrote this review and played the game late into the night .
But I was shocked that it did not scare me as it would have done in the past :
The back of my neck was dry .
The game had subconsciously flipped a switch .
Although clearly there are still very real threats to Jews around the world , the feeling that Nazis were a threat to my existence was created by teachers and rabbis , rightly making sure that I knew my history .
In truth , that specific anxiety was not real , but virtual .
And I could vanquish it virtually , as well .
One of the tragedies of World War II , and war in general , is that it puts simple dichotomies , as opposed to realistic complexities , into our minds .
Although on the face of it , “ Call of Duty : World at War ” rewards violent methods , its overwhelming gore and possibilities for playing the heartbreaking dilemmas of the other side , present the opportunity to put those methods into context .
Training ourselves with games like this can help us resist simplistic oppositions and the brutal desire for violent justice .
Understanding the horrors of war through playing games that illustrate the complexities of violence may even help us resist the real thing .

Google recently reported strong earnings despite a weak economy ; it continues to gain search market share and its Android platform is set to take the mobile world by storm this year .
It makes one wonder : Can anything stop Google ?
Thanks to Google Maps , we now know the giant ’s one weakness : Deer .
Google today fessed - up to an interesting image that appeared on Google Maps ’ Street View recently .
It seems that one of its Street View camera vans ran over a deer somewhere near Rush , New York , and Google Maps has the pictures to prove it — to everyone .
The images , which have since been removed from Street View , showed a deer clearly standing in one picture , then as you moved forward , it was on the ground , dead .
If you really must see the grizzly details , the blog The Daily What captured them .
Google went on to explain how the ordeal played out :
The driver was understandably upset , and promptly stopped to alert the local police and the Street View team at Google .
The deer was able to move and had left the area by the time the police arrived .
The police explained to our driver that , sadly , this was not an uncommon occurrence in the region — the New York State Department of Transportation estimates that 60,000 - 70,000 deer collisions happen per year in New York alone — and no police report needed to be filed .
Having grown up in the Midwest , I can relate to how pesky these mammals can be .
I ’ve been in a car that has hit a deer , and been in at least a dozen close calls before .

The Pentagon has decided to rescind a long - standing prohibition against press coverage of returning war dead , allowing families to say whether news organizations may photograph the arrivals , Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Thursday .
The remains of all U.S. service members killed overseas are flown to Delaware ’s Dover Air Force Base .
But photographic images have been prohibited since 1991 .
The administration of President George W. Bush rigorously enforced the ban , preventing pictures of troops killed in Iraq and Afghanistan from appearing in news coverage .
The new policy will leave it up to the families of slain service members to decide whether to allow the media to photograph the arrival of the remains in Dover .
“ My conclusion was , we should not presume to make the decision for the families .
We should actually let them make it , ” Gates said .

The question of media access has deeply divided the military as well as veterans and family groups .
Some favored keeping the ban , and others wanted to give families the option of allowing the media in , said Joyce Raezer , the executive director of the National Military Family Assn .
“ We are hoping whatever comes out of this new policy accommodates a variety of wishes , ” she said .
Gates has assigned a group of Pentagon officials to work out details .
Concerns include : what to do if a flight is carrying remains of several service members and families are divided over access , or what services will be provided for families who want to be present for the return .

Many Pentagon officials have worried that opening up Dover will result in pressure on families to go to the base to meet the arriving flights .
If they do , Raezer said , the military needs to be prepared with chaplains , counselors and lodging .
“ If they are going to open it up to families , do they have the capability of assisting those families ? ” she said .
“ There are lots of unanswered questions . ”
One organization , Military Families United , said a survey of military families found that 84 % opposed changing the policy .
“ We are pretty disappointed in the president ’s decision to overturn the ban , ” said John Ellsworth , the group ’s president , whose son was killed in Iraq in 2004 .
“ This is a complete disregard for the will of America ’s military families and their need for privacy during this solemn moment . ”

Ellsworth said he would not have wanted to choose whether to leave his grieving family and go to Dover to receive the body of his son , Justin .
“ I do n’t believe my family would have been best served for me to go to Dover , ” he said .
“ But I would have felt torn if I had to make the decision . ”
Gates said he had been opposed to the media ban and first considered dropping it a year ago .
At that time , he asked officials to review the prohibition .
Those reviewing the policy recommended keeping it unchanged , and Gates decided to accept the recommendation .
The Bush White House was not involved in that review , he said .
But the day after President Obama said this month that he wanted to revisit the issue , Gates launched a new , wider review .
Advertisement
“ I talked directly with the senior leadership of the services and solicited their views , ” Gates said .
“ I ’ll be perfectly honest about it .
There was a division in the building . ”
Gates said everyone in the military -- on both sides of the issue -- was motivated by trying to help the families of fallen service members .
“ People were all trying to do what was right by the families , ” Gates said .
“ It just seemed to me that we ought to let the families make that decision . ”

julian.barnes@latimes.com
The New York Times has an article on Japan which essentially blames its crisis on insufficient consumer spending .
The truth is however that low consumer spending is a result of low economic growth , not a cause .
If really low consumer spending was the cause of the crisis the you would have expected its household savings rate to have increased .
In reality , it has fallen dramatically , from 14 % in the early 1990s to 2.2 % in 2007 ( latest year available , I suspect it fell further in 2008 ) .
To the extent the savings rate is related to the economic crisis , it is because the savings rate is too low , and not too high , as the low savings rate means that the investment rate will be too low .
It is true that the decline in the savings rate is to a large extent related to Japan 's rapidly ageing population , which means that fewer people are saving for retirement and more people consuming their retirement savings .
But that does n't change the fact that savings are at an historic low in Japan , and that weak consumer spending growth therefore is a result and certainly not the cause of Japan 's economic problem .
While the article does mention in the graphic that consumers are " neither saving nor saving " , the impression you get from the headline and most of the article is that savings are too high .
The article also tries to blame the alleged excess savings on deflation which supposedly makes consumers postpone purchases so that they can buy things cheaper in the future .
Yet apart from the already mentioned fact that savings are historically low in Japan , the problem with that theory is that it really applies to any country with positive real interest rates , and real interest rates are n't higher in Japan than most other countries .

Warming to the cult of Snuggie
The faithful lined up , two to three deep at the bar , looking like Druids in electric - blue fleece .
Tim Jester and Brian Griffiths , two young San Francisco guys in polo shirts , leaned against a railing , surveying the scene .
They had gone to the Rouge nightclub on Polk Street on a Friday night without any idea that it was the starting point for a 200 - person Snuggie pub crawl and were a bit confused .
" I think they need more colors besides blue , " Griffiths said .
" It needs more diversity . "
" It looks cultish .
Very cultish , " Jester said .
Dedicated wearers of the fleece - blanket - with - sleeves would have a hard time disagreeing with that statement , seeing as many of the hundreds of Facebook fan groups set up to celebrate Snuggies list it as a " religion . "
The Snuggie is not the first product to imbue fleece with robelike properties - figure - obscuring leisure wear has been knocking around catalogs for years - but since hitting the market in October , Snuggies have hit a cultural nerve .
Buoyed by an inadvertently funny and rhyming commercial ( " Blankets are OK , but they can slip and slide / and when you need to reach for something , your hands are trapped inside " ) , Snuggies have sold more than 4 million units through online orders and Walgreens drugstores , where they go for a mere $ 14.99 .
( Blue is the only Snuggie color sold at Walgreens ; online , red and green Snuggies are also available . )
The San Francisco Snuggie pub crawl is the brainchild of Oakland resident Keith Charles F. ( he preferred to not give his last name or his occupation ) , 25 , and Patricia Prislin , 24 , of San Francisco .
About a month ago , the pair , who met on Yelp , got to chatting about a similar pub crawl earlier this year in Chicago .
( Snuggie pub crawls are a national phenomenon , with forthcoming events in Des Moines , Iowa ; Scranton , Pa. ; and Burlington , Vt. , to name a few , according to Snuggiepubcrawls.com . )
In about three hours , according to Keith Charles , they had created Yelp and Facebook pages dedicated to a Bay Area event .
Within weeks , they mapped a route down Polk Street , starting at the Rouge Lounge and rolling downhill , and secured drink specials for Snuggie wearers .

One catch : Snuggies were selling out at their major vendor , Walgreens .
" We kept moving the date back because people were not going to get their Snuggies in time , " Keith Charles said before the event .
" Do n't tell anyone , but I got a red one off of eBay . "
Keith Charles and Prislin went beyond just asking people to wear Snuggies in public .
They organized an " American Idol " - style costume competition with categories for best male , best female , best group , best couple and sluttiest Snuggie .
Keith Charles had contacted Allstar Products Group , of Hawthorne , N.Y. , maker of Snuggies , but the company did n't seem to want formal connection to the bar hoppers .
" If I were them , I 'd have sent a few marketing reps and a box of Snuggies , " Keith Charles said .
For his part , Allstar Marketing chief executive Scott Boilen says that the pub crawls are " fun and unique , " but Allstar has no plans to host them .
Beyond the sheer number of Snuggie - wearing people flooding the bar , there was one person in particular who attracted attention : local oddball celebrity Frank Chu , carrying his 12 Galaxies sign , and standing resplendent in a blue , borrowed Snuggie .
" It feels comfortable , " he said , as people snapped his photo a few minutes later .
" It looks like something from a church choir . "
The event started promptly at 8 p.m. , although Keith Charles - who had transformed his maroon Snuggie into a gladiator 's outfit with gold trim , a gold mask and gold sword - did n't arrive until around 8:30 .
One group of friends from San Francisco , dolled up in Hawaiian attire with leis and coconut bras over the fleece , snagged a table early on at Rouge .
They had spent considerable time on their outfits .
" We were in Party City for a good hour , " said Alison Berding .
" We considered a lot of costumes - Playboy Bunny , Pirate , Fiesta .
This was best suited for everyone . "
" We stapled the bottoms so we would n't drag , " Erica Yoli added .
Organizer Prislin stood out in the crowd :
She had turned her red Snuggie into a matador outfit .
She sat with her friend and co-worker Jenny " Snuggi- hontas " Wilner , whose American Indian - inspired getup , with fringes and beads , later won sluttiest Snuggie honors .
They estimated that assembling their outfits , with the gluing of ribbons and beads and whatnot , took about two to three hours each .
Prislin's relationship to her Snuggies is uncommonly strong .
" I was lying in bed , watching Lifetime movies on a typical Sunday when I saw the infomercial , " she said .
" I wanted it so badly .
It was all I talked about for weeks at work . "
" This is true , " Wilneraffirmed , sipping her cocktail .
After a monthlong delay in shipping , the duo's matching sage Snuggies arrived in January .
They wasted no time taking the items to a surprising place : the boardroom .
" I wore it to a few meetings , " Prislin said , demurring on the question of the women 's employer , just saying it was " a typical Financial District office . "
Snuggie elitists
As Prislin showed off pictures of her adventures in Snuggies in the workplace , a cheer erupted .
A pair of rare sage green Snuggies , Dave Fischer , 29 , and Christina Newman , 33 , had entered the bar .
" I feel ridiculous , " said Fischer , who had n't expected the extra attention .
" But I guess that 's the point . "
A few minutes later , a red Snuggie with pockets rolled in .
Could it be - gasp ! - a Slanket , the similar fleece product that is the Snuggie 's natural rival ( if only because it costs an elitist $ 40 ) ?
" Slanket , go home ! " someone bellowed .
But it was just an online - only Snuggie Deluxe that is 50 percent thicker and boasts pockets .
The pub crawl officially had five stops , but by the second one - Shanghai Kelly 's on Polk Street - the crowd had already grown too large to comfortably enter at once .
After some sidewalk discussions , Keith Charles announced that people should spread out on Polk Street but plan on making it to McTeague 's Saloon at 11 p.m. for the costume judging .
The Snuggies roamed freely , most in small groups .
Shanghai Kelly 's doorman , Antonio Garcia , himself the recipient of a gift Snuggie from a woman carrying an extra , laughed at the suggestion of bar fights over the fleece .
But as he expertly removed an open Coors Light from a Snuggie - clad man 's hand , Garcia allowed that " maybe something will happen .
There are anti-Snuggie people out there . "
" Snuggies suck ! "
As if on cue , a new cry rose out down the street : " Snuggies suck ! "
By the time the hordes descended on McTeague 's Saloon for the judging , however , nothing worse than a few too many beers had happened .
Glassy - eyed men and women , all seemingly in their 20s and 30s , danced and drank .
The organizers ran around the room delivering handmade prizes to the winners , such as crowd favorite Laura Wullschleger , 24 , of Pleasant Hill , who did a version of pop singer Lady Gaga 's infamous " no pants " leotard , complete with hood , sunglasses and platinum hair .
There were those who were not impressed with the concept of bringing Snuggies onto the city streets en masse .
Richie Johnson , smoking a Marlboro outside Shanghai Kelly's , grew contemplative watching the crowd giggling and shouting as they waited in line to get into the bar .
" I guess this is why I moved to San Francisco , " he said , waving his smoke at the Snuggies .
" But I guess this is why I would move away from San Francisco . "

Scientists have unravelled the genetic make - up of the Neanderthal , the long - faced , barrel - chested relative of modern humans .
Anthropologists analysed more than a billion fragments of ancient DNA plucked from three Croatian fossils to reconstruct a first draft of the Neanderthal genome .
The extraordinary feat gives scientists an unprecedented opportunity to clarify the evolutionary relationship between humans and Neanderthals that may ultimately shed light on the great mystery of how we became the most formidable species on the planet .
Neanderthals were the closest relatives of modern living humans .
They lived in Europe and Asia until they became extinct around 30,000 years ago .
The reason they died out is not clear , but likely factors are dramatic swings in the climate that affected the availability of food , and competition with early humans .
By comparing the genomes of modern humans with Neanderthals and chimps , scientists hope to unravel the genetic differences that define what it is to be human .
The Neanderthal genome was built up from strands of DNA , most of which came from a 38,000 - year - old fossilised leg bone unearthed in a cave in Vindija , Croatia .
Other material came from older remains dating back 70,000 years .
Together , the fragments make up more than 60 % of the Neanderthal genome .
Svante Pääbo , who led the project at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Leipzig , Germany , said the team would spend the rest of the year analysing the DNA .
They will focus on genes linked to modern human evolution , such as FOXP2 , which is involved in speech and language .
The draft genome was announced at the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in Chicago .
Two years ago , the same group used the ancient DNA to pinpoint the moment , about 500,000 years ago , when modern humans split from Neanderthals .
The analysis should clear up once and for all the ongoing debate as to whether Neanderthals and modern humans continued to mate with each other after separating along the path of evolution .
Remains of Neanderthals dating back to 400,000 years ago suggest they were proficient at crafting basic tools and weapons and buried their dead .
The last Neanderthals died out shortly after Homo sapiens migrated to Europe and settled .
Neanderthals were stocky and well - adapted to a cold climate , with brains that were on average larger than those of modern humans .
Some fossil evidence suggests they were occasionally cannibalistic , though they more commonly hunted large animals including horses and mammoths .

( CNN ) -- Meghan McCain , a contributor to TheDailyBeast.com , is the daughter of Sen. John McCain and Cindy McCain .
But it 's her recent verbal sparring with conservative Republicans that 's put her in the spotlight .
Meghan McCain tells Larry King on Monday night : " I 'm not going to be bullied around about my weight . "
In a wide - ranging interview on Monday on CNN's " Larry King Live , " McCain discussed her thoughts on President Obama , her recent heated exchange with radio host Laura Ingraham , her tattoos and more .
The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity :
Larry King : [ President Obama ] is taking some criticism for smiling and laughing [ during his " 60 Minutes " interview . ]
Are you one of those critics ?
Meghan McCain :
You know , I actually am not .
I think anyone that would possibly think that the president is not taking the economy seriously -- I just think it 's ridiculous .
...
King : [ Is President Obama getting overexposed ] ?
McCain : I think he is on the verge of it .
I do think you have to be careful .
But it is a different generation .
[ My ] generation ... we like our celebrities .
And I think that he realizes that because he is very much a Generation Y president .
However , he is on the risk of alienating his older followers .
King : Does Obama seem like the same guy who ran against your dad ?
How do you view him ?
McCain :
He 's our president and when the election was over and when President Obama won , all negative feelings were gone .
I support the president .
King :
How does your dad feel about that ?
McCain : I think the same way .
You know , my family is really good at letting go of things and moving on .
And he just holds no grudges .
King :
Do you think most of the people in your party agree with [ Rush ] Limbaugh ?
Do they want him to fail ?
McCain : I do n't know , because there are many different personalities within the party .
... I would never want my president to fail , no matter which party is in power .
King :
You interviewed the [ Louisiana ] governor 's wife ?
McCain : I interviewed [ Supyira ] Jindal , the first lady of Louisiana .
And she 's a fascinating woman .
She totally impressed me because she was very warm and friendly .
I went down and interviewed her and the piece came out today on TheDailyBeast.com .
King :
Do you like him [ Gov. Bobby Jindal ] ?
McCain : I do .
You know , we do veer off on some things politically , but any leader that I 'm going to have I 'm going to veer off politically .
King :
Do you consider yourself a moderate ?
Are you moderate liberal ?
McCain : I consider myself a progressive Republican .
I am liberal on social issues .
And I think that the party is at a place where social issues should n't be the issues that define the party .
And I have taken heat , but in fairness to me , I am a different generation than the people that are giving me heat .
I 'm 24 years old .
I 'm not in my 40s , I 'm not in my 50s and older .
King :
Therefore , you must , based on what you said , disagree with your father ?
...
Do you discuss it ?
McCain :
We have a very big generation gap between me and my father .
Yes , we discuss them .
He 's very open - minded .
I was raised in an open - minded home .
I was raised a Christian , but I was raised open - minded Christian -- one to accept people , love people , not pass judgment .
...
I believe in gay marriage .
... I personally am pro-life , but I 'm not going to judge someone that 's pro-choice .
It is not my place to judge other people and what they do with their body .
King :
We have an e-mail question from Veronica , Huntington Park , California : " Do you share most of your father 's political views ? "
McCain :
When it comes to war and the economy , and many fiscal conservative values , I agree with him .
I mean I fell in love with the Republican Party because of my father .
King : Earlier this month , [ you ] wrote a DailyBeast column criticizing right - wing pundit Ann Coulter .
Conservative radio host Laura Ingraham fired back at you , including making a comment about your weight .
You then gave a straight talk response in an appearance on " The View . "
What led to that ?
McCain :
You know , it 's so funny .
I was in the airport today and this guy goes , " Hey , Meghan , kiss my fat ass . "
And I was like oh my gosh .
That 's where this has gone to .
As far as I 'm concerned with what 's going on with Laura Ingraham , on my end , it 's over .
There are nine million women in this country suffering from eating disorders .
And I 'm not going to be bullied around about my weight and what kind of standards I 'm not fitting .
...
King :
Were you surprised that Laura , who 's had breast cancer , got into something that personal ?
McCain : I had never heard of her before until this happened .
King :
You did n't know her ?
McCain : No . I 'm not familiar with her work .
But I hope she does n't do it again .
King : What about Ann Coulter ?
McCain :
She did n't respond , which is fine with me .
...
All I wanted to do is show women that you do n't have to be Ann Coulter and Laura Ingraham to have a place in the Republican Party .
... Supriya Jindal is a good role model , but a lot of people had n't heard of her .
And I just want to show that you do n't have to think one way and fit into this one box in order to be a member of the Republican Party .
King :
Were [ your parents ] angry at Laura Ingraham ?
McCain : My mother was .
She 's a very protective mama bear .
King :
Are you a tattooer ?
McCain : I have one .
My brothers have a lot of tattoos .
I love tattoos .
I do .
I know , you never would have thought me , right ?
But I do .
King : No .
You do n't look like a tattooer .
What do your folks think of that ?
McCain : I 've got supportive parents , you know .
My mom thinks it 's cute .
... I have a little star on my foot .
King :
What kind of dad is your father ?
McCain :
He 's great .
I love my dad so much .
He 's the best father to me .
And like I said , he 's so supportive of me and my career and what I do and speaking my mind .
When you grow up having a maverick as a father and an example , you can understand how I turned out like this .

AFRICANS always give a visiting pope a hearty welcome .
Thousands of finely dressed Cameroonians danced and sang at the roadside this week as Pope Benedict XVI arrived on an inaugural African tour that will also take in Angola .
The Vatican is keen on the continent , home to around 135 m Catholics .
Pope Benedict delivered a compassionate message , recognising that Africa suffers disproportionately from food shortages , poverty , financial turmoil and a changing climate .
Yet for all the mutual appreciation , he got one matter painfully wrong .
Asked about the use of condoms to help tackle the scourge of AIDS , the pope restated , in unusually explicit terms , the church 's position that these are not useful to “ overcome ” the epidemic , indeed their use actually makes the problem worse .
He suggested the disease could be beaten through chastity , abstinence and “ correct behaviour ” .
Speaking in a continent where more than 20 m people have died from AIDS and another 22.5 m are infected with HIV , his statement sounded otherworldly at best , and crass and uncaring at worst .
Merely wishing away human sexual behaviour does nothing for the potential victims of AIDS , many of whom are innocent under even the most moralistic definition of that word .
Distributing more condoms would not , on its own , stop the spread of AIDS .
Lots of measures are needed : improving education , encouraging monogamy , delaying the age of first sexual encounter , helping young women to win a greater say over their sex lives and widening access to antiretroviral drugs that lessen sufferers ' infectiousness .
Male circumcision seems to limit the disease 's spread .
But giving people condoms can be particularly useful .
Experience in Thailand , which snuffed out a rapid early increase of HIV , suggests that condom use , especially by prostitutes and their clients , is effective .
The World Health Organisation points out that condoms , used properly , cut the chance of HIV infection by 90 % .
Clever leaders matter too .
Uganda 's president , Yoweri Museveni , talked frankly and often about “ ABC ” habits — abstain , be faithful , use condoms — and saw levels of infection in his country fall .
Leaders who deny the science or seriousness of the epidemic , or who are too squeamish to talk of condoms and sex , leave people confused and at great risk : Harvard researchers last year estimated that the approach of South Africa 's Thabo Mbeki had led to 330,000 needless deaths .
Sadly , Pope Benedict has put himself squarely in the denial camp .
An ugly light
It need not be that way .
Three years ago Pope Benedict was willing for his council for health to consider whether condom use would be a “ lesser evil ” than allowing the spread of a deadly virus .
Liberal cardinals had suggested that in a marriage where one partner is infected , condoms should be permitted .
In Africa , as elsewhere , many Catholics simply ignore the Vatican 's view on condoms anyway .
The pope now seems immovable on the issue .
His words on condoms and AIDS look particularly heartless in light of a scandal in Brazil that also casts the Catholic church in a poor light .
An archbishop there excommunicated doctors for performing an abortion on a nine - year - old girl who had been raped repeatedly by her stepfather and made pregnant with twins .
The girl 's mother was also expelled from the church ; the rapist was not .
The Vatican has made a partial retreat , criticising the haste with which the decision was made — and , eventually , the decision itself .
In this and in its views on condom use to combat the spread of AIDS , the Vatican risks seeming callous to the plight of the weakest , surely those whom the church should strive hardest to protect .
Such is the modern - day fascination , according to The Economist , that the book 's sales rank on Amazon climbed more than 500 places in the book charts over a two - year period , eclipsing such rival tomes as Barack Obama 's The Audacity of Hope .

The government yesterday publicly hardened its position on bank executive bonuses saying it will be " very , very robust " in clamping down on bonuses for 2008 in banks in which it holds shares .
It will only allow modest payments for clerks earning around £ 20,000 a year .
It came as David Cameron said he would cap all 2008 bonuses at £ 2,000 for staff in banks owned or partly owned by the government .
He also said the government should be willing to sue any bank executive who insisted their contract entitled them to a large bonus for the year .
The government shift , after intense private disagreements within the cabinet , came amidst reports that Lloyds plans to pay out up to £ 120 m in bonuses for 2008 to thousands of staff .
Its chief executive , Eric Daniels , came under intense pressure after Friday 's shock profits warning caused by the HBOS banking group it rescued four weeks ago .
The bank insisted that bonuses were typically £ 1,000 or less .
Daniels and other members of the Lloyds board have been banned from taking bonuses after receiving £ 17bn of taxpayers ' funds to bolster the bank but Daniels has always insisted that staff should be allowed to receive their bonuses , which are typically around 10 % of their salary .
The government 's bonus clampdown comes as polls suggest Labour may be losing support to the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats over the issue .
One poll put Labour on only 25 % , just three points ahead of the Lib Dems .
The poll , by ComRes , is the third to show a rise in Lib Dem support .
Vince Cable , the party 's treasury spokesman , yesterday opposed all executive bonuses in the banks bailed out by the taxpayer .
The Guardian has previously reported that Gordon Brown is willing to impose a bonus cap in banks in which the UK has shares , but yesterday was the first time ministers started to talk in public about government - imposed restrictions , as opposed to recommendations , at least in the banks in which the government holds shares .
The financial secretary to the Treasury , Stephen Timms , said " I think people will rightly want to make sure that very well - paid people who have contributed to the problems we are now seeing across the banking sector should not be rewarded by bonuses .
In the case of banks in which we are a major shareholder we will have to agree the detailed arrangements for bonus payments .
" UK Financial Investments - which handles the shareholdings on behalf of the government - will scrutinise them very carefully indeed .
We will take a very , very robust view . "
The employment minister , Tony McNulty , said staff on lower salaries should not forgo their bonuses , but the issue was totally different for senior executives .
" I would draw the line between senior managers , board members , executives , those responsible for the business model and strategy that got them into the mess , they should n't get a penny , " he said .
A Lloyds spokesman said : " We are a retail and commercial bank where most colleagues earn approximately £ 17,000 .
We have been stretching performance targets and if they are met we believe it is right that colleagues receive some financial recognition .
In most cases this means an annual bonus of £ 1,000 or less . "
Separately , the chairman of the Financial Services Authority , Lord Turner , yesterday said he would be putting proposals for longer term reforms of executive bonus structures to the government on 18 March .
Lord Turner also admitted there had been worldwide intellectual failures in regulation in that many supervisors , including the FSA , believed " this world of securitised credit has reduced the risks in the financial system " .
Although he said the FSA had foreseen the scale of HBOS losses announced last week , ministers were under pressure yesterday to explain their role in encouraging the merger between Lloyds and HBOS .
The losses have raised concerns that Lloyds ' share price may come under sustained attack this week , increasing taxpayers ' exposure over the deal .
Turner hinted he did not fully endorse the Lloyds - HBOS merger saying there could have been other ways of supporting HBOS without it .
He told the BBC : " At that time [ a merger with Lloyds ] seemed to be a sensible way of buttressing HBOS , which was clearly by then a weak bank .
There could have been a different way of directly supporting HBOS and keeping Lloyds separate . "
The Treasury played down suggestions that it was making emergency contingency plans to shore up Lloyds let alone nationalise the bank .
Timms said the bank had a " good commercial future " .
But in a shift of position for the Tories , Cameron said the merger had been a mistake , even though he voted for it only four months ago .
Timms angrily countered it was " not on for the Tories to support the merger one week and then oppose it for opportunist reasons a week later " .
He pointed out the Tory front bench had all voted in favour of suspending the competition rules to allow the merger to go ahead .

I came to Yahoo !
Inc in 2006 through the acquisition of Mobile social software company Kenet Works AB of which I was CEO and co-founder ( learn more about me ) .
After two years as Director of Product Management and later Director of Business Development , I ’ve decided to leave Yahoo !
Inc in order to join music startup Spotify .
Like many others , my first time using Spotify gave me that very rare ” Wooha ! , wait a minute ! ” - feeling .
I got that same feeling using Skype for the first time a few years back .
It was n’t the VoIP technology , I ’d used loads of other VoIP apps before , it was the implementation of the service .
The fact that it just worked !
I did n’t have to care about firewalls , NATs , VoIP servers or user SIP domains ( because they did n’t use SIP ) .
And the core proposition of the service , voice , had awesome quality !
Even more importantly , because of this , my friends , and even my parents , got it to work !
Though the technology had been around for ages , it was the first time I , and most people around me started to seriously think of telephony over the Internet as an alternative to using the POTS .
I get that same exact reaction from my friends ( and parents ) today when they use Spotify for the first time .
It just works , the technology is awesome , but invisible , and the content is there .
It is the first time they realize and seriously consider that there may be no point in physically getting , owning and storing every song in the world on your own harddrive , you can just have access to all of them !
The only thing you need to own and keep are your favourite song lists , and in a world where you are always connected , that ’s actually a lot more portable and easy to manage across computers and devices .
For most people , who never heard of “ cloud services ” , this is a pretty mind blowing realization !
So back in December , when I got the chance to join this great team of serial entrepreneurs , and work with some of Europe ’s top engineering talent , around a topic such as music , that engages just about everyone from all walks of life , I just had to take it !
Starting in February , I will head up something that a lot of users have already requested and discussed extensively , Spotify on the Mobile .
We obviously can’t tell you our plans yet , but make sure you subscribe to this blog to be the first to know !
I want to take the chance to say a big
Thanks to all of the great colleagues and friends at Yahoo ! , from Madrid ( you know who you are ! ) to Germany , London and Sunnyvale .
It ’s been a lot of fun working with all of you and I ’m very excited to see what the recent changes at the big Y! will bring !
Two sexes ' sin in different ways '
Italian confession boxes have been used less in recent years Women are prouder than men , but men are more lustful , according to a Vatican report which states that the two sexes sin differently .
A Catholic survey found that the most common sin for women was pride , while for men , the urge for food was only surpassed by the urge for sex .
The report was based on a study of confessions carried out by Fr Roberto Busa , a 95 - year - old Jesuit scholar .
The Pope 's personal theologian backed up the report in the Vatican newspaper .
" Men and women sin in different ways , " Msgr Wojciech Giertych , theologian to the papal household , wrote in L'Osservatore Romano .
" When you look at vices from the point of view of the difficulties they create you find that men experiment in a different way from women . "
Msgr Giertych said the most difficult sin for men to face was lust , followed by gluttony , sloth , anger , pride , envy and greed .
For women , the most dangerous sins were pride , envy , anger , lust , and sloth , he added .
Secretive department Catholics are supposed to confess their sins to a priest at least once a year .
The priest absolves them in God 's name .
THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS Men
1. Lust 2 . Gluttony 3 . Sloth
4. Anger 5 . Pride 6 . Envy 7 .
Greed
Women
1. Pride 2 . Envy 3 . Anger 4 . Lust
5. Gluttony 6 . Avarice 7 .
Sloth
The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that " immediately after death the souls of those who die in a state of mortal sin descend into Hell " .
Traditionally , the seven deadly sins were considered : pride , envy , gluttony , lust , anger , greed and sloth .
The Apostolic Penitentiary , one of the Vatican 's most secretive departments , which fixes the punishments and indulgences handed down to sinners , last year updated its list of deadly sins to include more modern ones .
The revised list included seven modern sins it said were becoming prevalent during an era of " unstoppable globalisation " .
These included : genetic modification , experiments on the person , environmental pollution , taking or selling illegal drugs , social injustice , causing poverty and financial greed .
The report came amid Vatican concerns about the declining rate of confessions .
A recent survey of Catholics found nearly a third no longer considered confession necessary , while one in 10 considered the process an obstacle to their dialogue with God.
Pope Benedict , who reportedly confesses his sins once a week , last year issued his own voice of disquiet on the subject .
" We are losing the notion of sin , " he said .
" If people do not confess regularly , they risk slowing their spiritual rhythm . "

More Details On Geithner ’s Plan
Bloomberg ’s has more highlights of Obama ’s plan for toxic assets that will be unveiled Monday by Treasury Secretary Geithner .
Newer details include :
Geithner will ask Congress to give the Treasury and FDIC more powers : to guarantee more types of debt , limit payments to creditors , and break executive compensation contracts .
The Federal Reserves Term Asset Loan Facility program ( TALF ) will expand to riskier assets .
Financing will be 1:1 , and will apparently include private partners ( in a way similar to the Treasury fund ) who will make the investment decisions .
Profits and losses will be shared between the government and the private sector .
I still do n’t like the FDIC funding plan , because the public component is up to 97 % , but the Fed TALF plan makes a lot more sense .
Doing the funding 50 % public , 50 % private is much more fair , is not nearly as heavily leveraged ( although leverage can be applied in other ways ) and losses are shared much more equally , assuming these are not non-recourse loans ( which they appear not to be , though that ’s not certain . )
The additional powers Geithenr is asking for are acceptable , except for the ability to guarantee more types of debt .
The FDIC is already guaranteeing many bank assets : the idea of them guaranteeing even riskier classes only serves to set up taxpayers to shoulder even more losses from the private sector’s .
Many of these concerns would be moot if the administration would just nationalize firms which are effectively insolvent .
But , given that the administration wo n’t nationalize the banks , at least parts of this plan are not completely stupid .
The plan does however appear to perpetuate the trend of taking on private losses and putting taxpayers at risk for most of them .
Update : There 's no work around other than mentioned in # 3214 .
My previous suggestion was for a work around was false and a result of an error on my part .
I have therefore edited the post to reflect this .
We have n't had the need for using arbitrary SQL in our application but this just changed when I was setting up automatic build and testing .
I ran into a caveat : # 3214 .
The title is somewhat misleading , the bug is really about the arbitrary SQL being mangled by Django without letting you know it .
It 's all there in the ticket ; dedicated developers , users needing it , patch , documentation and tests .
And the reason for not accepting ?
Some backends does n't handle multiple statement ...
I know SQLite and PostgreSQL does .
After spending some time both in Django source and on their site I eventually found out that running the SQL as Database - backend - specific SQL data does n't mangle it .
Unfortunately this information was not included in the documentation .

The incoming Obama administration will vigorously defend congressional legislation immunizing U.S. telecommunication companies from lawsuits about their participation in the Bush administration 's domestic spy program .
That was the assessment Thursday by Eric Holder , President - elect Barack Obama 's choice for attorney general , who made the statement during his confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
A court challenge questioning the legality of the legislation is pending in U.S. District Court in San Francisco – where the judge in the case wanted to know what the Obama administration 's position was .
" The duty of the Justice Department is to defend statutes that have been passed by Congress , " Holder told Sen. Orin Hatch ( R - Utah ) , who asked whether the Obama administration would continue the legal fight to uphold the legislation that the Electronic Frontier Foundation is seeking to overturn .
" Unless there are compelling reasons , I do n't think we would reverse course , " Holder added .
At a San Francisco hearing in EFF 's case last month , U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker wondered aloud whether the incoming Obama administration would continue to defend the legislation , which passed in July .
Obama opposed immunity but voted for it because it was included in a new spy bill that gave the Bush administration broad warrantless - surveillance powers .
" We are going to have a new attorney general , " Walker said from the bench , wondering whether he should delay a decision , pending guidance from Obama .
" Why should n't the court wait to see what the new attorney general will do ? "
The EFF is also accusing the nation 's telecoms of funneling Americans ' electronic communications to the Bush administration without warrants in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks .

WIRED Opinion
Children will no longer have to study the Victorians or the second world war under proposals to overhaul the primary school curriculum , the Guardian has learned .
However , the draft plans will require some children to master Twitter and Wikipedia and give teachers far more freedom to decide what youngsters should be concentrating on in classes .
The proposed curriculum , which would mark the biggest change to primary schooling in a decade , strips away hundreds of specifications about the scientific , geographical and historical knowledge pupils must accumulate before they are 11 to allow schools greater flexibility in what they teach .
It emphasises traditional areas of learning - including phonics , the chronology of history and mental arithmetic - but includes more modern media and web - based skills as well as a greater focus on environmental education .
The plans have been drawn up by Sir Jim Rose , the former Ofsted chief who was appointed by ministers to overhaul the primary school curriculum , and are due to be published next month .
The papers seen by the Guardian are draft plans for the detailed content of each of six core " learning areas " that Rose is proposing should replace the current 13 standalone subject areas .
The proposals would require :
• Children in England to leave primary school familiar with blogging , podcasts , Wikipedia and Twitter as sources of information and forms of communication .
They must gain " fluency " in handwriting and keyboard skills , and learn how to use a spellchecker alongside how to spell .
• Children to be able to place historical events within a chronology .
" By the end of the primary phase , children should have gained an overview which enables them to place the periods , events and changes they have studied within a chronological framework , and to understand some of the links between them . "
Every child would learn two key periods of British history but it would be up to the school to decide which ones .
Schools would still be able to opt to teach Victorian history or the second world war , but they would not be required to .
The move is designed to prevent duplication with the secondary curriculum , which covers the second world war extensively .
• Less emphasis on the use of calculators than in the current curriculum .
• An understanding of physical development , health and wellbeing programme , which would address what Rose calls " deep societal concerns " about children 's health , diet and physical activity , as well as their relationships with family and friends .
They will be taught about peer pressure , how to deal with bullying and how to negotiate in their relationships .
The six core areas are : understanding English , communication and languages , mathematical understanding , scientific and technological understanding , human , social and environmental understanding , understanding physical health and wellbeing , and understanding arts and design .
John Bangs , head of education at the National Union of Teachers , said : " It seems to jump on the latest trends such as Wikipedia and Twitter .
Then it has very traditional descriptions of chronological teaching of history .
It seems to be about trends on the one hand , then political pressure on the other hand - the government did n't want to look like it is scrapping traditional education .
Computer skills and keyboard skills seem to be as important as handwriting in this .
Traditional books and written texts are downplayed in response to web - based learning . "
Teresa Cremin , president of the United Kingdom Literacy Association , said : " We are very pleased to see a higher profile given to oracy but we are concerned that there seems to be no drama in the upper primary years linked to literacy .
But our main concern is that there is no emphasis on reading for pleasure or the enjoyment of literacy . "
Mary Bousted , general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers , said : " They are much more sensible programmes of study .
We are pleased they give the profession much more flexibility to meet the needs of their pupils .
Children need to be enthused by learning , so they want to learn and gain the skills which will enable them to learn in later life .
The debate is not about whether the Victorians are in there or not . "
The leak led to a row when it emerged unions had been excluded from the consultation about what should be included , and subject specialists were given only three days to respond .
Bousted said : " It 's entirely unacceptable that it has n't come to the teaching unions .
Our members have to teach this .
We 've responded at all other stages of consultation .
I do n't know why we have been missed out now . "
The Department for Children , Schools and Families , which initially refused to comment on the leaked report , issued a statement last night setting out its " general position " on history in primary schools .
" Of course pupils in primary school will learn about major periods including the Romans , the Tudors and the Victorians and will be taught to understand a broad chronology of major events in this country and the wider world , " it said .

The legendary rubber - keyed ZX Spectrum was for many millions of Britons their first introduction to computing .
Originally released in April 1982 , it had been designed ( under the working name of " ZX82 " ) with the same philosophy in mind as with the ZX81 - namely , to be the cheapest colour home computer on the market .
The hardware was designed by Richard Altwasser of Sinclair Research , while the software was written by Steve Vickers ( who subsequently wrote the Spectrum manual ) , on contract from Nine Tiles Ltd , the authors of Sinclair BASIC .
The famous keyboard owed its looks to Sinclair 's industrial designer Rick Dickinson , who also designed the cases of the ZX81 and ZX80 .
Although the outward appearance of the Spectrum remained consistent until late 1984 , its hardware went through a number of changes - see the Spectrum Versions page for details .
The machine was a considerable advance on the ZX81 .
It had a larger memory ; it had colour ( hence the name , Spectrum ) ; it had sound , albeit a tinny loudspeaker capable of little more than bleeps .
Originally , it was also proposed that the Spectrum would incorporate a flat - screen display based either on the technology that would eventually be used in the TV80 pocket television , or some kind of LED matrix .
The Spectrum might have had better sound , too , with a proper loudspeaker built into the case rather than the rudimentary capability actually provided .
Both of these features were eventually dropped on the grounds of cost .
Remarkably , prototypes still exist of the Spectrum 's pre-production designs and can be found in the International Vintage Electronics Museum of Brighton resident Enrico Tedeschi .
They provide a unique insight into how the Spectrum design was developed by Rick Dickinson and his team .
Although they often look convincingly real , they did not actually work and were never intended to , being essayed in wood and epoxy to work out the visual appearance and ergonomics of the proposed designs .
( This was a standard tactic for Sinclair - mockups were often used in publicity photographs and advertising , sometimes well before the real thing was ready for the market . )
The designs share a clear genetic resemblance , eventually converging on the final version .
The rubber keyboard is present in all , although in a rather different form - for instance , with a large central space bar on the bottom row , as per a typewriter keyboard .
More radical variants have a tiny flat screen display in the upper part of the case , or a long thin LCD - type display extending across most of the raised black strip above the keyboard .
All of the designs have about the same physical dimensions , illustrating the physical constraints to which Dickinson had to conform .
The Spectrum was always intended to be a compact computer , inevitably bigger than the less sophisticated ZX81 but still very much smaller than the offerings from Sinclair 's main rival , Acorn .
Acorn 's answer to the Spectrum was the BBC Micro , a much larger machine with a proper " full - travel " keyboard .
It also had far better graphics and sound than the Spectrum .
This made for distinctly critical comparisons from reviewers , who rightly pointed out the Spectrum 's slowness and graphical limitations .
The Spectrum 's 256x192 pixel resolution was actually rather better than most of its competitors and came with a choice of eight colours ( arguably fifteen with the use of the BRIGHT attribute ) , but the catch was that you could only use two colours per 8x8 pixel square .
This caused the infamous " colour clash " problem .
Clever graphic design could minimise this , as seen on the right in Ultimate 's Jet Pac ( 1983 ) , but it could still produce some garishly ugly results ( notice the blocky multicoloured fireballs on the right of the screen shot ) .
There was also an irritating " dot crawl " effect resulting from problems in the graphics circuitry ; no amount of cleverness could resolve this , so Sinclair users had to put up with it until Sinclair itself resolved the problem with the 1984 Spectrum + .
These problems were an inevitable result of Sinclair 's design brief , which emphasised low cost and simplicity at the expense of technological sophistication .
But these compromises were also at the heart of the Spectrum 's success , as its affordable and uncomplicated nature made it the ideal computer to crack the home market .
The Spectrum was initially released in two versions , outwardly identical - a 16 K machine for £ 125 and a 48 K version for £ 175 .
The 16 K version was rapidly superseded by its more capable big brother - it could be upgraded using a kit available from Sinclair - and by the end of 1982 the market had already swung heavily in favour of the 48 K Spectrum .
Production of the Spectrum started at 20,000 a month , with 300,000 - 400,000 machines expected to sell in the first year .
Unfortunately it did not work out quite like that .
Demand was enormous , far ahead of supply , and the first machines did not reach the market until June 1982 .
By July 1982 , Sinclair already had a backlog of 30,000 orders .
The situation worsened through the summer , with delivery delays of three months becoming commonplace .
In October the company was severely rebuked by the Advertising Standards Authority for failing to meet its promise of " 28 - day delivery " .
The Spectrum was also very popular abroad , with the unfortunate result ( for Sinclair ) of numerous pirate clones of the machine being produced .
Ironically , these clones have outlasted the Spectrum itself and have ensured the Spectrum 's survival ( albeit in a greatly modified form ) for well over a decade longer than the original machine .
Two authorised clones of the Spectrum were also produced by Timex Inc. of the United States , although these met with little success .
Sinclair responded to the surge in demand by ramping up the production of the Spectrum .
The delivery problems were eventually resolved , and by March 1983 more than 200,000 Spectrums had been sold by mail order , earning Sinclair Research nearly £ 55 million .
Sales figures continued to increase as major High Street stores such as W.H. Smith , Boots , Curry 's and Menzies got in on the booming market .
Soon up to 15,000 Spectrums were being sold every week in the UK , doubtless assisted by the price of the 48 K model being reduced to £ 129.95 .
A major reason for the huge popularity of the Spectrum was the enormous range of software available for it .
The ZX81 had spawned a huge cottage industry of computer programmers , many literally working from their bedrooms or garages , and they soon moved across to the Spectrum when that machine was released .
Some published their products commercially , giving rise to the Spectrum software industry , but many more did it simply to learn about programming .
Few self - respecting computer magazines appeared without program listings which one could type in .
This had significant long - term consequences - it fostered an enormous pool of programing talent , to this day allowing Britain to punch far above its weight in the world software market .

What busy times these are for homosexuals and their sympathizers !
Protests aplenty loom in the coming weeks and months .
An unofficial list of upcoming events can be found at the Against8 blog ; and an official list can be found , well , nowhere , since nobody 's really in charge .
This decentralized , informal , grassrootsy approach has been fun , but it's also increasingly confusing -- and , we worry , irrelevant .
Dan Savage observed last week that the movement is still crippled by its lack of clear , attainable goals ; and , he pointed out , " Not every idea is a good one . "
Meanwhile , Rex Wockner found weak messaging at a candelight vigil ( " the pretend nuns in face paint likely added to the confusion " ) and Peter Staley loves Join The Impact 's verve but laments that their disconnectedness and slowing momentum is leaving them with barely any impact to be joined .
The bottom line : all that post- election post - momentum is running out of steam as the crowd gradually drifts away from the movement , leaving only the hard - core activists behind .
So , those upcoming protests ?
We predict that they 'll be attended by ever - fewer people as they drag into February and " regular people " find new things to care about .
Rex Wockner says that " the method by which it was organized ( Facebook , MySpace , Twitter , blogs , e-mail , text - messaging ) can be reactivated in minutes whenever the moment strikes , " but that does n't strike us as being accurate .
You can try to reactivate the network , but the shrinking attendance at events since the election seems to indicate that response , over time , will diminish .
It was over a month ago that we observed a fatal aimlessness to the protests .
The SF protests in November ended with a band of misguided weirdos blocking traffic in the Castro , and we hate to say it , but it looks like we 're seeing the same thing happen on a national scale .
So what 's the solution ?
Go back to Dan Savage 's , Rex Wockner 's , and Peter Staley 's posts -- they 've got all the information you need .
To sum up :
- Agree on some clear , attainable goals .
- Make it clear to everyone what you 're doing ; and provide status updates .
- Shoot down the bad ideas .
- Write honest postmortems -- and do n't pat yourself on the back every five minutes .
- Drop the nationwide , one - size - fits - all - communities actions in favor of specific , targeted , customized campaigns that can push the ball forward .
- Focus on states where gay marriage is attainable in the next five years : California and the northeast .
- Get off the web and organize in real life .
That last one , we feel , is the most vital point ; without real - life organizing , none of the other points can happen .
See you at Equality Camp !
Disclosure : SFist_Matt is the creator of Stop8.org , does a bunch of behind - the - scenes marriage - equality organizing .

( CNN ) --
One of the most enduring mysteries of the 20th century has been put to rest : DNA analysis of bone fragments has proven that two of Czar Nicholas ' children believed to have escaped were killed with their royal family during the Russian Revolution .
Czar Nicholas II , from left , daughters Olga , Maria , wife Alexandra , kids Anastasia , Alexei and Tatiana in 1917 .
The chemically damaged and burnt remains were found in the Romanov family 's makeshift grave outside the city of Yekaterinburg , Russia , in 2007 .
In 2008 , scientists used bone and tooth fragments to identify the remains as those of the two missing children of Czar Nicholas II : 13 - year - old Crown Prince Alexei , the emperor 's only son and heir to the throne , and his sister Grand Duchess Maria , about 19 .
Researchers wanted to confirm their findings by comparing DNA from the remains with that of living Romanov relatives .
The results of the DNA analysis were published online Tuesday in the journal PloS One .
The Romanov family , the last Russian monarchy , was executed in 1918 by Bolsheviks in the basement of a home in Yekaterinburg , about 900 miles ( 1,448 kilometers ) east of Moscow .
Several of their staff members and servants also were killed .
Nicholas ' reign had ended when he abdicated the throne in 1917 at the time of the Russian Revolution .
The remains of the family were discovered in 1991 , during the last days of the Soviet Union .
In 1998 , those remains -- of Nicholas , his wife , Alexandra , and three daughters -- were interred in a cathedral in St. Petersburg that contains the crypts of other Russian royalty .
At the time , many thought that Alexei and Maria might have escaped -- leading to hopes among royal supporters that one or both Romanovs were still alive .
But clues left by one of the family 's assassins led investigators to the grave where the remains of Alexei and Maria were unearthed in 2007 .
The drama surrounding the Romanovs has been the subject of many books , movies and documentaries .
Several women have claimed that they were Anastasia , Nicholas ' youngest daughter , contending that they escaped the executions .
The body of one impostor , Anna Anderson , was cremated when she died in 1984 .
DNA tests showed she was not related to the Romanov family .
All About Czar Nicholas II • Russia
I was recently at an international airport , trying to get from one end of a very long terminal to another .
It inspired in me the following simple maths puzzle , which I thought I would share here :
Suppose you are trying to get from one end A of a terminal to the other end B .
( For simplicity , assume the terminal is a one - dimensional line segment . )
Some portions of the terminal have moving walkways ( in both directions ) ; other portions do not .
Your walking speed is a constant , but while on a walkway , it is boosted by the speed of the walkway for a net speed of .
( Obviously , given a choice , one would only take those walkways that are going in the direction one wishes to travel in . )
Your objective is to get from A to B in the shortest time possible .
Suppose you need to pause for some period of time , say to tie your shoe .
Is it more efficient to do so while on a walkway , or off the walkway ?
Assume the period of time required is the same in both cases .
Suppose you have a limited amount of energy available to run and increase your speed to a higher quantity ( or , if you are on a walkway ) .
Is it more efficient to run while on a walkway , or off the walkway ?
Assume that the energy expenditure is the same in both cases .
Do the answers to the above questions change if one takes into account the various effects of special relativity ?
( This is of course an academic question rather than a practical one .
But presumably it should be the time in the airport frame that one wants to minimise , not time in one ’s personal frame . )
It is not too difficult to answer these questions on both a rigorous mathematical level and a physically intuitive level , but ideally one should be able to come up with a satisfying mathematical explanation that also corresponds well with one ’s intuition .

Twilight Box Office Sales Biggest Ever for a Female Director
Director Catherine Hardwicke at the Los Angeles premiere of " Twilight "
" Twilight " took in $ 70.6 million at the box office in it 's debut weekend , making it the biggest opening ever for a female director .
Director Catherine Hardwicke is thrilled about the success of the film and hopes it will inspire other women and young girls to pursue a career in filmmaking .
Twilight 's opening beat the previous record for a female director by a whopping $ 29.5 million .
In 1998 Mimi Leder 's " Deep Inpact " took in $ 41.1 million .
According to Sunday morning estimates , " Twilight , " based on Stephenie Meyer 's vampire romance novel of the same name , made $ 20,636 per theater , putting independent film studio Summit Entertainment on the map .
" Twilight " starring Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart , tells the story of 17 - year - old Bella Swan who moves to the small town of Forks , Washington to live with her father , and becomes drawn to Edward Cullen , a pale , mysterious classmate who seems determined to push her away .
But neither can deny the attraction that pulls them together ... even when Edward confides that he and his family are vampires .
Summit Entertainment announced over the weekend that the studio is officially moving forward with production of " New Moon , " the second installment in Meyer 's modern day vampire series .

Caesar Is Not God
by Ryan McMaken by Ryan McMaken
In a recent speech in Toronto , Charles Chaput , the Archbishop of Denver , condemned what he called " a spirit of adulation bordering on servility " that surrounds Barack Obama and his administration .
" We elect public servants , not messiahs , " said Chaput .
And while the term " public servant " is perhaps an outrageously benign term for any president since Coolidge , the point is well taken from Chaput , who I can only assume has grown weary of hearing from parishioners that the new president will make lame beggars walk and blind men see .
Chaput goes on to say that " We owe no leader any submission or cooperation in the pursuit of grave evil , " and that " we have a duty to change bad laws and resist grave evil in our public life . "
So when exactly is this sort of resistance acceptable ?
Chaput ’s words can be applied generally as we shall see , but in this particular case , the Archbishop is referring to the Obama administration ’s position on abortion .
This position , Chaput notes , contrary even to Bill Clinton ’s position that abortions should be safe , legal , and rare , " is not only aggressively u2018 pro- choice ’ ; it has also removed any suggestion that killing an unborn child might be a regrettable thing . "
From Chaput ’s perspective as a Catholic bishop , unborn children are humans with the same natural rights as toddlers and adults .
So when a conscientious bishop finds himself confronted with a civil government that turns a blind eye to what the Church sees as a major form of violence against millions of individuals , he is left to confront what sort of obedience is due to such a government .
Clearly , Chaput believes that abortion is a " grave evil " and therefore " [ w] e owe no leader " who supports abortion " any submission or cooperation " on the matter .
But what of other issues ?
What else counts as " grave evil , " and under what other circumstances might resistance to the state be justified ?
Resistance against civil government has been a Catholic tradition since the very beginning .
The martyrs of the ancient world who died rather than submit to the laws of the Roman Empire are still venerated today , and modern martyrs like Miguel Pro and the Cristeros continue to inspire believers .
Since the first century , resistance to the state has always been permitted under the proper circumstances , although violent resistance is held to a much higher standard .
To understand the nature of Catholic resistance , one must understand the proper role of civil government in the Catholic world view .
From the Catholic perspective , the central purpose of civil government ( which need not take the form of a modern state ) is simple .
Civil government exists to protect persons from violence and aggression by others , and to provide for the common good .
This is not " common good " vaguely defined as " national security " might be today .
The common good is good that is common to everyone .
Outlawing murder , for example , is in the interest of the common good , because no one , not even murderers , truly benefits from murder .
A civil government that fails to do this is not a legitimate government .
Thus , such a government must be resisted and certainly need not be hailed , praised , obeyed , or applauded .
This position , explicitly stated , goes back at least to Thomas Aquinas , and less explicitly , back to the early Church Fathers .
Any government or state that acts in the interests of the state itself , or for a particular class , or which fails to maintain the rule of law that protects natural rights , is in fact illegitimate and may be morally overthrown .
Historically speaking , the church hierarchy is rarely ever seen encouraging armed resistance , but for Aquinas , even regicide was acceptable if a state were sufficiently corrupt .
But we are still left with the problem of when resistance is justified .
To answer this question , many fall back on Matthew 22 in which Christ , when asked whether or not a believer should pay taxes to the state , notes the emperor ’s image on the tax money and declares " render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar ’s and to God the things that are God’s . "
Much is made of this comment , and it is often presented as a proof that Christ considered even Caesar ’s murderous and dictatorial rule to be perfectly legitimate .
This certainly is n’t the Catholic position .
Chaput ’s comments in Toronto were preceded and clearly based on his book Render Unto Caesar released last year .
In the book , Chaput explores the nature of Christ ’s comments on Caesar .
While Christ ’s words clearly imply that something should be afforded Caesar , it is not at all clear as to what that might be .
In sermons , Chaput in the past has noted that the early Church Fathers had one clever answer :
Since the Roman coin that was to be rendered unto Caesar bore Caesar ’s image , then that which bears God ’s image should be rendered unto God .
Since every human person bears
God ’s image , then humanity itself belongs to God while some coinage belongs to Caesar .
This is n’t exactly a ringing endorsement of Caesar ’s power .
In his book , Chaput reiterates this point by noting that while civil government might be afforded authority when acting justly , free will , beauty , moral integrity , goodness , and immortal souls all belong not to the state but to God .
But perhaps most important in this passage from Matthew is the fact that a significant dichotomy exists between Caesar and God .
For the oriental despotisms of the ancient world , and certainly for the " divine " Caesars of the late Roman Empire , there was not division between god and Caesar at all .
Yet , here is Christ making is quite clear that Caesar is not God and God is not Caesar .
In his book Jesus of Nazareth , Pope Benedict XVI writes about just how subversive this message was .
The very language of early Christianity mocked the pretense of divinity among rulers of the Roman Empire .
Benedict notes that in the days of the early Church , " Son of God " was a title claimed by the Emperors , and when the emperors sent out edicts to be read to the masses these proclamations were called " euangelions . "
So , the fact that the Christians would claim that writings about their Christ would be called euangelions and that Christ himself ( and Christ only ) should be called Son of God , provided a direct challenge to the Roman state .
Consequently , philosopher Rémi Brague , whom Chaput approvingly quotes in his book , writes that " from the start , Christianity set itself outside of the political domain , and its founding texts bear witness to a distrust of things political . "
So what can we take away from this ?
We know that governments and their agents are not imbued with any kind of divine power .
We know that Christians of all time periods have morally opposed the state , and we know that states are only legitimate when acting in the common good and in accordance with natural law .
But when exactly is civil government in accordance with natural law ?
This is where Chaput is hesitant to offer any solid prescriptions .
While this has disappointed many of his readers who expected him to put forth some kind of political ideology , Chaput wisely refrains from this .
This is the position he has to take since , as Chaput notes , " the church has no special claim to policy competence . "
In other words , on matters of faith and morals , the Church can provide doctrinal certainty , but on everything else , the interpretation of natural law depends on the economists and philosophers and physical scientists .
This means that what counts as " grave evil , " and demands a withholding of " any submission or cooperation " can vary depending on how one defines it .
As libertarians , we define most government action as a type of unjust aggression against individuals .
If individuals are taxed to fund abortions and unjust wars and police brutality and a nuclear arsenal , is not the very act of taxation a form of grave evil ?
If millions are impoverished by outrageous economic policies and the wealth of millions more is stolen through inflation and government spending that leads to economic collapse , is this not evil as well ?
The answer to all of this is yes , of course .
A state that impoverishes and kills and destroys , and all at enormous expense to taxpaying families , most certainly does not act for the common good .
Nor does such a state even keep the peace when wars rage constantly overseas and the police state grows to proportions never before seen in American history .
Yet , it remains to be seen how many Americans , let alone how many Catholics , agree with this assessment .
Catholic libertarians should take note .
Libertarian political theory , itself grounded in natural law theory and a profound respect for human rights and human dignity , still has much work to do , but this tradition can only supplement and strengthen the traditional Catholic views of the state .
Chaput ’s assessment of “ a spirit of adulation bordering on servility ” that surrounds Obama is sound enough , but if skepticism toward the government is warranted now , it was just as warranted in 2003 when the American state invaded Iraq with no justification and in obvious violation of Catholic Just War theory .
And skepticism was certainly warranted during the six years of complete Republican rule when the GOP did not once even attempt to end taxpayer subsidies to Planned Parenthood while simultaneously demonizing Planned Parenthood in fundraising letters .
Distrust and skepticism of the state is a Catholic tradition , and is warranted now as always .
Nevertheless , it is a shame that it has taken this long for an American bishop to say so .

ONE LAST BUSHIE SOIREE ….
Slate ‘s Christopher Beam managed to get into a special party on Sunday night : a final , farewell send - off event , called “ Crossing the Finish Line , ” for the president and his team .
Jason Linkins noted that it sounded “ like the most depressing event in the world , ” which seems entirely fair given Beam ’s description .
The party , organized by outgoing White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and his predecessor , Andy Card , was held in a room with no heating .
They could n’t get any entertainers , because they ’d already been booked for better events .
“ Are these all white people — I mean White House people ? ” I asked someone in a genuine Freudian slip .
Turned out the crowd was a mix of alumni from the White House , State Department , Treasury , and Justice and a few campaign workers .
The mood felt more sweet than bitter .
Many staffers had spent the weekend clearing out their offices .
The question I kept hearing was “ What ’s next ? ”
Some were applying to grad schools , others were heading to D.C. law firms or think tanks , and others were returning to their home states or traveling .
One outgoing Treasury employee had already landed a job as a manager at Abercrombie & Fitch .
Take a moment to mull over that that last part .
( Linkins noted , “ The Great Gatsby could have ended with that line . ” )
Eventually , the president thanked his team .
“ This is objectively the finest group of people ever to serve our country , ” he said .
“ Not to serve me , not to serve the Republican Party , but the United States of America . ”
“ I am glad we made this journey , ” he went on .
Then he engaged in a little reminiscence .
“ Remember the time in 2003 when Bartlett came to work all hung over ? ” Laughs .
“ Nothing ever changes . ”
He continued : “ We never shruck – ” “ Shirked ! ” someone yelled .
“ Shirked , ” Bush corrected , smiling .
“ You might have shirked ; I shrucked .
I mean we took the deals head on . ”
I ’m trying to decide whether or not Beam was lucky to get in .
Sure , he finagled an exclusive , but then again , he actually had to endure the party .

YORK , S.C. , March 6 ( UPI ) --
A class at South Carolina 's York Technical College was disrupted by an accidental discharge of a handgun carried by a student , police say .
Police in Rock Hill , S.C. , said 19 - year - old Jeremy Moffett carried a loaded semi-automatic Smith & Wesson handgun into one of the college 's satellite buildings this week , The Rock Hill Herald said Friday .

During Wednesday 's class at the Construction Trade Center , Moffett 's firearm accidentally discharged and Moffett fled the classroom .
Police allege Moffett initially claimed the gun discharged when it fell from his pocket after he fell asleep during the class .
Later , police said , Moffett changed his story and claimed he accidentally pulled the gun 's trigger while holding it in is pocket .
Moffett denies making the second admission and told the Herald he is thankful no one was hurt in the classroom incident .
" When you hear ' rude awakening , ' that was a rude awakening , " said Moffett , who is facing three related gun charges .
" I was scared . …
I 'm lucky , and I thank God … that nobody got hit . "

U .S. - BACKED Ethiopian troops withdrew from their remaining positions in Somalia at the end of January , bringing an end to a two - year occupation carried out in the guise of the " war on terror . "
The Ethiopian Army invaded Somalia in December 2006 , overthrowing the Union of Islamic Courts ( UIC ) government and installing the Transitional Federal Government ( TFG ) .
Two years later , approximately 10,000 people have lost their lives , and 1.1 million Somalis were turned into refugees , the victims of Ethiopian occupiers and an ongoing civil war .
From the beginning , the TFG , though backed by the U.S. , was weak , maintaining control in only a small area of the capital of Mogadishu , and some regions of western Somalia .
Several thousand African Union troops -- including U.S. - trained Ugandan forces -- ostensibly bolster the TFG , to little effect .
The U.S. also intervened directly in Somalia with sporadic air strikes .
After the Ethiopian invasion , sections of the UIC and other opposition forces regrouped in the Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia ( ARS ) , with others coalescing around the fundamentalist al - Shabab group and other armed factions .
Ethiopian troops withdrew after a unity agreement between the TFG and the ARS , now the major opposition faction .
Sheik Sharif Ahmed , the ARS leader and head of the UIC government in 2006 , was elected president of the TFG on January 31 .
* * * SOMALIA IS located in the strategically crucial Horn of Africa on the eastern edge of the continent -- adjacent to the Red Sea , Suez Canal and key commercial waterways .
Somalia and neighboring Sudan have been targeted for oil exploration by U.S. companies , but China , India and other countries have also gotten their foot in the door with development contracts .
Competition past and present is behind the U.S. government 's concern with Somalia .
The U.S. has variously engaged in direct intervention ( as in the infamous " Black Hawk Down " Marine invasion of 1992 - 3 ) , backed different warlord factions and supported proxy armies ( such as Ethiopia ) .
Actually , the history of Western intervention in Somalia and the Horn of Africa extends back throughout the 20th century , during which time colonial powers and the Cold War superpowers waged proxy battles in constantly shifting alliances and conflicts .
Somalia 's civil wars -- like those in Darfur and southern Sudan - - must be seen as a direct result of the U.S. and the former USSR arming different sides with billions of dollars , all while famines raged .
The so - called humanitarian intervention by U.S. Marines in Somalia in 1992�93 was merely a continuation of this policy with a different name .
Along with " fighting terror , " humanitarian intervention became a watchword for the Clinton administration and the Bush administration after it -- providing a cover for Washington 's pursuit of economic and military aims , and justifying U.S. military deployment in the region .
In 2003 , while the U.S. was invading and occupying Iraq , the U.S. military built a major base in Djibouti , a tiny but strategically located country next to Somalia and across the Red Sea from Yemen .
The U.S. used its Camp Lemonier to train Ethiopian forces in the lead - up to the December 2006 invasion of Somalia .
As Mike Whitney pointed out it on the Counterpunch Web site : " The Bush administration invoked the ' war on terror ' to justify its involvement in Somalia , but its claims are unconvincing .
The UIC is not an al - Qaeda affiliate or a terrorist organization .
In fact , the UIC brought a level of peace and stability to Somalia that had n't been seen for nearly two decades . "
Political analyst James Petras made a similar point :
The UIC was a relatively honest administration , which ended warlord corruption and extortion .
Personal safety and property were protected , ending arbitrary seizures and kidnappings by warlords and their armed thugs .
The UIC is a broad multi-tendency movement that includes moderates and radical Islamists , civilian politicians and armed fighters , liberals and populists , electoralists and authoritarians .
Most important , the Courts succeeded in unifying the country and creating some semblance of nationhood , overcoming clan fragmentation .
But Bush did n't let this relative stability under the UIC get in the way .
According to a Chicago Tribune article , the invasion in Somalia was " a covert war in which the CIA has recruited gangs of unsavory warlords to hunt down and kidnap Islamic militants ... and secretly imprison them offshore , aboard U.S. warships .
The British civil - rights group Reprieve contended that as many as 17 U.S. warships may have doubled as floating prisons since the September 11 terrorist attacks . "
Only one month after the 9/11 attacks , Paul Wolfowitz , one of the top neo-con hawks in the Bush administration , met with various factions in Ethiopia and Somalia , alleging that al - Qaeda terrorists might use these territories as " escape routes . "
On December 4 , 2006 , Gen. John Abizaid , then the head of U.S. Central Command covering much of the Middle East and the surrounding region , met with the Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi .
Three weeks later , Ethiopian forces crossed into Somalia , and the U.S. launched air strikes to back them up .
The air attacks were supposedly against terrorist targets , but they killed dozens of civilians .
The U.S. also embedded small numbers of Special Forces in the Ethiopian army , and provided naval and air support .
* * * THE END result of the U.S. intervention has been untold destruction .
Human Rights
Watch published a report in December 2008 detailing the impact :
Two years of unconstrained warfare and violent rights abuses have helped to generate an ever - worsening humanitarian crisis , without adequate response .
Since January 2007 , at least 870,000 civilians have fled the chaos in Mogadishu alone -- two - thirds of the city 's population ... Somalia 's humanitarian needs are enormous .
Humanitarian organizations estimate that more than 3.25 million Somalis -- over 40 percent of the population of south - central Somalia - - will be in urgent need of assistance by the end of 2008 ...
Freelance militias have robbed , murdered and raped displaced persons on the roads south towards Kenya .
Hundreds of Somalis have drowned this year in desperate attempts to cross the Gulf of Aden by boat to Yemen .
Amnesty International documented numerous accounts of killings of Somalis by Ethiopian troops .
In one case , " a young child 's throat was slit by Ethiopian soldiers in front of the child 's mother . "
And according to the Red Cross , about half of Somalia 's population is dependent on food aid .
Millions live in tent cities without adequate water , food or power , while hyperinflation has driven up the price of staple goods by six times since the start of 2008 .
As Whitney puts it , " It is the greatest humanitarian crisis in Africa today ; a man-made hell entirely conjured up in Washington . "
Somalis celebrated the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops , and President Sheikh Ahmed enjoys popular support as a legacy of past UIC rule .
The U.S. government 's short - term goal of installing a partner in counter - terror appears thwarted .
Yet Sheikh Ahmed 's openness to the U.S. and his collaboration with the TFG now divides his forces from other wings of the former UIC , including groups like al - Shabab , which is on the U.S. government 's list of terrorist organizations .
For the U.S. , the split is welcome .
Meanwhile , attacks by Somali armed groups have continued .
Suicide bombers , likely connected to al - Shabab , attacked African Union troops on February 3 .
The longer - term picture likewise indicates increased volatility in the region .
Since the collapse of the UIC government in 2006 , a resurgence of pirate attacks off the Somali coast -- with some holding multimillion - dollar tankers hostage -- recently prompted the Chinese and Indian governments to send naval patrols , an unprecedented move for China .
Faced with this heightened militarization , Bush called for sending warships to the Gulf of Aden as well , and Barack Obama has pledged support for continuing that policy .
The Obama administration is also a strong proponent of Africom , a new U.S. military command for Africa officially launched on October 1 , 2008 , with the frightening potential to subject Somalia and other countries and regions to U.S. terror on a new scale .
In fact , Africom could mean the Somali experience writ large for the entire continent , with local proxies and enhanced military reinforcement .
As Nunu Kidane put it in an article titled " Africom , Militarization and Resource Control " :
If you 're thinking traditional bases with thousands of military personnel , think again .
General Kip
Ward has said it is not about " bases " and " garrisons , " but rather a network of sophisticated military operations strategically placed throughout the continent , which can be moved around and utilized for any purpose .
General Gates called Africom " a different kind of command with a different orientation , one that we hope and expect will institutionalize a lasting security relationship with Africa . "
It is " a civilian - military partnership , " where diplomatic and humanitarian relief by the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) will get directives from the Department of Defense .
Africa Action and other human rights groups have rightly called on the Obama administration to address the humanitarian catastrophe in Somalia .
But one often - proposed solution -- United Nations peacekeepers -- would only escalate the problems for ordinary Somalis .
On the ground , UN troops would carry out U.S. priorities , just as they did during the " humanitarian intervention " of 1993 .
Instead , activists should stand against any U.S. military intervention in Somalia , from Africom to the naval patrols .
Challenging the " war on terror " is a crucial first step toward real peace for Somalis .

WHEN Standard & Poor ’s , the bond - rating agency , lowered General Electric ’s rating to AA + , from AAA , last week , many were shocked at the tarnishing of one of America ’s most revered corporations .
But the real scandal is how long it took S.&P. to make that minor change  and that the other major ratings firm , Moody ’s , still has n’t  even though G.E. ’s dividend has been slashed by two - thirds and its stock price had fallen below $ 7 , from nearly $ 40 a year ago .
Why , more than a year into the crisis , do regulators and investors continue to rely on ratings ?
No one has been more wrong than Moody ’s and S.&P .
Less than a year ago both gave high ratings to 11 of the largest distressed financial institutions .
They put the insurance giant A.I.G. in the AA category .
They rated Lehman Brothers an A just a month before it collapsed .
Until recently , the agencies maintained AAA ratings on thousands of nearly worthless subprime - related securities .
The reason for this continued reliance on ratings is simple : bad regulation .
We have seen up close how legal rules that depend on ratings pervert the process .
One of us worked at Moody ’s , and was a frequent in - house critic of how the agencies put troubled companies on artificial “ watch lists ” while they maintained overly optimistic letter ratings .
The other of us worked in Morgan Stanley ’s derivatives group , which designed risky structured products that nevertheless obtained high ratings .
These deals were the ancestors of the highly rated subprime mortgage derivatives at the center of the crisis .
The trip down the dysfunctional regulatory path began after the 1929 crash , when Gustav Osterhus , an examiner at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , proposed a system for weighting the value of a bank ’s portfolio .
He felt regulators needed to be able to express a portfolio’s “ safety ” with letter symbols .
Always love big LEGO build efforts , but these days I 'm more fascinated by recreations of other scifi craft , like the Vipers from BSG , the Aliens Sulaco , dropship and APC , and of course , Star Trek .

A graphical representation of the molecular machine
Super - fast quantum computers are now a step closer to becoming a reality , thanks to a breakthrough by scientists .
Edinburgh and Manchester University researchers have created a molecular device which could act as a building block for super - fast computers .
They have created components that could be used to develop quantum computers , which can make intricate calculations faster than conventional machines .
The academics used molecular scale technology instead of silicon chips .
They achieved the breakthrough by combining tiny magnets with molecular machines that can shuttle between two locations without the use of external force .
The manoeuvrable magnets could one day be used as the basic component in quantum computers .
' Major challenges '
Conventional computers work by storing information in the form of bits , which can represent information in binary code - either as zero or one .
Quantum computers will use quantum binary digits , or qubits , which are far more sophisticated as they are capable of representing not only zero and one , but a range of values simultaneously .
Their complexity will enable quantum computers to perform more quickly than conventional machines .
Professor David Leigh , of Edinburgh University 's school of chemistry , said : " This development brings super - fast , non-silicon based computing a step closer .
" The major challenges we face now are to bring many of these qubits together to build a device that could perform calculations , and to discover how to communicate between them . "
The study , by Edinburgh and Manchester university scientists and published in the journal Nature , was funded by the European Commission .
The United States has stepped closer to a total ban on the use and export of cluster bombs with the signing by Barack Obama of a new permanent law that would make it almost impossible for the US to sell the controversial weapons .
The decision was hailed by opponents of the weapons as a " major turnaround in US policy " that overrode Pentagon calls to permit their continued export .
The new legislation , tacked on to a huge budget bill , was passed earlier this week by Congress and now sets such stringent rules for the bombs ' use , including a ban on sales where they might be suspected of being used where civilians are present , that it seems unlikely the US could export them again .
Researchers believe the US has transferred hundreds of thousands of cluster munitions , containing tens of millions of unreliable and inaccurate bomblets , to 28 countries .
They are regarded by those who campaign against their use as indiscriminate and dangerous to clear up .
Under the new rules , the air and artillery - deployed weapons , which scatter hundreds of bomblets , are required to have a self - destruct failure rate of less than 1 % , which few of the US cluster bombs meet , before being cleared for sale .
Despite a temporary ban having been in place , the Pentagon made it clear last year that it was keen to see the export of the weapons again .
The new law comes into force amid growing pressure from Congress for a complete ban on their use , even by the US military .
International opposition to cluster bombs , which maim and kill civilians long after they have been fired during conflicts , has been hardening rapidly since the Israeli Defence Forces fired more than 1 m into southern Lebanon during the 2006 war with Hezbollah .
Last year , a treaty limiting their use was signed by 95 countries , including most of America 's Nato allies - but not the US .
The 2008 treaty has in effect dried up the potential market for US - manufactured munitions , but in a policy document put out by the Pentagon last year , the US defence department called for it to be allowed to export cluster bombs for another 10 years .
" This permanent export ban is a major turnaround in US policy , " said Steve Goose , arms division director at Human Rights Watch , which has campaigned against cluster munitions .
" It brings Washington into closer alignment with international opinion on this terrible weapon .
" The passage of this measure is yet another indication that the president should initiate a thorough review of US policy with respect to cluster munitions .
If it is unacceptable for foreign militaries to use these weapons , why would it be acceptable for the US military to use them ? "
In July 2008 , Robert Gates , the defence secretary , issued a three - page directive spelling out US policy on cluster munitions which described the ordnance as " legitimate weapons with clear military utility " .
Under that policy , the US will continue to use cluster munitions and , after 2018 , will use only munitions with a tested failure rate of less than 1 % .
However , in December 2008 , a spokeswoman for the Obama transition team said the next president would " carefully review " the treaty banning cluster munitions and " work closely [ with ] our friends and allies to ensure that the United States is doing everything feasible to promote protection of civilians " .
Goose said : " The export ban moves the US one step closer to the position taken by nearly 100 nations , including its closest Nato allies , that have signed the treaty banning cluster munitions .
A US decision to sign would certainly signal President Obama 's commitment to multilateral diplomacy . "
The move was also welcomed by the US Campaign to Ban Landmines .
" What is important is the growing awareness that these weapons are beyond the pale , " said Lora Lumpe .
" This is a significant step towards seeing these weapons banned entirely .
The door is closing on cluster munitions .
When Georgia and Russia both used them in the war in South Ossetia last year they denied their use , because they realise how unacceptable the use of cluster bombs is now becoming . "
An artist 's impression of how HMS Victory may have looked A US - based salvage firm is believed to have found remains from the wreck of a British warship which sank in the English Channel in 1744 .
Odyssey Marine Exploration is expected to announce on Monday that it has found HMS Victory , the forerunner of Nelson 's famous flagship of the same name .
The valuables from the vessel , including brass cannons , could be worth millions of pounds , some experts say .
If confirmed , the find could trigger a row with the British government .
The remains from HMS Victory have been reportedly found in international waters .
We found this [ the shipwreck ] more than 50 miles ( 80 km ) from where anybody would have thought it went down
Greg Stemm
Odyssey Marine Exploration
But as a military wreck , they officially belong to the British state .
' Gold coins '
Ahead of the expected announcement at a news conference in London on Monday , Odyssey Marine Exploration 's CEO Greg Stemm said the firm was negotiating with Britain over collaborating on the project .
" This is a big one , just because of the history , " Mr Stemm was quoted as saying by the Associated Press .
" Very rarely do you solve an age - old mystery like this . "
Mr Stemm declined to reveal the exact location of the warship 's remains .
" We found this more than 50 miles ( 80 km ) from where anybody would have thought it went down , " he said .
HMS Victory has been described by some maritime experts as " the finest ship in the world " at its time .
It sank with more than 1,100 seamen aboard , including Admiral Sir John Balchen , in a fierce storm off the Channel Islands .
The ship 's exact location has since remained a mystery , despite numerous attempts by salvagers to find it .
The vessel had 100 brass cannons and reportedly some 100,000 gold coins on board .
In 2007 , Odyssey said it had salvaged 17 tonnes of gold and silver coins , worth $ 500 m ( £ 343 m ) , from a shipwreck in the North Atlantic .
The Spanish government later sued the company , claiming the sunken ship was a famous 19th Century Spanish galleon .
The case is pending .

For everything going wrong in your life right now , there 's at least one beacon of light to keep you , a dutiful PS3 owner , smiling .
A long ( long ! ) awaited device has just slipped into the FCC 's database , and while details are scant , most of what we need to know is tucked away in the title : Logitech Harmony Adapter for PlayStation 3 .
For far too long , PS3 owners with IR - based universal remotes have had to rely on clunky IR - to - Bluetooth converters to get the two to communicate , but as soon as the E - R0001 hits the market , all that will change for Harmony owners .
As of now , we 've got three questions that desperately need answered : 1 ) when ? ; 2 ) how much ? ; and 3 ) what Harmony remotes are compatible ?
I remember the first stuff I read about network programming .
It was the Beej ’s Guide to network programming .
Concise and straight to the point , this guide have been used for several years .
Beej describes the socket API with hopefully as little hassle as humanly possible ( Beej ) .
Yes , good things resist to the time .
And I can cite some more examples , with similar success .
TCP / IP Illustrated , Volume 1 , 1994 , by W. Richard Stevens .
Fantastic book , despite its publish date .
It cover in details several important protocols , like TCP , UDP , IP , ICMP and others .
Stevens published other volumes for this series , as you could imagine .
The second volume ( The implementation ) is devoted to source code and talks about BSD 4.4 .
Since many companies used BSD as starting point for theirs network stack implementations , it is simple to realize its importance .
UNIX Network Programming , third edition , 2004 , by W. Richard Stevens ( again ) , Bill Fenner and Andrew M.Rudoff .
This book was originally written by Stevens but after he passed away , in 1999 , the book got an edition with new co-authors .
In this book , the socket API is unveiled .
Recent protocols , like IPv6 and SCTP are discussed as well .
It is a book for programmers and a great reference .
Unfortunately , it is too thick to put under your pillow .
Although these books use C as default language , the socket API does not change significantly when choosing another programming language .
In fact , newer languages just implemented socket API since it is a kind of de facto standard .
It is important to cite some specific book for Python .
For instance , Foundations of Python Network Programming , 2004 , by John Goerzen covers not only socket API but several important modules found in Python .
It is a good companion , certainly .
By its turn , PyS60 network programming is very close to standard Python programming , just showing some sort of limitations ( some socket options , for instance ) .
A lot of books , no code at all .
Yes , sorry .
But we will have some fun in next post , I promise !

It 's not often I cheer for a corporate giant unleashing its legal might , but let 's make an exception for the lawsuit Verizon Wireless has filed this week against a film distributor .
In fact , it might even enough for me to forgive Verizon for its own robo - call assault on my house .
From the Verizon Wireless press release :
Verizon Wireless said today it has filed a lawsuit to stop a Utah - based telemarketing company from calling its customers and employees to advertise the upcoming movie , " The Velveteen Rabbit . "
The lawsuit , filed this week in U.S. District Court in Trenton , alleges Feature Films for Families , Inc. illegally used an autodialer to call Verizon Wireless customers on behalf of a company called Family 1 Films , based in Los Angeles .
The lawsuit states that over 10 days in early February , nearly 500,000 calls were made to Verizon Wireless customers and employees from the telephone number 917-210-4609 .
When customers answered these calls to their wireless phones they heard either a prerecorded voice message or an individual reading a script promoting the anticipated release of the film .
" Telemarketers continue to harass our customers and impinge on their privacy , often using illegal methods including autodialers , " said Steven E. Zipperstein , vice president and general counsel of Verizon Wireless .
" Whatever their methods and whatever their product , these unlawful telemarketing calls are an annoyance to our customers and invade their privacy . "
Did you notice that release included the telephone number ?
Normally not a nice thing to do .
Normally .
What could this film company possibly be thinking ?
A Utah newspaper managed to get a comment :
Matt Cooper , general counsel for Feature Films for Families Inc. and the film 's producer , New Movie Corp. , acknowledged Wednesday that New Movie Corp. had undertaken the calling campaign but did not believe it violated state or federal laws .
The campaign was suspended Wednesday , he said .
Cooper said New Movie Corp. " apologizes if their calling campaign caused any concerns or inconvenience . "
Translation : I 'm sorry we got caught and our sleazy practices are being publicized .
No way my kids are seeing this movie ( unless Mom caves ; that 's her call ) .
A delicate dance of teaser diplomacy has begun between Iran and the Obama administration .
Both sides are deciding how , or even whether , to hold talks that could , ultimately , reshape the Middle East .
As it nears a nuclear capability , Iran can afford to play for time .
But how much patience does President Obama have in such a case ?
The first inklings of US resolve may come this week as American envoy William Burns consults with Europe on possible talks with a country that supports terrorists but also holds immense reserves of oil and gas .
Three allies – Britain , Germany , and France – have spent five years talking to Iran about ending its nuclear program , only to fail .
Those talks did perhaps deflect a possible attack on Iranian atomic facilities by Israel or the Bush administration .
But they resulted in only limited United Nations - approved sanctions on the Islamic regime .
And this " EU - 3 " group of negotiators did finally set a condition that Iran must suspend its nuclear quest before talks resume .
Now Mr. Obama wants to drop that precondition .
This new US position makes some in Europe wonder if the new president may end up not being tough enough on Iran or may even be ready to accept it developing atomic weapons .
But Obama 's message to Europe is this :
Talking with Iran will help bring more support for tougher sanctions applied by even more countries , and thus help prevent a military confrontation .
China , for instance , still supplies Iran with much of what it needs .
So far , Iran is n't responding with open arms to Obama 's offers .
Ruled by ruthless Muslim mullahs , it faces a largely rigged election for president in June that could uncork social discontent over mishandling of the economy .
The clerical contest for power may explain the tough conditions set down for talks with the US by the vulnerable president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
At the least , Europeans advise , the US should wait until after the election , especially if a reformer is chosen president .
But Obama needs
Iran 's help soon to pull US forces out of Iraq and to suppress the Taliban in Afghanistan .
And with predictions for Iran becoming able to assemble a nuclear weapon ranging from one to five years , Obama can't afford to wait too long .
Even if talks begin – probably with Kissinger - to - China - like secrecy – the potential compromises to achieve suspension of Iran 's nuclear ambitions may be huge .
Will the US accept Iran as the major power in the Gulf ?
Will it allow Iran to continue making threats at Israel ?
Simply offering talks is a big trump card for Obama to play .
His hand would be strengthened if he first split off Iran 's key ally , Syria , with a peace deal that would end support for Lebanon 's Hezbollah and for Hamas in Gaza .
He could also force Israel to freeze Jewish settlements in the West Bank .
But this week , Obama must first deal with Europe 's concerns , which include a fear that the US might put itself first in line to tap Iran 's petroleum if talks succeed .
Speedy but effective diplomacy that does n't let Iran buy time and lures it into being a responsible regional player must be Obama 's strategy .
Otherwise , the dominant US role in the Middle East will diminish and the region will face a nuclear arms race .
What 's Obvious I : Legalize All Drugs But Meth ( February 16 , 2009 )
It is difficult to state what is obvious , but I launch a good - faith effort in a new series this week .
Today : legalize all drugs but crystal meth .
The difficulty is stating the obvious is , well , what 's obvious to us is not obvious to others until it has reached the very late stage of " undeniable . "
The coming financial meltdown of the global economy was exceedingly obvious to me and to most of you in 2005 , 2006 and 2007 , yet the mainstream media only belatedly took notice of " the obvious " in 2008 when major players like Bear Stearns started blowing up .
In the same way , it is exceedingly obvious that we need to legalize all drugs -- marijuana , cocaine , heroin , peyote , etc. -- with the one exception of crystal meth , a terrifically destructive substitute for the more expensive cocaine .
I have addressed this issue a number of times : The Worst of All Possible Worlds ( April 21 , 2008 ) Today 's exercise : design a policy which produces the following results : 1 . fills a veritable gulag of prisons with a half a million nonviolent men and women 2 . feeds a global Mafia of unprecedented size , wealth and influence 3 . nurtures a ghetto culture of endless turf wars , murder and mayhem 4 . despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars , the policy utterly fails to meet its " official " goal of limiting the supply of certain commodities Congratulations , you 've just designed the U.S. " War on Drugs . "
The failures of this " war " are so monumental that they beggar description .
Not only are illegal drugs still readily available , the " war " has spawned a global Mafia which reaps billions of dollars in profits , enabling it to extend its reach into other businesses .
Here at home , inner cities are riven by endless drug- centric turf wars and murders .
Pushers are the " big men " in the ghetto , the ones young men and women respect and hope to emulate .
In an attempt to render the consequences of dealing drugs so horrendous that people would forsake the immense wealth and prestige to be gained , the penalties for drug dealing and possession have been ramped up to insane " minimum sentences " which exceed those for rape and manslaughter .
More recently , I addressed legalizing drugs in End of Work , End of Affluence IV : Crime and Prohibition ( December 11 , 2008 )
By a wide margin , no policy has failed more spectacularly and at greater cost in human l ives and national treasure than the " war on drugs . "
No policy runs so counter to well - established research or law enforcement views , yet at the same time no policy is more heavily defended politically as " essential " and " unquestioned . "
The " War 's " single success is the unparalleled reach of the propaganda machine behind the " war on drugs " / Prison Nation gulag .
Indeed , we have to wonder : how did a policy which has failed so miserably for so long , at such horrendous cost , a policy renounced by the very law enforcement officials tasked with its Kafka - esque prosecution , continue to be so utterly sacrosanct and untouchable ?
One answer is of course , " follow the money . "
An entire Gulag / Prison Nation of well - paid police forces , sheriff 's departments and prison guards now feeds off the failed " war on drugs . "
If the " war " were cancelled as an abject , total failure , then funding for helicopters and other goodies would dry up , and staff would be reassigned to less glamorous work like catching those committing murder , rape , larceny , identity theft , robbery , car theft , burglary , and everyone 's least favorite beat , " white collar crime " in which smart guys steal millions with almost no chance of ever being caught and doing time .
Another answer is to look at the structure of " the obvious " and analyze just why repealing failed prohibition is so not - obvious .
For that we turn to the 60s - era " radical " psychiatrist and thinker , R.D. Laing , who penned this prescient lecture in 1972 : The Obvious :
To a considerable extent what follows is an essay in stating what I take to be obvious .
It is obvious that the social world situation is endangering the future of all life on this planet .
To state the obvious is to share with you what ( in your view ) my misconceptions might be .
The obvious can be dangerous .
The deluded man frequently finds his delusions so obvious that he can hardly credit the good faith of those who do not share them .
What is obvious to Lyndon Johnson is not at all obvious to Ho Chi Minh .
What is obvious to me might not be obvious to anyone else .
The obvious is literally that which stands in one 's way , in front of or over against oneself .
One has to begin by recognizing that it exists for oneself .
The study of social events presents an almost insurmountable difficulty , in that their visibility , as one might say , is very low .
In social space one 's direct immediate capacity to see what is happening does not extend any further than one 's own senses extend .
Beyond that one has to make inferences based on hearsay evidence , reports of one kind or another of what other human beings are able to see within their equally limited field of observation .
As in space , so in time .
Our capacity to probe back into history is extraordinarily limited .
Even in the most detailed investigations of small fragments of micro-history , in studies of families , one finds it difficult to get past two or three generations .
Beyond that , how things have come to be as they are disappears into mist .
Following that thought : most Americans have no idea of just how dramatically , and completely , the attempt to outlaw alcohol failed in the 1920s .
For a brief recap , please read this from the augustly " conservative " pages of the Wall Street Journal : Let 's End Drug Prohibition : Most Americans agreed that alcohol suppression was worse than alcohol consumption .
If so many libertarian - leaning conservatives grasp the utter futility and horrendously predictable consequences of the failed " war on drugs , " then why is it as politically untouchable as the so - called " third rail of American politics , " Social Security ?
The point of " undeniability " is rapdily approaching , as the U.S. 's insane " war on drugs " has reached the point of destabilizing entire nations and regions : Latin American Panel Calls U.S. Drug War a Failure ( WSJ.com )
I am not suggesting these drugs should be uncontrolled .
Common sense suggests that marijuana would be controlled much like alcohol and tobacco , and that heroin and cocaine would be controlled like morphine .
We already have a system for dispensing " controlled drugs " which , while not perfect , works pretty well .
Elderly patients with severe pain management needs ( like my Dad ) receive morphine from their local pharmacies ; the local heroin junkies could pick up their prescriptions in much the same manner .
Look , the vast majority of us have no desire to stick needles in ourselves and zone out .
You could n't pay me enough to 1 ) stick myself daily and 2 ) get zoned out daily .
The desire to become addicted is limited by factors we do not yet understand to a specific ( small ) percentage of the populace .
The idea that our entire youth would rush out and get addicted to smack ( heroin ) if given the opportunity is simply groundless .
If we take away the profit and the " glamour " of a verboten drug , then very few would actively seek such a monkey on their back -- and those few who would have already done so .
And perhaps surprisingly to those who have little in the way of real - world drug - rehab experience , numerous heroin addicts function rather well in the real world .
Statistically , I would wager that on a per capita basis , your middle - class heroin addict functions as well or better by most metrics ( holding a job , not physically abusing his family , etc. ) than the average middle - class alcoholic .
I know , I know -- that 's not P.C. and therefore verboten to even suggest .
And so is this :
The way to " take out " crack cocaine and crystal meth is to legalize plain old cocaine and make it cheap .
Easily verifiable fact : people zoned out on dope ( marijuana ) and horse ( heroin ) do not start fights , drive drunk or otherwise create mayhem .
That work is left to those high on alcohol , a fully legal drug with proven nightmarish consequences like 15,000 needless traffic deaths a year and countless murders and rapes .
What is " obvious " to an anthropologist from another culture or a visiting extraterrestrial is that alcohol should be as controlled as morphine and marijuana should be as readily available as tobacco .
That marijuana has been demonized is simply political ; by any metric ( violence , traffic deaths , disease , whatever ) , it is " obvious " that marijuana is less destructive , less deadly and less addictive than perfectly legal alcohol .
As I have stated here before : the way to " legalize " marijuana is to enable R.J. Reynolds and other tobacco companies to grow , test , package and market " medicinal marijuana " like they do tobacco .
On the geopolitical scale , it would be phenomenally cheaper and more efficient for the U.S. government to buy the entire poppy crop in Afghanistan and Burma ( the Golden Triangle ) and the entire coca crop in South America at wholesale prices than to waste untold billions in a painfully foolish attempt to seal 10,000 miles of porous border .
My own rough guess is that the U.S. could buy the entire global harvests of poppies and coca for about 10 % the annual cost of the visible " war on drugs " , i.e. $ 5 billion versus $ 55 billion .
And that $ 55 billion does not include the staggering cost of incarcerating hundreds of thousands of prisoners nailed for dealing or using drugs .
Question for " war on drugs " fans : what does prison do to dumb people caught doing / dealing drugs ?
It turns them into hardened criminals .
Prison is so destructive to its inmates it rather " obviously " should be reserved for violent predators : killers , rapists , muggers , etc. " Club Fed " is a misnomer ; no prison is fun and carefree , and for white - collar crimes , and those who manage to run afoul of the law via nonviolent means , low - security prisons free of predators are a common - sense solution to the need to punish these transgressors .
Lagniappe benefit to legalizing drugs : a huge new dollop of " sin taxes . "
Correspondent Craig M. recently recommended this insightful piece : Popular Delusions blog : Recapitalise the banking system - legalise drugs .
Growing and packaging high - quality organic marijuana / hemp could be a huge cash - crop for the U.S.
And unlike most other cash - crops , marijuana ( hemp ) is hardy enough to thrive in poor soils .
The harvest not deemed good enough for medicinal use could be made into clothing , rope , etc . -- the traditional uses for hemp .
The list of advantages to ending the absurdly costly and destructive Prohibition on drugs is so long , so obvious , so well - supported that the question now is : can we afford to lavishly fund a failed policy which is not only a supremely ineffectual waste of money but a destabilizing force geopolitically ?
For the record : I have no desire to buy or use the drugs mentioned in this entry except for alcohol in the form of wine and beer .
I am of legal age to do so .

This post is the tentative conclusion to a series of posts , loosely about the sorts of pseudo - scams that credit card companies use to keep borrowers in debt , which series began as a response to an article I read in Business Week .
After all , the fact that most credit card debt collection is an outright scam , is both the tip of the iceberg , and the roundabout culmination of a business practice based on exploitation .
The process by which banks create money is so simple that the mind is repelled .
– J.K. Galbraith
The scams are , in no particular order of importance ( since they all feed off of , and enable one another ) :
A brief review is in order : when borrowers default on a credit card contract , arbitration is generally foisted upon the debtor , by the creditor .
The credit card companies are able to game the informational asymmetry they acquire over the course of many proceedings , to exclude arbitrators who show any tendency towards siding with the debtor .
Lurking below the surface , are the pseudo - scams that are used to keep borrowers in debt .
Credit card companies routinely apply payments towards the principle bearing the lowest interest rate first , in an effort to create negative - amortization , and so as to collect more unearned interest payments .
They offer low - interest balance transfers in an attempt to create such a negative - amortization situation , especially to their most - worthy customers ( who are not otherwise profitable for them ) .
Often , a single late payment causes interest rates on all debts ( sometimes even on other credit cards underwritten by the same company ) to rise to usurious heights .
Most people do everything they can to stave off default until it is the only available option .
At this point in time , they have probably had use of their card (s ) suspended for several months , they ’ve accumulated mountains of spurious fees , and excessive interest charges .
This phantom debt is then presented to an arbitrator who is , for all intents and purposes , chosen by the creditor , and used as the starting point for default negotiations , liens or encumbrances to be filed against real property , structured repayment agreements , and so on .
The circle is complete .
Some people might posit that consumers should make more prudent decisions , but when every lender is in - fact a loan - shark , and the monetary system is a scam that destroys the value of savings , decisions are often made that would otherwise be deemed imprudent .
Capitalmarkets are profoundly distorted by legislation and monetary policy , as a result institutions are able to “ loan ” money at teaser rates which no honest man could bear .
If everyone paid off their balance in full each month , credit card companies would quickly go out of business , because there are few things less profitable than giving out perpetually interest - free revolvers .
Credit card companies are , as a matter of fact incapable of profiting from responsible borrowers .
It is impossible to profit from these borrowers , because it ’s impossible to charge them .
It ’s impossible to charge them , because all credit card companies have the legal privilege of creating debt obligations from thin fucking air .
If one credit card issuer wanted to issue 30 - day notes payable , they would quickly be undercut by another issuer who wrote the same obligations at a lower interest rate , and so on .
The result is that none of the companies are capable of charging these customers anything .
The credit card companies ’ modus operandi , is to figure out new and creative ways to get people to violate some obtuse term in a contract of adhesion , such that they can then charge whatever they ’d like .
Precisely , the problem is that they do n’t want you to pay off your “ loan ” every month .
They want you , indeed , they need you to carry a balance .
So they come up with neat little ways of trying to prevent you from paying off your balance .
E.g. , a “ zero - interest balance transfer ” is worthless , if you ’re already carrying a balance – even a small one that you intend to pay off .
They prey primarily on financial ignorance , and although there is certainly some culpability on behalf of debtors , the primary reason for any of these situations is a political environment that encourages the creation of ex nihilo , no - interest debt obligations , and a legal environment that tolerates same .
Loans , or the extension of personal lines , always entails the lender ’s sacrifice of present consumption in order to enjoy a greater future consumption .
The “ debt ” embodied on a credit card statement is not , in any meaningful way , tied to any distinct amount of real , accumulated wealth .
Nobody has lost anything when the borrower defaults , on the contrary , whosoever he purchased goods from has already received and has likely spent the money that was created out of nothing .
Fiat credit is NOT a loan for which anyone has put up any amount of collateral ; it is a fiction and a fraud .

Tuesday , February 17 , 2009 WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama has authorized a Saudi project to supply aerospace systems to Syria , in what was seen as the suspension of U.S. sanctions .
The Commerce Department has not confirmed the approval .
Boeing , however , acknowledged that Commerce approved an export license for Syria on Feb .
2 . Satellites identify apparent CW site in Syria — February 19
The sources said the approval by Commerce marked a departure from nearly five years of sanctions by the outgoing Bush administration .
Under the Syrian Accountability Act , Syria was to be denied all but food and humanitarian supplies from the United States .
Also In This Edition This Week 's Geostrategy - Direct Headlines Bush aides had said Syria used passenger jets to ferry weapons from Iran to Hizbullah in Lebanon , Middle East Newsline reported .
Bush aides had said Syria used passenger jets to ferry weapons from Iran to Hizbullah in Lebanon , Middle East Newsline reported .
" This was an issue that has been on the back - burner for a long time , " a government source said .
The decision would allow Boeing to overhaul two 747s for the state - owned Syrian Arab Airlines .
Boeing has contracted its Saudi - based venture , Alsalam Aircraft Co. , to conduct the overhaul .
Commerce , however , argued that the repair of the Boeing 747s would prevent air accidents .
The sources said the department said this would come within the definition of U.S. humanitarian exports to Damascus .
Syria has reported several U.S. measures to improve relations under the Obama administration .
On Feb. 15 , Syrian ambassador to the United States , Imad Mustafa , said the U.S. Treasury Department approved the transfer of $ 500,000 to a Syrian charity .
Mustafa 's announcement came on the eve of the visit by a U.S. Senate delegation to Damascus .
The delegation was headed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Sen. John Kerry , scheduled to meet President Bashir Assad .

Do n't discount this story out of being misinformed about Syrian air transportation .
Like the former Soviets whom they have emulated in many ways , there is a very thin separation between the civil and military branches of their air transportation .

The media pretends not to notice BHO 's insanity , politicians pretend not to care , and the adolecent - minded Obama voters do n't even have to pretend not to have a clue about what 's going on .
Compared to Comrade Obama , King George was a more intelligent choice to rule the colonies than this narcissistic , traiterous crowd ever will be .

Good lord people , they 're jumbo jets from the 70's .
If you actually dig a little further instead of just flying off the handle you 'd realize that Syrian Arab Airlines is a commercial airline , and they also have Airbus A320's and Boeing 727's .

We have created the following FAQ to provide background information on the open letter to Sun microsystems .
Q : What is the Apache Software Foundation ?
A : The Apache Software Foundation - or ASF - is a 501 ( c ) 3 public charity that , among other things , provides a foundation for open , collaborative software development projects by supplying hardware , communication , and business infrastructure .
The Foundation website is http://www.apache.org and you can read more about the Foundation at http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html
Q : What is the Apache Harmony project ?
A : Apache Harmony is a project of the Apache Software Foundation focused on creating an independent , compatible implementation of Java SE .
That means we 're writing the whole implementation from scratch , or incorporating software from other open source projects .
You can read more about the Apache Harmony project at its website http://harmony.apache.org
Q : Why was Harmony created ?
A : Harmony was created for many reasons .
The fundamental reason is the same as other projects in the open source / free software space working Java ( such as GNU Classpath , Kaffe , GCJ , etc ) - we wanted to do an implementation of a complete , compatible Java SE runtime environment , including virtual machine , class library and tools under a FLOSS license .
Q : What does " FLOSS " mean ?
A : It refers to a license being either " Free " , " Libre " or " Open Source " .
Q : What is the Java Community Process ?
A : The Java Community Process ( or JCP ) is the governing organization for Java .
Initially created by Sun , it includes an Executive Committee composed of 32 representatives from corporations , individuals and academics representing thousands of members .
The JCP is the organization through which new specifications for Java technology are created .
Q : How long has the JCP existed ?
A : After an initial draft of the process was crafted and distributed on October 8 , 1998 , the JCP was introduced on December 8 , 1998 and was announced by Sun at the 1998 Java Business Expo Conference .
Q : What is the JSPA ?
A : The JSPA is the " Java Specification Participation Agreement " , the governing document of the JCP .
Among other things , it specifies how IP is managed in an expert group , how it is licensed to independent implementations , and how the TCK and RI can be licensed .
Q : What is a JSR ?
A : A JSR is a " Java Specification Request " , the formal vehicle through which Java technologies are created or updated .
A JSR is proposed by any JCP member , who is then known as the " specification lead " or " spec lead " for that JSR .
The spec lead organizes an " expert group " and that expert group works to create the specification .
The expert group must also create a " reference implementation " or " RI " , as well as a " technology compatibility kit " or " TCK " .
Q : What is an expert group ?
A : An expert group is a group of people , organized by a spec lead for a JSR , with appropriate expertise in the area of the JSR .
Q : How many JSRs has the ASF participated in ?
A : Many - the ASF has had representation in JSRs since the modern JCP was formed .
Q : How many JSRs has the ASF implemented as open source software ?
A : Many .
For example , Apache Tomcat , Apache Geronimo , Apache Harmony , Apache MyFaces , Apache Scout , Apache ActiveMQ , Apache ServiceMix , Apache Jackrabbit , Apache Portals , Apache WebServices and Apache XML are all projects that implement one or more JSRs .
Q : What is a TCK ?
A : The Technology Compatibility Kit , a test framework produced by the spec lead to be used by independent implementations to demonstrate compatibility ( and therefore get the grant of necessary IP ) .
Q : Why is the TCK useful ?
A : It allows independent implementations to demonstrate that they are compatible with the specification , and as a result , receive all the " necessary IP " from expert group members .
Q : What is " necessary IP " and why is this important that compatible implementations receive it ?
A : " Necessary IP " is the IP - usually patents - that cannot be technically avoided when implementing the specification .
This is important because it prevents anyone from joining an expert group and gaining the ability to demand royalties from implementors or users of the specification .
This is one of the main features of the JCP that makes the specs the JCP produces " open specifications " .
Q : You talk about the JCK in the letter .
Is the JCK a TCK ?
A : It is , actually .
The JCK is the name Sun gave the TCK for the Java SE specification .
While it has a different name , it 's a TCK for the purposes of JCP process discussion .
Q : Who owns the JCK ?
A : Sun owns the JCK , as they created it as part of their obligation as a spec lead .
The JSPA requires the spec lead for every JSR to deliver a TCK ( which Sun calls the JCK for the Java SE spec ) when a given spec is completed to allow independent implementations to demonstrate compatibility and receive the necessary IP grant .
Q : Was it always possible to create and distribute implementations of JSRs under free and open source licenses ?
A : No , but the ASF was instrumental in making this possible .
In 2002 , the Apache Software Foundation , working with other members of the Java community , led the effort to change the JCP governance document - the " Java Specification Participation Agreement " or JSPA .
These changes finally made it possible to create independent implementations of Java specification under free and open source licenses .
Before these changes , it was impossible to do so .
Q : What is the " Apache Compromise " ?
A : As part of the process that led to changes in the JSPA , Sun Microsystems made a public commitment to the Java community that Sun-led specifications would be implementable in free and open source software .
That commitment can be found here : http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/announce/LetterofIntent.html
Q : Is it true that Java SE 5 was the first of the Java SE JSRs to be released under the above - mentioned FOSS - friendly JCP terms ?
A : Yes .
Some Java specifications take years to complete , and one was in progress at the time of the JSPA changes .
So we had to wait until the next JSR for Java SE was complete , which was Java SE 5 .
Q : I see you refer to " necessary IP " in your open letter .
Is Sun the only owner of the necessary intellectual property that the Java SE JSR contains ?
A : No .
There probably is " necessary IP " from all members of the Java SE expert group .
The JSPA requires expert group members to license their necessary IP to the spec lead , who in turn is obligated to license all necessary IP to any compatible implementation that passes the TCK ( or in this case , the JCK ) .
Q : Who was the spec lead for the Java SE 5 JSR ?
A : Sun. See http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=176 Q : Is Apache the first to ask for a JCK license ?
A : No .
There are many JCK licensees .
It is our understanding that we are the first non-profit with no commercial ties to Sun to attempt to license the JCK .
We know about a JCK licensing discussion between Sun and some in the free software community , but we do n't believe that led to a successful resolution .
Q : Is Apache against Sun earning money out of licensing the JCK to commercial entities ?
A : Of course not .
The ASF is a public charity and as such , does n't compete in the commercial marketplace .
We take a completely neutral position regarding legal commercial activity .
Q : What is a " field of use " restriction ?
A : A " field of use " restriction is a restriction that limits how a user can use a given piece of software , either directly or indirectly .
To give a concrete example from the Sun / Apache dispute , if Apache accepted Sun 's terms , then users of a standard , tested build of Apache Harmony for Linux on a standard general purpose x86 - based computer ( for example , a Dell desktop ) would be prevented from freely using that software and that hardware in any application where the computer was placed in an enclosed cabinet , like an information kiosk at a shopping mall , or an X - ray machine at an airport .
Q : Is a " field of use " restriction incompatible with both open source and free software principles ?
A : Yes , both .
See the Open Source Initiative 's open source definition ( http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd), most notably section 6 and 10 and the Free Software Foundation 's free software definition ( http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) most notably freedom # 0 .
Q : Would the ASF be satisfied with a TCK license that removed the field of use restriction if used only on Apache Licensed code ?
A : No . Looking at the broader picture , the ASF has worked for years to ensure that the JCP creates " open specifications " , specs that are freely implementable under free and open source licenses .
If the field of use restriction was lifted only for the Apache License ( or only the GPL , or only the MPL , or ... ) then it still would be discriminatory and contrary to the terms of the JSPA .
The resulting specs still would n't be open specifications .
In addition to that , the Apache License 2.0 grants everybody who follows the terms of the license " a perpetual , worldwide , non-exclusive , no -charge , royalty - free , irrevocable copyright license to reproduce , prepare Derivative Works of , publicly display , publicly perform , sublicense , and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form . "
In particular , note the word " sublicense " in that quote - it 's not possible for an " Apace License carve - out " here as people can sublicense our software .
( Note that it 's still true that if someone makes a derivative work of Apache Harmony , they are still obligated to secure their own JCK license and test their derivative if they wish to call their work compatible ) .
Q : What is an acceptable JCK license for Apache ?
A : Simply put , we 're asking Sun to make it like the other 15 +
TCK licenses - including other major platform JSRs like Java EE - we have executed with them over the years , all of which have no " field of use " limitations .
We are asking that Sun drops the " field of use " limitation , therefore allowing freedom of use , in accordance with their obligations under the JSPA .
Q : Why does Apache think it 's entitled to such a license while others have to pay for it ?
A : This is n't a debate about the cost - Sun agrees that it should be available to Apache at no cost .
The important issue is lack of a field of use limitation .
The JSPA mandates is that everyone is entitled to a TCK license free of field of use limitations - whether or not they pay for the license - and that is what makes the specs created by the JCP open specifications .
Now , as to the issue of paying for the TCK , the JSPA requires that TCKs are made available to qualified not - for - profits , individuals and academics .
As Apache is a 501 ( c ) 3 public charity - aka " non-profit " - we therefore would receive the JCK at no cost .
Q : Does Apache think that Harmony could be used by commercial entities to avoid paying JCK licensing fees to Sun ?
A : No .
The only way that could happen is if a commercial entity stopped shipping their own software and started shipping the tested binaries that were created by the Harmony project .
Even then , they would still need to license the Java branding rights from Sun , as Apache does not pass those rights downstream to users or redistributors of our software .
Note that if an entity made a derivative work , or used only part of Harmony 's source code in building their implementation , they would still be obligated to obtain their own JCK license for , and test the software themselves .
Apache does not make its TCKs available for use outside of our projects .
Q : Is Apache trying to damage Sun 's business ?
A : No .
Apache is a non-profit and does not engage in any commercial activity .
We 're trying to build our own independent implementation of Java , and create a community of users and developers around that software , and need the JCK to do so .
Q : What about OpenJDK ?
Sun has indicated their intention to release the source code of their implementation of Java SE under a modified version of the GPLv2 .
Would OpenJDK be allowed to ship without passing the JCK ?
A : Good question , and a complicated one .
We think the answer is " no " .
While Sun was the spec lead of the Java SE JSR and therefore had all the " necessary IP " licensed to them by all the expert group members , by simply placing their own implementation under the GPL v2 , not all of the necessary IP is automatically granted .
If OpenJDK users are to receive the benefits of compatibility , the project will need to ship a binary that has passed the JCK .
It is worth noting that if Sun placed " field of use " limitations in the certified releases of OpenJDK , that would be in violation of its own license , the GPLv2 .
If Sun added a " GPL - only carve - out " to the field of use , that would be problematic in the same way that an " Apache License - only carve - out " would be problematic , as we discussed above .
Q : Why does n't Apache simply ignore this and ships Harmony without passing the JCK ?
A : We can ship Harmony without passing the JCK - it 's our source code to do with what we wish - and we will with milestone releases as we progress towards completion .
However , we could never claim to be Java compatible , which is something very important to Java users , and is the stated goal of the project .
Also , users would n't be assured that they had all necessary IP rights from the spec 's contributors .
Compatibility is important to us as is not putting users in IP jeopardy , as it has been for every JSR the ASF has ever implemented .
We have no interest in forking the technology .
Q : Why is Apache resorting to this public " open letter " ?
A : Apache has tried since August of 2006 to get this license .
There has been quite a bit of effort put into this to achieve a private resolution , including private appeals to officers of Sun , including Jonathan Schwartz , Sun's CEO .
We even brought the issue up to the JCP Executive Committee .
But to this point , Sun has continued to be unyielding .
We really did hope to resolve this peacefully and privately , and continue to hope that we can resolve this peacefully .
But we owe answers to our communities as to why we have n't been able to secure the JCK , and we feel that at this point , it is Sun 's question to answer given their contractual obligations in the JSPA , and their past and current promises to the open and free software communities .
Q : Would Apache send such an open letter if it was n't Sun the spec lead of the Java 5 JSR ?
A : Absolutely , if we ever got to an equivalent stage with another spec lead .
JCP openness is a necessary requirement for a healthy and diverse java ecosystem and has nothing to do with the identity of the spec lead or their company affiliation .
The nature of the so - called placebo effect continues to tantalize scientists as an increasing number of lab experiments are detecting robust physiological responses to placebos .
And just to add fuel to the fire , a new study , published in the British Medical Journal , takes placebo investigations one step further by comparing the effects from two different placebo treatments .
The researchers , from Harvard Medical School , usually use placebos in clinical trials to test the effectiveness of a new treatment , but this is the first study that pitted one placebo against another .
Such an experiment may seem wrong - headed and researcher Ted Kaptchuk admits that “ it ’s upside down research . ”
The two placebos that Kaptchuk looked at were a sham acupuncture device and an inert pill .
The study , involving over 250 subjects with chronic arm pain , was conducted in two phases .
In the first phase , half were given sham acupuncture , and half were given a placebo pill over a two week period .
The findings from this phase showed no strong evidence for an enhanced effect with placebo acupuncture compared to placebo pills .
But in the second phase of the study , the results were more interesting .
This phase saw half the patients entered in a sham acupuncture device versus real acupuncture trial , and the other half in a placebo pill versus real pain pill trial .
Both trials in this phase were conducted over a longer period .
The results indicated that the patients receiving sham acupuncture reported a more significant decrease in pain and symptom severity than those receiving placebo pills for the duration of the trials .
The researchers say that this shows that the placebo effect varies by type of placebo used .
“ These findings suggest that the medical ritual of a device can deliver an enhanced placebo effect beyond that of a placebo pill .
There are many conditions in which ritual is irrelevant when compared with drugs , such as in treatment of a bacterial infection , ” said Kaptchuk , “ but the other extreme may also be true .
In some cases , the ritual may be the critical component . ”
While the results are based on subjective reports from patients about their perception of pain and the severity of their condition , Kaptchuk says the results of this study add evidence pointing to the existence of a placebo effect in a clinical environment .
He also believes that the results provide evidence that what doctors tell patients about side effects directly influences their experience of them .
Prior to participating in the study , the researchers provided informed consent forms alerting the patients as to the side effects they might experience : temporary soreness for acupuncture and fatigue and dry - mouth for the pills .
Of those receiving placebos , 25 percent of sham acupuncture and 31 percent of placebo pill patients reported experiencing the very side effects suggested to them , even though the bogus treatments could not possibly cause them .
