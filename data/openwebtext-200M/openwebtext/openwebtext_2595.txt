But one former official said that the exact provenance of the arms that were being smuggled via Sudan was unclear .
Although the airstrike was carried out two months ago , it was not publicized until Sudanese officials said Thursday that a convoy of trucks in the remote eastern part of Sudan was bombed by what they called “ American fighters , ” killing dozens .
The strikes were first reported on several Internet - based news sites , including cbsnews.com .
The area where the Sudanese said the attack occurred , near Port Sudan on the Red Sea , is an isolated patch of eastern Sudan near the Egyptian border and a notorious smuggling route , populated mostly by nomads and known as one of the poorest , least developed parts of a very poor , underdeveloped country .
The Sudanese said the reports emerged now because it took time to fully investigate the strike .
But an accusation from one government official that the attack was an American act of genocide raised the possibility that the Sudanese were lashing out because the International Criminal Court had issued a warrant for the arrest of their president , Omar Hassan al - Bashir , on war - crimes charges in the conflict in Darfur .
The official , Rabie A. Atti , a government spokesman , also gave a death toll in the attack that was higher than the 39 reported in other secondhand accounts .
Mr. Rabie said by telephone from Khartoum , the capital , that “ more than 100 people ” had been killed in the air raid .
He said the trucks that were bombed were not carrying weapons .
“ I ’ve heard this allegation , but it ’s not true , ” he said .
“ It was a genocide , committed by U.S. forces . ”
Unlike the huge mortgage loan modification programs that are taking place , which address thousands of mortgages at once , workouts for credit card customers are still being handled on a case - by - case basis .
In addition to debt forgiveness , debt collectors are allowing many delinquent borrowers to pay down their debt over the course of a year rather than the standard six months .
Paul Hunziker , the chairman of Capital Management Services , said that before this downturn , his firm put only about a quarter of all borrowers into longer - term repayment plans .
Now , it puts about half on such plans .
Some lenders are also reaching out to borrowers shortly after they fall behind on their payments to try to avoid having to write off the account .
Others are reaching out to customers who seem likely to fall behind .
Just as lenders competed for years to be the first card to be taken out of the wallet , they are now competing to be the first ones paid back .
And realizing that millions more consumers are likely to default on their credit card bills in the coming months , the banking industry has started lobbying regulators to make it more advantageous to lenders to extend payment terms or forgive debt .
In an unusual alliance , the Financial Services Roundtable , one of the industry ’s biggest lobbyists , and the Consumer Federation of America recently proposed a credit card loan modification program , which was rejected by regulators .
Under the plan , lenders would have forgiven about 40 percent of what was owed by individual borrowers over five years .
Lenders could report the loss once whatever part of the debt was repaid , instead of shortly after default , as current accounting rules require .
That would allow them to write off less later .
Borrowers would have been allowed to defer any tax payments owed on the forgiven debt .
KABUL , Afghanistan 
The Supreme Court in Afghanistan has upheld a 20 - year prison sentence for an Afghan university student journalist accused of blasphemy .
The case has alarmed news media and rights organizations in the country and abroad .
The student ’s family and lawyers said Wednesday that they had learned only recently about the court decision , which was made in secret on Feb. 12 , and they called the procedure illegal .
The student , Parwiz Kambakhsh , 24 , from northern Afghanistan , was arrested in 2007 and sentenced to death for blasphemy after accusations that he had written and distributed an article about the role of women in Islam .
Mr. Kambakhsh has denied having written the article and said he had downloaded it from the Internet .
His family and lawyers say he has been denied a fair trial .
In 2008 , an appeals court in Kabul commuted the death sentence to 20 years ’ imprisonment , a decision that was upheld by a tribunal of the Supreme Court last month .
Images of one of Phoenix 's struts taken by the lander 's robotic arm camera on Sols ( or Martian days ) 8 , 31 and 44 of th emission .
The two spheroids enclosed by the circle appear to merge with each other , which some Phoenix scientists argue is a sign that the globs are liquid water .
During itsmore than five - month stint on Mars last year , NASA ?s Phoenix Mars Lander foundevidence that liquid water existed at the spacecraft ?s landing site , somePhoenix team members say .
Water iskey to all forms of life as we know it and the discovery of liquid water wouldsuggest a greater opportunity for biologyon the red planet .
The new butcontroversial conclusion comes from observations of a set of ?
little globules ?
attached to struts on the lander ?s legs that were photographed by Phoenix ?s robotic arm camera over the course of the mission , asfirst reported at Spaceflight Now .
These globswere seen to apparently move and grow between snapshots , and 22 members of the Phoenix team , including principal investigator Peter Smith of the University ofArizona in Tucson , think that this behavior combined with other Phoenixfindings indicates that these blobs might have been liquid water that wassplashed up onto the spacecraft as it landed .
The papermaking the case for liquid water will be presented on March 23 at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston .
But not all of Phoenix ?s team membersagree with the paper ?s interpretation of the globs .
? It ?s a bitcontroversial , ?
Smith told SPACE.com .
But ?obviously they came fromsomewhere ???
they weren?t there when welaunched , ? he added .
Phoenixtouched down at its landing site in the Martian arctic on May 25 , 2008 .
The stationarylander ?s mission was to search for signs of potential habitability on the redplanet , namely , signs that water ice just below the surface was once liquid .
On July 31,2008 , Phoenix confirmed that the hard material it encountered underneath theclumpy surface dirt was indeed water ice .
Analyses of dirt done in thelander ?s onboard instruments also indicated that this ice was likely onceliquid and had interacted with the Martian regolith , or dirt , at a period oftime in Mars ?
history when its climate was warmer .
But findingliquid water on the present surface of Mars , which sees temperatures between - 20 and - 80 degrees Celsius ( - 4 and - 112 degrees Fahrenheight ) even in thesummer , is a whole different ball game .
It was expected that any water iceexposed to the atmosphere would immediately sublimate , or turn to vapor .
The Phoenix team saw signs of this when they exposed underground ice in thetrenches dug by the spacecraft .
The newreport ?s main author , Phoenix team member Nilton Renno , proposes that perchlorate salts , discovered in the Martian dirt by Phoenix ?s wet chemistry lab , were concentrated enough in a patch at thespacecraft ?s landing site that they could lower the freezing point of the waterice , causing it to melt into a salty brine ( this is the same phenomenon that causessidewalk salt to melt down snow and ice in the winter ) .?
Nilton and hisco- authors think the brine could have been splashed up onto the lander leg when Phoenix touched down .
Of course , Phoenix didn ?t get any samples of this material and any investigation of theblobs relies on the images taken by Phoenix and knowledge of how perchloratebehaves .
? There ?s amatter of belief at some level , ?
Smith said .
Smithcautions that the case is n?t solved for sure .
As Phoenix descended to thesurface , its thrusters created a high - pressure , high - temperature environmentand blasted ammonia which could have affected the surface below it .
There couldalso be other constituents in the dirt that could affect its chemistry , hesaid .
But thecase for liquid water is compelling , Smith said .
Though he added , ? I can ?t sayI agree with every statement in the paper .?
MichaelHecht , the lead scientist for the instrument that discovered perchlorate , thinks that while the idea of this splash of liquid brine is n?t physically impossible , it is ? far less likely than simpler explanations , ?
he told SPACE.com .
The imagingof the globules is low resolution , which Smith also pointed out , and some ofthe apparent changes seen in them could be attributed to changing shadows , Hecht said .
And whileperchlorate is an excellent sponge , sucking up water if the surrounding air iswarm and dry enough , the temperatures required of the lander mentioned in thepaper are too warm and ?
you would not get liquid droplets of perchloratebrine , ?
Hecht explained .
A morelikely explanation , Hecht contends , is that water vapor released by the groundice stuck to the legs .
The legswould likely be relatively cold compared to the ground during the day , Hechtexplained .
When sunlight fell on the patches of ice exposed at the landingsite , some of that water would sublimate .
As that water vapor traveled upthrough the air , it might encounter cold patches of dirt stuck on the landerlegs from the landing and stick .
And ?oncethere ?s ice there , [ other water vapor molecules will ] go to the places wherethere ?s ice , ?
eventually forming the blobs seen in the photos , Hecht said .
There arecircumstances where perchlorate could create liquid brine on Mars though , Hechtsaid .
During periods when Mars might have just a few degrees warmer , perhclorate rinds could melt water ice .
Another paper being presented at theLunar and Planetary Science Conference posits that perchlorates could seep downbeneath Mars ?
polar ice caps , forming a lubricating sludge that lets the icecaps flow .
But thesesituations are different than the briny blobs described by Renno .
Hechtacknowledges that he could be wrong and the globs on Phoenix could be liquidbrine , but ?
I just don ?t think it ? s the likely explanation , ?
he said .
?
It ? sjust plain old frost , nothing more .?
Hechtthinks that the true nature of these blobs will be hashed out over time by the Phoenix team and by reviewers of Renno ?s paper .
( Hecht and Renno , as well asother Phoenix team members , have corresponded at great length over the topic . )
? It hasn ? tbeen in front of the jury yet , ?
Hecht said .
Editor 's Note :
The image showing the globules was added at 11:30 a.m. E.T .
This was a very odd looking fish in one of the colorful new displays ( “ Oddwater ” ) at the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport Oregon that I visited this last weekend .
This particular fish almost looked alien ..
Or perhaps one of the characters from the Disney / Pixar animated film “ Monsters , Inc. ” !
All the “ plant life ” in the tanks were made of very colorful and odd shaped blown art glass .
Fascinating display to be sure !

Injured man in Japan dies after 14 hospitals reject him Injured man dies after rejection by 14 hospitals
He died 90 minutes later at the facility that finally relented — one of thousands of victims repeatedly turned away in recent years by understaffed and overcrowded hospitals in Japan .
Paramedics reached the accident scene within minutes after the man on a bicycle collided with a motorcycle in the western city of Itami .
But 14 hospitals refused to admit the 69 - year - old , citing a lack of specialists , equipment and staff , according to Mitsuhisa Ikemoto , a fire department official .
The Jan. 20 incident was the latest in a string of recent cases in Japan in which patients were denied treatment , underscoring health care woes in a rapidly aging society that faces an acute shortage of doctors and a growing number of elderly patients .
One of the hospitals agreed to provide care when the paramedics called a second time more than an hour after the accident .
But the man , who suffered head and back injuries , died soon afterward of shock from loss of blood .
The injured man might have survived if a hospital accepted him more quickly , Ikemoto said .
“ I wish hospitals are more willing to take patients , but they have their own reasons , too , ” he said .
The motorcyclist , also hurt in the accident , was denied admission by two hospitals before a third accepted him , Ikemoto said .
He was recovering from his injuries .
The death prompted the city to issue a directive ordering paramedics to better coordinate with an emergency call center so patients can find a hospital within 15 minutes .
But hospitals cannot be punished for turning away patients if they are full .
The latest Vex prototype robot kit is just called Walker — a generically oblique name that somehow makes it scarier — and is inspired by Dutch artist Theo Jansen 's terrifyingly beautiful beach creatures .

As it moves , the legs undulate in a wavy , spooky motion .
If it was as big as Theo 's creatures it would mulch any puppies or small children caught in its path .
And if it want to , it could bring them or any other prey closer with its extendable grippy claw .

They 're not sure yet if they 're going to sell the kit , which uses standard Vex electronics , but new customized metal parts .
If they do , they'd be aiming for a $ 99 price point .
Even for something as politically benign and helpful as a consumer restaurant review site like Yelp.com , everything on the Internet succumbs to what can only be described as “ people being shitheads . ”
Now , I ’m not saying the site is n’t useful .
If it had n’t been for Yelp , I ’d still be rooting through my neighbors garbage cans trying to find a good sandwich place .
I ’m just saying that there are some things to consider when you ’re using the site .
The biggest tip I can give a novice Yelp user , is to actually read the reviews along with the 1 – 5 star rating .
Generally speaking , they ’re usually straight forward and fairly accurate .
If there was a problem , they ’ll concisely explain and you can weigh if something like slow service is a deal breaker for you or not .
But , there are a lot of extraneous variables to consider when reading a review ( the shitheads I was talking about earlier ) :
The Connoisseur – These are Yelp experts with the most mature and particular palates , or at least that ’s what they ’d like you to think .
Most likely they ’re just elitist assholes who have a physiological need to strongly disagree with the majority .
Think 15 - year - old music snob from a culturally barren Midwestern town whose favorite band is still Slipknot .
The easiest way to pick these reviews out is if they ’re rating disagrees with the vast majority of the other reviewers ( i.e. if they gave a restaurant a 1 star when the other 100 + reviews average to a 4 star ) .
They ’ll always start off with a sentence that intends to make the people who genuinely liked the restaurant look like bumbling idiots while simultaneously making themselves feel superior for hating it .
Something like “ I ’ve had much better ( insert type of food here ) , ” which is usually followed by name dropping their favorite place .
This suggestion will most likely be worse than the restaurant being reviewed , but it does n't really matter since The Connoisseur will win either way .
If The Connoisseur ’s suggestion is actually better , then he was right .
If you feel it ’s the same or worse , then you ’ll be ridiculed for having poor taste .
The International – They are usually from same country where the cuisine is from or at least the same region .
They give the restaurant 5 stars , a brilliant review and an endorsement of “ just like my Mom use to make back in X . ”
Seems great right ?
Wrong .
I ca n’t speak for everyone but I can safely say , most people wo n’t like it how they “ do it back home . ”
I first discovered The International when I went to a Korean place called Ondal 2 known for their “ spicy crab soup ” and realized my group was the only non-Koreans in the 50 + person restaurant and subsequently realized most of the reviewers had Asian names .
Even though I consider myself very open minded , especially when it comes to food , I was very much out of my league .
Maybe I should actually travel outside of the U.S. before I say that .
Keep you eye out for the review that starts off with something like “ This was my first time going to a genuine ... ” and they 'll usually have a similar palate as you .
The Unyielding –
Why would you go to a type of restaurant fully knowing you ’re going to dislike it ?
And on top of that , why do you feel the need to inform the Internet about it ?
The Unyielding are usually found in fairly exotic restaurants reviews and can be identified by a 1 - star rating and an opening statement prefacing how a few years ago they tried X type of food and they hated it , and decided to try it again .
Good for you .
Asshole .
I can understand you giving the cuisine another shot , but you do n’t need to go out of your way to give the restaurant a poor rating and a scathing review .
It ’s like overhearing a geriatric couple in a movie theater complaining how there ’s “ too much violence and sex in this movie ” and the movies called Mr. Boner ’s Murder Brigade .
THEN DON ’T GO .
If you need an example of The Unyielding just search for Ethiopian food in your area and get ready to have an ice pick stabbed through your logic membrane .
The Enthusiastic – I ’m all for getting a lot of opinions , but if you find it necessary to write a review for a Subway , you should probably reevaluate where you are in life .
There ’s a fine line between being meticulous and being completely asinine .
And if you even mention the phrase “ sandwich artist , ” I ’ll give you a ten second head start before I murder you and your whole family .
The Malcontent – About 90 % of the time , The Malcontent is a woman .
100 % of the time , they can never be happy .
The review will usually get down to business fairly quickly .
It will always be harsh , brutal and completely and utterly baseless .
You ’d never think someone would get incensed because the restaurant is valet - only parking or the fact they did n’t have limes instead of lemons .
But I assure you , if it ’s on Yelp , it will be one of the most hilariously long diatribes about how the restaurant did n’t have Kettle One vodka you ’ll ever read .
After the multi- paragraph rant , it will make a complete 180° closing statement : “ The food was amazing , the service was always fast and the atmosphere is unrivaled . ”
After reading it , you will be left in a state of WTF .
The Economist - I mean , really .
How can you be surprised when a 5 - star sushi restaurant in Beverly Hills is ball - bustingly expensive ?
Apparently where The Economist is from , babies poop foie gras and barf truffles , hail is a mix of Beluga caviar and Crystal champage , and the main food staple is cocaine battered fatty tuna .
Actually , I 'm pretty sure I just described Dubai .
But I digress ...
If you 're worried about cost , might I suggest you look at the fucking " price - range " that Yelp provides for your convenience .
If it costs more than $ 40 a person , The Economist will expect the food to be so good that it makes the whole dinner party cream their pants simultaneously .
Would that be awesome ?
Yes .
But is it tragically unrealistic ?
Yes .
Brit Hume was positively fuming over the Obama tax increases on this morning 's Fox News Sunday .
For once Juan Williams was actually the voice of reason .
Hume :
Well it 's just so dishonest because the top what , 2 % of tax payers in this country pay something on the order of 40 % of the taxes already .
The top 5 % pay 60 % of the taxes already , income taxes .
And the top 50 % pay all but , you know they pay like 95 % of the taxes .
So most of the people in this country , most of the people pay almost , either no income taxes at all or almost none .
That 's like half the income brackets .
So the idea that the playing field is somehow tilted in favor of the few is bosh !
And the idea that you 're going to be able to squeeze out of the rich , who will move their money around and invest in such a way to avoid it as much as they can , this much money in tax receipts is crazy .
There 's only one way to get a big gusher of tax receipts out of the wealthy and everybody else and that is with an extraordinarily booming economy .
And normally what happens is you get that when tax rates , which he proposes to allow to increase here go down .
Not up .
Williams :
Let me give you an alternative point of view .
An alternative point of view is that 40 % that you 're talking about , those people earn about half of all the money that 's earned in America .
They 're blessed to be in this country and to have the opportunity and why should n't they be responsible and pay their fair share of taxes ?
After Williams makes some other good points about what type of things our tax dollars pay for Hume is n't quite finished with expressing his concern for the have - more's .
Hume : Juan we agree with that but remember this .
The share of income taxes paid by the higher income people over the years has not gotten smaller under the Republicans .
It 's gotten larger .
Why do you ...
Williams :
And why is that Brit ?
Because they 're earning more money .
Hume :
Well I know what Juan but the fact of the matter is that 's what you want is n't it ?
Do n't you want ... I mean I often feel that people like Democrats and liberals would rather have everybody equally poor rather than unequally rich !
Yeah that 's it Brit .
You figured out the liberals ' evil plan .
We want all the rich people living in squalor and increasing tax rates for income above $ 250,000 a year is going to put them there .
You know Brit we 've had much higher tax rates in the past but I do n't ever remember them making the rich people go away and suddenly turn into poor people .
BSkyB is in fourth place in the list of 2008 ’s biggest advertisers , having spent £ 96 m on UK advertising .
However , this was a fall of 21 pc on what it spent in the same period the previous year .
Elsewhere , major retailers such as Marks & Spencer and car manufacturers such as Ford and Vauxhall have slashed their marketing budgets in the six months to October as the financial crisis has taken its toll , while supermarkets have boosted ad spend in a battle to prove that they offer the most competitive prices .
Tesco boosted spend by 24pc to £ 77.6 m , making it the fifth biggest spender on advertising , while Asda ’s spend increased by 56 pc to £ 56.93 m , making it the 12th largest spender , up from 31st place the previous year .
The rare event of solar eclipse had happened at Southeast Asia region , on which the dark disk of the moon creeps across the setting sun .
Only people viewing from the southern Indian Ocean were among the few to see the full annular eclipse , so called because at its peak the eclipse is surrounded by an annulus , or ring , of fiery light .
A fantastic sequence of photos above shows the moon passing between Earth and the sun before , during , and after an annular eclipse , as seen on January 26 , 2009 , from Bandar Lampung in Indonesia .
The path of the full annular eclipse crossed mostly open ocean in the southern part of the globe , starting about 560 miles ( 900 kilometers ) south of Africa and not reaching land until it crossed Australia ’s Cocos ( Keeling ) Islands in the Indian Ocean .
However , observers in southern Africa , Madagascar , Australia , and Southeast Asia were able to watch a partial eclipse .
Astronomer Jay Pasachoff used a specially equipped camera to capture images of the January 26 , 2009 , annular eclipse from the Indonesian island of Java .
Practicing photography techniques and for getting the public excited about astronomy is significant for him as he added later .
The image of haze blurs the bright ring around an annular eclipse on January 26 , 2009 was captured from Anyer Beach on the Indonesian island of Java , one of the few places where the solar eclipse was completely visible .
Crowds gathered across Indonesia to witness the event , some cheering and banging drums as the moon seemed to cross the face of the sun .
These two magnificient photos were taken from Malaysia .
The clouds seems to fold during the eclipse and the color reacts accordingly .
The picture has been taken from one of the busiest highway in the nation .

As automakers cut costs , perhaps they should become blatantly , honestly cheap and follow the Fioravanti Tris .
The Tris , which uses the same bumpers , lights , and doors on all sides of the car , first debuted nine years ago and is showing again at the Geneva Auto Show .
While not much has changed since , the Tris is still a robust lesson in trimming manufacturing costs through the use of minimalist , modular design .
Provided , of course , that style and embarrassment does n't matter to the driver .
If a car like the Tris ever came to production , traffic cops would constantly ticket it for parking in the opposite direction of the street .
Perhaps Fioravanti could install a steering wheel in the back to clear that up .
The Irish rock band U2 has n't toured since 2006 , but it stands to make $ 25 million in a sweetheart stock deal , according to SEC filings Wednesday and people familiar with the matter .
In March , the band struck a 12 - year deal with Live Nation Inc. , that called for the concert promotion giant to pay U2 partly with stock .
Live Nation promised to pay tens of millions of dollars to high - profile artists in exchange for several years ' worth of revenue from a broad range of their work , including concerts , online fan clubs and t- shirt ...

The Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland/16
by Michele Simionato
February 17 , 2009
There is a feature of Scheme that I never liked , i.e. the fact that functions ( more in general continuations ) can return multiple values .
Multiple values are a relatively late addition to Scheme - they entered in the standard with the R5RS report - and there has always been some opposition against them ( see for instance this old post by Jeffrey Susskind ) .
I personally see multiple values as a wart of Scheme , a useless complication motivated by premature optimization concerns .
It is possible to define functions returning multiple values as follows :
> ( define ( return - three - values ) ( values 1 2 3 ) ) > ( return - three - values ) 1 2 3
In order to receive the values a special syntax is needed , and you cannot do things like the following :
> ( apply + ( return - three - values ) ) Unhandled exception Condition components : 1 . &assertion 2 . &who : apply 3 . &message : " incorrect number of values returned to single value context " 4 . &irritants : ( ( 1 2 3 ) )
Instead , you are forced to use let - values or other constructs which are able to accept values :
> ( let -values ( ( ( x y z ) ( return - three - values ) ) ) (+ x y z ) ) 6
In this series I will never use functions returning multiple values , except the ones in the Scheme standard library ( this is why I am forced to talk about let - values ) .
Instead of using multiple values , I will return a list of values and I will destructure it with let + .
For instance , I will write
> ( let+ ( ( a b ) ( list 1 2 ) ) ( cons a b ) ) ( 1 . 2 )
instead of
> ( let -values ( ( ( a b ) ( values 1 2 ) ) ) ( cons a b ) ) ( 1 . 2 )
let + is more elegant and more general than let - values : everything let - values can do , let + can do too .
let + can even faster - in some implementations and in some cases .
Here is a benchmark in Ikarus Scheme :
running stats for ( repeat 10000000 ( let-values ( ( ( x y z ) ( values 1 2 3 ) ) ) ' dummy ) ) : no collections 276 ms elapsed cpu time , including 0 ms collecting 277 ms elapsed real time , including 0 ms collecting 0 bytes allocated running stats for ( repeat 10000000 ( let+ ( ( x y z ) ( list 1 2 3 ) ) ' dummy ) ) : 58 collections 211 ms elapsed cpu time , including 42 ms collecting 213 ms elapsed real time , including 43 ms collecting 240016384 bytes allocated
As you see , let + takes only 211 ms to unpack a list of three elements ten million times ; let - values would take 276 ms instead .
On the other hand , let + involves garbage collection ( in our example 24 bytes are allocate per cycle , and thats means 240 million of bytes ) and depending on the situations and the implementation this may cause a serious slowdown .
You may find much better benchmarks than mine in this thread on comp.lang .
scheme and you will see that you can get any kind of results .
let -values seems to be slow in Ikarus and in Ypsilon with the default optimization options ; it can be faster in other implementations , or in the same implementations with different options or in different releases .
However , those are implementation details .
The important thing in my view is the conceptual relevance of a language construct .
Conceptually I think the introduction of multiple values in Scheme was a mistake , since it added nothing that could not be done better with containers .
I think functions should always return a single value , possibly a composite one ( a list , a vector , or anything else ) .
Actually , I am even more radical than that and I think that functions should take a single value , as in SML and Haskell .

What are the environmental costs of “ snail mail ? ”
That ’s easy , right : paper - based mail has a massive footprint when one takes into account the harvesting of trees , the production of paper , and the disposal of much of what we receive in our mail boxes .
What ’s the answer ?
Electronic mail … right ?
Well … maybe .
If you have someone ’s email address , or can easily find it , email as currently configured does provide a viable alternative .
But , ever tried to email everyone on your block ?
If you ’re a marketer , ever tried to simply email everyone on your snail mail list ?
For the most part , unless you ’ve taken steps to gather those email addresses , you ca n’t complete these tasks : email addresses have no immediate connection to a physical address .
Enter Zumbox , a start - up based in the Los Angeles area .
Their solution to the paper - email dilemma : create an electronic mailbox for every physical mailing address in the United States .
Yes … rather than offering a service to remove you from mailing lists , or scan your paper mail into electronic format , or complete tasks like bill - paying online , Zumbox has created a platform that they hope will create a viable , all - inclusive , paper - free alternative to snail mail .
Confused ?
That ’s OK …
Zumbox is doing something quite different .
Company president Glen Ward provides an effective example on the Zumbox blog :
Suppose your dog or cat ( perish the thought ) goes missing .
With Zumbox , you can send a notice with a photo ( and video , if you like ) to all of your neighbors … digitally .
You do n’t have to know their email addresses , and you do n’t have to walk house - to - house .
And since Zumbox is a closed system - mail is sent from one Zumbox to another - it provides total accountability .
You know precisely where all of your Zumbox mail is coming from .
If your neighbor sends an overwhelming number of missing pet notices or Bar - B - Que invites ( it can happen ) , you can opt to block mail from that sender .
In this sense , Zumbox represents a new way to communicate and connect with your community ( or not ) .
When I talked to Rob Read , who ’s handling social media outreach for Zumbox , I was really curious about what he labelled the “ chicken and egg ” challenge facing the company : if both sender and received have to be Zumbox users , wo n’t that make it difficult to get this venture off the ground ?
It ’s not like email , where I can send a message to anyone with an email account anywhere : I and my neighbors have to be Zumbox users for the above scenario to work .
The upside , he told me , is cost : in many cases , a user can send a message through Zumbox for free .
For direct mail and other business / bulk mailings , the costs will be significantly lower than US postal rates .
Add the environmental benefits and convenience , and there are definitely a number of advantages to the system Zumbox has created .
As Rob and I were talking , it also occurred to me that this should be a godsend for the direct mail industry .
I do n’t know if companies like MailStopper ( formerly Greendimes ) are cutting into their profits , but this gives that industry another way to do what it does without trying to recreate databases with email addresses .
Zumbox also makes it easier for the consumer to get off a mailing list ( or , at least , block particular mailings ) .
Lots of bloggers weighing in on Zumbox : go see what our friends at Eco Child ’s Play , EcoGeek , Triple Pundit , and MNN have said .
Of course , I ’m interested in what you have to say … whaddaya think ?
Paper mail killer ?
Or not …
Best Buy is getting into motorcycles – think Geek Squad in mechanics ' coveralls .
The consumer electronics store chain is going to start selling the Enertia electric motorcycle made by Ashland , Ore. - based startup Brammo at five of its West Coast stores in May , CEO Craig Bramscher said Friday .
In time , Bramscher envisions the $ 12,000 Enertia , as well as Brammo 's upcoming lighter - duty and heavier two - seater models , being sold across Best Buy 's chain of 1,200 U.S. stores , as well as some of its 1,500 or so stores in Europe and its 270 stores in China .
Speculation that Best Buy would sell Brammo's motorcycles began back in September when Best Buy Venture Capital participated in a $ 10 million investment in the Ashland , Ore. - based startup .
Chrysalix Energy Ventures was another investor ( see Funding Roundup : Solar and Wind Startups , Along With Tesla Motors , Seek Capital ) .
Contributions by Bramscher himself raised that total to $ 12 million , he said .
The idea of selling motorcycles at an electronics store is n't as crazy as it sounds , Bramscher said .
Many Best
Buy stores are built with two garage bays that are " underutilized , " he said at the Pacific Crest Clean Technology Conference in San Francisco .
Also , given features like a built - in Web server and APIs that Brammo is opening to third - party application developers , " What we 're selling is a lot closer to consumer electronics than to transportation , " he said .
He envisions add - ons like on - board cameras that can download images to travel blogs .
Brammo is among a number of startups seeking to supply electric two - wheelers to the mass market – others include Vectrix and Zero Motorcycles .
Others like Mission Motors are making expensive , high - performance models .
Setting up distribution channels is a key challenge for startups like these , Bramscher said .
That 's why Best Buy could be a coup , he said .
After all , all the motorcycle distributors in the United States see about 7 million customer visits per year – the same number that Best Buy sees at a single store in West Hollywood , he said .
And yes , Geek Squad employees will perform what Bramscher called " level one " repairs on parts like brakes , tires and electronic components on Enertia motorcycles , he said .
For more complete repairs , for example " if you crash one , " the motorcycles will go to a small number of central distribution centers Brammo is planning , he said .
( The company is seeking a second round of funding , he said , though he did n't specify how much ) .
The Enertia now has a 45 - mile range and a maximum speed of 53 miles per hour , using a lithium - ion - phosphate battery provided by Valence Technology that takes about three hours to charge using a standard outlet , he said .
But those range and speed limits are all right , considering that most people Brammo surveyed about their driving habits say they travel less than 25 miles per day for commuting and errands , he said .
The Enertia is highway - legal , he added , and Bramm has about $ 3 million in pre-orders .
Brammo's two - seater motorcycle is expected to have a range of about 100 miles and go 75 miles per hour when it 's released next year , he said .
More than a fifth of the private domestic wells tested nationally as part of a federal study had at least one contaminant at worrisome levels .
A sampling of water from private wells in 48 states including California by the U.S. Geological Survey found that most of the pollutants " of potential health concern " were naturally occurring -- such as arsenic and radon .
Nitrate -- associated with human activities such as fertilizer use , livestock operations and septic systems -- was the exception .
It was found in elevated concentrations most commonly in agricultural regions , such as California 's Central Valley and the Midwest Corn Belt .
Nationally , the USGS says about 43 million people draw water from private domestic wells , which are not regulated by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act or by California .
However some counties , including Los Angeles , do regulate them .
The State Water Resources Control Board estimates 1.2 million to 1.5 million Californians get their household water from private wells .

An extraordinary document called The Pepsi Gravitational Field has been leaked on to the internet .
The claim is that this 27 - page wonder represents a successful $ 1.5 m ( £ 1.05 m ) pitch to make a slight modification to the Pepsi logo .
Welcome to the science of PR .
" By investing in our history and brand ethos we can create a new trajectory forwards , " they explain in the opening pages .
This is entirely reasonable .
A cognitive linguist by the name of George Lakoff has done some fascinating ( and no doubt gruelling ) empirical work on metaphors in English literature .
He has shown , for example , that we often conceive of the abstract in terms of the concrete : anger is an overheated fluid in a sealed vessel , emotional states are locations , and fascinatingly , we do n't just talk about things in this way , we may also reason using these metaphors .
How else can you explain the fact that " baby , we 're riding in the fast lane on the freeway of love " is so instantly meaningful to us ?
Perhaps - and this is speculation - we think about abstract things using brain hardware that originally evolved to deal with more simple visuo - spatial manipulations .
I am open to new ideas .
Lakoff may or may not be entirely correct , but he is not throwing words around at random : his ideas are often coherent and stimulating , and they may have explanatory force for real world phenomena .
Let us return to the Pepsi document .
It is gibberish .
" The investment in our DNA leads to breakthrough innovation and allows us to move out of the traditional linear system into the future " .
This is accompanied by a helpful diagram , which is reproduced here for your delight .
" The Pepsi DNA finds its origin in the dynamic of perimeter oscillations , " they explain .
There is talk of an " authentic geometry " .
" The breathtaking colour palette is derived , " they explain , " using a scientific method of colour assignment based on the product 's essence and primary features . "
They go on to discuss " attraction theory " , and the " Pepsi proposition " .
This involves the " establishment of a gravitational pull to shift from a ' transactional ' experience to an ' invitational ' expression . "
The accompanying diagrams show a " typical light path " being subjected to gravitational pull , and then the gravitational pull of Pepsi .
The words " relativity of space and time " appear next to a curved light beam , but the diagram for Pepsi shows many Pepsi logos , distorting the human path through " typical shopping aisle " .
Here we find further parallels with conventional physics .
" The universe expands exponentially with f( x ) =e^x ( 1 light year = 671 million miles per hour ) . "
One light year is not - if I can anally interject - 671 million miles per hour .
Maybe that works because " the Pepsi Orbits " " dimensionalise exponentially " .
This might be a useful moment to mention that the new logo is basically the same as the old one , except one of the curves has been changed a bit to look more like a smile .
The Arnell agency has yet to comment on the veracity of the document , but Pepsi certainly announced a revamp in October last year , and from reading his work , Peter Arnell does quite like the word " dimensionalise " .
At a recent news conference , he also compared his advert for SoBe Lifewater to the achievements of Thomas Edison in inventing cinematography .
And even if this is an elaborate 27 - page long spoof , the horror is that it 's believable .
Across huge swaths of the world , scientific reasoning is regarded as decorative : a rhetorical stance , or a speech in a white coat from a 1950s B - movie .
We live in a world that has indulged these buffoons for so long that they think they are heroes , while nerds are regarded with contempt .
Our only hope is that after the robot wars , you will all starve , cold and in the rain , wearing leaves and eating mud .
Mr. Avellino did not respond to calls or visits to his homes in Nantucket , Mass . ; Palm Beach , Fla . ; and New York , or to messages left with his son Joseph Avellino in Chester , N.J. Gary Woodfield , the former federal prosecutor who represents Mr. Avellino , also declined to comment .
Francis B. Brogan , a longtime lawyer for Mr. Avellino and a partner at Greenberg Traurig in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , asked that questions be e-mailed to him , then did not respond .
Mark Raymond , a lawyer for Mr. Bienes , said that his client had no knowledge of Mr. Madoff ’s fraud and had lost tens of millions of dollars , most of his savings , in the fraud .
Mr. Bienes worked mainly as a fund - raiser , while Mr. Avellino actively managed Avellino & Bienes , according to court documents and people who knew the men .
Mr. Avellino has been connected to Mr. Madoff for his entire career .
After graduating from the City University of New York in 1958 , Mr. Avellino began working as an accountant at a firm run by Saul Alpern , Mr. Madoff ’s father - in - law .
Mr. Madoff also briefly ran his securities business from the firm ’s offices .
As early as 1962 , according to the S.E.C. ’s complaint against him , Mr. Avellino began raising money for Mr. Madoff , who was running a small brokerage company .
Mr. Bienes joined in 1965 .
In 1977 , Mr. Avellino and Mr. Bienes formed an accounting firm in Midtown Manhattan .
Mr. Avellino owned half the company ; the remainder was owned by Mr. Bienes and his wife , Dianne .
In 1980 , the Bieneses moved to Fort Lauderdale , while Mr. Avellino remained in New York .
The two men gradually shifted their focus from accounting to raising money for Mr. Madoff .
Their business expanded until 1992 , when the S.E.C. received marketing materials showing that Avellino & Bienes had promised investors annual returns of up to 20 percent .
Commission officials said at the time that they believed they had stumbled upon a Ponzi scheme .

But when the investigators went to Mr. Avellino , they found , to their surprise , an apparently legitimate explanation .
The money , $ 441 million from 3,200 clients , was being managed by Mr. Madoff , whose brokerage firm by then was one of the biggest stock traders on Wall Street .
In a deposition , Mr. Avellino explained that he had promised returns of 13.5 to 20 percent a year .
If Mr. Madoff fell short of producing those returns with his stock trades , Avellino & Bienes would make up the difference , Mr. Avellino said .

At least on the surface , most in the mainstream music industry agree : illicit file - sharing is evil .
However , when you are n't getting paid to have a certain opinion , things can change .
No longer taking a salary from his former company , Ex-IFPI chairman and EMI director Per Eirik Johansen speaks freely .
While working for a big company , which in themselves are very often parts of an even bigger concern with global interests , it is taken as read that you toe the corporate line .
Those that dare to have an opinion of their own can find themselves in sticky situations .
Of course , the sway an outfit has over an individual is nearly always financial , but what happens when this point of leverage disappears ?
Per -Eirik Johansen has been in the music industry for many years , and was noted for his ability to develop some prominent artists .
At one point elected as chairman of the IFPI , it was during Johansen ’s time as a director at EMI that he bore the brunt of a backlash against the copy protection his company put on CDs .
In 2004 , five thousand people lobbied EMI to remove this DRM , with news site nrk .
no calling Johansen ’s office 27 times over two broken interview promises on the issue .
Eventually he conceded , “ I have neither the desire nor the ability to give out discs without copy protection , ” while indicating that only EMI London could make such a decision .
“ We always listen to consumers , ” he objected .
“ I can inform you that over the last five months , in EMI we have sold about 400,000 CDs with copy protection in Norway .
In the same period we have received 28 complaints from consumers . ”
“ What we are talking about is a tiny , tiny little thing , ” he said .
But did he really believe that it was so insignificant ?
No longer working for EMI , in an interview with Joakim from Norway ’s Dagbladet , Johansen – unrestrained from the shackles of a forced corporate line – speaks freely , noting that while he took a salary from EMI he felt obliged to defend their stance .
He now believes the music industry ’s fight against piracy has been useless and says he disagrees with the assertion that illicit file - sharing is the same as theft .
Referring to an earlier EMI anti-piracy initiative , Johansen noted , “ The message of that campaign is that there is a reason why we have copyright , and I agree . ”
“ But the main thing is that a whole generation already violates copyright , and the only thing we can do now is find better solutions , ” he says pragmatically .
Now , as the 49 year - old manages his own label , Johansen looks back on some good times with EMI , particularly those where he discovered and developed new artists .
But times have changed .
“ Now that companies ’ earnings have gone down , and you cut down on people , people no longer have the resources to drive this work , ” he said .
Johansen still has optimism for the industry , pointing out growth in the live concert market and showing enthusiasm for new models to make money from music .
“ I am extremely optimistic .
There has been a revolution , and in the wake of this , it is very chaotic .
Today there is an entrepreneurial spirit that is both healthy and exciting .
We do not know how the industry will look in a year or two , but I am convinced that the future looks promising . ”
Noting that as a whole the music industry has n’t fallen in value , Johansen says it is the recording section that has suffered most after it did nothing for too long and failed to adapt their business model to the new era .
“ No one has ever won a battle when fighting against new technology , ” he said .
Time to embrace it then .
The RNC chair issues groveling apology to … Rush Limbaugh .
This is really pathetic :
“ I went back at that tape and I realized words that I said were n’t what I was thinking , ” Steele said .
“ It was one of those things where I thinking I was saying one thing , and it came out differently .
What I was trying to say was a lot of people … want to make Rush the scapegoat , the bogeyman , and he ’s not . ”
Many young parents , of course , complain of smothering attention from grandparents who wo n’t leave them or their children alone .
Lorraine R. , 49 , a lawyer in Teaneck , N.J. , does not place herself in this category .
“ My mother - in - law seemed supportive when we were going through in vitro , ” she said .
But after her twins were born four years ago , grandma “ did n’t offer to help , ” she said .
“ She did n’t clean or cook a meal or change diapers . ”
( Like some others interviewed for this article , Lorraine R. requested that her full name not be used for fear of making a difficult family situation worse . )
When Lorraine R. and her children visited her mother - in - law ’s swimming club , “ she wanted to show everyone she had grandchildren , but then she sat as far away from the kiddie pool as she could , ” Lorraine R. said .
“ She has no idea what our kids are like or what they ’re interested in . ”
In these parlous economic times , attitudes like that can have far greater consequences than hurt feelings .
If a grandparent cannot or will not baby - sit for a working parent , day care or a nanny may be the only option , and may also be a financial hardship .
“ It ’s very expensive here , but we stayed on Long Island to be near my parents , ” said a 43 - year - old public relations consultant who lives in Syosset , N.Y. , with her husband and three children , 7 , 9 and 11 .
“ My expectation was that my parents would be very hands - on . ”
That has not happened , she said .
Her parents , who are healthy and retired , live a mile away but keep their distance .
“ I ’ll see three generations of families on vacation or at Splish Splash , ” the Long Island water park , “ and I ’m amazed , ” this woman said .
“ I ’m in awe that there are grandparents there with the grandchildren , because it has n’t been my experience . ”
Google launched software that allows users of mobile phones and wireless devices to know the approximate location of friends and family instantly .
The feature is called Google Latitude and can be added to the Google Maps application starting from Wednesday .
It works on Google 's G1 phone , Blackberry 's , Windows Mobile devices and several smartphones .
Users can also be in touch directly via SMS , Google Talk , Gmail , or by updating their status message or even upload a new profile photo , Google said in a statement .
The software was added some private features : everything on the program is opt - in meaning each person can control who gets to see their location , decide the location that others ' see or sign out of Latitude at any time .

Philadelphia - The Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) urged a U.S. appeals court Monday to block the government 's repeated attempts to seize cell phone location information -- a record of where the cell phone user travels throughout each day -- without a warrant in violation of communications privacy statutes and the Constitution .
In September of last year , a federal court affirmed that location information stored by a mobile phone provider is legally protected and that a judge can and should require law enforcement to show probable cause in order to access the stored data .
However , the government appealed that decision to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals .
Cell phone providers store an extraordinary amount of data about where you are when making or receiving a call , based on the cell towers your phone uses .
In the amicus brief filed Monday , EFF argues that Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Fourth Amendment protect this location information from unfettered search and seizure .
" The government argues that federal law requires judges to approve their applications for location information from cell phone companies -- even if the police do n't have probable cause to obtain this sensitive information , " said EFF Civil Liberties Director Jennifer Granick .
" Courts have the right under statute -- and the duty under the Constitution -- to demand that the government obtain a search warrant before seizing this private location data . "
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , the ACLU Foundation of Pennsylvania , and the Center for Democracy and Technology ( CDT ) joined EFF 's brief .

( CNN ) -- Nadya Suleman , the Southern California woman who gave birth to octuplets in January , has fired a nonprofit group of nurses charged with helping care for her children , CNN affiliate KTLA has reported .
Nadya Suleman , mother of octuplets and six other children , fired a free nursing team , says a CNN affiliate .
Suleman accused the nurses , from a group called Angels in Waiting , of spying on her to report her to child - welfare authorities , the affiliate reported Monday .
The group was working for free , the affiliate said .
Suleman instead will rely on nurses whom she is paying , Suleman 's attorney said .
She now has four of the octuplets at home , along with her six other children .
The other octuplets remain in a hospital , which is discharging them two at a time to ease the adjustment .
Suleman -- already a single mother with six young children -- gave birth to the octuplets through in - vitro fertilization , fueling controversy .
News of her collecting public assistance for some of her children also outraged many taxpayers .
She has not identified the father of the children , but spoke about him in a new video released on RadarOnline.com .
Watch Suleman describe donor »
He is a foreign - born man who lives in California and is the father of all 14 of her children , Suleman said .
The man was angry when she told him that she was having eight more children , she said .
" He was angry at the doctor , like everyone else , " Suleman said .
" He is a good friend -- a platonic friend .
We would not be very compatible .
As far as I am concerned , I would never disclose who he is . "
At one point in the video , a child 's voice can be heard asking Suleman the man 's name .
She did not answer .

I ’ve never loved the idea of reading a novel online , because novels are n’t meant to be read that way : they are designed to envelop you .
Anything I see on the web , by contrast , I give my attention for a maximum of eight seconds before checking Reddit for videos of laughing dogs .
Do n’t say that ’s just me .
It ’s how the internet trains us .
So rather than trying to shoe - horn a novel into a web - friendly format , I thought I ’d write you a real - time serial .
That means a continuing story that turns up one tiny page at a time in your inbox .
It is titled “ Machine Man . ”
I say “ real - time ” because I will write it as you read it .
I ’m warning you about this up - front because it ’s going to be a little chaotic , and Hemingway was right .
Also there is the possibility that it will go so badly I nuke this part of the web site and pretend it never happened .
But it ’s the web , right ?
So I will release early and release often .
Right now you can sign up for free .
If it goes well , I ’ll turn it into a subscriber thing where you can buy the whole thing for $ 6.95 .
Pages start Wednesday March 18 , 2009 .

I hope you like it .
P.S. I ’m not sure if anyone ’s done anything quite like this before .
If they have , and it was a disaster , please do n’t tell me .

Tie -ins — games based on movies — have earned a well - deserved reputation for shoddy quality .
As a result , such games are seen as little more than attempts to separate fans of the films from some extra cash .
But one title stands out among the masses of inferior games :
The Chronicles of Riddick : Escape From Butcher Bay .
Butcher Bay was one of those games that took us all by surprise when it came out in 2004 .
Not only did it have a great story , but it also featured some of the most intense action we 'd seen in a long while and some mighty - fine stealth sequences to boot .
The high quality of the game was , needless to say , a delight , far better than the film version of The Chronicles of Riddick .
Five years later , it looks like lightning might strike twice , thanks to The Chronicles of Riddick : Assault on Dark Athena .
Playing the recently released demo reveals a game that is just as tense and thrilling as its predecessor .
Wanting to know more about ,
Ars sat down recently with Vin Diesel , Tigon 's Head of Production Ian Stevens , and lead writer John Platten .
Our conversation revealed something that most gamers do n't know : Assault on Dark Athena is the fruition of a love story between its designers and the source material .
" When I first started playing games , I felt guilty about how much I loved these video games , " Diesel explained .
In fact , it was n't something he told people about when he was starting out as an actor until he appeared in Saving Private Ryan and found out that Steven Spielberg was getting involved with something called Medal of Honor .
" Somehow , that gave me the green card to launch a video game company that would speak to a favorite pastime of mine . "
While many games have provided canon story ties to a movie universe , few have done them quite as well as Escape from Butcher Bay did , and Dark Athena looks like it will follow in its footsteps .
This is mainly due to the fact that developers Tigon and Starbreeze have no desire to produce any tie-ins to the Riddick Universe that are forgettable in any way .
Assault on Dark Athena looks like it will repeat the quality experience that was Escape from Butcher Bay
" We do n't try to turn out a game every six months , " Diesel explained .
" We take great pride in creating content that is deep , that you can play again and again , that complies with the film experience .
One of the coolest things about having this company is bridging great films with great games and having them be accountable for one another . "
" These games take years to develop , " added Stevens .
" We invest a lot of ourselves in them , personally We 've got a great opportunity now to continue to build momentum for this franchise . "
Diesel revealed that a new Chronicles of Riddick film was in development ( though beyond being written by David Twohy , details are scarce ) .
What little was revealed sounded interesting : the first half of the movie will feature a return to the fast - paced action of Pitch Black ; Riddick is alone on a strange planet while being hunted by bloodthirsty aliens .
Meanwhile , the overall film will retain a strong tie to the mythology established in the later films .
Involving developers with a solid reputation for quality games certainly makes it easier to keep building momentum for what started out as a cult franchise , especially when they 're working on the follow - up to a surprisingly big hit .
" Escape from Butcher Bay was , in many ways , a bit of a viral thing for us , " said Stevens .
" I do n't think as many people expected it to be as well - received as it was This has been an entirely different experience for us .
People have been very excited to see what we 've done with Assault on Dark Athena . "
Of course , Riddick is n't the only franchise Tigon is working on ; Stevens made a point of briefly mentioning the soon - to - be- released Wheelman .
" What 's so cool about that is that we were able to launch this IP to such a degree that both the movie and the game are being created simultaneously , " he said .
" That 's rare ; hopefully , within two years , we 'll have pulled this off .
It 'll be the first time that a movie and a game have been produced simultaneously ...
The movie's at Paramount , the game 's at Midway and Ubisoft .
We 're very excited about it . "
FOUNTAIN VALLEY , Calif . --
A young Australian is almost single - handedly spurring a new age in bowling :
He throws the ball with two hands .
With an easygoing charm to match his spiky brown hair and rock - star sunglasses , 25 - year - old Jason Belmonte , bowling in a tournament here this week , could well reach new audiences for a sport many younger Americans associate with " The Big Lebowski " and beer bellies .
He has quite a novel delivery .
Rather than use one hand , he shovels it forward with both from the right side of his body as he slides to a stop at the lane 's foul line .
Mr. Belmonte plugs two fingers , but not the thumb , of his right hand into the ball 's holes and uses his left hand to create extra spin .
The ball can top 600 revolutions per minute , up to 17 % more rotation than the nearest elite one - armed competitor and twice what some other top pros generate .
Ideally , the approach sends the ball flirting with the right edge of the lane before hooking sharply into the center and creating an explosion of pins .
" When he hits the pocket , it 's curtains , " says John Jowdy , a coach since 1948 .
" The ball is very destructive . "
Mr. Belmonte is the best - known practitioner of a style that 's actually gaining converts .
" We 're only three or four in the world , and we 're bowling so well .
Imagine if there were 50 of us , " he says .
He occasionally competes with fellow two - hander Osku Palermaa , a Finnish pro , on the European circuit .
In 2006 , Ohioan Chaz Dennis became the youngest player to roll a perfect 300 game at the age of 10 using the technique , and the entire Bolivian national team adopted it last year .
Even Walter Ray Williams Jr. , the most decorated bowler in the Professional Bowlers Association in his 26th year on the tour , has started dabbling in it in competition .
People whose bodies make an unusually active form of a certain protein tend to have dangerously high levels of cholesterol .
Those with an inactive form of the protein have low cholesterol and a low risk of heart attacks .
Needless to say , pharmaceutical companies would love to find a drug that can attach itself to the protein and block its activity .
That might be difficult for this protein , which is called PCSK9 .
But a powerful new approach , called RNA interference , may surmount that obstacle .
Instead of mopping up a protein after it has been produced , as a conventional drug would do , RNA interference turns off the faucet , halting production of a protein by silencing the gene that contains its recipe .
In monkeys , a single injection of a drug to induce RNA interference against PCSK9 lowered levels of bad cholesterol by about 60 percent , an effect that lasted up to three weeks .
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals , the biotechnology company that developed the drug , hopes to begin testing it in people next year .
Type is one of the most - used elements of the web .
Think about it .
Unless you are YouTube or Flickr , chances are your site visitors are coming for your text content – not the fancy packaging that surrounds it .
So why are web designers still treating text like a secondary element ?
Good typography brings order to the page and increases legibility .
It allows people to process information faster .
A more scannable , readable site means happy visitors .
Happy visitors return often , buy products , leave comments , and share the site with friends .
See why it might be worth thinking about ?
I could blather on forever about how far typography has come on the web , and how far yet it has to go .
I have frequently bounced between web and print design .
When you ’re going from InDesign to TextMate , the limitations of web type are crystal clear .
But plenty has been said about what web type ca n’t do .
This is n’t going to be another rant .
Instead , let ’s focus on a 5 easy fixes for the typographic eyesores that abound across the Web .
1. Use A Reset Stylesheet
Stupid , but true :
No two browsers use the same presentation defaults .
Differences in padding , margins , headings , and indentations are rampant .
If you want your page layout to be more consistent across browsers , it pays to start with a CSS Reset stylesheet .
Two I recommend :
Yahoo’s CSS Reset Stylesheet
Eric Meyer ’s CSS Reset Stylesheet
2. Watch Your Measure
Measure refers to the length of a single line of type .
A longer line = a longer Measure .
Studies have shown that for optimal readability , running text columns such as your main body copy should be somewhere between 45 – 75 characters ( 30 – 50 ems ) including spaces .
This is one of the reasons that fluid designs ( ones in which the columns expand and contract to fit the browser width ) are harder on the eyes .
Additionally , your leading should increase with the length of your Measure .
Leading is the amount of white space between lines of text , and is controlled via the CSS line - height property .
If you need to use an extra-long Measure , make sure your leading opens up .
Likewise , if you have a small column such as a sidebar with a short Measure , your leading should be tighter .
I find the default value most browsers assign is a little too tight .
A line - height of around 1.4em works well for most body content .
3. Tend To The Space Between
It ’s not just about your text – its about the space that surrounds it .
Too little space makes text hard to read , but so does too much .
The key is to find a simple balance that guides the eye from one element to the next .
One of the common mistakes new designers make is to fill every inch of space .
White space refers to the empty or “ negative ” space around your content , and it is crucial .
Take a look at a well - designed magazine such as Dwell or Good and you ’ll see that even though it costs the publisher money to print each page , they leave abundant amounts of white space around the text .
The page will be in balance and your eye will move from space to space effectively .
In addition to adjusting your line - height ( as mentioned in # 1 ) , try increasing your padding and margins .
Unless you ’re trying to pull of a crazy visual trick , there should always be a good amount of white space around your text .
Do n’t let it butt up against other elements , especially images .
Let your content chunks ( headings , paragraphs , sidebars , etc. ) breathe .
Mark Boulton wrote a very informative article about White Space for A List Apart , check it out .
4. Do n’t Go Font Crazy
A good rule of thumb for any designer is : use no more than two font faces in your design .
Two font faces can look very stylish .
A List Apart uses variations of Georgia and Verdana to create an elegant and polished look .
But continuing to add font faces to your interface creates unnecessary confusion .
Similarly , avoid using too many font sizes , colors , or treatments on a page or in a paragraph or they will compete with each other instead of adding emphasis as intended .
Although font stacks and technologies like sIFR and Typeface .js allow you to specify just about any font you want as the default , resist the temptation to go wild with the body copy .
Decorative fonts are best kept to headlines because they affect readability .
Think about it – when is the last time you picked up a paperback novel set entirely in Comic Sans ?
When creating font stacks , pay attention to the size of your pairings .
Some fonts that look similar render at very different sizes .
Verdana and Arial are a great example of this .
Typetester is a great tool for comparing core web fonts and creating a successful stack .
Another useful tool called Font Stack Builder shows you what percentage of users will see each variation .
Regardless of what fonts you decide to use , make sure they are not teeny tiny .
I know its hard … tiny text looks cool .
But think about the poor , squinting users !
Keep body text above 10 or 12 pixels .
If you insist on teeny tiny , at least use relative sizing for all those IE 6.0 users who otherwise could n’t make it larger .
Read Wilson
Miner ’s article on font sizes for a great take on the debate .
5 ) Do n’t Neglect The Details
The client provided the content .
Adding it to the site is just a matter of copying and pasting , right ?
Wrong , wrong , wrong .
This is a trap web designers fall into all too often .
Even those of us who diligently add heading tags , format each paragraph and organize bulleted lists with care forget some important typographic details .
Many ( including me ) missed out on formal typography training , so you ca n’t blame us entirely .
But the devil is in the details .
Its time we embrace these basics :
Use smart quotes
What ’s the difference between smart quotes and dumb quotes ?
Smart quotes ( also known as book or curly ) are curved and have both an opening and closing style .
Dumb ( straight ) quotes are usually straight up and down .
An apostrophe is typographically just a single quote so the same problem applies .
A dumb quote ( also called a prime ) should only be used between measurements .
For example , 6 ’ 4 ″ uses double and single prime quotes .
Unfortunately our keyboards default to prime quotes .
Microsoft Word and other text editors just correct them for us as we write .
Adding smart quotes to HTML pages requires more work from the web developer because you need to use markup to produce opening and closing quote symbols .
I see the same problem with em and en-dashes , ellipsis , trademark and copyright symbols .
Coders take the easy way out by replacing them with hyphens , multiple periods , a large TM and the infamous ( C ) .
Using the right symbols does make a difference visually .
Do it right and make editors everywhere smile .
How to make smart quotes :
# 8216 ; = opening single quote
’ = closing single quote
“ = opening double quote
” = closing double quote
I know – no one wants to spend all day hunting down quotes .
Luckily , tools like SmartyPants and Textism can do much of the legwork for you by automatically formatting text that includes smart quotes and the like .
Read “ The Trouble with EM and EN ” from A List Apart for more detail on the subject and the UTF - 8 character encoding for most common special characters .
One caveat – lots of CMS text editors ( like the one this site uses ) wo n’t let you implement smart quotes without extra plugins .
Sad , but true .
Stop putting two spaces after a period .
Please !
It ’s not necessary and its actually rather annoying .
On your links , use border - bottom : 1 px solid instead of text - decoration : underline .
Underlines can run through the descender characters ( g , j , p , q , y ) making them hard to read , especially when using smaller font sizes .
And while it has nothing to do with typography , running a quick spell check never killed anyone .
Even if all you did was copy and paste , a spelling error that slips through to a live site reflects badly on everyone involved .
Pay attention to those 5 fixes and your site designs are sure to improve .
Remember that these are just a starting point .
Good typography is a learned skill just like anything else , and it requires study and practice .
Always keep an eye out for sites that are getting it right and make note of what they are doing .

We ’d like to hear from you !
Hey folks , I ’m going to break the habit of a life time here and actually tell you about an event in enough time to make plans for it .
Usually I ’m a failmeister and only announce these things at the very last minute but I ’m trying to fix that , so here goes .
Next month there will be a release party for the new version of Ubuntu 9.04 ( Jaunty Jackalope , terrible name if you ask me ) at the BBC in Manchester ( UK ) , Friday 24th April at 7 pm .
I ’ll be attending , barring any natural disasters and if you ’re within easy traveling distance we ’d love to see you there too .
Perhaps even if you ’re not within easy traveling distance but are ridiculously committed you could also come , do n’t put yourself out too much though .
It ’s all being fantastically organised by Lucy Bridges of Manchester Free Software fame .
It ’s really great that the BBC have agreed to host the event in their bar and a big thanks go to Ian Forrester of BBC Backstage for this .
The address is New Broadcasting House , Oxford Road , Manchester M60 1SJ .
Here ’s the OpenStreetMap details :

… and here ’s the Google Map for those of us who hate freedom .
If this offends you please avert your eyes and for the love of god keep scrolling , scroll like you ’ve never scrolled before man ( or woman ) !!
View Larger Map
Ok so that ’s the details out of the way .
There ’s no dress code that I know of and if you wait in the reception of the BBC building someone will come and escort you upstairs to the bar ; tell one of the staff why you ’re there though , that might help .
Obviously if you turn up in your mankini or leather chaps they might have something to say about it but most outfits should be fine .
You do n’t have to be an Ubuntu user to come , you do n’t even have to like Ubuntu that much ( for all you haters out there ) .
It ’s a night of Free Software and fun , whatever your distribution or denomination .
There ’s an Upcoming event and also a Facebook event about this as well .
Apologies to folks in other parts of the world for whom this information is largely irrelevant but there may be a release party near you , have a look on the Ubuntu site and perhaps join a local party … for local people 😉
Hope to see some of you there to enjoy some drinks and geekery together ,
Dan
Important : – Please see Lucy ’s comment below and be sure to let her know if you ’re coming to the event .
This is a BBC requirement to comply with fire regulations .
You do n’t have to give anything other than a name , no official ID .
Send a message via Identi.ca or add yourself to the Facebook or Upcoming events .
Thank you ! 🙂

Ex -AG Gonzales returning to Texas with a story to tell ‘ I am going to tell my story ’
Former attorney general Gonzales returns to Houston
“ There is a lot of misinformation out there about what happened , ” said former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .

Gonzales returning to Texas with a story to tell 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
It has been nearly two years since Texas son Alberto Gonzales resigned under siege as U.S. attorney general , giving up the power and perks of a post with 110,000 employees and the ability to shape the rule of law in the United States .
Nowadays , Gonzales seems reflective , maybe humbled , and wants to get on with his life , including moving back to Houston or Austin by this summer .
“ You serve and move on ; it was going to happen , ” Gonzales told the Houston Chronicle while in town this week to visit his mother .
He drives his own car , carries his own umbrella , feeds his own parking meter and does n’t have any sort of an entourage .
But not all is back to normal for the Aldine MacArthur High School alumnus .
Members of Congress have not given up on investigating him for decisions he made as attorney general , and he remains under scrutiny for the Justice Department dismissal of some federal prosecutors .
He said he has cooperated with investigators and continues to be represented by counsel .
Book in the works
Although it has been reported he ’s had a hard time finding a job , Gonzales said he ’s making a living as a consultant , giving speeches and doing arbitration work as a lawyer .
He was to speak at a dinner at Texas Tech ’s law school on Friday , but that was canceled because of icy weather , officials said .
Gonzales is also looking for an agent for a book he is writing .
“ I am going to tell my story , ” he said .
“ People that have told a story — a narrative — are those who are very critical of the president and the Bush administration , and I think it is important for people to hear another perspective , so I ’m going to do that . ”
Gonzales said it does n’t burn when people call him a criminal , but he notes there is no accountability for statements made about him in the media or on the Web .
“ There is a lot of misinformation out there about what happened , a lot of accusations , wild accusations about what happened , ” he said .
“ Over time , I ’m confident that will be sorted out . ”
The former partner at the prestigious Vinson & Elkins law firm said he is n’t sure he wants to return to that way of life .
If he could have his dream position , the Astros fan said the choice would be simple : baseball commissioner .
Views on Mexico violence
Gonzales visited the Chronicle to lend his perspective to the ongoing violence in Mexico and U.S. efforts to support Mexican President Felipe Calderon .
He applauded President Barack Obama for the recent aid package to help Mexico take on the cartels and said the U.S. needs to do more to stop the southward flow of its guns that are ending up in the hands of cartel gangsters .
He also said Mexico should have oral , public trials of major organized crime figures rather than having trials consist of written testimony read by a judge behind closed doors .
Doing things in private breeds corruption , he said .
As for himself , Gonzales said he hopes history judges him fairly and that anyone who questions his actions listen to news reports from Sept. 11 to remind themselves of the context .
“ Just look at it for 30 minutes and recall what you felt like that day , ” he said .
“ It is unbelievable .
I was in all of that , but to go back and look at it , it is like , ‘ Wow . ’ ”

Because the visual cortex registers what you see , whether you realize it or not , this process also makes it possible to capture things you havenât physically seen - like dreams or visualized imaginary scenarios â as well as things you canât consciously recall seeing , or werenât paying attention to - like forgotten memories or small details overlooked at the time .
So eventually , way down the line , this process could be used for anything visually based , from finding your lost keys , to recording your dreams for later examination .
Why you would want to do the latter is anybodyâs guess , seeing as how your dreams , if theyâre anything like mine , are mostly just jumbled assortments of pop-culture idols gyrating erotically , while abstract representations of your deepest fears chase you through a hedge - maze , finally catching you because you can only run in slow motion while everything else moves in real time .

Litracon
Concrete has a sometimes - bad reputation as a harsh , rigid , cold - to - the - touch and straight - edged material .
Litracon is doing a great deal to change that image of concrete through a score of creative and sustainable applications for their patented light - transmitting concrete .
( Pics )
Filled with optical fibers that run from one end of a poured piece of concrete to the other , these prefabricated blocks and panels effectively transmit light from one side to the other .
Colors and light remain remarkably consistent from end to end , but with a natural variation from the pouring process that actually softens the effects considerably .
The fibers can transmit light to over 50 feet and , as they occupy only a small percentage of the total concrete block or panel , they do not significantly effect the structural capabilities of the poured pieces .
One could imagine all kinds of artistic as well as functional applications for this new - and - improved form of concrete .
Daylighting possibilities abound and all with potentially much lower heat loss and cost and with greater durability .
Perhaps best of all it puts another broad - ranging , highly versatile material choice in an architect ’s or builder ’s structural tool kit – what designers do with this solid - but - see - through substance ultimately will probably surprise us all .

Search for NASA chief comes under political influence
Why NASA 's top job remains unfilled
Politicians , outside interests maneuver to influence choice
The Ares rockets ( shown here in a drawing by an artist ) are being developed at the space center in Huntsville , Ala .

Each time , though , aides to President Barack Obama failed to say whether they had selected the space agency ’s administrator , and the guessing game continued .
Now , some supporters of the manned space program with ties to NASA say that one of the key reasons for the prolonged selection process is that powerful politicians and rival space contractors are maneuvering behind the scenes to influence the choice .
At stake is a multi-billion - dollar project to develop the Ares rocket for the space shuttle replacement .
NASA thought it had put the decision behind it to use the Ares to propel the Orion moonship into space when it selected a consortium of ATK Launch Systems Group , the Boeing Co. and Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne to develop the moonship .
The space agency has spent $ 13.6 billion on the rocket so far .
But the United Launch Alliance — a joint venture forged by Lockheed Martin Corp. and the Boeing Co. — never accepted Griffin ’s decision as final , space expert John Logsdon said .
The alliance favors the Atlas V or Delta IV rockets , which the Pentagon uses to launch military satellites .
Lockheed ’s Atlas V rocket is built in Littleton , Colo . ; Boeing ’s Delta IV is constructed in Decatur , Ala .
“ They see the choice of a new administrator as an opportunity , ” said Logsdon , a former director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University who served on the Columbia accident investigation board .
Urged to keep Griffin
The Ares would use space shuttle launch facilities at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida , keeping many high - paying jobs at the base — an approach that won the wholehearted approval of Sen.
Bill Nelson , D - Fla. , one of the strongest supporters of the space program in Congress .
Nelson — the chairman of a key NASA subcommittee whose exploits include a shuttle flight in the 1980s — at one point urged the Obama transition team to keep the Bush administration ’s NASA administrator , the man who selected the Ares , space engineer Michael Griffin .
Griffin ’s concept for the Ares envisioned replacing the 30 - year - old shuttle with a rapidly built rocket that integrated elements of the shuttle and the venerable Saturn V rocket , which lifted Apollo astronauts to the moon .
In his final weeks at NASA , Griffin was still complaining about the efforts of the United Launch Alliance to overturn his 2005 decision .
“ Every week it seems we hear that NASA should be directed to halt development of the Ares I ( and pay industry to develop an ) expendable launch vehicle to fly the Orion crew vehicle , ” Griffin grumbled in a January speech shortly before leaving the agency .
“ In a world where NASA had substantially more , ” he said , “ it would certainly be desirable to build and optimize different systems for different missions .
We are not in that world . ”
Both of the competing contractor teams have political allies on Capitol Hill .
Nelson ’s support for the Ares system in the Senate is complimented in the House by two Florida Democrats who sit on a panel that oversees the space agency .
Lockheed Martin of the rival United Launch Alliance has facilities in Littleton , Colo .
Sen. Mark Udall , D - Colo. , chaired a House space subcommittee before winning election to the Senate in November .
The alliance also has facilities in Decatur , Ala. , the home state of Sen.
Richard Shelby , the ranking Republican on a Senate Appropriations subcommittee that oversees NASA spending .
Selection of a new administrator has taken longer than some expected , Logsdon said , because “ the White House knows how tricky it will be to get an independent and trustworthy judgment from a new administration given the vested interests on all sides of this issue . ”
Looking at options
The rival contractor , he said , hopes that the next administrator will reconsider the moon rocket as part of a broad review .
“ The new administration and the new administrator are going to look at all the options with a fresh perspective , ” said Scott Pace , a former NASA official who leads George Washington University ’s Space Policy Institute .
Spokeswoman Julie Andrews of the United Launch Alliance said company officials would not comment on what she described as “ speculation ” about a new NASA administrator or a new choice for the moon mission contractor .
She signaled that the ULA would welcome a second chance to provide the rocket system that would be used for the next phase of manned U.S. space operations .
“ NASA is a valued customer , and we stand ready to support them in any way we can , ” Andrews said .
The Obama team has floated three names so far as NASA administrator : retired Marine Gen. Charles Bolden , a former astronaut ; Scott Gration , a retired Air Force general ; and retired Air Force Gen. Lester Lyles .
Gration emerged as a promising prospect before senators led by Nelson apparently scotched the choice .
They were concerned he might reopen the decision on the Ares .
The White House declined to comment on the selection process or the timetable .

When Yohan J. heard that the invoice generation code had started to run slowly , alarm bells sounded in his head .
The invoicing system had n't been touched in a long while , no business process had changed , no new outside interfaces , no hardware changes , no logical reason that it would n't be running as quickly as it always had .
In fact , this was just the step that generated the invoice ; not invoice items , just creating a draft invoice .
A single insert that would produce a single row .
Yohan started by checking the invoice table to get a spread of invoices over the past few months to see if volume had increased substantially .
It had n't .
Though , oddly , the six - numerical - digit invoice numbers were all over the board .
He spotted an 000015 and a 702438 that were created within hours of eachother .
How is it even generating these ?
he wondered , expecting to find a constraint on the column containing an algorithm to generate the invoice numbers .
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `invoices` ( `code` varchar (6 ) NOT NULL default ' 000000 ' , `DtCode` date NOT NULL default ' 0000 - 00 - 00 ' , ` Type` varchar ( 100 ) NOT NULL default '' , ) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 ;
Damn , not even the decency to enforce a primary key constraint on the code column .
Oh well , on to the stored procedure that generates the new invoice codes .
Ha , just kidding !
There was no stored procedure .
Invoice codes were generated in the PHP code :
No keys in the table , no enforced uniqueness of invoice numbers , and a while loop using a random number generator until it stumbles on an unused invoice number .
Yup , this code has wound up right where it belongs .

Ronin is a 1998 thriller starring Robert De Niro as Sam , a former spy turned mercenary who is hired along with other specialists to recover a stolen briefcase from those intending to sell it to the highest bidder .
The mercenaries then find shifting allegiances when the briefcase is recovered .
The film was written by David Mamet ( under the pseudonym Richard Weisz ) and directed by John Frankenheimer and the cast included Jean Reno , Sean Bean , and Natascha McElhone .
The following weapons were used in the film Ronin :
WARNING !
THIS PAGE CONTAINS SPOILERS !
Handguns
Colt M1991A1 Series 80
In the first half of the film , Sam ( Robert De Niro ) carries a Colt M1991A1 Series 80 pistol , a modernized version of the 1911 .
He hides the pistol in a gutter at the rear of the first rendezvous point .
He uses the M1991 to take out a sniper and provide cover fire during the arms deal .
He later switches to a SIG - Sauer P228 after the convoy ambush .
While discussing weapons and other preparations early in the film , Sam tells Spence ( Sean Bean ) that he favors the " 1911 " after being asked what sidearm he prefers .
When Spence remarks that it's an " old gun " , Sam replies that " it served my country well for a long time " - undoubtedly a metaphor for Sam himself .
NOTE : IMFDB previously referred to Sam 's pistol as an original M1911A1 , but PropStore sold this gun many years ago on their web site , and it was actually an M1991A1 Series 80 being used as a 1911 stand - in .
In several scenes of the movie , it is also possible to see the black plastic grips characterizing the M1991A1 .

SIG - Sauer P228
Besides his Colt M1991A1 Series 80 , Sam ( Robert De Niro ) also carries a SIG - Sauer P228 .
He uses it in the stadium scene to kill one of the the two attackers and also during car chase after that .
Near the end of the film , he attempts to kill Seamus ( Jonathan Pryce ) with it .
It can also be seen in promotional posters .

Beretta 92 FS Inox
Vincent ( Jean Reno ) selects for himself a Beretta 92FS Inox fitted with Hogue combat grips .
He is very skilled with the weapon and it is in fact the only weapon he uses throughout the entire movie .
The Beretta used in this movie was eventually deactivated and sold by PropStore .

Glock 17L
Gregor ( Stellan Skarsgård ) throughout the film is armed with a Glock 17L with the factory sights removed in order to allow attachment of a claw mount with a Bushnell HOLOSight 400 ( one of the earliest cinematic appearances of this device ) .
In the scene where he attempts to exchange the package , Gregor 's Glock 17L is fitted with the HOLOSight , a suppressor , and a 20 - round Glock 18 magazine .

The suppressor is fake due to the presence of a muzzle flash .
Note also how Skarsgård is actually pointing the gun into the rear of the jeep , to avoid injuring Tríska .
Glock 19

The Vatican felt the heat from an unprecedented amount of international condemnation last week after Pope Benedict XVI made an outrageous and wildly inaccurate statement about HIV / AIDS .
On his first visit to Africa , the Pope told journalists that the continent 's fight against the disease is a problem that “ cannot be overcome by the distribution of condoms : on the contrary , they increase it ” .
The Catholic Church 's ethical opposition to birth control and support of marital fidelity and abstinence in HIV prevention is well known .
But , by saying that condoms exacerbate the problem of HIV / AIDS , the Pope has publicly distorted scientific evidence to promote Catholic doctrine on this issue .
The international community was quick to condemn the comment .
The governments of Germany , France , and Belgium released statements criticising the Pope 's views .
Julio Montaner , president of the International AIDS Society , called the comment “ irresponsible and dangerous ” .
UNAIDS , the UN Population Fund , and WHO released an updated position statement on HIV prevention and condoms , which said that “ the male latex condom is the single , most efficient , available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV ” .
Amidst the fury , even the Vatican tried to alter the pontiff 's wording .
On the Holy See 's website , the Vatican 's head of media , Father Federico Lombari , quoted the Pope as having said that there was a “ risk that condoms … might increase the problem ” .
Whether the Pope 's error was due to ignorance or a deliberate attempt to manipulate science to support Catholic ideology is unclear .
But the comment still stands and the Vatican 's attempts to tweak the Pope 's words , further tampering with the truth , is not the way forward .
When any influential person , be it a religious or political leader , makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people , they should retract or correct the public record .
Anything less from Pope Benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates , including many thousands of Catholics , who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of HIV / AIDS worldwide .
I have seen this around the web , but I can't find the original source .
It 's written by Michael Haber , but a search has n't turned up much about him .
It 's pretty funny !
Emboldened by their success in declaring Pluto not a planet , the International Astronomical Union determined this week by a close vote that February is too short to be considered a true month .
It has , however , been granted the newly created status of " dwarf month . "
It shares this dubious distinction with several other calendar time spans , including Labor Day Weekend , Christmas Vacation , and the Time Between When You Were Supposed to Get Your Oil Changed and When You Actually Did .
" It only seems fair , " said IAU President Ron Eckers .
" February reaches a peak size of 29 days , averaging only 28 days for 75 percent of the time .
Recent research has shown that other periods , such as the Time Between When You Were Supposed to Get Your Oil Changed and When You Actually Did , often exceed this meager time frame .
In fact , this erratic behavior only strengthens our case that February does not belong in the same classification as the eleven ' true ' months . "
Eckers also warned that the crop of 30 - day " so - called " months should be careful to maintain their number of days .
" They 're already cutting it pretty close in my book . "
I think that pretty much nails it on the head .
And hey , if you know of ( or are ) Michael Haber , pipe up in the comments .
This was pretty good !
Tip o' the dew shield to Steven Raine .
As I wrote before , I was on a panel titled “ DM Going Green – Separating Fact and Fiction ” on January 13 .
The session , which was organized by the New England Direct Marketing Association , was interesting and the conversation was lively .
Floyd Kemske , who serves as Editor of NEDMA News and Creative Director at Amergent , wrote up a nice summary from the event .
As it is not online yet , I ’m pleased to include select portions of the piece below :
**** From NEDMA News ****
The session , moderated by Mariah Hunt , Senior Production Manager at Digitas , featured four practitioners from the front lines of the campaign for industry sustainability .
Each panelist provided a unique perspective on sustainability , its achievability , and its benefits .
Ben Grossman , Director , Green Marketing & Sustainability Practice , Grossman Marketing Group , for example , has been instrumental in developing a model program for his company , which offsets 100 % of its energy use through an organization called Renewable Choice Energy .
This allows Grossman Marketing ’s customers to credibly claim they make their printed collateral with certified wind power .
In addition , Grossman has replaced petroleum - based window material in its window envelopes with corn- based material , which is both compostable and recyclable .
Although the corn - based windows cost more , Grossman said , the company absorbs the premium so its customers pay the same as if they ’d bought the petroleum - based ones .
According to Grossman , the company ’s sustainability practices confer benefits in terms of increased sales , reduced costs , and more productive recruitment .
But he advised the audience that sustainability is n’t something you can just say you do .
“ Customers are smart , ” he said , “ and they are conversant with the issues .
They can discern a real commitment . ”
Transparency is important , he said .
“ Give people a way to dig down and investigate . ”
If you work at it and you are sincere , he said , you can use sustainability as a competitive advantage .
Mary McCormick , Senior Account Manager , Neenah Paper Inc. , said her company was committed to manufacturing products with high post - consumer waste content , FSC - certification , and reduced carbon footprint .
Before delving into some of the technical aspects of sustainable paper manufacture , she may have confirmed Grossman ’s assertion about competitive advantage when she noted that the invitation for President Obama ’s inauguration was printed on Neenah paper , chosen because of the company ’s sustainability practices .
FSC certification , which is the premier paper certification standard , guarantees a chain of custody for pulp products from the harvest site to the finished product .
It does n’t simply guarantee sustainability .
It also addresses social issues ( e.g. , rights of indigenous peoples ) and forest recovery as well .
Neenah ’s website offers a calculator you can use to find the environmental savings you will achieve by using FSC papers .
Neenah has also developed no - new - tree papers , including one manufactured from sugar cane bagasse .
The panel presentations were followed by a lively discussion in which some members of the audience sought proof that sustainability practices could increase sales .
None of the panelists could cite such proof , but Ben Grossman stepped up and said that if anyone in the room wanted to conduct a test to determine whether a legitimate green logo would boost response to a mailing , his company was willing to subsidize it .
There ’s a man who backs up his belief in sustainability !

Palm has announced it has enough money to launch the Pre , but with a net loss for the last quarter ( $ 98 m ) bigger than its revenue ( $ 90.6 m ) , there 's not much left in the piggybank .
While Palm wo n’t comment on the company ’s burn rate , it ’s clear that everything depends on the launch of the new Pre handset - which will come to the US , tied to Sprint , some time soon .
The Pre not only has to succeed , but succeed hugely if Palm is really going to spread its WebOS to a range of handsets as predicted by Edward Colligan , Palm ’s CEO .
This time last year the company had a revenue of $ 312 million , on which it managed to lose $ 57 million , so things are slipping badly and the company is desperatly in need of the boost that the launch of the Pre is expected to provide .
Palm is staying tightlipped on exactly when that 's going to happen – much like the London Underground , which found it 's much easier to avoid running late if you stop publishing a timetable - but whatever the date is , Mr Colligan is confident the company will hit the deadline .
" I have never had more confidence in Palm 's ability to bring a new product to market on time and at scale " , he told investors during a call about the quarterly results , as reported by CNet .
" Right now we 're 100 per cent focused on getting the Pre launched and the Sprint product out the door . "
Palm does n't just have to launch the Pre - it also has to market the device as the next best thing and sell enough to fund more production .
To save Palm the Pre has to be successful around the world , which means the already - demonstrated GSM version will have to get into production fast .
Palm claims to already be in talks with European network operators , and it seems likely that the amount those operators are prepared to sink into marketing will be an important factor in their selection . ®
How a Taoist Would Deal with the Recession
Growing up in an Asian culture , I was influenced by the traditions and concepts of Taoism ( check out wikipedia ’s page for more on the subject ) .
With the outlook of our jobs and economy so grim , I ’d like to talk about natural forces and balance , one of the central concepts of this philosophy that have influenced many for over two thousand years .
Taoist believe strongly that nature will always find its equilibrium .
Relating that to more scientific and modern terms , it ’s nothing more than :
1 . What goes up must come down
2 . When there ’s darkness , light always follows
So Why Does This Matter David ?
Look , job security means nothing these days and anything you own is basically depreciating in value like never before .
However , it does n’t mean that the economy will keep worsening forever .
As fast as this downturn has come because we overextended ourselves in the past decade , there will be a time in the not too far future when the outlook will be rosy again .
We have gone through tough times before and we ’ve come out of it every single time .
When there ’s darkness , light always follows – it ’s just nature at work .
Example of Taoism at Work
Taoist also believe that the universe works in its natural way and all should live within it without disrupting the harmony that exists .
In simple terms , everyone should learn the dynamics and go with the flow instead of working against it .
Knowingly or not , here are a few examples of people practicing this .
Gary , the Adaptable IT Executive
Money magazine had a great story of a IT Manager , Gary , who turned a downturn into a blessing in disguise .
After working at Ford for 30 years , the automaker offered Gary half his salary as pension to retire .
At age 55 , Gary knew he probably would n’t be able to find a comparable job anytime quick , but he took the offer anyway thinking that the next one might not be nearly as good .
Instead , he found a part time job scouting new businesses for a staffing agency to supplement his income .
Result of him going with the flow ?
Similar income levels as his full time job and much more time for his family .
Learn from the Taoist
Taoism or not , going against the flow is always difficult .
If you want to stop being the rock that is trying to remain stationary in a flowing river stream , here are a few suggestions :
Do n’t be stubborn –
Be flexible and you just might be able to make your own “ Gary , the IT Executive story ” .
Bottom line – do n’t always say no .
Do n’t be Afraid to try New Things – Look at the opportunities in front of you and do n’t believe one bit that you have to stay in the same industry for the rest of your life .
When the opportunity presents itself , be ready to move on .
Just because you have a MBA in Finance does n’t mean you ca n’t be a great project manager .
Think Positively –
Do you realize that your colleges are n’t complaining about their company and supervisors as much these days ?
How about all those coworkers who are much more cooperative with you ?
Not everything is so bad is n’t it ?
When there ’s Darkness , Light Always Follows
The next morning will come .
Be rested and wake up when the sun is beaming on your face , be prepared with groceries so you can make your breakfast and most importantly , be ready for your job that still needs you .
Happy Monday .
To become resilient in food production , urban areas need more than the conversion of empty neighborhood lots and terraces into gardens .
They need true farming platforms that can bundle commonly needed goods and services into an easily accessible package located in the middle of the community .
One good example of this is the Community Food Center put together by Will Allen ( a MacArthur award recipient ) in downtown Milwaukee WI .
In a small two acre space , the food center has packed 20,000 plants , thousands of fish , and hundreds of livestock .
This farming platform prototype includes ( note the intensity of the operation ) :
Greenhouses , hoop - houses , and hydroponics systems that support the growth of plants , fish , worms and a wide variety of livestock ( chickens to turkeys ) .
Agricultural services such as a large rapid composting system and an apiary ( beehives ) .
Self sufficiency via a retail store and energy production from anerobic digester that produces energy from farming waste .
Training services and classrooms to teach the community how to do nearly everything the farm does for themselves ( with an eye towards helping entrepreneurs start their own efforts ) .
In short , this looks like an excellent prototype for a local farming platform that can serve as the basis for a revival in community agriculture .
In particular , given the small footprint of this model , it may be the perfect way to return abandoned urban retail space to productive use in the years to come .

Bush Declares State of Emergency for Inauguration
President Bush has declared a state of emergency for the District during the Inauguration Jan. 17 - 21 , Press Secretary Dana Perino said .
The move will allow the federal government to provide funding to District government agencies , which have been swamped with planning and paying for security and transportation needs .
The federal government had given the District $ 15 million to help with the inauguration costs , but D.C. Mayor Adrian M. Fenty ( D ) had lobbied for more money .
Fenty , along with Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley ( D ) and Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine ( D ) , recently asked the federal government for $ 75 million to cover the costs .
No word on whether Virginia or Maryland will get extra federal money .
Up to 2 million people are expected to come to Washington , a city of about 580,000 people , to watch Barack Obama 's inauguration Jan. 20 .
The all - time inauguration record is 1.2 million who watched Lyndon B. Johnson get sworn in in 1965 .
Update 4:29 p.m : Post homeland security reporter Mary Beth Sheridan reports that Fenty wrote a letter to Bush last week requesting the declaration and the funds .
The state of emergency declaration does not mean the city is overwhelmed , Sheridan 's sources said .
The move is part of a reform effort enacted after Hurricane Katrina that allows the president to declare an emergency ahead of time in order to provide extra funding for security and other planning needs .

CanSecWest Microsoft on Friday released an open - source program designed to streamline the labor - intensive process of identifying security vulnerabilities in software while it 's still under development .
As its name suggests , ! exploitable Crash Analyzer ( pronounced " bang exploitable crash analyzer " ) combs through bugs that cause a program to seize up , and assesses the likelihood of them being exploited by attackers .
Dan Kaminsky , a well - known security expert who also provides consulting services to Microsoft , hailed the release a " game changer " because it provides a reliable way for developers to sort through thousands of bugs to identify the several dozen that pose the greatest risk .
" Microsoft has taken years of difficulties with security vulnerabilities and really condensed that experience down to a repeatable tool that takes a look at a crash and says ' You better take a look at this , ' " Kaminsky told The Reg .
" What makes ! exploitable so fascinating is that it takes at least the first level of this knowledge and packages it up into something that can be in the workflow . "
Over the past five years , Microsoft has made a fair amount of progress hardening its operating systems and applications against the most - common security threats .
Protections such as Address Space Layout Randomization and cross-site scripting defenses have been added to later versions of Windows and Internet Explorer , respectively .
And the company has generally managed to exorcise its programs of dangerous vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers .
Now , Microsoft wants to help secure third - party applications that run on top of Windows .
Last year , the company released a threat - modeling tool and other resources designed to help software developers kick - start secure development lifecycle programs in their organizations .
The idea was to package the security experience Microsoft has attained so it can serve as a sort of template for other companies .
The release of ! exploitable , which was announced at the CanSecWest security conference in Vancouver , British Columbia , is a continuation of that effort .
It 's a Windows debugger extension that 's used during fuzz testing , when testers test the stability and security of an application by throwing unexpected data at it .
It 's expected to be available soon at this link as an open - source program on CodePlex .
Because the majority of crash - inducing bugs do n't result in security vulnerabilities , there can be a fair amount of internal debate when they 're discovered during development .
Delaying the release of a product to fix a crash bug that 's most likely not exploitable needlessly drives up development costs .
An even worse outcome is ignoring a flaw that later results in an application being exploited .
" It 's all about signal - to - noise ratio , " Kaminsky said .
" Nobody has the time or resources to learn all the obscure tricks we have in the security industry , let alone to build that into the process . " ®
The BBC has been given footage of a pirate attack off the coast of Africa .
But unlike other high - profile attacks off Somalia this one was off the West Coast where there are few coalition warships on patrol .
The International Maritime Bureau says it knows of more than 100 pirate attacks on shipping off West Africa last year but most of them were not reported .

Earlier today I heard Washington Post columnist Robert Samuelson interviewed on WTOP radio ( a local all - news / sports / weather channel in DC ) .
Samuelson is usually pretty good , but he — like so many others — fails to understand the trade deficit .
He said in this interview ( as he says sometimes in his columns ) that the trade deficit " must be financed . "
That 's simply not so .
If Mr. Toyota sells $ 1 million worth of cars to Americans in 2009 , spends $ 600,000 buying ( " current " ) goods and services — exports — from Americans , and stuffs the remaining $ 400,000 into his mattress , the U.S. trade deficit rises by $ 400,000 but there 's no more " financing " of this amount going on than if Americans had spent that $ 1 million buying , not Mr. Toyota 's product , but Mr. Chrysler 's and Mr. Chrysler had used the proceeds exactly as Mr. Toyota did .
The only difference between these two scenarios is that , in the first , the U.S. trade deficit rises while in the second it does not rise .
Ditto if , say , Mr. Toyota used the $ 400,000 to buy shares of General Electric and 3M — or if he used the $ 400,000 to buy real - estate in Ohio .
Only if Mr. Toyota lends the $ 400,000 to Americans is there any financing going on , but even here there is n't necessarily a problem .
Is it worse for Entrepreneur Jones in Jacksonville to launch his firm with money borrowed from Mr. Toyota than with money borrowed from , say , Bill Gates ?
In both cases there 's debt .
But economically it matters not one whit which government issues the creditor 's passport .
If the borrowed funds are used wisely , they serve a useful purpose .
Period .
End of story .
If the borrowed funds do represent a problem , it must be because the debtor went into debt unwisely — say , he borrowed the $ 400,000 not to launch a new firm but to throw a gigantic party .
( Yes , yes .
I know that even gigantic parties are not unambiguously wasteful or unwise , but please do n't be pedantic with me on this point . )
But the problem here , again , is not the nationality of the creditor but the status of the debt — how it was used .
There is a great deficiency in the way even otherwise well - informed pundits think and write about the so - called " trade deficit . "

Perez burst into tears as she named the bitter ingredients of her new life as a widow : three children emotionally adrift , a mounting pile of bills and meager factory wages to pay them .
“ I ca n ’t . . . " Perez , 36 , said as she sobbed on the witness stand .
She took a sip of water and dabbed her eyes with a tissue before turning again to the prosecutor ’s gentle questioning .
A few paces away , the man convicted of mowing down her husband with a big - rig truck gnawed his lip and stared a hole into his cowboy boots .
By day ’s end , a three - judge panel would deliver his punishment .
Courtroom dramas such as this sentencing are standard fare north of the U.S. border .
But what ’s happening in the northern state of Chihuahua amounts to a revolution in Mexican justice .
Far - reaching legal reforms have brought U.S. - style trials to the border state , providing a glimpse of the kind of change that experts say is needed throughout Mexico to rescue an opaque and graft - laden justice system besieged by organized crime .
Chihuahua has overturned centuries - old legal traditions and opened courts to public scrutiny as never before .
The reform effort in the state , whose largest city , Ciudad Juarez , has been racked by gruesome drug killings , comes as the government of President Felipe Calderon is locked in a war with narcotics traffickers .
Many analysts say success against organized crime hinges on building a new judicial system and cleaning up corrupt police agencies .
Chihuahua ’s overhaul has attacked an ossified judicial system that many Mexicans long ago stopped trusting .
In contrast to U.S. practice , detainees in Mexico are treated as guilty until proven innocent , and often are beaten until they confess .
Trials are usually held behind closed doors and in writing , rather than in person .
Witnesses rarely confront assailants in court .
Moreover , trials in other parts of Mexico can drag on for years , slowed by endless injunctions that are a favorite weapon of the rich , and by a clogged court calendar overloaded with small - potatoes cases , such as routine car accidents , which are treated in this country as crimes .
Since unveiling its new system two years ago , Chihuahua court officials have experimented with legal tools untried in Mexico : plea bargains , mediation , suspended sentences and probation .
These mechanisms , familiar in the United States , are considered daring innovations to streamline Chihuahua ’s courts , officials say .
“ You have a faster , more open system that is completely transparent , ” said Margarita Romero Sanchez , one of the state ’s 72 judges who were trained for oral proceedings by legal experts from foreign countries , including Chile , Costa Rica and the U.S .
The reforms aim to fix a system in which only one or two of every hundred crimes result in prosecution and conviction .
Similar programs have been adopted by some other states , such as Baja California , Oaxaca and Zacatecas .
Last year the Mexican Congress approved oral trials in the federal courts as part of a judicial reform package that required changing the constitution .
Reform advocates contend that fair trials will force police to act more professionally .
Slipshod police work due to poor training , thick caseloads and neglect remains a weak spot in the criminal justice system , officials acknowledge .
The changes also could help win the trust of the public .
By this thinking , a robbery trial in Chihuahua represents a blow against impunity across Mexico .
“ These behind - the - scenes criminal justice reforms are really what are going to make the difference in the long run , ” said David Shirk , who tracks law enforcement trends in Mexico and directs the Trans - Border Institute at the University of San Diego .
Chihuahua ’s reforms , spearheaded by Gov. Jose Reyes Baeza after his 2004 election , rolled out gradually , starting in January 2007 in the capital , also named Chihuahua .
Oral trials began in Ciudad Juarez a year later and in the rest of the state in July .
In the capital ’s main courthouse , prosecutors and defense attorneys joust in public in sleek , wood - paneled courtrooms equipped with cameras that beam proceedings to a video control room .
Information is recorded digitally ; the piles of files that once filled entire rooms are nowhere in sight .
Perhaps the most basic change is that suspects are presumed innocent , reversing the inquisitional system brought by Spanish colonizers .
The arrested are no longer tossed straight into jail , but can remain free while prosecutors present evidence in hopes of winning an indictment .
Many residents question whether the reforms that include more rights for the accused may be to blame for a yearlong wave of killings in Chihuahua , especially in Ciudad Juarez .
A little less than a year after the reforms debuted in the capital , lawmakers responded to public pressure and made more suspects subject to incarceration before appearing in court .
But killings tied to drug trafficking are federal offenses .
Robberies , assaults and murders not linked to organized crime are handled in state courts .
Critics “ do n’t distinguish , ” the state ’s attorney general , Patricia Gonzalez , said in an interview .
“ They believe it could be because of this new criminal justice system . ”
All agree that the flexibility of the new system is one of its best points .
Having new ways to adjudicate cases , such as letting defendants plead guilty in return for lesser punishment , means that relatively few of them go through a long trial .
Of 1,112 cases filed in Chihuahua city last year , only eight went all the way to an oral trial .
Six of those ended in conviction .
Ciudad Juarez had 1,253 cases , but only six trials .
In both cities , about a quarter of all cases ended in a plea bargain .
Many other suspects received probation or had charges dropped after agreeing to compensate the victim .
Court officials say they want to keep the docket clear of minor matters .
Now many cases are mediated through the state attorney general ’s office , allowing parties to reach a court - supervised deal instead of trial .
Judge Romero was trying to nudge one such case toward mediation on a recent day .
A mechanic charged with smashing his pickup truck into a car sat glumly as Romero called a new hearing in six months .
That is enough time , she said later , for the two sides to agree on a fair damage estimate , and for the defendant to avoid a possible five - year prison term .
“ The trial under the old system would take three years .
What good does it do to wait that long ? ” said Romero , 36 .
“ The victim gets no satisfaction . ”
Some wrongs ca n’t be fixed with a handshake .
Perez , the widow with three children , acknowledged on the stand that her husband ’s killer had offered to pay her $ 3,100 .
But funeral costs alone added up to $ 2,000 , she noted .
Instead , the homicide case went to trial .
Cuitlahuac Davila , 49 , was convicted of running over her husband with a tractor - trailer after a booze - soaked argument .
The sentencing hearing , in front of a nearly empty gallery , lasted 90 minutes .
Perez , bundled in a quilted nylon parka , cried some more and then took a seat next to the prosecutor .
The three judges , in suits and ties , called a recess to decide the sentence .
Their answer came 10 hours later : Davila was to serve eight years in prison and pay $ 4,700 to the widow .
Case No. 30/2008 had ended a year after its start , lightning - fast for Mexico .
The sentence was read in open court -- the way it is done in Chihuahua these days .

The latest record store to close in New York is a big one : the Virgin Megastore in Union Square .
Following its announcement last month that the Times Square Megastore would close down in April , Virgin Entertainment Group North America will shut down the Union Square shop in late May or early June , a spokeswoman said , confirming a report in Billboard .
Virgin will also close its Market Street store in San Francisco in April .
The New York closures will leave Manhattan without a large - scale record store .
Thousands of music retailers have shut down in recent years as CD sales have plunged , and Virgin has been closing most of its locations around the country since it was bought by the real estate companies Vornado and Related in 2007 , but its high - traffic New York stores were said to be profitable .
Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean warned that Republicans who stand against the president ’s health care plan or try to label it “ socialized medicine ” will suffer at the polls in 2010 , and admitted “ enough is enough ” when it comes to the Rush Limbaugh hullabaloo .
Mr. Dean , a medical doctor passed up for health care spots he once coveted , told The Washington Times that because the president ’s plan stresses choice - it would allow people to choose their preferred health coverage or keep plans they like - it ’s “ right up the Republicans ’ alley . ”
Mr. Dean said “ Democrats ca n’t cave ” on Mr. Obama ’s plan , which he called “ perfect . ”
“ Not every Republican is a right - wing ideologue , ” Mr. Dean said in an interview Monday .
“ They called Medicare socialized medicine , ” he said .
“ If they want to filibuster this to death , be my guest and let ’s see how they do in 2010 . ”
Mr. Dean said he is not interested in an administration job , but he would n’t engage in hypotheticals about what he would do if Mr. Obama asked him to serve as surgeon general , for example .
He said he has told the White House he does not want to be considered for the post .
Mr. Dean said he is “ free to freelance ” and is busier now tackling several projects than when he was leading the party for the last four years .
The interview covered a wide variety of topics - from “ exaggerated ” reports about tension between him and the White House chief of staff to a theory the tough Virginia Democratic primary may help the party come November .
While he is focused on technology , health care and alternative energy projects in his new job as an independent consultant at Washington mega- lobbying law firm McKenna Long & Aldridge , politics and the administration ’s policy were n’t far from his mind Monday .
“ This has to get done , ” Mr. Dean said , or major corporations may not survive .
In addition , a health care system would drastically help small businesses , he said .
He said Medicare for all would be a good solution since “ people like it , ” and “ it works . ”
“ It ’s ridiculous to say care would be inferior , ” said Mr. Dean , who was a family practice physician in Vermont and later the state ’s governor .
“ It ’s perfectly good for the millions and millions of people over 65 in this country . ”
Mr. Dean said the fight would be between the “ conservatives and insurance companies ” and the rest of the nation .
He predicted moderate Republicans like the ones who already crossed the aisle to support Mr. Obama ’s $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan would want to help on health care .
“ Political leadership will get it , ” he said .
“ Voters want this . ”
Mr. Dean said he could n’t talk about the alternative energy projects he ’s working on , but hinted at some top secret news on a “ breakthrough ” he is working to get into the Defense Department : “ There are some extraordinary inventions out there being moved forward . ”
But he was most excited about a potential new project harnessing ideas he championed as governor - helping children from birth to age three - and saying that early age is crucial to determining how a child will perform in school the rest of their lives .
The “ Baby College ” idea encourages poor families to attend parenting groups to learn basic skills like reading to children , keeping fathers engaged and in some cases offering adult literacy courses .
“ Middle class people in America know you have to read to your kids long before they can read , and it ’s incredibly hard for poor people who are under economic pressure and maybe did n’t do so well in school themselves , ” he said .
“ If you do n’t get to kids who are really growing up in difficult circumstances before they are three , it ’s very tough to get to them later . ”
Nothing ’s official yet , but he ’s coordinating with a program in Harlem for the new venture and said a similar program helped reduce the prison population in Vermont .
Though he repeated he is n’t interested in an administration job , Mr. Dean has said previously he would have liked to be Health and Human Services Secretary .
Political sources have speculated that his sometimes tense relationship with Mr. Obama ’s chief of staff Rahm Emanuel might have been a factor , but he said the fights they had in 2006 over fundraising and his 50 - state strategy are “ exaggerated . ”
Still , he was quick to point out he ’s “ not a registered lobbyist , ” a label that would make it tougher to get a job in the Obama administration .
Mr. Dean said in the last three weeks he had a “ very cordial ” lunch with Mr. Emanuel and political adviser David Axelrod in the White House .
He declined to discuss any details of the meeting and would not say who extended the invitation , but added , “ I appreciated it . ”
Mr. Dean praised his predecessor Terry McAuliffe as helping lay the foundation for the Democratic takeover of government , and said he is “ very good friends ” with new Chairman Tim Kaine , who he suggested as a possible successor .
He said the new Organizing for America political arm - which morphed from the Obama campaign and will be housed at the DNC - may soon dwarf the party ’s successes and “ break huge new grounds . ”
Mr. McAuliffe is running in a three - way Democratic primary to be the party ’s nominee for governor this year , a race Mr. Dean said he would n’t touch .
But he did allow that the primary could help the party in the formerly red state , which has trended for the Democrats in recent years and backed Mr. Obama last fall , the first time Virginia went with a Democrat for president since 1964 .
“ The Republican candidate will have a hard time getting visibility because the press loves to cover a fight , ” he said .
But in another political fight , asked if the Limbaugh situation was getting too much play from the Democrats , Mr. Dean laughed and responded : “ Of course it is . ”
“ You expect people to have fun , and it was fun , but enough is enough , ” he said .
“ The reason it ’s fun is because it ’s true . ”
The conservative radio host has been a top headline for more than a week and Democratic groups seized on Mr. Limbaugh ’s remark he wants Mr. Obama to “ fail ” and pushed the idea he is the true leader of the Republican Party .
That was only furthered when Republican National Committee Chairman Michael S. Steele first dismissed Mr. Limbaugh as “ entertainment ” who offers “ ugly ” comments but then apologized after being excoriated by the radio titan .
Mr. Dean told The Times it was “ an embarrassment ” and “ ridiculous ” that Mr. Steele felt he had to apologize to Mr. Limbaugh .
He said he ca n’t blame Mr. Steele , adding as the leader of the Republicans he should n’t have to apologize for pointing out the party ’s sorry shape .
He said the inner-party squabble “ reminds me of what happened when I got here , ” though disputes he had with entrenched party leaders were kept private “ instead of a public fight with a very prominent figure . ”

Goldeneye 64 is easily in my top five best Nintendo 64 games ever made .
I devoted many hours of my life to this fantastic game .
Granted , the game is crap compared to today 's standards , but it 's still a gem in my eyes .
It 's been years since I last played this game , but thanks to this fan video , I 'm now on the hunt for the Nintendo 64 again .
This recreation of the Facility level ( best level in the game ! ) is old , but it 's pretty fun to watch so shut your whore mouth with the old comments .
It 's funny how I thought Goldeneye was the best game ever made back in 1995 1997 .
The A.I. was horrible , the aiming system was sh*t and chairs exploded like a bomb if you shot them up .
The best part of this fan video is when " Bond " aims at a bad guy and a reticle on a wire pops up .
Classic .

Can any of you remember a time in your life where laser guns were not just a few years away ?
Sven found a photo that was published in a German military journal from 1964 .
Very rifle like .
Click to expand .
The caption :
“ The laser rifle … that was developed by an American company and now presented for the first time is lighter than an infantry rifle .
10 kg baggage in form of batteries make it possible to shoot 10,000 times .
The effect in the target is quite small .
Only if the enemy coincidentally looks into the muzzle of the laser rifle he ’ll have serious eye damage even at a distance of 1.5 km as a result of the strong dazzling .
Fire effects are at such distances not possible yet , and it ’s still a long way to the “ death rays ” . “
Sven pointed out that the first laser guided bombs were developed only a few years later .
These bombs were guided by a laser mounted in the back seat canopy of an F - 4 cockpit and manually operated by the Weapons System Operator .
The laser used was probably very similar to the one use in the above photo .
Thanks to Sven , who blogs at Defense and Freedom , for the scan and translation .
Strange Humanoid Carp Found in Pond
The hybrid descendants of a carp and a leather carp ( tangerine fish ) are the new sensation in the small South Korean town of Chongju because of their â€œhumanoidâ€ facial features .
The look suddenly appears after observing the front part of their heads for a moment or two .
Two lines and two dots on their heads bear some resemblance to human eyes .
The local newspapers managed to snap some sensational pictures of the fish , which are about 80 centimeters long ( more than three feet ) and 50 centimeters ( almost two feet ) in circumference .
The fish live in a pond behind the home of a 64 - year old South Korean man and have been there since 1986 , although they have never attracted such public attention before .
â€ œMy fish have been getting more and more human for the past couple of years , â€ said the owner of the unusual fish species .
The two fish are females so it will not be possible for them to breed others of their very odd ilk .
They remain two very weird members of a very dynamic and eerie cosmos .

People are advised to wait a few minutes before drinking a cup of freshly - boiled tea today as a new study , published on bmj.com , finds that drinking very hot tea ( 70 °C or more ) can increase the risk of cancer of the oesophagus , the muscular tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach .
The study was carried out in northern Iran , where large amounts of hot tea are drunk every day .
But an accompanying editorial says these findings are not cause for alarm and the general advice is to allow foods and beverages to cool a little before swallowing .
Cancers of the oesophagus kill more than 500,000 people worldwide each year and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) is the commonest type .
In Europe and America , it is mainly caused by tobacco and alcohol use and is more common in men than in women , but drinking hot beverages is also thought to be a risk factor .
Golestan Province in northern Iran has one of the highest rates of OSCC in the world , but rates of smoking and alcohol consumption are low and women are as likely to have a diagnosis as men .
Tea drinking , however , is widespread , so researchers set out to investigate a possible link between tea drinking habits and risk of OSCC .
They studied tea drinking habits among 300 people diagnosed with OSCC and a matched group of 571 healthy controls from the same area .
Nearly all participants drank black tea regularly , with an average volume consumed of over one litre a day .
Compared with drinking warm or lukewarm tea ( 65 °C or less ) , drinking hot tea ( 65 - 69 °C ) was associated with twice the risk of oesophageal cancer , and drinking very hot tea ( 70 °C or more ) was associated with eight - fold increased risk .
Likewise , compared with drinking tea four or more minutes after being poured , drinking tea less than two minutes after pouring was associated with a five - fold higher risk .
There was no association between the amount of tea consumed and risk of cancer .
To minimise errors between reported and actual tea temperatures , the researchers then measured the actual temperature that tea was consumed by nearly 50,000 residents of the same area .
This ranged from less than 60 °C to more than 70 °C and there was a moderate agreement between reported tea drinking temperature and actual temperature measurements .
Our results show a strong increase in the risk of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma associated with drinking hot or very hot tea , say the authors .
Previous studies from the United Kingdom have reported an average temperature preference of 56 - 60 °C among healthy populations .
They suggest that informing the population about the hazards of drinking hot tea may be helpful in reducing the incidence of oesophageal cancer in Golestan and in other high risk populations where similar habits are prevalent .
These results provide persuasive evidence that drinking tea at temperatures greater than 70 °C markedly increases the risk of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma , says David Whiteman from the Queensland Institute of Medical Research in Australia in an accompanying editorial .
This report also lends support to the notion that thermal injury may be a cause of epithelial cancers , though he points out that the way in which heat promotes tumour development is not clear and warrants further investigation .
However , he stresses that these findings are not cause for alarm , and they should not reduce public enthusiasm for the time honoured ritual of drinking tea .
Instead he suggests waiting at least four minutes before drinking a cup of freshly boiled tea , or more generally allowing foods and beverages to cool from " scalding " to " tolerable " before swallowing .

One - third of El Paso 's residents cross the Texas - Mexico border to Ciudad Juarez to purchase medication and health care services , according to a study by researchers at The University of Texas School of Public Health El Paso Regional campus .
Results from this study are published in the February issue of the Journal of the National Medical Association .
" This is the first report on the patterns of cross - border purchase of health care and medications from a random sample of persons living in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez , " said Victor Cardenas , M.D. , Ph.D. , M.P.H , associate professor of epidemiology at the UT School of Public Health .
Other study investigators were Jose Rivera , Pharm .D , director of The University of Texas at Austin Cooperative Pharmacy Program at El Paso ; and Melchor Ortiz , Ph.D. , professor of biostatistics at the UT School of Public Health .
According to the authors , cross - border medication shopping and medical attention can present health dangers , including medications laced with toxic substances that are banned in the U.S. market ; incorrect medications or dosage prescribed by unqualified personnel ; and counterfeit medications .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and Texas State Board of Pharmacy do not have any strict regulations against cross - border medication and U.S. Customs typically allows the entry of limited quantities of medications , Cardenas said .
The study found while 33 percent travel from El Paso to Ciudad Juarez , only 5.2 percent travel from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso seeking more affordable and easily accessible medication and health care services .
According to an estimate of the Pan - American Health Organization , 11.5 million people lived in counties along the U.S - Mexico border in 2000 .
There are an estimated 2.3 million people living in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez , making it the largest bi-national metropolitan area in the U.S. , according to the City of El Paso .
" The border region is underinsured and underserved in terms of healthcare provision .
It is a major concern that clearly plays a role in the cross - border healthcare phenomenon , " Cardenas said .
He believes the lack of health insurance among El Paso residents is directly associated with crossing the border to purchase easily accessible prescription medications and healthcare services at lower costs .
Pharmacies and health care providers openly advertise their bilingual services to visiting U.S. residents .
However , Rivera said many people receive their diagnosis and prescription at the pharmacy counter by nonprofessionals .
" This [ study ] is a mirror of what happens across the entire U.S. - Mexico border .
The three main reasons people travel across border lines are affordable medications and services ; savings on doctors ' fees by using a pharmacy attendant as a doctor ; and the attentiveness of bilingual pharmacy attendants who can answer questions in depth for patients , " Rivera said .
According to Mexico's National Institute of Statistics , Geography and Informatics , 62.3 percent of Ciudad Juarez residents are enrolled in government insurance plans , which provide them with more overall access to healthcare .
Cardenas ' study found that 59.6 percent of El Paso residents and 82.8 percent of Ciudad Juarez residents were insured .
The study also found that Ciudad Juarez residents without insurance were three times more likely to travel to the U.S. to receive medical attention and purchase medications .
Cardenas said that Ciudad Juarez residents who crossed the border were more educated , had more purchasing power and were not enrolled in government insurance plans .
More men than women traveled to the U.S. to purchase medications with cash .
Cardenas believes increasing the access to affordable health care in the United States would prevent most of the cross - border purchase of medications and use of medical services in Mexico .

People at high risk from rhinoviruses , like children with asthma or adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , would benefit greatly from new drugs , Dr. Miller said , and should therefore be populations of interest to the drug industry .
Dr. Liggett said the new data might even provide an opportunity to consider new vaccine approaches .
Dr. Palmenberg is less optimistic .
“ There ’s not going to be a vaccine for the common cold , ” she said , given that vaccines do not protect the linings of the nose where the virus attacks .
The rhinovirus has a genome of about 7,000 chemical units , which encode the information to make the 10 proteins that do everything the virus needs to infect cells and make more viruses .
By comparing the 99 genomes with one another , the researchers were able to arrange them in a family tree based on similarities in their genomes .
That family tree shows that some regions of the rhinovirus genome are changing all the time but that others never change .
The fact that the unchanging regions are so conserved over the course of evolutionary time means that they perform vital roles and that the virus cannot let them change without perishing .
They are therefore ideal targets for drugs because , in principle , any of the 99 strains would succumb to the same drug .
Dr. Liggett said he believed that one such target lies at the very beginning of the rhinovirus genome , where its genetic material is folded into a clover - leaf shape .
The sequence of units in the clover leaf is designed to be read quickly by the infected cell ’s protein - making machinery .
All strains of rhinovirus have much the same sequence of units at this region and all could be vulnerable to the same drug .
Fair Isaac Corp. is rolling out its new - and - improved FICO score , but it 's likely to take a while before consumers see how they stack up under the new system .
On Thursday , Fair Isaac and one of the three major credit bureaus , TransUnion LLC , will start offering the revamped score , dubbed " FICO 08 , " to lenders .
Equifax Inc. is expected to follow in the second quarter , while Experian Group Ltd. declined to comment due to pending litigation with Fair Isaac .

When Republicans lose their principles
Despite the shock and awe of Democrats ' melodramatic press releases , nobody was genuinely bewildered or surprised by the recent McClatchy newspaper headline screaming that " GOP lawmakers tout projects in the stimulus bill they opposed . "
We all know that politicians love to brag about bringing home the bacon - even the bacon they vote against .
Far more baffling are those same politicians contradicting their entire foundational philosophy .
When that starts happening , as it is in the debate over health care , things can become authentically confusing .
Anyone who remembers the 1993 - 94 health care fights knows that Republicans have long asserted that private insurance is more efficacious and more adored by patients than government - run programs like Medicare .
To solve the health care crisis , those on the right say we must foster more price - cutting , efficiency - producing competition .
" The American people know that innovation , choice , and competition work , " wrote Sen . Tom Coburn , R - Okla . , in an archetypal opinion piece titled " Competition Solves Health Care . "
Give conservatives credit here :
At minimum , this argument had a logic to it , however flawed .
Sure , it is belied by data - the Urban Institute reports that private insurers spend up to 30 percent of their revenue on administrative costs ( read : salaries , paperwork , etc. ) while government programs spend just 5 percent , and polls show Medicare recipients are far more satisfied with their health care than those in the private system .
But , in nonetheless claiming that the private sector will always outperform the government , Republicans at least presented an ideologically coherent ( if fantastically inaccurate ) hypothesis .
That all changed , though , when Democrats this week began pushing to let citizens buy into a government - sponsored health plan similar to the one federal lawmakers enjoy .
The allegedly competition - loving GOP immediately stated its strong opposition on the grounds that the initiative would begin " forcing free market plans to compete with government - run programs , " as congressional Republicans lamented .
While Rep. Roy Blunt , R - Mo. , insisted that the GOP remains " committed to common - sense solutions that promote competition , " he said his party is " concerned that if the government " is permitted to compete , " it will eventually push out the private health care plans . "
Hold on a second .
Do n't Republicans insist that " competition solves health care ? "
Yes , ad nauseam .
Have n't they been telling us that government programs are obviously worse than private health insurance ?
Yes again .
Then , do n't they welcome a private - versus - public competition , believing that the former will easily trump the latter ?
Well ... uh ... no .
As I said , this is truly perplexing .
In one breath , GOP Jekylls say government medical plans will be inefficient , inferior to private insurance and thus hated by Americans .
In another breath , Republican Hydes effectively admit that government programs would be so efficient , superior to private insurance and loved by Americans that they will attract most consumers and dominate a health care competition .
Of the two assertions , of course , the latter is closer to the truth - and the GOP knows it .
Republican lawmakers received the new Commonwealth Fund report showing that a public system would save consumers $ 2 trillion through reduced premiums and lower administrative costs .
They see surveys showing the country overwhelmingly wants the government to create a public health program - and they know that if given a choice , many Americans will opt into that program rather than swim with the private insurance sharks .
Republicans can't simply acknowledge these truisms , however , because doing so would undermine the insurance industry that 's filling their campaign coffers .
So instead , we get pro-competition , government - is - ineffective " conservatives " working to thwart competition and implicitly admitting they believe government will be too effective .
Yes , when it comes to competition , Republicans were for it before they were against it .
And this time , that confounding flip - flop does n't merely threaten a bumbling presidential candidate , it imperils a health care revolution .
Their problem is that fare - box revenue accounts for only a fifth to a half of the operating revenue of most transit systems  and the sputtering economy has eroded the state and local tax collections that the systems depend on to keep running .
“ We ’ve termed it the ‘ transit paradox , ’ ” said Clarence W. Marsella , general manager of Denver ’s system , which is raising fares and cutting service to make up for the steep drop in local sales tax .
The billions of dollars that Congress plans to spend on mass transit as part of the stimulus bill will also do little to help these systems with their current problems .
That is because the new federal money  $ 12 billion was included in the version passed last week by the House , while the Senate originally proposed less  is devoted to big capital projects , like buying train cars and buses and building or repairing tracks and stations .
Money that some lawmakers had proposed to help transit systems pay operating costs , and avoid layoffs and service cuts , was not included in the latest version .
The Washington Metro set a record on Inauguration Day last month when people made 1.5 million trips on it to see the swearing - in of President Obama , but its $ 176 million budget gap means that it is planning to cut service and eliminate 900 jobs .
Chicago had its biggest gain in riders in three decades last year , but was forced to raise fares .
Charlotte , N.C. , whose new light - rail system is the envy of transit planners around the country , and which is enjoying its biggest ridership levels since “ the days of streetcars , ” according to Keith Parker , the transit system ’s chief executive , will be running its new trains less frequently , raising fares and cutting back on bus service .
In New York City , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is considering steep fare increases and its deepest service cuts in years to help close a $ 1.2 billion deficit .
In addition to considering a 23 percent increase in fares and tolls , the authority is weighing plans to eliminate more than two dozen city bus routes and two subway lines , reduce off - peak service and even close some subway stations at night .
The nation ’s transit woes threaten to deal another blow to the weak economy , keeping some workers from jobs they commute to and forcing some systems to lay off administrators , bus drivers , train operators and mechanics .
And while the economic stimulus package being considered on Capitol Hill includes tax cuts intended to put more spending money in people ’s pockets , fare increases promise to take a big bite for many commuters .
A few weeks ago , Jorge Ortiz gave a good talk at BASE about actors .
I want to summarize a bit of that and explain why I wrote naggati , and why I think mina - plus - actors is a big deal .
The history
In the 90s , we server coders wrote daemons using the fork / exec process model .
Apache still does it this way , though you can switch to threaded models in the current version .
Having a bunch of processes makes coordination difficult ( you have to use shared memory , pipes , or something similar ) but works well for a web server where there is n’t really any shared state except configuration , and you can just respawn new processes if the configuration changes .
For a chat server , you ’d like a lot of shared state and communication between the various sessions .
So in the late 90s ( early 2000s on Linux ) , we started using threads .
Each incoming connection spawns a new thread .
Each session is exactly one thread .
Because threads all share the same memory space , communication between sessions is easy .
You just have to make sure to use locks and condition variables , and to get the locking logic right – which can be tricky .
When you start to have a lot of sessions , the number of active threads begins to get a little unmanagable .
At a past job , we had a daemon that would handle between 3000 - 4000 sessions this way .
We could n’t push it past that , because the OS was n’t able to allocate stack space for more than about 4000 threads , and the task switching overhead was getting pretty ridiculous anyway .
Most sessions are blocked waiting for new data most of the time , so in the mid-2000s , server coders migrated to a thread - pool model .
Java even included a good thread pool library in java 5 .
In this model , you can have thousands of open sessions or socket connections , but you farm out work across a smaller pool of threads .
Usually you have one or two threads in a socket poll ( ) call ( or Selector in java ) across all the open sockets , and when incoming data arrives , it posts a work item into a queue , which gets handled by the next available thread from the pool .
Here ’s where mina comes in
Mina takes this thread - pool pattern and pulls it out into a reusable library .
You can register a socket with mina and get an IoSession object back .
There ’s a Selector running in its own thread , and when an I / O event happens on one of your registered sockets , mina calls an event method on your IoHandler , passing in the IoSession .
These methods represent events like “ new data has arrived ” or “ some data you sent has been successfully transmitted ” , and they are called from within a thread pool , or other executor of your choosing .
The great thing mina adds to this mix is the idea of a “ protocol decoder ” .
Instead of handling I/ O events in your session and doing stateful buffering and protocol decoding there , mina lets you write a Protocol Filter that receives incoming data as a byte buffer .
This filter can do the buffering and decoding , and pass decoded objects on to the session .
For example , a web server could have a decoder that takes byte buffers and generates HttpRequest s.
The protocol decoding happens in a special set of I/ O processor threads maintained by the mina library , so your IoHandler only gets events for fully decoded objects , and the handler code can be small and simple .
In the web server example , an IoHandler would receive HttpRequest objects as events that run in a worker thread from a thread pool .
The repsonse can be created and queued for writing , and then the event is over .
Since the queued work items are small , discrete tasks that finish quickly , many active sessions can be handled across a much smaller number of threads .
There are only two big speedbumps with this system :
You ’re using threads , so you need to be very careful about locking and all the other threading issues .
The protocol decoder is isolated into its own filter class , but it still has to be stateful and buffered .
So it will still be ugly and gnarly .
Enter actors …
Actors solve problem 1 .
There are several good articles about actors out there , so I wo n’t belabor the point .
With actors , you can write code in a way similar to writing threaded code , but all communication happens through message passing .
The actor library promises that any actor will only be running in one thread at a time , so you can avoid using locks entirely if you want .
Shared state can be passed around as “ messages ” that are immutable objects .
There ’s a pretty clear one - to - one mapping between the events that mina would like to notify you about , and messages passed to an actor .
It ’s straightforward enough that I put it into naggati as a helper class called IoHandlerActorAdapter .
It creates an IoHandler that handles every event by sending a corresponding message to the actor handling that session .
( For example , the messageReceived method causes MinaMessage .
MessageReceived to be sent . )
This line in kestrel is all that ’s needed to tell mina to create a new actor for each incoming connection :
acceptor.setHandler(new IoHandlerActorAdapter( session => new KestrelHandler( session , config ) ) )
… and naggati
Mina ’s written in java , so they ca n’t do much about the way protocol filters need to be written , beyond giving you some tools to store state between calls and some base classes you can use to get implementations of some common bits ( like reading a line ) .
But scala ’s syntax supports attaching code blocks to method calls as Function objects , so we can write code that looks sequential but is actually a series of continuations .
Naggati is a library that makes it easy to build protocol filters for mina 2.0 using this sequential style .
A DSL allows you to write the decoder in sequence , but each decoding step is actually a state in a state machine , and when one step is finished decoding , it calls the code block for the next step .
As an example , let ’s say there ’s a simple protocol that sends packets .
Each packet starts with an ( ascii ) count of the number of bytes in the packet , followed by a linefeed , and then the actual bytes .
( This is how HTTP chunked encoding works . )
We could write the decoder like this :
case class DataBlob ( data : Array [ Byte ] ) val decode = readLine { line => readByteBuffer(line.toInt ) { data => state.out.write( DataBlob( data ) )
End } } val decoder = new Decoder ( decode )
The first line just defines a case class for the decoded objects we ’re going to be throwing to an actor inside a MinaMessage .
MessageReceived event .
The decode step is where it gets interesting .
It just calls readLine with a block of code that will process that line when it ’s read .
readLine returns a Step object that contains that code block and some logic for reading bytes from mina ’s buffers until a linefeed is found .
Once a complete line has been read , readLine passes it to the saved code block .
In this example , that code block just contains another call ( readByteBuffer ) which returns a Step that reads a certain number of bytes and then passes them on to the attached code block .
The nested code block takes that byte array and sends it back to mina as a decoded object , to be handed off to a session actor .
End is a special state object that means decoding is complete , and the decoder should reset and start over at the beginning again .
We ’ve written a tiny state machine here , which buffers data as it arrives and progresses through each state as the previous state is completed .
But we did n’t have to write it that way .
By passing code blocks around , we got to write a very simple , sequential description of the protocol without worrying about callbacks or buffers .
There are a couple of more in - depth examples in the naggati source code , including an ASN.1 tag decoder , and a simple HTTP request decoder .
They ’re too long to quote here , but they demonstrate things like using a value from one decoded state to help decode a later state .
Kestrel is another good example , because it uses nagatti to decode memcache requests in a pretty small chunk of code .
With actors , mina , and naggati , I think the promise of a simple programming model for servers with thousands of connections is here .
You can spend your time thinking about and coding up the actual logic of a server , and not worry so much about how to juggle all those sockets and threads .
Hopefully in this tiny space I ’ve convinced you too .
Speaking before the Energy Department this morning , President Obama made a stirring defense of his stimulus package , and nailed his critics ' ears to the wall :
As we are meeting , in the halls of Congress just down the street from here , there is a debate going on about the plan I have proposed , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan .
This is n't some abstract debate .
Last week we learned that many of America 's largest corporations are planning to lay off tens of thousands of workers .
Today we learned that last week the number of new unemployment claims jumped to 626,000 .
Tomorrow we 're expecting another dismal jobs report .
On top of the 2.6 million jobs that we lost last year , we 've lost half a million jobs each month for the last two months .
Now , I believe that legislation of such magnitude as has been proposed deserves the scrutiny that it has received over the last month .
I think that 's a good thing , that 's the way democracy is supposed to work .
But these numbers that we 're seeing are sending an unmistakable message , and so are the American people .
The time for talk is over .
The time for action is now .
Because we know that if we do not act , a bad situation will become dramatically worse .
Crisis could turn into catastrophe for families and businesses across the country , and I refuse to let that happen .
We can't delay , and we can't go back to the same , worn - out ideas that led us here in the first place .
In the last few days we 've seen proposals arise from some in Congress that you may not have read , but you'd be very familiar with , because you 've been hearing them the last ten years -- maybe longer .
They 're rooted in the idea that tax cuts alone can solve all our problems , that government does n't have a role to play , that half - measures and tinkering are somehow enough .
That we can afford to ignore our most fundamental economic challenges -- the crushing cost of health care , the inadequate state of so many of our schools , our dangerous dependence on foreign oil .
So let me be clear :
Those ideas have been tested , and they have failed .
They have taken us from surpluses to an annual deficit of over a trillion dollars .
And they have brought our economy to a halt .
And that 's precisely what the election we just had was all about .
The American people have rendered their judgment .
And now it is time to move forward , not back .
Now is the time for action .
It 's that time of year again , when the Heartland Institute gathers together climate naysayers to deny the reality of global climate change .
In a previous post on this blog , James Randerson recognised the similarity between creationists and climate change denialists and their tactics of sowing confusion and doubt about established science .
But the similarities are not just with creationists .
The same tactics are used by those who deny the link between HIV and Aids and those who subscribe to any number of bizarre conspiracy theories from 9/11 conspiracies to lizard people .
At denialism blog we have identified five routine tactics that should set your pseudo - science alarm bells ringing .
Spotting them does n't guarantee an argument is incorrect – you can argue for true things badly – but when these are the arguments you hear , be on your guard .
• First is the assertion of a conspiracy to suppress the truth .
This conspiracy invariably fails to address or explain the data or observation but only generates more unexplained questions .
But let us think about such conspiracies for a moment .
Do they stand up to even a cursory evaluation ?
Is it really possible to make thousands of scientists , from over 100 countries , and every national academy of every country toe the same line , falsify data , and suppress this alleged dissent ?
I certainly did n't get the memo .
At the heart of all denialism are these absurd conspiracy theories that require a superhuman level of control of individuals that simply defies reality .
• The second tactic is selectivity , or cherry - picking the data .
Creationists classically would quote scientists out of context to suggest they disagreed with evolution .
Global warming denialists similarly engage in this tactic , harping on about long discredited theories and the medieval warming period ad nauseum .
But these instances are too numerous and tedious to go into in depth .
• Instead , let 's talk about the third tactic , the use of fake experts , where both creationists and global warming denialists truly shine .
Creationists have their Dissent from Darwin list of questionable provenance .
Similarly , global warming denialist extraordinaire has his list of climate scientists who disagree with global warming .
But do n't look too close !
Lots of his big names are the same hacks who used to deny that cigarettes cause cancer for the tobacco companies , others are scientists who are wrongly included because they said something that was quoted out of context , others simply have no credibility as experts on climate like TV weathermen .
But the desire of denialists to gain legitimacy by the numbers of scientists ( or whoever they can find with letters after their name ) used remains despite their contempt for the science they disagree with .
• The fourth tactic – moving goalposts or impossible expectations – is the tendency to refuse to accept when denialists ' challenges to the science have been addressed .
Instead , they just come up with new challenges for you to prove before they say they 'll believe the theory .
Worse , they just repeat their challenges over and over again ad nauseum .
This may be their most frustrating tactic because every time you think you 've satisfied a challenge , they just invent a new one .
The joke in evolutionary biology is that every time you find a transitional fossil all you do is create two new gaps on the fossil record , one on either side of the discovery .
Similarly with global warming denialism , there is no end to the challenges that denialists claim they need to have satisfied before they 'll come on board .
It 's important to recognise that you should n't play their game .
They 'll never be satisfied because they simply do n't want to believe the science – for ideological reasons .
In the US , global warming denialism usually stems from free - market fundamentalism that is terrified of regulation and any suggestion there should be control of business .
• Finally , the fifth tactic is the catch - all of logical fallacies .
You know you 've heard them .
Al Gore is fat !
His house uses lots of energy !
Evolutionary biologists are mean !
God of the gaps , reasoning by analogy , ad hominem , you name it , these arguments , while emotionally appealing , have no impact on the validity of the science .
It is important to filter information so that scientific discourse and debate can stay within the confines of rational argument and reason .
Otherwise we get sidetracked and paralysed by denialists who are not honest brokers in a debate .
Their goal is n't to promote science , or truth , or human knowledge , but to delay and deny .
• Mark Hoofnagle has a PhD in physiology from the University of Virginia and contributes to denialism blog .
He said : " I screamed , thinking it was some kind of joke for a few seconds , then I screamed more and more and more and tried to tap her on the head .

) about how foreclosures are mostly concentrated in only four states : AZ , CA , FL and NV ( see map above ) , despite the media coverage that would suggest it 's a much more widespread phenomenon .
Now comes confirmation of those observations of highly concentrated foreclosures from a new study recently released by the University of Virginia (
press release
and
full study here
) :
National housing price declines and foreclosures have not been as severe as some analyses have indicated , and they are not as important as financial manipulations in bringing on the global recession , according to a new analysis of foreclosures in 50 states , 35 metropolitan areas and 236 counties by University of Virginia professor William Lucy and graduate student Jeff Herlitz .
Their analysis shows that most foreclosures have been concentrated in California , Florida , Nevada , Arizona and a modest number of metropolitan counties in other states .
In fact , they claim that " 66 % of potential housing value losses in 2008 and subsequent years may be in California , with another 21 % in Florida , Nevada and Arizona , for a total of 87 % of national declines . "
" California had only 10 % of the nation 's housing units , but it had 34 % of foreclosures in 2008 , " Lucy and Herlitz reported .
California was vulnerable to foreclosures because the median value of owner - occupied housing in 2007 was 8.3 times the median family income , while the 2007 national average was only 3.2 times higher than median family income ( and in 2000 , it was lower still at 2.4 ) .

The Sudanese president Al - Bashir got indicted by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the country 's western Darfur region .
By now , everyone knows .
The international community , and the aid organisations working inside Sudan were weary of upcoming indictment since months .
Now the Sword of Damocles has fallen , they are dealing with the consequences : Sudan accused aid agencies of passing on information to the ICC and first expelled 10 NGOs ( Non Governmental Organisations ) , followed by another three .
The impact goes beyond the expelled Darfur - based aid agencies themselves and their relief programmes .
Many of these NGOs are implementing partners of other - often larger organisations - , who themselves were not expelled .
Concretely , this means that for non-expelled organisations , providing aid relief in Darfur will become even more challenging than it already was , with the security problems and logistical problems .
More challenging , if not impossible for what is the largest humanitarian operation in the world .
So no wonder the aidworkers ' blogosphere has been abuzz today on the ICC indictment and its consequences for the humanitarian relief efforts in Darfur .
Check what Michael , Harry , Thirsty Palmetto , Paul , Scott , Peter and Rob have to say .
( and check AidBlogs for more ) .
Add to that , what Rob Crilly , a reporter currently in Darfur , wrote on his blog a few days ago :
Today I met families who fled the fighting in Muhajiriya (..)
One of them was Mariam Ahmed Abu . (..)
She had survived six years of war but left when she realised she no longer had any children left to care for her . (..)
She had n't heard of the ICC until I asked her about it and I 'm starting to think that taking Bashir to the Hague will be more of a victory for activists far away from Sudan than for the people stuck in this miserable war .
All of that combined makes me think in how far the ICC indictment by itself will not cause a new genocide .
Not one executed by AK47s and bombs dropped from helicopters , but a hidden genocide caused simply by blocking aid to flow to Darfur ...
Would we then have killed in the name of justice ?
Murdered those we should have protected ?

As the International Criminal Court issues a landmark warrant for the arrest of Sudanese President Omar Hassan al - Bashir over war crimes in Darfur , CNN 's Nic Robertson interviews a man who was told to rape and kill children .
( CNN ) -- I wanted to believe the man in front of me was n't a rapist .
I knew he was a former Sudanese soldier , I knew he wanted to talk about rape in Darfur .
A humanitarian group working on Darfur issues had introduced him to us .
They told us his testimony was important to hear .
A woman left homeless by conflict in Darfur walks along railway tracks .
Last year in Darfur aid workers told me children as young as five were being raped in the huge displacement camps that are home to several million Darfuris .
In some camps , they told me , rape had become so common that as many as 20 babies a month born from rape were being abandoned .
As I sat inches from Adam -- not his real name -- I feared the revulsion I knew I would feel at my own questions as I asked about rape and his involvement .
I have interviewed rape survivors in Darfur .
I have two daughters .
I am a human being with a conscience .
It would be hard to listen to his replies .
He told me he was conscripted by force in to the Sudanese army in the summer of 2002 .
He thought he was being taken for six months ' national service and then would be released .
The conversation was slow going at first .
We were both holding off from delving into the sordid details he'd come to discuss .
His answers were short , he told me he got no pay from the army , only food and drink .
He said he was rounded up in an army truck from a market in Darfur and trained to kill .
He said he was armed with Kalashnikovs and told to " shoot targets . "
Watch ex-soldier describe brutal attacks on children to Nic Robertson »
Then , he says , his officers told him " we will be taken to a patrol and then soon after that we were asked to join other people to go and burn and kill people " .
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference in children 's lives around the world
That 's when he says he realized he was n't getting national service training , that in fact , he was being forced into war against his will , with his own people .
" They are black , " he told me , noting the difference between the lighter skinned rulers of Sudan and the darker farmers of Darfur .
" I am black , " he said , " this should n't be happening . "
But , he said , worse than being told to kill his own people , was that if he tried to resist , he himself would be killed .
" The order is that the soldiers at the front , and there are some people who are watching you from behind , if you try to escape or do anything you will get shot .
The order is that we go to the village , burn it and kill the people . "
It felt as Adam was beginning to open up a little -- not easy , given the topic , and the lights and cameras all around us .
He was beginning to talk a bit more , answer questions with more than one or two words .
But it was following a pattern : I 'd have to lead the way .
We were both waiting for the inevitable .
How he came to know of rape in Darfur .
And that 's when he said it .
Watch warrant being issued for president »
He brought up the rape by himself .
He was talking through a translator but his voice was quiet .
I thought I heard anger , heard him slow and his voice drop : " I had no choice , " he said " but I will say that I did n't kill anybody but the raping of the small children , it was bad " I knew this was going to be difficult and now it had begun .
What happens with the children , I asked .
" They cry out , " he answered .
" And what happens when they cry out ? "
" Two persons will capture her while she is crying and another raping her , then they leave her there , " came his reply .
Silence .
" What do I ask now ? " I thought .
Be forensic .
Get the story .
This is important testimony , I reminded myself .
And so we continued , Adam describing in detail how soldiers raped girls as young as 12 .
How officers ordered them to do this to make people flee their villages , run away and never come back .
Through all of this , Adam did n't once mention whether he actually had been directly involved in the raping .
He said he tried to desert the army as soon as he could , but was caught and tortured .
He showed me the scars where he said he was tied down beneath a tree and officers set fire to tires above him , dripping burning rubber on his body .
Eventually , he said , he did get away , went to his sisters , tried joining the rebels to fight the army .
But even there , his troubles were far from over .
Incredibly , he said , the rebels did n't trust him ; he was kept at their camp and only escaped when it was bombed by the army .
The end of his story , but we were n't really done .
One more question .
Had he been forced to rape children ?
" Yes I did , they were government orders , " came his reply .
How many ?
" Well it did n't feel like raping , I was feeling very bad but as I was ordered , I had to do something .
What I did was take off my trousers and lay myself on top of the girl but I did n't feel like raping , so I lay there for about 15 minutes . "
I want to be sure I understand him .
" So you did n't actually penetrate the girls ? " I ask .
No , he says , " because I had no feeling for it , my penis did n't actually wake up , so there was no actual penetration , " he replied .
There were other people in the room , the translator , a cameraman , our producer Jonathan Wald , but I had forgotten they were there .
My thoughts were entirely locked on Adam .
What more could I ask ?
I was emotionally drained .
There was no way of knowing whether he was telling me the truth .
Only in the measure of his voice was there a clue .
Here , sitting on an office chair , thousands of miles away from Darfur , the memories come flooding back .
The many , traumatized women and children we 've interviewed , distraught families , unable to protect themselves .
The pain we put them through , to recount , to relive , their nightmares .
Each time , I 've asked myself can I justify the suffering these questions cause ?
Each time , I tell myself it is only their own accounts that can cast light on the darkened corner of humanity they inhabit .
Only their own accounts that can help break their cycle of suffering .
Time and again , though , it seems telling the world their stories has little tangible impact on their reality of their lives .
And now I 'm face - to - face with a man who says he was part of the suffering , albeit by his own account not complicit and not guilty .
I am left with the thought perhaps Adam 's words carry even greater power .
If his story is true -- and it mirrors other accounts emerging from Darfur -- then it implicates the government in these terrible crimes .
He says he has trouble sleeping at nights .
I can understand why .
He is not alone .
Aid workers say millions of women in Darfur not only have trouble sleeping at nights , but live in fear of rape 24 hours a day .

BAGHDAD , Iraq ( CNN ) --
Muntadher al - Zaidi , the man seen as a hero in some circles for throwing his shoes at then - U.S. President George W. Bush , was sentenced to three years in prison Thursday by an Iraqi court .
TV reporter Muntadher al - Zaidi , shown in a file photo , was jailed after throwing his shoes at President Bush .
Al - Zaidi threw his shoes at Bush during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki in December in Baghdad .
Neither shoe hit the president , and other people in the room quickly knocked al - Zaidi to the ground before security officials arrested him .
Family members and journalists were cleared from the courtroom before Thursday 's verdict .
After news of the verdict reached family members , al - Zaidi 's brother appeared close to fainting .
Other family members were seen crying and shouting curses about al - Maliki and Bush .
Watch al - Zaidi's family protest the sentence »
Al - Zaidi was a journalist who worked for the television network al - Baghdadia .
The network also called for his release shortly after the incident .
He explained his actions during an hourlong appearance last month in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq .
Asked whether anyone pushed or motivated him , al - Zaidi said he was spurred by the " violations that are committed against the Iraqi people . "
In the Middle East , throwing shoes at someone is traditionally a sign of contempt .
Al - Zaidi's angry gesture touched a defiant nerve throughout the Arab and Muslim world .
He is regarded by many people as a hero , and demonstrators took to the streets in the Arab world and called for his release shortly after the incident .
Al - Zaidi , who faced a charge of assaulting a visiting head of state , had 17 lawyers to defend him .
There were also three judges in the courtroom , along with the prosecutor and family members .
In December , his defense team told CNN that he could face 15 years in prison if convicted .
But al - Zaidi's defense team was hoping to change his charge to an insult rather than assault , which would have brought about three months in prison rather than three years .
CNN 's Yousif Bassil and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report .

It ’s been a week filled with PC gaming DRM with companies talking about fancy new systems that aim to make everyone happy .
None of this for the Sims 3
Electronic Arts , while credited with creating one of the largest DRM debacles ever with Spore , is now looking at a DRM solution that ’s just plain old school .
Rather than try to re-engineer or employ some elaborate scheme , the Sims 3 team is going with the last form of DRM that did n’t hurt legitimate buyers -- the CD key .
“ The game will have disc - based copy protection – there is a Serial Code just like The Sims 2 , ” wrote Rod Humble on the Sims 3 news page .
“ To play the game there will not be any online authentication needed . ”
Humble explained why one of EA ’s biggest franchises will be getting such a simple form of protection : “ We feel like this is a good , time - proven solution that makes it easy for you to play the game without DRM methods that feel overly invasive or leave you concerned about authorization server access in the distant future . ”
Earlier this week , Microsoft , Valve and Stardock recently detailed their own new anti-piracy methods .
Microsoft ’s aims to stop pre-release games from leaking onto the internet , and Valve ’s ensures that only the original owner of the game but no one else can make use of the executable .
Stardock ’s system appeared to be the best with consideration for resale , but still required a one - time online activation .
[ I can't believe EA is agreeing with what I wrote in my story about HDCP .
I guess there is hope -- Ed . ]
RiffTrax boss Michael J. Nelson is about to prove forever the health benefits of cured pork products .
Or , he should be preparing his will .
The former Mystery Science Theater 3000 writer and performer has pledged to eat only bacon throughout February .
A long - time fan of salt and nitrates , the RiffTrax head writer chose the unique regimen because " several doubters on the RiffTrax staff had the unmitigated gall to insult bacon by making the outrageous claim that , as good as it is , no one could eat very much of it and live . "
To avoid dehydration , Nelson will allow non-bacon fluids such as beer , wine , martinis and water .
Along the way , Nelson 's blog will feature bacon- related updates and possible estimates on heart attack dates and times .
Under the terms of a no-lose bet with RiffTrax co-star Bill Corbett , if Nelson should survive the month , he will receive a prize of five pounds of bacon .
If he should not survive , Nelson gets a cremation that smells like your house at brunch time on Sunday morning .

A couple of months back , I realised that two of my projects ( Generous and Catapult ) could do with the help of the theme_support Rails plugin .
Discovering that it did n’t play nicely with Rails 2.1 , I created a fork on github and hacked at the _pick_template method to get it to do what I wanted .
It turned out a few people were interested in having the plugin work with Rails 2.1 , some of whom used more of the plugin ’s featured than I need , and a few further forks emerged .
I ’ve been meaning to work through them and merge together the best bits , but the impending release of Rails 2.3 stopped me in my tracks .
I ’m particularly keen to upgrade to 2.3 because Catapult generates a lot of routes and 2.3 ’s improved route handling should save us quite a bit of RAM and a number of cycles .
So it was rather frustrating to find that yet again a new release of rails broke the plugin .
Many hours later , working my way through the render path and trying to find the optimal solution , I ’m not quite there , but it sort of works and seemed worth writing up :
It turns out that for most templates there ’s a single point we can patch that will handle things .
ActionView : : Base # view_paths returns an instance of ActionView :: PathSet which is an augmented Array that ActionView consults to find a template that matches its current requirements .
By overriding that method we can check to see if a theme should be active and add that theme ’s folder to the set of paths to be consulted .
module ActionView class Base alias_method : theme_support_old_view_paths , : view_paths def view_paths paths = theme_support_old_view_paths if controller and controller.current_theme theme_path = File.join( RAILS_ROOT , " themes " , controller.current_theme , " views " ) if File.exists ?( theme_path ) and ! paths.include ?( theme_path ) paths.unshift ( theme_path ) end end paths end end end
The hitch is that this does n’t work for layouts , which take a slightly different path .
In my case , that ’s not a huge deal , but it ’s a major omission for other uses .
I ’ve also not yet tested the actionmailer handling .
You can track progress in a branch on GitHub .
I ’ll post here as I make more progress , but would welcome any contributions from the rest of the community .
UPDATE ( 10 pm ) : I just checked in ActionMailer support .
More on that tomorrow .

Me on the Economics of Imperialism By David Henderson
In this radio interview , Scott Horton interviews me about various current economic issues including : the Obama budget , the Bush - Paulson - Bernanke bailout , why most of the Republicans in Congress have zero credibility in pushing for small government , the economics of imperialism , Adam Smith ’s early use of public choice to explain British imperialism , why we do n’t need to go to war for oil , why I think we are nowhere close to another Great Depression , why I think Ron Paul is wrong in predicting a world fiat currency , and Robert Byrd ’s objections to Obama ’s continuation of Bush ’s aggrandizement of Presidential power .
One of the things I highlight in the interview is a marvelous line from Friedrich Hayek that fits Bryan Caplan ’s view of “ rational irrationality . ”
A friend of mine , Michael Walker , the former head of the Fraser Institute in Canada , once asked Hayek why it was so hard to convince people of the value of economic freedom .
Hayek smiled and said :
Bank of America 's shares hit an intraday low of $ 3.19 a share today , a level not seen since August 2 , 1984 , when the bank traded at $ 3.17 a share .
Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis is having his own difficulties over his bank 's acquisition of Merrill Lynch .
It must be time for some morale building , and to that effect , here is a memo Lewis sent out to his staff today :
Rough week for stock , good week for business
To my teammates :
Public debate on the subject of potentially nationalizing some banks continues to put great pressure on our stock .
And yet , our company continues to be profitable .
I see no reason why a company that is profitable , with capital and liquidity levels that are very strong , and that continues to lend actively , should be considered for nationalization .
Speculation about nationalization is based on a lack of understanding of our bank ’s financial position as well as a lack of appreciation for the adverse ramifications for our customers and the economy .
Bank of America does not need any further assistance today , and I am confident we will not need any further assistance in the future .
I believe our company has more than enough capital , liquidity and earnings power to make it through this downturn on our own from here on out .
Years ago , I had a pop up contact form in the corner of my website that let visitors ask me anything .
Most of the time , I got the typical “ How do I escape side control ? ” and “ What BJJ workouts can I do at home ? ” questions .
But one day I received a serious message I was not entirely prepared to answer .
A young woman was a white belt at a gym where a male student was stalking and harassing her , making sexual comments during training , and even using threats of suicide to get her attention .
Her concerns were not being taken seriously by her instructor , who was aware of the male students problems , but just told her the guy was just having a rough time lately .
She was turning to me for guidance .
Here is her messaged ( shared with permission ) :
I am not sure what to do about one of the other people who rolls at my gym .
I ’m one of two girls who trains there , and I ’m fairly new .
This guy managed to get my phone number early on ( I ’m not certain how ) , and unilaterally decided that we were friends .
The problem is that he makes inappropriate comments ( i.e. after rolling , commenting that this is the closest he ’ll ever get to having sex with me , asking me out repeatedly despite firm and explicit responses that this wo n’t happen ) , and he ’s fairly unstable psychologically .
He can become so angry that I ’m almost afraid he ’ll show up at my house and hurt me ( he knows where I live ) , and he becomes angry like this because I did n’t roll with him , or I “ beat him ” at something , or my face looks angry while I roll with him .
He also will brush it off and pretend nothing happened or that everything is perfectly normal the next day , and he does n’t behave this way toward any of the other guys , and more importantly he does n’t behave this way when any of them are paying attention .
He ’s pretty good friends with the instructor who has brushed this behavior off as just part of his personality and not something to worry about , though he said I could contact him if it happened again in the future and he would deal with it ( since the anger / insanity is not occurring at the gym ) .
I ’m not certain how to address this without setting off an even more dramatic reaction ( the last time he became angry with me he also became suicidal ) .
I am just not sure how to address this situation at this point and any advice would be appreciated .
Having never dealt with a problem like this before , I reached out to Val Worthington through my friend Marshal Carper to share the woman ’s story and ask for advice .
Val sent back this message :
The more I think about it , the more concerned I am for her and the other woman at that academy , particularly because the instructor is condoning the behavior .
The women there have no allies .
So here ’s what I suggest you tell her : 1 . Run , do n’t walk , to the library / bookstore / Kindle and read The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker cover to cover .
And I do n’t mean when she gets around to it .
I mean NOW .
If she says she does n’t have time , tell her to do it the next time she would normally train .
Have her bring the other woman , too ; have them read this book .
de Becker is a personal security expert , and he would likely argue that she should be limiting this man ’s access to her .
It will also give her other suggestions about what to do next to defuse the situation .
Have her also watch these videos , especially if she hems and haws about reading the book .
I suspect these stories will resonate because they will share some similarities with what she ’s experiencing , in terms of her feelings / intuitions .
They ’re maybe 5 min each .
2 . Once she gets her immediate next steps straightened out , she should find a different academy .
That place is no good .
But first things first .
3 . I have a couple friends who have worked with de Becker and / or are security experts .
I ’ll reach out to them and see if they are willing to give me some suggestions for her and even to chat with her if / when she ’s ready .
Thanks ,
Val
I forwarded Val ’s message to the woman along with my own , which read :
Your story has me seriously worried , and I asked several friends in the BJJ community for advice , and all of them are very concerned , too .
I do n’t want to be alarmist , but I ca n’t take this lightly .
If you follow BJJ news at all , you ’ve likely read that two BJJ competitors were arrested on New Year ’s Eve for gangraping a teammate , and I know of too many similar cases .
This is a real problem , and I ca n’t just brush you off .
It would just be an awkward social situation if he had simply asked you out and been turned down , but this has gone far beyond that .
He ’s found out where you live , he ’s using his anger and threats of suicide to control you , and you fear he will physically harm you .
Those are all very serious .
I understand that you are worried about “ causing drama ” and fearful of retaliation , but you have done nothing wrong , and you owe nothing to this guy or your instructor .
Your primary concern should be your safety and well - being .
I do n’t see how you can achieve those without leaving this gym and taking steps to protect yourself against this man .
Your protection is more important than “ being nice ” or “ not causing problems . ”
If you insist on staying at this gym , then you need to have a serious conversation with the head instructor with all other staff members present so there is a record of your concerns .
The “ closest we ’ll come to having sex ” comment alone deserves a serious reprimand from the instructor , but this goes far beyond that .
Honestly though , if you think the instructor will side with his buddy , and they will continue to treat this like a “ he said , she said , ” I do n’t see why you would even want to stay at this gym .
I have a few questions for you .
Do you live alone ?
Do you have a friend whose house you could stay at if needed ?
Do you have any male friends you trust to stay with you ?
Do you know if he is treating the other girl at the gym the same way ?
If my response seems overly serious , realize this was right after the news broke that two of Lloyd Irvin ’s “ medal chasers ” were accused of raping a female student in a parking garage on New Years Eve , and Lloyd ’s own gang rape trial was coming to light , so the problem of sexual abuse in BJJ was a hot topic .
You can read about this in the The Miami Times article The Cult of Lloyd Irvin .
Here is the woman ’s response to my questions and Val ’s message :
To answer your questions : 1 . I do n’t live alone .
I am studying at a university , I live with one other female roommate .
2. yes
3. yes
4 . I ’ve spoken with the other girl , she was out of town when he started and after she got back she said that he obtained her phone number as well and is somewhat annoying about contacting her all the time , but when I talked to her about this she said she has n’t observed any of this behavior in relation to her .
The other members of the gym that I discussed this with say that he either has their numbers as well and contacts them incessantly or that he tried and they had already figured this out and refused to give him their number .
In response to Val : I am already familiar with The Gift of Fear , and recently read it cover to cover so we ’re good there .
Prior to your response , I spoke with a few of the other higher ranking members of my gym about this just so that people would be aware of how I feel and what is going on .
It ’s a relatively small gym so at this point there will always be people around who are aware of this , though I have n’t been quite as specific as I was here .
I do n’t think that anyone really knows how to approach it since the black belt who is officially in charge is in Brazil but at the very least he wo n’t be allowed to roll with me .
When I said that the instructor said I could contact him if this happened again , what I meant was that he gave me his personal phone number and said to call him if the other guy starts behaving this way again ( even if it ’s in the middle of the night which is what happened to cause me to start trying to sort this out ) .
I think the reluctance to take any more extreme action stems from the slew of psychological problems that the guy has going on which are no secret , and they do make an effort to ensure that they are informed about his current state of medication .
I do n’t know if this is a good enough response , and I do n’t know if I made myself as clear as I have been here .
Thanks for your response .
I ’ll make sure that this gets sorted out , which unfortunately I may have otherwise given up on , so I really appreciate it .
Like Val mentioned , she got in contact with a friend who works in security and personal protection , and he wrote this advice :
Sorry to hear about your friend .
Sounds pretty much like a classic stalker situation to me .
Not the best write - up , but this : Coping with Various Types of Stalkers … is a good starting place to at least figure out what type she is dealing with .
She has to be willing to take some serious measures should she really want the guy to leave her alone :
1 ) Cut off contact – Unfortunately , this is going to mean finding a new place to train or a different time to train .
She should also change her phone number IMMEDIATELY and not give it to anyone except her closest friends .
She basically needs to ignore him .
I would go so far as to walk out of a room he is in .
2 ) Her instructor sounds like an a -hole or a complete wimp .
The fact that he is not concerned about a female student being harassed says A LOT about him as an instructor .
Next school , please .
I ca n’t give too much more help without more info .
At the very least , she needs to inform her friends of what is going on and start paying attention to her surroundings when she is coming and going from work / home / training .
If she has been physically threatened she can file a police report , but it might just be easier to walk away from the situation .
Tell her to hang in there .
It ’s a disturbing situation to find oneself in and every bit of support she can get will be helpful .
Years after her original message , I remembered this story and sent an email to ask the woman how she was doing these days .
Here is her answer :
First of all , wow , this really feels like a long time ago .
This guy that I was having problems with ended up lying his way into the apartment of the other girl I trained with at the time ( gave her a ride home because she was drunk then asked to use her bathroom ) , then cornered her and she had to physically push him out .
He got kicked out of that academy , so I did n’t leave , but then another student there started the same overly pushy , and then onto threatening behavior so I left .
But not before trying to talk to the owner / instructor , who cornered me in his office after asking me to come in during off hours to discuss the issue .
He ended up standing in the doorway and blaming me , saying that I needed to find it in me to forgive this second guy , and that this guy was just “ trying to be funny ” .
This conversation / lecture lasted more than an hour .
After that conversation , I never went back .
Things have been great since then , I changed gyms , then moved out of that city to a different academy that ’s even better and more professional .
I got my purple belt a few months ago and still train nearly every day .
Thanks for checking up on how this turned out .
Also a somewhat relevant and ironic twist to this story : the first guy I had an issue with ( the one who got kicked out ) apparently had a track record of trying to force himself on girls in high school .
And he has now been a police officer in that city for a few years , though he was n’t at the time this was occurring .
If this story sounds uncommon , you do not talk to enough women .
The threats of suicide may take it to the extreme , but many women have dealt with some level of creepy or predatory behavior from men they train with , or even their instructors .
Start asking the women you know in BJJ and you will hear many similar stories .
My goals for the remainder of this article are to lay out what red flags to spot when someone at your school is trying to manipulate you , how to spot if a gym has a toxic culture that normalizes abuses , and what you can do as students or instructors to address these problems .
Be wary of these behaviors , especially when used to pursue a sexual relationship with you :
Corners you or pulls you aside to speak alone
Pressures you to go on a date or spend time alone together
Will not take no for an answer and persists despite your disinterest
Offers you free after hours private lessons or one - on - one training
Offers to drive you home alone
Persists in asking for your phone number or to add them on social media
Asks others about you or gets your contact info from someone else
Uses the contact info you provided to the school for personal reasons
Adds you on social media to send personal messages
Does not respect that you are already in a relationship
Sends you unsolicited sexual messages or pictures / videos
Shows up uninvited where you live or work
Does not respect or ask for your consent to touch or kiss you
Initiates unwanted or inappropriate physical contact
Touches you inappropriately under the guise of “ coaching ”
Offers to “ massage ” or help you stretch as an excuse to touch you
Gropes you during sparring or wrestling but plays it off as an accident
Makes inappropriate comments about your body or appearance
Surprises you with favors and gifts to ingratiate themselves to you
Flatters and compliments you excessively
Promises to make you successful or a “ star ” competitor
Claims they feel a special connection to you
Offers you alcohol or drugs to lower your inhibitions
Flirts when you cannot easily turn them down or get away
Blocks you from entering or leaving the bathroom or changing room
Makes sexual jokes or innuendos at inappropriate times
Shares unsolicited personal problems to gain sympathy
Asks prying questions about your personal or sex life
Tells you inappropriate details about their sex life
Confides in you to tell you secrets and force a “ bond ” between you
Uses guilt or threats to coerce you into giving them what they want
Acts like you ’re making a big deal out of nothing when confronted
Pretends nothing bad happened when you see them later
Blames you for making them hurt or abuse you
Lies about what they did or said when called out on it
Exhibits volatile emotions like anger and jealousy to control you
Insults and harasses you to undermine your confidence
Treats you poorly after you turn them down
Spreads rumors and lies about you especially after you reject their advances
You will see common patterns in these behaviors : working to get you alone , testing your boundaries , disregarding your lack of consent , breaking down your barriers , gaining your trust ( or at least compliance ) , and establishing control over you .
Many of these are the signs of predatory grooming , where the abuser takes the time to lower their victim ’s defenses by building trust and creating emotional dependency .
These tactics are often seen when men are in positions to abuse their authority over boys and girls ( such as sports coaches and priests ) , but it can also be used on grown women .
The victim can come to feel like it was their fault , not understanding the undue influence the abuser held over them and how their consent was being subverted .
While you may not be the target of unwanted sexual advances or abuses , you can evaluate if your school ’s culture is healthy or not by seeing if problematic behaviors are tolerated .
Signs of a toxic school culture :
Instructors or students engage in the red flag behaviors listed above
Instructors makes excuses for people who are guilty of these behaviors
Instructors are unwilling to seriously look into complaints and take action
Instructors and senior members use student body as their dating pool
People know a member is a problem and blame their victims for not knowing better
Instructors make sexist or homophobic jokes or are OK with others making them
Use of sexist or homophobic insults and slurs
Jokes about sexual assault , abuse , molestation , rape , and domestic violence
Female students are not taken seriously or given the same respect as men
Instructors and students make sexual comments about female students
An instructor or student has a history of sexual harassment / assault or a criminal record for it
What you can do as a student
Contact the police and get help .
If you have been sexually assaulted , you can go to the police and report it .
RAINN offers advice on how to report sex crimes and what to do after an assault .
If you do not feel the harassment warrants going to the police , you can still take steps such as learning what to do when someone is pressuring you or stalking you .
Know your rights to consent and set your boundaries .
Understand consent and your right to refuse sexual advances .
Being taken advantage of by someone is not your fault .
It is normal to feel embarrassed , like you did something wrong or brought it upon yourself , but the blame lies with the perpetrator , not you , even if you were tricked into going along with it .
Report problems to the head instructor or school owner .
If the offender is another student or an assistant instructor , let whoever is in charge know .
Make sure the school leadership takes you seriously and does not just brush it under the rug .
Serious or repeat offenders need to be kicked out .
Be warned though that many instructors are hesitant to question their friends or loyal students , and may try to stay out of what they consider “ drama ” or “ he said , she said ” situations .
When you hear inappropriate comments about another student , do not “ be cool ” by staying quiet or laughing it off .
Tell whoever said it that they are being offensive and that they need to treat people with more respect .
Do not worry you are being “ too serious ” or killing the mood .
This bad behavior often persists because people let it slide as “ locker room talk ” or “ boys being boys ” or they are afraid of starting an argument .
Confronting them may mean having an awkward or tense moment , but silence is often taken as agreement , and someone needs to call them out .
There are plenty of other topics to talk and joke about that do not involve objectifying or degrading women , especially your classmates .
Do not tolerate a known creep at your school .
Some guys gain a bad reputation , yet people just learn to work around them .
This is sometimes called the “ broken stair ” analogy , where instead of fixing a broken step , people get used to stepping over it , and tell people who trip on it that it ’s their fault for not knowing better .
Examples of being a creep include being too handsy during training and “ accidentally ” grabbing women ’s chests and butts too often , hovering around the less experienced girls , and appointing themselves as the “ mentor ” to the newer girls and giving them unsolicited coaching during sparring , in addition to all of the red flags above .
Rather than let it be an “ unspoken rule ” to avoid him , talk to the instructor about your concerns .
If you want to date another student , consider the dynamics at play .
Do you have higher social status and authority than them ?
How would a break up affect them — would you drive them away from the school or from BJJ entirely ?
Will your relationship be disruptive for others ?
If you burn through all the single girls at your school and pounce on every new one who comes through the door , you are contributing to a toxic culture .
Instructors do not usually police relationships between students , but they can be forced to step in when they are losing income because female students are being driven away .
If the problem is the instructor , leave the school .
This is a difficult one , especially if the instructor is good at BJJ or you do not want to lose your BJJ friends .
You may overlook bad behavior because you are just there to learn techniques and you do not care what the instructor does in their personal life or feel “ that ’s just Brazilians being Brazilian . ”
You may also not have anywhere else to train if it ’s the only good school in town .
This is a very difficult personal choice , and you will need to listen to your moral compass here .
What you can do as an instructor
As an instructor , you need to recognize that — for better or worse — you are the role model for your students and you set the tone for your school .
You may just want to teach martial arts techniques , but your school will evolve into a social group for many of your students , and you are its central authority figure .
How you act and what you say influences the culture that your school develops .
When reading the warning signs listed above , did someone come to mind ?
One of the hardest jobs an instructor has to do is kick out problematic students , but that is one of your responsibilities .
You may want to give people a second chance after minor offenses , but at a certain point you have to lay down the law and tell them to leave .
Take complaints by your students seriously and look into them .
You may be uncomfortable with this because you trust the person being accused or you do n’t want to stir up “ drama . ”
While you may not have realized it when you started a school , this is one of your duties as a leader .
Many victims hesitate to come forward with their stories because they fear no one will believe them or they are ashamed of what happened to them .
You do not need to act without first investigating to confirm the facts , but victims should feel safe coming to you because you respect what they have to say .
Do not date or have sexual relationships with your students .
Even if you are sure you are a good guy and would never abuse your privileges , the problems inherent in romantic relationships between teachers and students make them a bad idea .
This is a controversial point for some , since they may know of happy couples that started as a teacher - student relationship , but the potential for abuse or other problems is very high .
Should instructors be free to date students ?
Some will defend an instructor ’s freedom to date students and point to successful marriages that started this way .
The argument usually goes : “ Love can blossom anywhere .
Who are we to tell consenting adults what they can and ca n’t do in the privacy of their bedroom ?
Are n’t a lot of those supposedly ‘ problematic ’ behaviors just normal for romance and dating ? ”
The problem with those arguments is that they ignore the power dynamics at play , where the teacher has much greater power over the student .
We are not talking about what adults do in private , but how a teacher acts towards his students .
Focusing on the few times these romantic relationships work out fine ignores that much greater number that do not .
Recognize that these are not two adults meeting on level ground in a socially neutral setting .
There is a high potential for manipulation and abuse .
What power does an instructor hold over a student ?
Teaches a special knowledge , but can also withhold it
Can award or deny your rank promotions
Can give or withhold attention
Can praise or shame you in front of your peers
Has the final word on decisions that impact your life at the school
Can kick you out and severe your ties to other students
Likely to be sided with in disagreements or conflicts
Likely to be believed when spreading rumors
Hold these powers over all of your peers in the school
An instructor can also have physical power over their students , which is usually part of the job description for teaching people to fight .
Relationships with students can also cause problems for the school .
Students can develop jealousy and resentment if they feel their instructor is showing favoritism towards their new romantic partner , such as getting extra attention or faster belt promotions .
In My Personal Code of Ethics as an Instructor , I wrote the following :
Do not get into relationships with students .
In my previous post , I briefly mentioned “ do n’t bang your students ” as an obvious rule , but many readers wanted to hear more on that , which is partly why we are getting this second post .
Let ’s look to what the code of ethics for Olympic coaches says about this :
Coaches do not engage in sexual intimacies with current athletes .
The code even goes one step further to ban sexual relations between coaches and former athletes for two years after the coach - athlete relationship ends , explaining it like this :
Because sexual intimacies with a former athlete are so frequently harmful to the athlete , and because such intimacies undermine public confidence in the coaching profession and thereby deter the public ’s use of needed services , coaches do not engage in sexual intimacies with former athletes even after a two - year interval except in the most unusual circumstances .
The coach who engages in such activity after the two years following cessation or termination of the coach - athlete relationship bears the burden of demonstrating that there has been no exploitation , in light of all relevant factors , including : ( 1 ) the amount of time that has passed since the coach - athlete relationship terminated ,
( 2 ) the circumstances of termination ,
( 3 ) the athlete ’s personal history .
( 4 ) the athlete ’s current mental status ,
( 5 ) the likelihood of adverse impact on the athlete and others , and
(6 ) any statements or actions made by the coach during the course of the athlete - coach relationship suggesting or inviting the possibility of a post - termination sexual or romantic relationship with the athlete or coach .
A BJJ gym is not held to the same standard as an Olympic training center , but it is still a bad idea for instructors to sleep with students for the same reasons .
The teacher - student dynamic — like any with one person having more authority , control , and influence over the other — has too much potential for abuse .
Students ( especially women ) should not need to worry that their coach has other intentions than to teach them what they signed up to learn .
I will admit I know of a few times where a BJJ black belt dated a student and they ended up happily married , but I have many more stories about nasty break - ups , rifts breaking up the gym , jealousy , angry wives , and all the drama you would expect from a Brazilian soap opera .
It ’s better to just keep it in your pants .
Women should feel safe joining a martial arts school without needing to keep their guard up against being pressured into sex by instructors or other students .
Women want to learn martial arts so they can protect themselves against predators , not surround themselves with more .
The aim here is not to portray every instructor with a romantic interest in a student as an abuser .
It ’s not uncommon for people who spend a lot of time together with a shared interest to develop feelings for each other .
The point is that power imbalances make the breakdown of personal and professional boundaries so prone to negative outcomes , even when no one set out with bad intentions .
Thinking she can just say “ no ” if she ’s not into you ignores that she has to worry how her answer changes her relationship with her teacher who holds power and influence over her .
What about students who pursue instructors ?
The instructor - student relationship is a two way street , and the student can be the one making advances on the instructor .
You may have run into so - called “ black belt chasers , ” women whose goal seems to be to sleep with black belts .
They get brought up when this topic is debated to try to get instructors off the hook .
This muddies the waters , because the instructor could be manipulated , too , but issues of power dynamics and consent still apply , and the best policy is still “ do not get romantic with students , ” even if they want it .
What about romantic partners or spouses who start training ?
Relationships that started outside the school without teacher - student power dynamics that later move into the gym are not what we ’re concerned about here .
What about women who commit abuse ?
This article was written from the perspective that men are more likely to cause problems than women .
Of course , a woman engaging in inappropriate behavior is wrong , too .
But even if we assume any single woman is just as likely to offend as a man , just going by the numbers , men are the bigger problem because they are the majority in BJJ , especially among instructors .
All demographic data I have seen for BJJ ( and I have collected much of it ) puts the ratio at about nine men for every one woman .
What about abuse of men and boys ?
Going by those same demographics , abuse of men and boys is a problem , too , though they may be even less likely to report it .
The abuse can be sexual , such a groping and rape , but more common between adults are bullying , abuses of power , or ripping off money .
Closing Thoughts
Martial arts instructors need to realize that to teach self defense and personal empowerment with any integrity , they have to ensure their schools and their own conduct are free of coercion and harassment .
Students are placing a great deal of trust in you , and you are betraying that trust if you exploit it for personal gain and sexual indulgences .
As a student , you can insist that your instructors and your fellow students are held to higher standards .
The relaxed , non-traditional attitude of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is what drew so many of us to it , but we should see that this blurring of boundaries does not give those with power the freedom to abuse it .
If you are currently having problems with people at your school , feel free to contact me or Valerie Worthington , and we will do what we can or put you in touch with people who are better equipped to help you .
If you are an instructor who needs the advice on how to address issues like problematic students and toxic gym culture , you can reach out and I will put you in touch with leaders on their topics .
In future articles , I will talk more about how the power imbalances between instructors and students can lead to abuses , not just for sex , but also for power and money , and how men are victimized , too .

Cathy Chapaty has written Athletes at Risk , a five - part series for Bullshido about the problem of sexual abuse and misconduct in martial arts .
While my focus here was mainly on what happens between adults , hers is mostly about adults who coach children , though the patterns of abuse are often the same .
I highly recommend reading these , especially if you are a parent of a young student and an instructor who who works with kids :
Go on , go around these gadget sites and read all that talk about netbooks and what not .
Acer Aspire
One this , MSI that , Dell Mini 9 this , Asus that .
It feels like the second coming of laptops in this netbook revolution .
But truth is , even back in 1999 you could find super - lightweight laptops in the market ( for the right price ) .
This 2005 - released IBM Thinkpad X41 laptop that Geeks.com sent us , a well - known shop for computer parts , is one of the best Linux - compatible laptops you can buy today for cheap .
The X41 is small and light , weighing around 2.7 lbs with the 4 - cell battery it came with .
It uses a 1.50 GHz Pentium M processor with the Intel 915 GM chipset .
Other specs include : Intel PRO wifi chipset ( fully supported by Linux out of the box ) , Intel graphics card , a 12.1 ″ XGA TFT screen , 512 MB RAM ( Geeks sent us a 1 GB RAM upgrade too , reaching the overall RAM of 1.5 GB ) , fingerprint reader , a 1.8 ″ 60 GB drive at 4200 RPM .
It features a modem port , an ethernet port , headphone / line - out , external microphone , infrared , expansion bus for IBM laptops , VGA - out , 1 PCMCIA slot , 1 SD slot , two generic USB 2.0 ports , and 1 IBM “ USB ” port ( not compatible with most gadgets ) .
The funny thing is , the Geeks.com page did not mention it , but the laptop actually had Bluetooth in it !
I did n’t know that either , until my husband unscrewed the back panel to install the new RAM stick and he noticed the modem / bluetooth card in there .
He said “ there ’s also Bluetooth there ” , and I must say , I did n’t believe him at first as “ lspci - v ” did n’t find any Bluetooth hardware earlier when I ran the command , and the Bluetooth / modem card was originally optional .
After playing around to change the wireless state ( Fn+F5 ) , lo and behold , Bluetooth was there , and was fully supported by Ubuntu !
I have a bit of a fetish when it comes to Bluetooth ( I own almost a dozen of wireless stereo A2DP / AVRCP Bluetooth headsets ) , so this was a big surprise for me .
The laptop feels great in the lap .
Not hot , and very lightweight .
I have gone through a number of 8 ″ to 10 ″ screen netbooks and I must say that while they are even more lightweight , they are very difficult to type on , and the ones that come with an SSD drive instead of an HDD one , they are very slow ( my SSD Acer Aspire One is very slow with Ubuntu for example ) .
But this IBM laptop feels so much better when trying to type , has some good vertical resolution ( and not useless resolutions like 800×480 or 1024×600 where many app windows do n’t fit vertically ) , and it ’s fast , fast , fast !
Truth is , even if I have a bunch of new netbooks , I am still using as my primary laptop at home my 6 year old 12 ″ Powerbook G4 867 Mhz , and I felt that what I needed a similarly - sized laptop rather than a netbook to replace it .
This IBM X41 is it , and at a price lower than $ 250 , and 1.8 lbs lighter .
The CPU speed is miles ahead of that of my Powerbook ’s ( playing back Flash videos online at a good speed is impossible with my Powerbook ) , and also faster than my netbooks ’
Celeron or Atom CPUs .
I have estimated that the CPU speed is close to a 2.6 Ghz or 2.8
Ghz of a desktop Pentium 4 architecture , which is more than enough to browse the internet , write a document , email , and play some ( simpler ) games .
The unit I received is refurbished , and there was one problem with it : the battery ’s data line .
The battery works fine , it goes through its full 2 hours of battery life , but if you start shaking the laptop a bit , it starts beeping .
The laptop * thinks * that the battery is getting removed and re-inserted , while it ’s not .
The power does not go off during these beeps , it ’s just some harmless bad information about the state of the battery ’s connection being transmitted .
I do n’t know if the data line is bad on the battery side or the laptop itself , but for my almost - stationary usage of it in front of the TV it does n’t really matter much .
It can be a problem though if people walk from room to room all the time with the laptop fully ON as it can be annoying to hear these beeps every so often .
And of course , this only happens on the unit I received , it does n’t mean that yours will have the same problem .
The laptop came pre-installed with Ubuntu 8.04 ( 1.5 GB swap file was setup as a file instead of a partition ) , and all hardware parts worked perfectly except the 56 k modem ( requires third party proprietary driver ) , and the fingerprint reader ( also works , but requires some user intervention to set it up ) .
I must say that Ubuntu is flying on this laptop and I am very happy with its performance and stability .
Especially when it comes to the Bluetooth and Wifi stability — I had no bad surprises .
At home we even paired the X41 ’s Bluetooth with my husband ’s three Android phones ( he ’s working for Google ’s Android , hence the quantity ) , and my own iPhone successfully , among other devices .
If netbooks are too small for your fatty fingers ( hey , I am not judging , my fingers are fat too ! ) , and you just need a “ hybrid ” between a full - on heavy laptop and a lightweight netbook , this model comes at a great price and offers great compatibility with Linux .
The fact that it ’s a 4 years old model has no impact at all in the abilities it offers , as at least myself , I find it still very modern in terms of speed and hardware features .
My good friend Vince was raving about that laptop when he bought one a few years ago , but unfortunately he was twitting at deaf ears at the time .
I ’ve now learn my lesson …
Ca n’t wait for Ubuntu 9.04 to be released next month and upgrade !

Hundreds of thousands of French employees have stopped work and are expected to demonstrate across France this afternoon in the first general strike to hit an industrialised nation since the start of the financial crisis .
Public and private sector workers have joined forces to protest against Nicolas Sarkozy 's handling of the crisis , saying too much has been done to help businesses and not enough to protect jobs and boost French workers ' low wages .
It is the first wide - ranging general strike since Sarkozy took office and a rare show of unity from France 's main unions .
Train drivers , airport staff , teachers , postal workers and tax inspectors joined private - sector employees including bank clerks , car workers , ski-lift operators , supermarket check - out staff and even employees from the company that operates France 's stock exchange .
With lawyers and journalists from state TV and radio also walking out , the various groups are protesting for job protection and better wages and against a raft of Sarkozy 's reforms , ranging from justice to hospital and school reforms , and changes to the running of state TV .
Car workers downed tools over the crisis hitting the French auto industry .
The arts world joined the ranks as north Paris 's cutting - edge new arts centre , Le 104 , staged its own strike .
" We need to sound a cry of anger , " said François Chereque , head of the moderate CFDT union .
Early this morning there were delays and cancellations at Paris airports and to regional and national train services , as well as school closures .
A scaled - back service was running on buses and the metro in Paris .
State radio stations broadcast music on a loop , and the telecoms , gas and electricity sectors were all affected .
Polls have shown that around 70 % of the French public think the strikes are justified – the highest approval for such action since Sarkozy took office .
France has not experienced the banking woes that Britain and Ireland have faced but , as the country enters its first recession in 16 years , rising unemployment – predicted to top 10 % next year – has sparked a mood of fear and anxiety .
The latest unemployment figures could not be released today because statisticians are on strike .
About 200 demonstrations and marches around France are planned for this afternoon .
RawLine 0.3.0 has been released .
This new milestones fixes some minor bugs and adds some new functionalities , must notably :
Ruby 1.9 support
A filename completion function
A new API very similar to the one exposed by the Ruby wrapper for GNU Readline
Some of you asked for Readline compatibility / emulation and that was actually not too difficult to implement : all the bricks were already there , I just had to put them together in the right place .
The RawLine module ( you can spell it “ Rawline ” as well , if you wish ) now behaves like Readline .
This means that you can now use RawLine like this ( taken from examples / readline_emulation.rb ) :
include Rawline puts " *** Readline Emulation Test Shell ***" puts " * Press CTRL+X to exit " puts " * Press < TAB > for file completion " Rawline.editor.bind ( : ctrl_x ) { puts ; puts " Exiting ... " ; exit } Dir.chdir '..' loop do puts " You typed : [ #{readline ( " = > " , true ) .chomp !} ] "
end
Basically you get a readline method , a HISTORY constant like the one exposed by Readline ( Rawline ’s is a RawLine : : History Buffer object though — much more manageable ) , and a FILENAME_COMPLETION_PROC constant , which provides basic filename completion .
Here it is :
def filename_completion_proc lambda do |word| dirs = @line.text.split('/' ) path = @line.text.match(/^\/|[a-zA - Z ] :\//) ? " / " : Dir.pwd+ " / " if dirs.
length == 0 then # starting directory dir = path else dirs.delete( dirs.last ) unless File.directory ?( path+dirs.join ( '/' ) ) dir = path+dirs.join ( '/') end Dir.entries ( dir ) .select { |e| ( e =~ /^\./ && @match_hidden_files && word == '') || ( e =~ /^#{word} / && e !~ /^\./) } end end
You can find this function as part of the RawLine : : Editor class .
The result is not exactly the same Readline , because completion matches are not displayed underneath the line but inline and can be cycled through — which is one of Readline ’s completion modes anyway .
A few methods of the RawLine : : Editor class can now be accessed directly from the RawLine module , like with Readline :
Rawline.completion_proc — the Proc object used for TAB completion ( defaults to FILENAME_COMPLETION_PROC ) .
— the Proc object used for completion ( defaults to FILENAME_COMPLETION_PROC ) .
Rawline.completion_matches — an array of completion matches .
— an array of completion matches .
Rawline.completion_append_char — a character to append after a successful completion .
— a character to append after a successful completion .
Rawline.basic_word_break_characters — a String listing all the characters used as word separators .
— a String listing all the characters used as word separators .
Rawline.completer_word_break_characters — same as above .
— same as above .
Rawline.library_version — the current version of the Rawline library .
— the current version of the Rawline library .
Rawline.clear_history — to clear the current history .
— to clear the current history .
Rawline.match_hidden_files — whether FILENAME_COMPLETION_PROC
matches hidden files and folders or not .
I bet you did n’t know these methods were even in the Readline wrapper , did you ?
Probably because of lack of documentation .
Anyhow , another very important difference beween Rawline and Readline is Rawline.editor , i.e. the default instance of RawLine : : Editor used by the Rawline module itself .
This makes things easier if you want more control over the line which is being edited and the previously - edited lines .
Sure , Readline # completion_proc exposes the current word being typed before hitting tab , and so does Rawline # completion_proc the difference is that if you access Rawline .
editor.
line you get a RawLine : : Line object with all the information you could possibly need about the current line : the position of the cursor , the text , the order the characters were entered , etc. etc .
Now you can imagine why it took me a few minutes to write the filename_completion_proc method ( and why it will take you even less time to write your own similar method if you wanna do something different ) : you can access not only the last word being typed but also the current and previous lines ( through Rawline.editor.history or just Rawline :: HISTORY )!
It must be said , as usual , that Rawline is not a complete replacement for the Readline library yet ( and it will probably never be , as Readline is huge ! ) , but it ’s a good cross-platform , more Ruby - esque alternative to what ’s currently available by the Readline wrapper for Ruby .
It ’s not as fast , of course , especially when completing long words , but it ’s quite usable .
The following libraries are not required but recommended :
win32console ( on Windows )
( on Windows ) termios ( on * nix )
They basically make Rawline faster .
If you do n’t use them , Rawline will fall back on its pure - Ruby implementation to move left and right ( i.e. printing backspaces and spaces character codes instead of ASCII escape codes ) .
Unfortunately , there ’s no vi_editing_mode or emacs_editing_mode yet ( for time constraints : they can be implemented ! ) but patches are very welcome .
Also , if you need more features , all you have to do is ask :-)

Some of the turbogeeks in the forum started a forum RPG .
This tickles my geek bone , so I 'd love to see it work out .
Sign up !
WOW .
Somehow this comic ended up taking 3 hours .
I 'm not sure it makes sense anymore , so I 'll just keep my fingers crossed that I was sane when I wrote the script .
Also , wanted to give some linky love to old school comics guru and friend Dave Olbrich , who recently started a comics blog .
He 's one of the nicest people I 've ever met , and has about a billion anecdotes about the comic biz .
He cofounded the late Malibu Comics , and was there for the birth of Image

TOKYO , March 23 ( Reuters ) - A Federal Express Corp cargo plane crash landed and was burning at Narita airport in Tokyo , Japanese media reported .
NHK public broadcaster showed video of the plane crash landing and live footage of it burning .
There was no immediate information about the crew of the plane .
( Reporting by Linda Sieg ) ( ( linda.sieg@reuters.com ; 81-3-6441-1881 ; Reuters Messaging : linda.sieg.reuters.net@reuters.com ) )
New York Times , By CHARLIE SAVAGE and NEIL A. LEWIS – A day after releasing a set of Bush administration opinions that claimed sweeping presidential powers in fighting terrorism , the Obama administration faced new pressure on Tuesday to support a broad inquiry into interrogation , detention , surveillance and other practices under President George W. Bush .
Justice Department officials said they might soon release additional opinions on those subjects .
But the disclosure of the nine formerly secret documents fueled calls by lawmakers for an independent commission to investigate and make public what the Bush administration did in the global campaign against terrorism .
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , Representative John Conyers Jr. , Democrat of Michigan , said the revelations , together with the release of new information about the Central Intelligence Agency ’s destruction of 92 interrogation videotapes , had underscored the need for a commission that would have the power to subpoena documents and testimony .
Officials who discussed the process spoke on the condition of anonymity because memorandums still under review might involve classified information .
Among those that have not been disclosed but are believed to exist are a memorandum from the fall of 2001 justifying the National Security Agency ’s program of domestic surveillance without warrants and one from the summer of 2002 that listed specific harsh interrogation techniques , including waterboarding , that the C.I.A. was authorized to use .
The Justice Department officials said the decision to release the nine memorandums on Monday came after some of the opinions were sought in a civil lawsuit in California .
They said department lawyers had determined that the opinions did not contain classified information .
The lawsuit was filed by Jose Padilla , a United States citizen who was arrested in Chicago in 2002 and detained for years as an enemy combatant before eventually being tried and convicted in a civilian criminal procedure .
Mr. Padilla is suing John C. Yoo , a former Bush administration lawyer who was the author of many of the opinions justifying detention and interrogation policies .
The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on Wednesday on whether to create a commission to look into the Bush administration ’s counterterrorism policy .
The committee chairman , Senator Patrick J. Leahy , Democrat of Vermont , has already called for a commission , and another Democrat on the panel said Tuesday that he would support such an approach .
But David B. Rivkin Jr. , an associate White House counsel under the first President Bush who is scheduled to testify at the hearing on Wednesday , said he planned to urge Congress not to move forward with that proposal , which he said would violate the rights of Bush administration officials and set them up for prosecutions by foreign courts .
“ They want to pillory people , ”  Mr. Rivkin said .
“ They want to destroy their reputation .
They want to drag them through the mud and single them out for foreign prosecutions .
And if you get someone in a perjury trap , so much the better . ” 
President Obama has signaled a reluctance to open a wide - ranging investigation into his predecessor ’s policies , saying he preferred to fix the policies and move on .
In his first days in office , he issued executive orders requiring strict adherence to rules against torture .
As a senator , he voted for legislation that brought surveillance efforts into alignment with federal statutes .
The increased calls for a greater public accounting come as the Justice Department ’s internal ethics office is preparing to release a report that is expected to criticize sharply members of the Bush legal team who wrote memorandums purporting to provide legal justification for the use of harsh interrogation methods on detainees despite anti-torture laws and treaties , according to department and Congressional officials .
The Office of Professional Responsibility at the Justice Department is examining whether certain political appointees in the department knowingly signed off on an unreasonable interpretation of the law to provide legal cover for a program sought by Bush White House officials .
The report is expected to focus on three former officials of the Office of Legal Counsel : Mr. Yoo , a Berkeley law professor , now on leave at Chapman University , who was the principal author of opinions on national security matters from 2001 to 2003 ; Jay S. Bybee , who oversaw the counsel ’s office during that period and is now a federal appeals court judge ; and Steven G. Bradbury , who oversaw the counsel ’s office in Mr. Bush ’s second term .
Mr. Bradbury wrote two of the opinions released on Monday .
Written last October and this January , they broadly repudiated the aggressive theory of virtually unlimited commander - in - chief power at the heart of Mr. Yoo ’s memorandums .
Although he was a critic of Mr. Yoo ’s work , Mr. Bradbury himself wrote three memorandums on the use of harsh interrogation techniques in 2005 .
Those documents are believed to be part of the Office of Professional Responsibility ’s investigation .
In a footnote to Mr. Bradbury ’s January memorandum that sharply criticized Mr. Yoo ’s work , Mr. Bradbury signaled that he did not want a repudiation of Mr. Yoo ’s legal reasoning to be used against him as part of the ethics inquiry .
Mr. Bradbury wrote that his retractions were not “ intended to suggest in any way that the attorneys involved in the preparation of the opinions in question ”  violated any “ applicable standards of professional responsibility . ” 

A couple of weeks ago , Wizards of the Coast offered Gnome Stew — and several other RPG blogs — the chance to write an article about the Player ’s Handbook 2 in exchange for a pre-release copy of the book .
Specifically , an article about the book from a GMing perspective .
We jumped at that chance .
I ’ve been poring over the PHB 2 since early March — reading , taking notes , and asking Gnome Stew readers ( here on the Stew , via email , and on Facebook ) what they , as GMs , want to know about the PHB 2 .
At 4,500 words , this in - depth overview of the PHB 2 from a GM ’s point of view is the result .
Want to see what the PHB 2 looks like to a veteran GM — and how it will impact your campaign — four days before it appears in stores ?
You ’ve come to the right place .
A bit of background : I looked at the PHB 2 purely from a GMing perspective .
I ’ve been running and playing D&D for 20 years , I ’ve played ( though not yet GMed ) 4e , and I ’ve written over 700 articles for GMs , both here on the Stew and on Treasure Tables .
So far , I love 4th Edition ; it does the things I like most about D&D exceptionally well .
You can read my launch day review of the core books or my take on the Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide to see where I ’m coming from .
This article is n’t a review , although it includes review elements , and I wo n’t be getting too crunchy with the individual classes — other ( excellent ! ) RPG blogs are handling those topics today .
Links to all of them appear at the end of this article .
Sound good ?
Let ’s rock .
The Meat : Eight New Classes
Classes are what the PHB 2 is all about — everything else is ancillary , or supports the classes .
That makes the PHB 2 a simple , pure , and polished book .
This is one of the things I ’ve enjoyed about 4e products to date : they pick one thing , do it very well , and do n’t try to do much else .
If you or your players pick up the PHB 2 , it will be for the classes .
The PHB 2 demonstrates the strength of the role system .
Before I dive into the classes themselves , let ’s talk roles for a moment .
I was originally pretty neutral on the role concept .
I could see the value for building a balanced party , but I did n’t think it was a system I ’d give much thought to down the road .
Enter the PHB 2 — with this book , the role system really shines .
For one thing , there are now 16 core classes , plus some variations ( the ones found in Martial Power , and soon more in Arcane Power — and beyond ) and campaign - specific classes ( from the Forgotten Realms ) .
By flagging each class with a role , it ’s easy to break them down in terms of what you want to play .
And without a role designation , it would n’t be immediately obvious what some of the new classes are like .
Quick , what ’s an invoker do in combat ?
Or a bard ?
( And no , unlike previous editions the answer to that question for bards is not “ Die horribly , while singing . ” )
Knowing their roles ( controller and leader , respectively ) gives you an idea of what they ’ll be like to play , and it ’s quite handy for new and old players alike .
Now that there are 16 role / class / power source combinations to consider , I find roles to be an essential tool for understanding — and getting the most out of — 4th Edition .
The classes : more solid options for everyone .
There are eight new classes in the PHB , a mix of entirely new ones and re-imagined classes that have appeared in previous editions .
Along with their roles and power sources , they are :
Avenger , a striker ( divine )
, a striker ( divine ) Barbarian , a striker ( primal )
, a striker ( primal ) Bard , a leader ( arcane )
, a leader ( arcane ) Druid , a controller ( primal )
, a controller ( primal ) Invoker , a controller ( divine )
, a controller ( divine ) Shaman , a leader ( primal )
, a leader ( primal ) Sorcerer , a striker ( arcane )
, a striker ( arcane ) Warden , a defender ( primal )
Let ’s recap the original PHB ’s breakdown the same way :
Cleric , a leader ( divine )
, a leader ( divine ) Fighter , a defender ( martial )
, a defender ( martial ) Paladin , a defender ( divine )
, a defender ( divine ) Ranger , a striker ( martial )
, a striker ( martial ) Rogue , a striker ( martial )
, a striker ( martial ) Warlock , a striker ( arcane )
, a striker ( arcane ) Warlord , a leader ( martial )
, a leader ( martial ) Wizard , a controller ( arcane )
Because the PHB 2 is part of the core book line for 4e , for the purposes of this article I ’m going to set aside the classes from the Forgotten Realms Player ’s Guide .
Not every GM will be running a Realms campaign , but nearly every GM is likely to consider the books in the core line , like the PHB 2 .
Seeing the 16 classes broken down like this brings a few things to mind from a GMing perspective .
For starters , there are now three controllers , three defenders , four leaders , and six strikers to play .
Particularly for players who liked the wizard but wanted more controller options , this is a good thing .
Notice the lack of overlap , too :
Out of 16 classes , only two pairs share the same role / power source combination — the original PHB ’s ranger and rogue , and the warlock and sorcerer .
Now think about how different the rogue and ranger are from each other in nearly every sense — to me , they ’re totally different animals ( and the same goes for the warlock and sorcerer ) .
Similarly , if all I ’d heard about the avenger was that it was a holy warrior class , I ’d think , “ Why do we need another paladin ? ” — but knowing that while they share a power source ( divine ) , the avenger is a striker and the paladin is a defender makes a huge difference .
That difference shows through once you drill down to their powers , too .
So what does it say about the PHB 2 that with eight new classes , there ’s zero new overlap ?
Bingo : the eight new classes were n’t just phoned in — they ’re fully realized classes in their own right , not just variations on old themes .
And just as classes that shared a role in the original PHB were pretty interchangeable in terms of creating a balanced , fun , and playable party , so are the new ones .
You can mix and match within roles without mucking up the basic formula for a balanced D&D party ( one class of each role ) — but classes that share a role are different in more than enough ways to dramatically change how the game actually plays out depending on which class you choose .
For me , that ’s a great approach :
All the fun of variations in player and PC roles with none of the heartache that would come with , say , all strikers not being created equal .
The new classes will quickly become a part of D&D lore .
Every edition of D&D has shaken up the class mix , but this is the first edition to have so many classes so soon .
Between the PHB and the PHB 2 , there ’s something here for damned near everyone .
Players familiar with 3.x already know the nuts and bolts of the barbarian , druid , bard , and sorcerer ( although they ’re in for surprises , too : these classes have changed dramatically , just like the first eight core classes did ) — but the four new classes are just that : new .
The four new classes are differentiated from the 12 familiar ones in every sense — concept , role , power source , and of course their specific powers — and they put a new spin on D&D .
Having a class like the shaman ( a leader who assists his party in tandem with his spirit companion , and whose player will have to look at the battlefield in an entirely new way ) in D&D represents a departure from standard fantasy fare — and I think it ’s a good departure .
Remember how you felt when you first cracked open the 3rd Edition PHB and read the sorcerer ?
And remember how quickly sorcerers became a staple of D&D , and then a part of the game ’s lore ?
The avenger , invoker , shaman , and warden will become a part of D&D lore , just like the sorcerer did when 3rd Edition was released .
There are subtle — but real — distinctions between all 16 classes .
One thing I ’ve consistently heard about 4e is that mechanically , the classes are all pretty similar .
And I see that perspective : Fundamentally , a lot of powers from different classes work in more or less the same way , just with slight variations .
But with 800 new powers added to the existing 800 ( more , if you include Martial Power and other sources ) , as a GM I ’ve observed that the distinctions between classes can be subtle , but they ’re there — and they become more dramatic and obvious once the dice hit the table .
For example :
The shaman is a leader with healing and buffing powers .
Sounds like a cleric , right ?
Yes and no .
Unlike the cleric , many of the shaman ’s powers stem from and revolve around her spirit companion : PCs and enemies adjacent to the spirit can be affected , and the shaman herself can also do things directly .
That puts a very different spin on a similar kind of class .
A player running a shaman PC has to think about two characters every round , and consider positioning and movement more carefully than someone running a cleric .
Their power sources ( primal for the shaman , divine for the cleric ) add another layer of differentiation .
For me , this is the crowning achievement of the PHB 2 : WotC has added eight classes and 800 powers to the game , and not only do they not feel tacked on , repetitive , poorly thought out , or otherwise troublesome in any way , all eight new classes are worthy — and fun — additions to D&D .
None of the classes suck .
This is one of the best features of this book for me as a GM : there ’s no cruft — not a single bad class .
Just like when I first read through the original 4e PHB , I can see playing and enjoying every class in the PHB 2 .
Even the bard — formerly the poster child for classes that rarely get to do anything useful in combat or dungeon crawls ( D&D ’s core activities ) — is full of interesting options , and is every bit as viable as the other classes .
The reason I dig that as a GM — and the reason you , as a GM , will dig it too — is that it removes a major worry from consideration when starting up a new campaign .
You can let your players use any of the 16 classes currently available without worrying that someone is unintentionally getting screwed in the process .
They also seem balanced .
Actual play is the only way to be sure , but based on my read - through , there are no balance issues here .
All eight classes are evenly matched , and stack up well both against each other and against the original eight .
Hiccups might be uncovered down the road , as the PHB 2 filters into groups and onto gaming tables , but I can say with confidence that no glaring balance issues jumped out at me — and I ’m a balance nazi .
New variations , not a fundamentally new approach .
It ’s worth noting that just like the original PHB classes , the PHB 2 classes are all about combat .
As in the core rules , non-combat “ powers ” are almost exclusively rituals .
Whether you loved or hated that aspect of the original PHB , the PHB 2 is n’t going to change how you feel — it alters the game by introducing new and fun class options , not other new elements .
Even the backgrounds ( covered later ) do n’t mess with 4e ’s basic formula too much .
The PHB 2 is n’t a book that sets out to change how you think about D&D , it ’s a book that sets out to give you and your players more ways to have fun with the core elements of 4th Edition — adventuring , exciting combats , dungeon crawling , and loot .
I like 4e for what it is , so for me this is a good thing ; I find the simplicity of the PHB 2 refreshing .
Good classes for new players .
4th Edition turned an old D&D truism on its head :
In previous editions , you gave a new player a fighter .
Once a round , you hit something ; in between , try not to die — pretty simple .
And you avoided giving them the wizard , who had scads of spells to review , weigh against one another , and keep track of every single session .
In 4e , the opposite is true :
In many ways , playing a defender ( like the fighter ) requires more tactical acumen and complex considerations during combat than playing a controller ( like the wizard ) .
Very generally , I would put strikers in a similar boat : good for new players .
So of the new PHB 2 classes , I recommend the avenger , druid , invoker , and sorcerer for players who are new to 4th Edition , or new to gaming in general .
Some classes are less suitable for new players .
Leaders are a bit like defenders :
When you play a leader , you have to think about every other PC on the battlefield , not just your own character — because so many of your powers revolve around other characters .
That can make them a bit harder for new players to grok .
On this basis , I ’d say the barbarian , bard , shaman , and warden are less suitable for new players .
Why the barbarian ?
Because despite having some of the striker ’s essential simplicity , the barbarian ’s rage mechanic — which is similar to a fighter ’s stances , and has powers that stem from it — adds a layer of complexity .
That said , one thing I dig about 4e is that because of how it breaks rules up into little pieces — each character ’s powers — any class , including the eight in the PHB 2 , will be reasonably easy for a new player to pick up and enjoy right out of the gate .
Even the ones I ’d argue are better suited to players with more experience are n’t poor choices for new players .
How will the new classes change your game ?
Because 4e gives players ( and GMs ) an incentive to form a fairly balanced party — or at least to carefully consider an imbalanced one ( there ’s nothing wrong with a four - striker group , it ’ll just make for a VERY different campaign ) — the new classes do n’t force any major changes in how you run your game .
Sure , there are now more options for each role , but even before the PHB 2 you could wind up with a party with two defenders , two leaders , and nothing else .
That has n’t changed ; it ’s just that now your players have more options in every role .
This is n’t to say that a D&D campaign with a shaman PC in it wo n’t be different from a campaign that only uses the classes from the original PHB — it will be different .
You ’ll run different kinds of adventures , introduce roleplaying elements specific to the shaman , adjust the tone of the game to match a party that features a primal PC , etc. — but the PHB 2 does n’t introduced any foundational changes to the system itself , or to what makes 4e the game that it is .
New micro-rules , not new rules .
One of the things I love about 4e ’s approach to class powers is that despite having 100 ( or more ) for each class , you only have to keep track of a handful of them at any one time .
And everything you need ( with a few exceptions ) is right in the power ’s description — or better yet , on a power card .
This includes new rules related to each class , which makes learning the game considerably easier for players and GMs alike .
By and large , the powers in the PHB 2 ( and the original PHB , for that matter ) do n’t introduce many full - fledged new rules — they introduce micro-rules .
To pick one example out of hundreds , let ’s peek at the druid ’s 1st - level Flame Seed at - will power .
If it hits , Flame Seed creates a zone of fire around the target ; until the end of your next turn , enemies entering those squares take damage .
That ’s not a new rule , it ’s a micro-rule : a small mechanical element that ’s easy to keep track of — and best of all for GMs , one that the druid ’s player can happily and easily keep track of on his own .
Instead of a rule in the combat section that explains how a one - turn zone of fire works , all the info is built into the power itself .
With each power carrying a tiny rules payload , the PHB 2 avoids introducing new core rules , substantial new mechanics , and even little things that add up , like new conditions — there are n’t any of those , either — into the game as a whole .
There ’s only one thing in the PHB 2 that every player and GM needs to think about , remember , or add to their mental store of game rules and exceptions — the Rules Updates appendix , covered later in this article .
Here ’s why that ’s important :
You can add the PHB 2 to your campaign without worrying about plumping up 4e ’s game system with new crunch .
That ’s significant for me because it means that as a GM , I do n’t have to carefully vet a bunch of optional rules , new mechanics , and other changes to the game .
The PHB 2 introduces new classes and support material for those classes — that ’s it .
I like that approach .
Dude , I want to make a [ PHB 2 class ] now .
The PHB 2 is a supplement , and like all supplements — particularly for D&D — it will likely prompt at least some of your players to start thinking , “ Hmm , I ’d really rather be playing one of these classes … ”
My take ?
That ’s just fine .
( And it ’s inevitable , unless you only play games after they go out of print . )
At the end of the day , what ’s more important :
The campaign plans you ’ve made around the current party ( which will change if a new PC is introduced , creating more work for you ) , or your players having fun ?
Right — the second one .
If one of your players wants to start from scratch with a new PC because she just picked up the PHB 2 , let her .
Work together to incorporate the new PC into the campaign , come up with compelling reasons for the old PC ’s departure and the new character ’s arrival , and generally collaborate to make the process as smooth as possible .
Personally , I have n’t found this to be a huge problem in my campaigns .
If a player is n’t sufficiently invested in his current PC , then something is already wrong — and a fresh start might be just the fix he needs .
Similarly , a player who loves her current character is n’t likely to roll up a new one just because more classes become available .
Do you , as a GM , need this book ?
Yep .
The classes in the PHB 2 are so strong that I actually put this book in a different category than most D&D supplements ( from this or previous editions ) : it ’s not really a supplement , it ’s an extension of the core book .
Every class might not be appropriate to your campaign , and therefore might not be essential to you — but enough of them will be appropriate , and because of the importance of classes in 4e , that makes them essential .
Even just looking at two elements — the primal power source and the two new controllers — there ’s enough here to make the PHB 2 “ required reading . ”
Unlike the PHB II for 3rd Edition , which was kind of meh overall , and definitely not essential , the 4th Edition PHB 2 feels like the 200 + pages that did n’t make it into the original PHB for space considerations — I consider it a core book .
New Races
There are five playable races in the PHB 2 : one new one , the deva ( former immortals with connections to their past lives ) , and four re-imagined ones — gnomes , goliaths , half - orcs , and shifters .
Will your players dig them ?
On the whole , yes .
The deva are a cool concept , and the other four races are all welcome additions to 4e .
They all offer good roleplaying hooks , and only the deva and goliaths might not fit into the “ average ” fantasy setting .
They seem slightly weaker than the core races .
My gut instinct is that the PHB 2 races are slightly weaker overall than the races in the PHB .
The deva are a good example .
They get the standard +2/+2 , 6 - square speed , and + 2 to two skills , and their goodies are : one extra language , +1 against attacks by bloodied creatures , necrotic and radiant damage resistance , the “ immortal ” creature origin , and an encounter power that adds +1d6 to the result of a die roll .
In terms of raw power , I ’d take any race from the original PHB over the deva , unless their stat bumps ( Int and Wis ) were just perfect for my class of choice — but the gap is n’t huge .
Still , for a supplement to offer up something slightly weaker than a core book is unusual ; power creep is more the norm .
( We ’ll be coming back to power creep . )
There is one big problem , though …
And I think we can all agree on what it is :
On the right there is a gnome ; the thing on the top and the one on the left are …kender who ’ve been infected with the black oil creature from the X - Files ?
Norfin trolls ?
Or ( as one of my fellow gnomes put it ) anime hairdressers , maybe ?
BAD MOVE , WIZARDS .
Ahem .
Moving on .
Character Options
This is the support chapter — goodies for the aforementioned classes , and a few for other classes , too .
It includes backgrounds , feats , gear , magic items , and rituals .
Backgrounds are a great idea , but …
If you have any players in your group who are relatively new to roleplaying , the PHB 2 ’s backgrounds will come in very handy for them .
For experienced players , they ’re nothing new — but as a GM , I do like them as a sort of shorthand for sketching out a character .
Backgrounds — in the mechanical sense that the term is used in the PHB 2 , not the more general one ( IE , a PC ’s backstory ) — give your players cues about their characters .
They can be used to define a new PC , or to fill out gaps during character creation .
They ’d also be pretty simple to implement in an ongoing campaign , as they can be easily applied to existing PCs .
They ’re broken down into categories — geography , society , birth , etc. — with multiple ideas in each category .
“ Occupation , ” for example , includes artisan , criminal , entertainer , farmer , and so forth .
Once you ’ve chosen your elements , you get one minor mechanical benefit ( like + 2 to a skill ) .
The book suggests choosing one concept from each of three different categories ; again , for a new player that ’s a great way to get started .
So why the “ But… ” ?
Because the mechanical element seems flawed — and like the races , it ’s weaker than the version presented in a previous book .
In this case , that book is the Forgotten Realms Player ’s Guide , which features regional benefits — minor mechanical bonuses granted to PCs based on their home region .
The regional benefits presented in the FRCS are categorically more powerful than the ones in the PHB 2 .
In fact , they usually combine two of the PHB 2 ’s background benefits .
And again , that ’s weird : it ’s the opposite of power creep , and a bit surprising for a supplement .
So …there ’s no power creep ?
Right — zero power creep that I saw .
Adventurer ’s Vault and Martial Power both introduced a bit of power creep , and honestly I half expected to find some in the PHB 2 .
As with class balance , actual play is the only way to really compare the classes , powers , and other elements of the PHB 2 to their previously - published counterparts .
But my power creep radar never went off while reading this book , and the only power changes I could find — in the new races and the background rules — went in the other direction : slightly weaker than their predecessors .
Feats , magic items , and rituals are mostly self - contained .
The vast majority of the feats in the PHB 2 are specific to the classes presented in this book , with a good spread of feats for each class .
There are a handful that can see wider use , though , so if you have a PHB 2 available during character creation , your players will probably want to glance at it no matter what classes they ’re playing .
Ditto with the new magic items : most of them are geared towards the classes in this book , although there is a good amount of spillover into general - use items .
The new rituals are a more even mix of general - use and PHB 2 class - specific — many of them are for bards only .
Between the bard - specific mundane gear ( instruments ) , magic items , and rituals , there ’s quite a bit of support for bards — which is right in line with how much better that class is than previous incarnations .
Appendix : Rules Updates
To close things out , both in the PHB 2 and in this article , we have the Rules Updates appendix .
I cringed , then I relaxed .
When I flipped to this section for the first time , my reaction was , “ Oh , shit , a bunch of stuff has changed already ” — but that was n’t borne out once I started reading .
Heck , the whole section is only 5 1/2 pages long .
The majority of the appendix is given over to a new version of the “ How to Read a Power ” section from the original PHB ; the new version replaces the original text .
It incorporates clarifications and new PHB 2 - related stuff , and again : nothing major .
That ’s followed by an overview of all of the power keywords — from power sources and damage types to effect types — published to date in the PHB , Martial Power , and the PHB 2 .
And last but not least , the Stealth skill has changed somewhat , and the Buff and Perception skills have been updated to match those changes .
This appendix covers fairly small stuff , but it represents an important update to the core rules .
I ’d say every 4e GM should at least glance at this section , and most will likely want to use it as written .
I also do n’t feel that these pages took space away from any of the other , more interesting , sections of the PHB 2 — I ’m glad it ’s here .
Closing Thoughts
This is a good book .
In the PHB 2 ’s intro , WotC calls it “ the most significant expansion yet to the 4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons game , ” and I agree .
What makes it significant is the fact that it introduces a mix of revamped favorite classes ( and races ) and entirely new ones , and does so without any of the problems common to supplements — no shitty classes , no power creep , no balance issues , and no unfortunate mix of useful and useless material .
The new classes look like a lot of fun .
Like I said , I can see trying any of the PHB 2 classes and having a good time with them .
( I ’m working on a D&D character right now — a dwarven fighter — and I ’ve seriously considered scrapping him in favor of a wild magic sorcerer … )
The avenger , warden , invoker , and shaman , in addition to being cool in their own right , are going to become a part of the lore of D&D — just like the sorcerer did in 3rd Edition .

The smart money says yes .
Reader “ Oleg ” directs our attention to the following item from Eurasia .net :
Russia in recent weeks has used its apparent financial clout both to knock an American back out of Kyrgyzstan and to solidify its relationship with Kazakhstan .
But recent economic data suggests that when it comes to assistance to Central Asian states , the Kremlin may be running a geopolitical Ponzi scheme — guaranteeing returns that it will not be able to produce .
So far in 2009 , Moscow has gone about lavishing money on its international friends as if the heady days of high energy prices still existed , and the global financial crunch had never hit .
Even the Kremlin ’s old friend Cuba has been the beneficiary of largesse , receiving $ 354 million in credits recently .
Two of the highest profile outlays involve Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan .
In early February , Bishkek initiated the process of closing down the American air base at Manas following Moscow ’s announcement that it would give Kyrgyzstan $ 2.1 billion in aid .
[ For background see the Eurasia Insight archive ] .
More recently , Russian officials announced that a Kremlin - controlled bank would provide $ 3 billion to Kazakhstan , a large part of which would be used to modernize a coal - fired power plant .
[ For background see the Eurasia Insight archive ] .
The Kremlin has been behaving like a big spender , even though Russia is among the countries hardest hit by the global financial crunch .
[ For background see the Eurasia Insight archive ] .
And the news just keeps getting grimmer for Moscow .
Indeed , Russian government officials recently reported that the state budget is starting to groan under the weight of the country ’s economic burdens .
Russia ’s dependence on energy exports to generate income is the central problem .
For 2009 , state planners had put together a budget based on an oil price of $ 95 per barrel .
But on February 26 , the price of Russian oil was lingering at about half that level .
Adding to the pressure on the budget , state revenue is projected to be 42 percent less than the government had predicted it would be .
At the same time , Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said state expenditures will be substantially higher in 2009 than envisioned , due to increasing outlays to stabilize the shaky economy .
Right now , according to Economic Development Minister Elvira Nabiullina , Russia is projected to experience a 2.2 percent decline in GDP .
But that projection could turn out to be a drastic underestimation , depending in large part on energy prices .
Initial figures for 2009 are turning out to be worse than the government anticipated .
For instance , the government projected the overall decline in industrial production for 2009 to be 7.4 percent , and the annual inflation rate to check in at 14 percent .
But in January , the government reported a 19.9 percent drop in industrial production for the month compared with the total for December 2008 .
What should be the most worrisome sign for the Kremlin is that its cash - reserve fund is evaporating at an alarming rate .
Thanks in large part to several years of sky - high energy prices , Moscow put away 4.7 trillion rubles for rainy - day contingencies .
Amid the deluge that is the current financial crisis , the Kremlin expects to burn through 2.7 trillion rubles of the reserve fund in 2009 .
The fund will run dry in 2010 if Moscow keeps spending at the current pace .
Under the barrage of bad economic news , Russia has seen its creditworthiness sink .
For example , the cost of insuring against a Russian default on its debts has risen to an all - time high , the Financial Times reported February 23 .
Moscow has about $ 500 billion in debts coming due in 2009 .
Although the economic indicators make a convincing argument for fiscal restraint , the attitude of Russia ’s paramount leader , Vladimir Putin , appears to be : “ Damn the torpedoes , full speed ahead . ”
Nothing demonstrates Putin ’s outlook better than his recent comments on military spending .
Over the next three years , Russia has committed $ 4 trillion rubles to modernizing Russia ’s armed forces .
Those modernization programs will proceed , Putin insisted , regardless of Russia ’s fiscal woes .
While the Kremlin seems to be having problems realigning its capabilities with the new economic reality , Russia ’s population appears to be growing increasingly disgruntled .
In one recent survey conducted by the All - Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion , 49 percent of respondents said the Russian government should curtail its assistance commitments to foreign states during the financial crisis , and should instead devote a greater share of state funds to alleviating the crisis - related hardships being endured by Russian citizens .
Central Asian leaders , in particular Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev , who are making bets today that Russia will come to the financial rescue , may end up being sorely disappointed .
Moscow ’s ability to finance long - term projects , such as the construction of hydro - power plants in Central Asia , will be severely tested in the coming years .
Russia ’s days as a creditor nation may well be numbered .
Those Central Asian leaders who banked on Russian help could end up being left to hold an empty bag .
With the " biggest ever " piracy raid in Sweden 's history — taking down a server with " data equivalent to 16,000 movies " — the Swedish Anti-Piracy Agency says they 've killed the source of all The Pirate Bay 's pirated material .

The raid , launched on a server owned by the Nordic file sharing ring Sunnyvale , actually took place during The Pirate Bay trial of the epoch .
The Swedish Anti-Piracy Agency says that by taking down that server , they caused the collapse of the entire 10 - server Sunnyvale ring , which put out about 65 terabytes of pirated goods , from games to TV .
The Anti-Piracy Agency claimed further they the Sunnyvale ring was in fact the source of all of The Pirate Bay 's pirated material .
Uh huh .

TPB 's Peter Sunde says " it is possible that it's a major source " but is also dubious the Sunnyvale ring is the sole source of the material that makes TPB tick , since " more than 800,000 people have uploaded to The Pirate Bay . "
So , uh , who do you believe ?

Trees across the tropics are getting bigger and offering unexpected help in the fight against climate change , scientists have discovered .
A laborious study of the girth of 70,000 trees across Africa has shown that tropical forests are soaking up more carbon dioxide pollution that anybody realised .
Almost one - fifth of our fossil fuel emissions are absorbed by forests across Africa , Amazonia and Asia , the research suggests .
Simon Lewis , a climate expert at the University of Leeds , who led the study , said : " We are receiving a free subsidy from nature .
Tropical forest trees are absorbing about 18 % of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere each year from burning fossil fuels , substantially buffering the rate of change . "
The study measured trees in 79 areas of intact forest across 10 African countries from Liberia to Tanzania , and compared records going back 40 years .
" On average the trees are getting bigger , " Lewis said .
Compared to the 1960s , each hectare of intact African forest has trapped an extra 0.6 tonnes of carbon a year .
Over the world 's tropical forests , this extra " carbon sink " effect adds up to 4.8bn tonnes of CO2 removed each year - close to the total carbon dioxide emissions from the US .
Although individual trees are known to soak up carbon as they photosynthesise and grow , large patches of mature forest were once thought to be carbon neutral , with the carbon absorbed by new trees balanced by that released as old trees die .
A similar project in South America challenged that assumption when it recorded surprise levels of tree growth a decade ago , Lewis said .
His study , published tomorrow in Nature , was to check whether the effect was global .
The discovery suggests that increased CO2 in the atmosphere could fertilise extra growth in the mature forests .
Lewis said : " It 's good news for now but the effect wo n't last forever .
The trees can't keep on getting bigger and bigger . "
Helene Muller - Landau of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Ancon , Panama , said the forests could be growing as they recover from past trauma .
" Tropical forests that we think of as intact [ could have ] suffered major disturbances in the not - too - distant past and are still in the process of growing back . "
Droughts , fire and past human activity could be to blame , she said .
" This recovery process is known as succession and takes hundreds or even thousands of years . "
The research comes as efforts intensify to find a way to include protection for tropical forests in carbon credit schemes , as part of a new global climate deal to replace the Kyoto protocol .
Lee White , Gabon 's chief climate change scientist , who worked on the new study , said : " To get an idea of the value of the sink , the removal of nearly 5bn tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by intact tropical forests should be valued at about £ 13 bn per year . "
David Ritter , senior forest campaigner at Greenpeace UK , said : " This research reveals how these rainforests are providing a huge service to mankind by absorbing carbon dioxide from our factories , power stations and cars .
" The case for forest protection has never been stronger , but we must not allow our politicians to use this as an excuse to avoid sweeping emissions cuts here in the UK . "
As President Bush settles in for his last Christmas in office , he has been busy handing out presents to some of his top aides .
And they are not the kind that require wrapping paper or a bow .
The White House announced on Wednesday the appointments of key members of the president ’s inner circle , including Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez , to high - profile boards and commissions .
The Christmas Eve appointments will allow them to serve far beyond Jan. 20 , the end of Mr. Bush ’s term in office .
The White House said that the positions are unpaid , but appointees receive reimbursement for expenses and per diem compensation .
They do not require Senate confirmation .
Ms. Rice got a spot on the John F. Kennedy Center ’s board of trustees until September 2014 .
The position should guarantee her good seats at the performing arts venue for the next six years ; she is currently an ex-officio member of the board .
Mr. Bush ’s gift to Mr. Gutierrez : membership on the board of trustees of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars , a research institute in Washington .
Joining Mr. Gutierrez as a trustee is Barry Jackson , a former deputy to Karl Rove , who serves as assistant to the president for strategic initiatives and external affairs .
It is not uncommon for presidents to bestow these positions on friends and political allies .
On Wednesday the White House defended the appointments .
“ The president has chosen these individuals because of their high - level work in their respective policy areas , ” said Carlton Carroll , a White House spokesman .
“ Each of them brings unique and valuable experience that will benefit the boards . ”
Maria Cino , a longtime ally of the president who was deputy secretary of the Department of Transportation and helped run the 2008 Republican National Convention , received a four - year term on the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations .
President Bush also extended the same courtesy to Israel Hernandez , who was once a personal aide to Mr. Bush in Texas and now serves as an assistant secretary of commerce and director general of the United States Commercial Service .
The role of the trade policy committee is to provide advice to the United States trade representative .
Other friends and high - dollar Republican donors are getting more than stocking - stuffers from the president this year ; some of them have also been invited to fill spots on these boards .
And the first lady , Laura Bush , appears to be taking care of her own , too .
The president appointed her chief of staff , Anita B. McBride , to a three - year term on the J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board .

That ’s what the poker community has been told about Congressional action regarding the reversal of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act ( UIGEA ) .
This week , it has become much clearer just how soon poker players can expect that action .
“ I expect that we will introduce the legislation in 2 - 3 weeks .
Like last session , we will introduce after [ Congressman Barney Frank ’s legislation ] , ” Mike DeCesare , the chief of staff for Congressman Jim McDermott ( D - WA ) , told Card Player this week .
McDermott has fought for the taxation and regulation of online poker in the past , most notably in a bill he introduced last year , H.R. 6501 .
That bill would ’ve used revenue from the regulation of Internet gambling for job training and opportunities for past foster care participants .
Frank ( D - MA ) , of course , has also been at the heart of the fight for online poker .
He previously introduced the Internet Gambling Regulation and Enforcement Act of 2007 — which would have repealed the UIGEA — but that bill also never made it to the House floor for a vote .
An aide for Congressman Barney Frank ( D - MA ) told Reuters last month that poker players and fans could expect to see action in the near future .
“ The bill introduction should happen in the next month , ” the spokesman said in February .
“ Mr. Frank will bring back legislation to repeal the UIGEA . ”
The UIGEA was passed as a last - minute attachment to the SAFE Port Act in 2006 .
While the law does not criminalize the playing of online poker in the U.S. , it severely hampers the industry because it makes it illegal for banks , credit - card companies , and payment processors like PayPal to transfer funds from potential customers to online casinos , and vice versa .
The Poker Players Alliance was founded in 2005 to protect the rights of poker players , but the non-profit organization has been especially active in the past few months in its fight against the UIGEA .
PPA Chairman Alfonse D’Amato made the case for regulation in an article for the Congressional magazine Roll Call last January , and he sat down with Card Player last month to talk about the PPA ’s future .
Former World Champ Greg Raymer , a patent lawyer and a member of the PPA Board of Directors , has also hit the political trail in defense of the game .
He attended the Conservative Political Action Conference in late February on behalf of the PPA , and has since appeared on Fox Business News to explain why he is — and why most people should be — for the regulation of online poker .

Your Inner Fish * by Neil Shubin
Shubin , a fish paleontologist who discovered a “ missing link ” fossil belonging to a creature making the transition from ocean to land , shows how the basis of our eyes , ears , legs and other body parts are present in much earlier creatures .
Although written for adults , older kids will also find this a quick , lively read , with helpful illustrations .
Also available as an audiobook ( so you can play it in the car to your captive audience ) .
The PBS series Evolution
One of the advantages of watching educational videos with your kids is being able to stop and discuss questions or listen to comments as they come up .
We just borrowed this series from the library and started watching it last week .
So far , it ’s done a good job of explaining Darwin ’s theories on a level that my middle school / high school kids can understand , and of putting them into context .
There ’s also a companion website http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/ with online activities and extra information .
There are more resources , including websites with interactive features , in this article I wrote last year ( since updated ) and at the homeschooling blog Farm School .
Kathy Ceceri also blogs at Home Biology .
If you 're about to invest in a lot of DVDs for your new baby , here 's a way to save some money ; they wo n't help .
Of course , there is some correlation / causation data to classical music but it 's correlation / causation data because parents who listen to classical music and buy it for their kids tend to be better educated and care about their kids ' education , which is reflected in more ways than just music .
But the benefits of making classical music into video has still not been found and a longitudinal study of infants from birth to age 3 showed TV viewing , even of well - meaning music videos , before the age of 2 does not improve a child 's language and visual motor skills , according to research conducted at Children 's Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School .
The findings , published in the March issue of Pediatrics , reaffirm current guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) that recommend no television under the age of 2 , and suggest that maternal , child , and household characteristics are more influential in a child 's cognitive development .
" Contrary to marketing claims and some parents ' perception that television viewing is beneficial to children 's brain development , no evidence of such benefit was found , " says Marie Evans Schmidt , PhD , lead author of the study .
The study analyzed data of 872 children from Project Viva , a prospective cohort study of mothers and their children .
In - person visits with both mothers and infants were performed immediately after birth , at 6 months , and 3 years of age while mothers completed mail - in questionnaires regarding their child 's TV viewing habits when they were 1 and 2 years old .
It was conducted by researchers in the Center on Media and Child Health at Children 's and the Department of Ambulatory Care and Prevention at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care .
The study is the first to investigate the long term associations between infant TV viewing from birth to 2 years old and both language and visual - motor skill test scores at 3 years of age .
These were calculated using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test III ( PPVT III ) and Wide - Range Assessment of Visual Motor Abilities ( WRAVMA ) test .
The PPVT measures receptive vocabulary and is correlated with IQ , while WRAVMA tests for visual motor , visual spatial , and fine motor skills .
The researchers controlled for sociodemographic and environmental factors known to contribute to an infants ' cognitive development , including mother 's age , education , household income , marital status , parity , and postpartum depression , and the child 's gender , race , birth weight , body mass index , and sleep habits .
Using linear regression models , the researchers equalized the influences of each of these factors and calculated the independent effects of TV viewing on the cognitive development of infants .
Once these influences were factored out , associations in the raw data between increased infant TV viewing and poorer cognitive outcomes disappeared .
" In this study , TV viewing in itself did not have measurable effects on cognition , " adds Schmidt .
" TV viewing is perhaps best viewed as a marker for a host of other environmental and familial influences , which may themselves be detrimental to cognitive development . "
While the study showed that increased infant TV exposure is of no benefit to cognitive development , it was also found to be of no detriment .
The overall effects of increased TV viewing time were neutral .
TV and video content was not measured , however , only the amount of time exposed .
The researchers acknowledge follow - up studies need to be done , and they are quick to warn parents and pediatricians that the body of research evidence suggests TV viewing under the age of 2 does more harm than good .
" TV exposure in infants has been associated with increased risk of obesity , attention problems , and decreased sleep quality , " adds Michael Rich , MD , MPH , the pediatrician who directs the Center on Media and Child Health and contributing author on this study and the current AAP Guidelines .
" Parents need to understand that infants and toddlers do not learn or benefit in any way from viewing TV at an early age . "

According to Wall Street Journal , IBM is seriously preparing for the Sun acquisition and the IBM experts already analyse all the documentation in the company .
IBM allegedly try to clearly understand the complex cross-license agreements that Sun has with third parties , and also they are “ digging deeply ” in Sun accountings for the third fiscal quarter .
There is no expectations that Sun revision results may affect on IBM ’s decision for acquiring the company , regardless of the fiscal situation or the current contracts .
Although in the second fiscal quarter , Sun ended with 11 % decline in revenue compared to the same period last year , and compared to the previous quarter this results were not so bad .
IBM reportedly considering the price of 6.5 to 8 billion dollars for Sun Microsystems .

Advertisement Archaeologists believe they have unearthed the remains of Shakespeare 's first theatre , the BBC has learned .
A team from the Museum of London found the remains of the theatre in Shoreditch last summer .
Built in 1576 , it is thought the Bard acted there and that it also hosted the premiere of Romeo and Juliet .
Meanwhile , a portrait of Shakespeare , thought to be the only surviving image of him made during his lifetime , has been unveiled in London .
Taryn Nixon , from the Museum of London , said her team had found part of the original curved wall of the playhouse , which was believed to be polygonal in shape .
A metre and a half below street level , it has also uncovered the gravel surface , gently sloping down towards the stage , where the bulk of the audience would have stood .
But the archaeologists fear the stage itself may be buried underneath a housing development .
Ms Nixon told the BBC the theatre was built in what were known as " the suburbs of sin " just outside the city .
" The Lord Mayor actually passed a decree that there should n't be any theatrical performances in the city ... so just on the edge of the city is actually , classically , where you find all the slightly wilder , slightly more fun activities going on , " she said .
Finds made within the gravel yard include a fragment of 16th - century pottery featuring the image of a man with beard and ruff .
Relocated
The theatre was constructed by James Burbage , possibly using bricks from an old priory .
There was a huge appetite for theatre at the time
Penny Tuerk
Tower Theatre Company
Shakespeare 's theatre unearthed
It is thought to have played host to Shakespeare 's theatre company , the Chamberlain 's Men .
About 25 years after it was built , it was dismantled and moved timber by timber to construct the Globe Theatre on the South Bank of the Thames .
In the 1990s the Globe was recreated on a site nearby .
Penny Tuerk , from the Tower Theatre Company , said Romeo and Juliet and an early version of Hamlet were thought to have been performed at the excavated site , as were some of Shakespeare 's comedies , like A Midsummer Night 's Dream .
" There was a huge appetite for theatre at the time , " she said .
" People were flocking into the theatres and they would have grabbed anything that they could and put it on to please the crowds . "
Portrait
The site is now owned by the Tower Theatre Company .
It plans to preserve the architecture in situ and construct a new playhouse around it which will open in 2012 .
The painting of Shakespeare is thought to date from 1610 Ms Tuerk said it would be a 21st Century equivalent of the original playhouse - a " no frills , hard - working place of entertainment " - that would bring London theatre " back to its roots " .
" Imagine actors in the future crossing the theatre and perhaps paying homage to Shakespeare as they go on stage for luck , " she added .
Elsewhere on Monday , Professor Stanley Wells , chairman of The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust , unveiled a newly identified portrait of the Bard .
The picture is owned by art restorer Alec Cobbe and is believed to have been painted in 1610 , six years before the playwright 's death at the age of 52 .
There has long been controversy over the accuracy of some representations of him and many have been discredited in recent years .
Most experts generally agree that the most accurate posthumously made depictions are a bust in Holy Trinity Church in Stratford - upon - Avon and an engraving made for the title page of the first collected edition of his work .
The portrait will go on display to the public in Stratford - upon - Avon on 23 April , Shakespeare 's birthday .

We may have liked the premiere episode of the new NBC alternate reality drama Kings , but sadly we were in the minority .
The show 's ratings were , apparently , almost Biblically bad .

Ian McShane Has A Promising Reign
In Kings Last night , NBC debuted it 's modern - day monarchy series , with a dash of David and Goliath , Kings . …

Kings ' Sunday bow had what the Hollywood Reporter calls " a devastating premiere , " coming in as the lowest rated network show not just in its own timeslot , but for the entire night between 8 and 11 pm ; only six million viewers watched Ian McShane 's debut turn as America 's King Silas , all but guaranteeing that it'll disappear sooner rather than later .
Maybe they should move it to Fridays ; six million would 've made it the fourth highest rated show of the evening last weekend .

In a paper published in Nature scientists announced the discovery of the world ’s largest snake , a prehistoric beast which preyed on giant turtles and crocodile - like reptiles in South America after the demise of the dinosaurs .
As amazing as the discovery is , its greatest importance may be the clues it provides conservationists about the future of tropical forests under various global warming scenarios .
“ At its greatest width , the snake would have come up to about your hips , ” David Polly said , Indiana University Bloomington geologist .
“ The size is pretty amazing .
But our team went a step further and asked , how warm would the Earth have to be to support a body of this size ? ”
Polly ’s question was important for several reasons .
First , fossils in tropical forests are extremely rare due to the lack of bare rock : the snake , christened titanoboa , was found in a coal mine .
It is one of the very few fossils from that period in South America .
This artist ’s rendering of Titanoboa cerrejonensis demonstrates the great snake ’s size .
It is anticipated the boa spent much of its life in or near water .
Picture by : Jason Bourque , University of Florida .
“ Until now , tropical South America ’s dense forest prevented discovery of fossil vertebrates found between 55 and 65 million years ago , so this discovery gives us a very unique and important glimpse into the past , ” Jonathan Bloch said , a vertebrate paleontologist who helped lead the expedition .
Secondly , using the measurements of the titanoboa , the scientists were able to draw conclusions about the environment in South America 60 million years ago .
Cold - blooded animals , like snakes , are limited in body size by the average temperatures of where they live .
The hotter the ecosystem , the larger a reptile could grow .
“ If you look at cold - blooded animals and their distribution on the planet today , the large ones are in the tropics , where it ’s hottest , and they become smaller the farther away they are from the equator , ” Bloch said .
Considering the titanoboa was twice the size of today ’s largest snake , the anaconda , the scientists estimated that the average temperature of its ecosystem would have been about 91 degrees Fahrenheit , 10 degrees warmer than the tropical forests which cover South America today .
“ This temperature estimate is much hotter than modern temperatures in tropical rainforests anywhere in the world , ” said Carlos Jaramillo , a paleobotanist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute .
“ The fossil floras that the Smithsonian has been collecting in Cerrejon for many years indicate that the area was a tropical rainforest .
That means that tropical rainforests could exist at temperatures 3 - 4 degrees Celsius hotter than modern tropical rainforests experience . ”
Such a discovery may have widespread implications as scientist attempt to predict how tropical forests will change in face of global warming .
Many have feared the forest would become savannah due to higher temperatures , but if the climate of 60 million years ago is any indication some of tropical plants could survive temperature increases .
“ These data challenge the view that tropical vegetation lives near its climatic optimum , and it has profound implications in understanding the effect of current global warming on tropical plants , ” Jaramillo said .
At a symposium last month preeminent tropical biologist , Joseph Wright , said that he believed climate change was the gravest threat to tropical forest .
He warned that global warming would create a “ novel environment ” in the tropics , adding that scientists “ have no way to predict what it will look like ” .
The discovery of the long - extinct colossal snake may be the beginning of accurate predictions .

[ Haskell - cafe ] Haskell Logo Voting will start soon !
Hi there !
It 's been quiet for a while around the ' new logo ' competition , but here is how it is going to work :
The list with options can be found here ( for now ) : http://community.haskell.org/~eelco/poll.html
Notice that some ( very ) similar logos are grouped as one option ( thanks to Ian Lynagh )
All submissions compete , so that still makes more than a 100 options !
The voting system we 'll use is the Condorcet Internet Voting System ( http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/civs.html ) .
The poll wo n't be public , but every subscriber to Haskell - Cafe will get a ( private ) voting ballot by email .
The poll will ( probably ) start March 16 and run for about a week ( do n't worry , there will be a strict deadline communicated ) .
When the poll is over , the results will be viewable by everybody .
The CIVS allows easy grouping and ordering , so the task of ordering 100 options should be doable within 5 - 10 minutes .
If you 're in a hurry you can do it a lot faster , just pick your favorite and put it first .
If you want to learn more about condorcet voting , the CIVS site and Wikipedia are your friends .
I 'll supervise the poll and make sure it 's started , stopped and all Haskell - Cafe subscribers get a ballot ( Simon Marlow provided the email addresses ) .
Since I 'm going on a ( probably internet deprived ) holiday for a week _and_ to make sure I have n't overlooked anything , I 'm announcing it now but wo n't start the poll till March 16 .
Of course , I 'd love to hear about anything that I missed and / or that might influence the voting process in a significant way .
( There are probably some people subscribed with multiple addresses , but I 'll be using the subscriber list from yesterday , so signing up now with lots of addresses wo n't get you more ballots ;) -- Regards , Eelco Lempsink

( After you read this article , consider using our free Keyword List Generator to build large lists of target keywords and / or negative keywords . )
Every search engine advertiser should be using negative keywords in their Pay Per Click ( PPC ) campaigns and / or Ad Groups .
Negative keywords are words and phrases that you do not want searchers to associate with your products and services ( see Google ’s AdWords blog for some high - level information about negative keywords ) .
When you add negative keywords to your PPC campaigns your ads will not be served if those words are part of the user ’s search query .
Not only does this benefit you by directly saving money on wasted clicks , it also improves the click through rate ( CTR ) of your keywords / ads , which helps improve your ad quality scores in Google , Yahoo , and MSN .
Improved quality scores can help you with bidding strategies by allowing you to bid less than a competitor ( who is not as knowledgeable , skilled intelligent , talented , sophisticated , etc. as you are ) , and maintain high / higher ad positions on a search results page .
Over my 6 + years managing Pay Per Click campaigns , I have built up a list of negative keywords that are useful when conducting B2B PPC campaigns ( I am providing some of my list only :) ) .
This list is by no means exhaustive , and each company has its own unique market positioning .
So , do not use this list of negative keywords indiscriminately !!!
The list of B2B negative keywords below is meant to be a resource for you , and a starting point when you are deciding which words you do not want associated with your ads .

No Bargains
These negative keywords will help if you are positioned as a premium provider .
If you do want visitors for these keyword concepts , create an additional campaign or ad group to focus on these discount concepts , and specifically bid on keywords that contain these words .
And then make sure to add this list of negative keywords to the campaigns or ad groups that do not target the discount audience :

It ’s a good idea to screen out this audience if you do not cater to it :
craft
crafts
create
creating
hand made
handmade
home

Selling Commercial Software
This is a tricky one .
If you are a company selling commercial or enterprise software , a ) you are likely to want to avoid the thousands of software developers who are looking for free resources , and b ) you want to avoid confusion with consumers looking for tools and home - use products .

Product Materials
Obviously not all of these materials will apply to one business .
I created this list of product materials as a reminder to screen out searches for product types that a company does not offer .
One might wonder if it is OK to not screen for these in the hopes that someone will search for one type of product , but be convinced to buy a different type once they see what is available .
Most B2B marketers have limited PPC budgets , so usually it is a better idea to only show your ads to people who do n’t have a specific alternative to your products already in mind :
aluminum
ceramic
cotton
fabric
glass
gold
iron
leather
metal
paper
plastic
rubber
silver
stainless steel
steel
stone
vinyl
wood
Legal / Law
It is probably a good idea to prevent your ads from being shown to people looking for information related to legislation and regulations .
There will be cases where this might not apply , especially if your product / service solves a regulatory / compliance issue ( and if you have a landing page on your site that speaks to the legal issue AND provides a conversion action right there on the page ) :
act
act of
compliance
law

Security researcher Charlie Miller , who last year won $ 10,000 for hacking into a MacBook Air via Safari in just two minutes , says he thinks Safari will be the first browser to fall at this year 's Pwn2 Own contest .
" It might be because I 'm biased about the things I 'm good at , but it 's the easiest browser [ to hack ] , " Miller told Computerworld this week .
The Pwn2Own contest this year will pit hackers against a MacBook running Mac OS X with Safari and Firefox installed , as well as a Sony Vaio P running Windows 7 and IE8 , Firefox , and Chrome installed .
The browsers are intended to be the target vector to launch exploit code that will " pwn " the machines and earn $ 5,000 for each browser that is exploited .
" Apple 's products are really friendly to users , and Safari is designed to handle anything , including all kinds of file formats , " said Miller .
" With a lot of functionality comes the increased chance of bugs .
The more complex software is , the less secure it is . "
Miller believes that the other browsers wo n't be hacked , based on his experience .
" They make it so hard that , for me , $ 5,000 is n't motivation enough to try to break one of those guys , " he said .
We doubt that five grand is so unappealing to others that are more familiar with those browsers , but if Miller 's prediction proves true , I can only hope Apple has plans to strengthen security in Snow Leopard .
Miller also plans to attempt to hack into the mobile platforms , which are also offered as bait to hackers at this year 's contest — and offering a sweeter pot of $ 10,000 each .
He did n't specify if he was going after the iPhone specifically , but he was one of the first to discover a vulnerability in Mobile Safari shortly after the iPhone was launched in 2007 .

GameStop ( GME ) shares are getting clobbered today on news that Amazon.com ( AMZN ) is getting into the business of buying and selling used video games - and so is Toys 'R Us .
Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter explained in a research note today that one reason he has maintained an Outperform rating on GME shares is that the company has dominated the used video game business ; he notes that used games generate 44 % of the retailer 's gross profits , nearly twice the segment 's sales contribution to the company .
Over the last several days , he reports , there have been two attacks on the company 's near monopoly in used games .
On Tuesday , Forbes reported that Toys 'R Us has a pilot program to test the sale of used games in some of its U.S. stores ; Forbes noted that the program was first reported in the user forums of a web site called cheapassgamer.com .
Other retailers , including Best Buy ( BBY ) and Blockbuster ( BBI ) , have previously experimented in the segment , but have n't made much of a dent .
More worrisome for the industry , though , is the entry of Amazon into the business .
UBS analyst Benjamin Schachter notes today that select games in good condition can be shipped to Amazon for free , with trade - in value deposited into the customer 's account .
Anyone who trades in games prior to March 19 will get 10 % off a game or accessory purchase through Amazon .
Balter notes that Amazon seems to be offering to pay about 10 % more for used games than GameStop pays .
Amazon is offering to buy your copy of Tiger Woods PGA Tour '09 for Playstation 3 for $ 20 .
All done with Metroid Prime 3 : Corruption for the Wii ?
Amazon will give you $ 10.50 for it .
Finshed up Gears of War for the Xbox 360 ?
Amazon will pay you $ 7 for it .
Balter thinks the market may be over - reacting here ; he says Amazon 's move should n't have a big impact on earnings near term .
Longer - term , he thinks downloadable games are a bigger threat .
" While there is no doubt that the Amazon news is disconcerting and shakes some of the eroding confidence in the story , the stock at $ 23 seems to discount that already , " he says , " and given the earnings power we still see a trade to the low $ 30s . "
GME today is down $ 4.07 , or 14.9 % , to $ 23.23 .
I 'd note that this is n't necessarily great news for the video game publishers , either ; they now get to compete on Amazon against used versions of their own games .
WASHINGTON --
The travel industry is taking aim at Democrats ' efforts to limit luxury travel by companies that accept government bailouts with a new advertising campaign that says the attacks on travel are costing jobs .
One of four print ads in the campaign includes a photograph of the back of President Barack Obama 's head , superimposed over an empty stadium .
" Imagine holding a convention and no one showed up , " the headline says .
" Until political conventions are held via conference call , we should n't expect business to do ...

In a phone call back to the New York Times , President Barack Obama explained that he is not a socialist , and that his administration is behaving in a market based way , which he added is more than the people who are calling him a socialist have done in the past .
Here is the audio of the call :
Advertisements
Obama called the paper to clarify why he did n’t answer a question about Republicans calling him a socialist .
He said that he did n’t think that the reporter was serious about the question .
I found it most interesting that Obama took a shot at the previous Republican leadership by saying , “ It was n’t under me that we started buying a whole bunch of shares in banks .
It was n’t on my watch , and it was n’t on my watch that we passed a massive new entitlement , the prescription drug plan , without a source of funding .
It is important just to note when you start hearing folks throw these words around that we have actually been operating in a way that is entirely consistent with free market principles , and that some of the same folks who are throwing the word socialist around ca n’t say the same thing . ”
Obama did decline to mention Bush by name , and he also said that his actions in the crisis have nothing to do with his ideological preferences , and more to do with the current situation .
Obama is more than correct in pointing out that these same Republicans who passed the prescription drug benefit are now calling Obama a socialist .
I do n’t know how much mileage Obama will get out of blaming the Republicans for this mess .
I think he has about a year before people will expect things to get better .
Nobody except the die hard right wingers believes that Obama is a socialist .
In contrast to what Republicans are trying to spread , Obama has acted in line with market principles .
He is refusing to nationalize the banks , even though most Americans are in favor of it .
He is demanding more corporate accountability in return for federal bailout money .
The socialist tag is just another attempt at a political buzzword to scare support away from the Democratic Party .
I highly doubt that this strategy will be effective .

The U.S. Army is to invest $ 6 million in riot equipment , a fact that has furthered fears that troops will be used inside the U.S. in order to quell any civil unrest resulting from the ongoing economic crisis .
The U.S. Army Contracting Agency , based at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , has a post on the Federal Business Opportunities website , requesting the equipment and has received several notices of interest from potential vendors .
The request titled “ 84 –RIOT EQUIPMENT ” outlines the need for hard polyethylene Shin and Chest Guards , shock absorbing Forearm Protectors , Interior leg brace supports as well as knee and ankle protectors .
The ACA asks that the equipment be able to “ safely withstand a substantial blow … from non-ballistic weapons or flying debris ” .
The Solicitation also states :
The associated North American Industrial Classification System ( NAICS ) code for this procurement is 453998 with a small business size standard of $ 6 M .
This requirement is a [ Small Business ] set - aside and only qualified offerors may submit bids .
Interested vendors include Irish Brigade inc. , manufacturers of hunting and safety gear with facilities located in the heart of Kansas City , Missouri .
Federal and Military resource company MCLEARVISION , LLC is another interested party , as is Kentucky based U. S. CAVALRY STORE , INC .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In our article yesterday we highlighted the fact that Urban warfare training drills are taking place across the country as top analysts as well as officials predict a potential “ summer of rage ” across Europe and America as civil unrest from the economic fallout builds .
Are such drills really for the purpose of preparing troops for foreign combat zones ?
Undoubtedly – but other factors indicate that the drills may very well also be aimed at preparing troops for dealing with mass civil unrest as the economic crisis worsens .
There ’s no question that U.S. authorities have been closely observing riots that have toppled governments in Iceland and Latvia and also threatened to do so in several other European countries .
The fact that they have contingency plans in place to deal with such scenarios should they unfold in America can not be disputed .
Indeed , before a media exposé forced them into a denial , Northcom revealed that one of the duties of at least 20,000 active duty troops that are being placed inside the United States would be dealing with “ civil unrest and crowd control ” .
The U.S. Army War College in November released a white paper called Known Unknowns : Unconventional ‘ Strategic Shocks ’ in Defense Strategy Development .
The report warned that the military must be prepared for a “ violent , strategic dislocation inside the United States , ” which could be provoked by “ unforeseen economic collapse , ” “ purposeful domestic resistance , ” “ pervasive public health emergencies ” or “ loss of functioning political and legal order . ”
The “ widespread civil violence , ” the document said , “ would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security . ”

Advertisement Business Secretary Lord Mandelson has had green custard thrown over him by a protester as he arrived at the launch of a low - carbon summit in London .
The protester , Leila Deen , is a member of the Plane Stupid group campaigning against a third runway at Heathrow .
The move was a " last resort " after the democratic process failed , she said .
Lord Mandelson said security was a police matter but he did not want to " go back " to the 24 - hour protection he had when Northern Ireland Secretary .
The business secretary said people should not " over - react " to the incident .
Lord Mandelson stressed that he had chosen not to continue with " round the clock " protection - which he is entitled to as a former Northern Ireland secretary - and he hoped this would not now be necessary .
No complaint has been made about the incident and no action taken against Ms Deen .
But former deputy prime minister John Prescott , who threw a punch at a protester who had thrown an egg at him in 2001 , said it was " totally unacceptable " that Ms Deen had been able to walk away after the incident without being arrested .
Speaking on the video sharing site You Tube , he said the protester could have thrown acid not custard and public figures had a right to go about their business without being attacked .

' Adolescent protest '
Ms Deen , 29 , from Brighton , told the BBC that she had informed Lord Mandelson that the substance involved was custard before throwing it .
She said Lord Mandelson was an unelected politician and he was siding with the " interests of business " rather than the " interests of the people and the planet " in backing the new runway .
I suppose in a democracy people are entitled to have their say but I would rather people said it to my face rather than throw it
Lord Mandelson
Brown calls for ' green new deal '
The government approved a new runway last month despite opposition by MPs , local residents and green campaigners .
She justified the " direct action " as the best way of bringing about change , claiming she and others were excluded from the democratic process .
" When democracy is failing you have to resort to any means necessary as long as it is peaceful and does not harm other human beings , " she said .
She added : " Peter Mandelson is the same person who effectively bullied Ed Miliband and other members of the cabinet to accept a third runway that nobody wants , a third runway that no one was consulted on and no one is able to say no to .
" It 's not right that someone like Peter Mandelson can stand up and talk about being green . "
Ms Deen , who works for anti-poverty charity World Development Movement , denied indulging in " childish " stunts and hit back at criticism of her e-mailed in by BBC viewers .
" You can talk about me being a yuppie , I am no such thing , I 've got a very normal background , " she told BBC News , saying the protest was " a light hearted way of making a very serious point " .

Ms Deen was arrested in 2005 after she climbed up a 150ft crane in Edinburgh to draw attention to third world debt and government aid policies during the G8 summit at Gleneagles .
Lord Mandelson dismissed the protest as a " crude " stunt but said he was grateful that the substance concerned was not " nastier " .
He rejected Ms Deen 's claims about the third runway , saying he was accountable to Parliament , and said the incident had merely brought attention to the UK 's need for a greener economy .
" I suppose in a democracy people are entitled to have their say but I would rather people said it to my face rather than throw it , " he joked .
He added : " I am prepared to take my fair share of the green revolution on my shoulders but I am less keen on having it in my face . "
Prime Minister Gordon Brown sought to make light of the incident , saying it demonstrated the " greening " of his business secretary .
" If anyone doubted Peter Mandelson 's willingness to take the green agenda on his shoulders we have seen it in practice on our television screens this morning , " he said .
The Conservatives said the incident did not " advance the cause " of environmental campaigners and they should seek to influence the democratic process in other ways .
Green summit Ms Deen and other activists disrupted a speech by Transport Secretary Geoff Hoon at the same London venue on Thursday by honking horns .
Plane Stupid has launched a series of protests against a new runway at Heathrow , including scaling the roof of Parliament and blocking the runway at Stansted .
The decision to build a new runway remains hugely controversial with opponents set to mount a legal challenge to try and block it .

The government won a vote on the issue in Parliament after making a number of concessions on the number of new flights and the type of aircraft which will be allowed to use the runway .
Gordon Brown attended Friday 's summit , organised to look at ways in which the UK can develop jobs and business in environmental industries .
He called for an international " green new deal " to boost the environmental sector and help lift the global economy out of recession .
The government wants to turn the UK into a world leader in green industries of the future , with the aim of reducing carbon emissions by 80 % by the year 2050 .

The following appeal was issued on 29 December 2008 :
The Palestinian Federation of Unions of University Professors and Employees condemns in the strongest possible terms the bombing today of the campus of the Islamic University in Gaza .
This wanton destruction of an academic institution is only the latest in the ongoing lethal campaign launched by the Israeli government and army against Palestinian society in the Gaza Strip .
This murderous rampage has caused more than 300 deaths and the injury of close to 1,500 Palestinians .
And the carnage continues with impunity .
We add our voice to the urgent appeal issued two days ago by the Palestinian Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions National Committee ( BNC ) urging international civil society not just to protest and condemn Israel ’s massacre in Gaza , but also to join and intensify the international boycott , divestment and sanctions ( BDS ) campaign against Israel to end its impunity and to hold it accountable for its persistent violations of international law and Palestinian rights .
We agree that , without sustained , effective pressure by people of conscience the world over , Israel will continue with its gradual , rolling acts of genocide against the Palestinians , burying any prospects for a just peace under the blood and rubble of Gaza , Nablus and Jerusalem .
Today , at the height of the lethal Israeli assault against the Palestinian people in Gaza , we are met with deafening silence emanating from the Israeli academy .
Does it condone the murderous bombing campaign that its government is carrying out in the name of all Israelis ?
Are the members of the academy dutifully preparing for the reserve call - up just approved by their government , ready to serve in the death squads committing war crimes around the clock ?
Are Israeli universities willing to call for an end to the occupation ?
Are they going to cut their organic and deep - rooted ties with the military - security establishment ?
There is no doubt that the aggression against the Gaza Strip has reached horrendous proportions , described by many international public figures as constituting war crimes and a continuation of the ethnic cleansing unleashed 60 years ago .
We urge academics around the world to intensify their boycott of Israeli academic institutions , and to isolate the Israeli academy in international forums , associations of academics , and other international venues .
Israeli academic institutions are complicit in the entrenched system of oppression practiced by the Israeli state , and their silence at this critical moment is only the most vociferous indicator of this complicity .

The budget that President Obama proposed on Thursday is nothing less than an attempt to end a three - decade era of economic policy dominated by the ideas of Ronald Reagan and his supporters .
The Obama budget — a bold , even radical departure from recent history , wrapped in bureaucratic formality and statistical tables — would sharply raise taxes on the rich , beyond where Bill Clinton had raised them .
It would reduce taxes for everyone else , to a lower point than they were under either Mr. Clinton or George W. Bush .
And it would lay the groundwork for sweeping changes in health care and education , among other areas .
More than anything else , the proposals seek to reverse the rapid increase in economic inequality over the last 30 years .
They do so first by rewriting the tax code and , over the longer term , by trying to solve some big causes of the middle - class income slowdown , like high medical costs and slowing educational gains .
After Mr. Obama spent much of his first five weeks in office responding to the financial crisis , his budget effectively tried to reclaim momentum for the priorities on which he campaigned .

Raymond Masucci
As the site for New York City ’s first free - standing wind - power generating turbine , Staten Island is logical enough in its way .
The buildings there are relatively low , and it has plenty of unobstructed shoreline and hills from which to grab wind coming off the water .
As such , the borough ’s vast , dormant landfill , Fresh Kills , has long been named as a possible site for a wind farm .
Last August , the borough president , James P. Molinaro , proposed such an operation , with seven turbines mounted on 400 - foot towers .
It would generate enough electricity , he said , to power 5,000 homes .
But the Fresh Kills proposal , should it come to pass , would not have the first wind turbines in the city , or even on Staten Island .
That honor — for free - standing windmills , anyway , connected to the city ’s power grid with Con Edison ’s permission — goes to a much smaller project , in a muddy corner of a half - built 55 - and - over condominium project on the island ’s southwest shore by the Outerbridge Crossing .
That is where Ray Masucci , the developer behind the Tides at Charleston , has erected a turbine on a 45 - foot - tall tower to run the community ’s streetlights and sewage system .
I paid it a visit for this Sunday ’s Dispatches feature in The City section .
The turbine , the existence of which was first reported in The Staten Island Advance , was approved by Con Edison for connection with the local power grid on Feb. 9 , said Margarett Jolly , a spokeswoman for the utility .
It was erected simultaneously with — but approved just before — a set of roof - mounted turbines at an apartment building in the South Bronx , Ms. Jolly said .
Some wiggle room is necessary to call the Staten Island turbine the first of its kind in the city .
Ms. Jolly said that for reasons of safety and grid stability , Con Edison must be notified , and its approval sought , whenever wind power is used at a building or operation that is also connected to Con Edison ’s power .
Still , she said , not everyone remembers to ask .
Moreover , there are cases in which permission is not necessary , such as where the turbine is part of a closed system , disconnected from the grid , as with a Ricoh billboard in Times Square that is being powered entirely by wind and the sun .
Finally , there are cases like that of the rooftop turbine in the East Village , erected in the 1970s atop a reclaimed gutted tenement building and later connected to the grid without Con Edison ’s permission .
It generated modest power before it broke in a hurricane and was later dismantled .
At any rate , Ms. Jolly said Mr. Masucci ’s turbine was the first and only free - standing turbine in the city , as far as Con Edison knows .
All that being said , it is something to see .
It is made of lightweight molded fiberglass , aluminum and plastic , and it rotates on its own to point in the right direction , away from the wind .
On a gusty day , of which Mr. Masucci said there are many on the southwestern edge of the island , it emits a quiet whining sound as its blades spin .
If the wind is too high and the turbine starts to spin too fast , it shuts down automatically before restarting later .
Mr. Masucci , who is now an authorized distributor for the turbine ’s manufacturer , Southwest Power , is hoping to sell similar models to businesses and private homes in the area .
Ms. Jolly said that for Con Edison ’s part , the utility has overcome much of its initial uneasiness about wind turbines connecting to the grid .
It is now commonplace , she said , for them to be fitted with bidirectional meters , which allow them to feed surplus energy into the larger system , essentially selling it back to the power company .
Even though small turbines , like those in Staten Island and the Bronx , do not put much wattage into the grid , there were still some worries at Con Edison about the process disrupting the system .
“ We ’ve been cautious and have been looking at them case by case , ” Ms. Jolly said .
Still , she added , now that the utility has had more experience with the technology : “ We ’re more comfortable now with what it is and is n’t .
Up to a certain threshold , we ’ve done some studies that say we ’re O.K . ”
Last month , Capt .
Chesley “ Sully ” Sullenberger ( a fine graduate of my alma mater , the USAF Academy ) took a very courageous stand in his testimony before Congress following the “ Miracle on the Hudson . ”
Sully told of the worsening conditions in the airline industry in regard to compensation and retention .
One of the most cogent comments he made was “ I do not know a single pilot who would counsel their children to choose a profession in the airline industry . ”
Let me relay my own story and relate it to the tapestry Sully weaves .
Four years ago , I retired several years early from a profession I loved and in which I had spent my entire working life .
The last 20 years of my career , I held increasing levels of responsibility and loved the people and challenges of the airline industry .
Early retirement for me was a very tough choice , but one made only for economic reasons …
I fully expected my airline to declare chapter 11 ( they did ) and cancel my pension ( they did ) .
The pilots doing the same job today are making roughly 50 % of what I did due to pay , benefit , and work rule changes .
They are still making a decent living , but at a far lower rate than before .
At my airline , over 1,500 very experienced captains took early retirement in the years preceding the bankruptcy , many seeking to preserve a portion of their pension by retiring early – a huge loss of experience and this at just one airline !
Reaching the pinnacle of an airline pilot ’s career requires many years of preparation .
While gaining experience and ratings , pay and working conditions are sub-par .
The time and commitment required is akin to a doctor who finishes medical school and then spends many more years in specialty training .
Then , when reaching the top of one ’s career , the rules change and the economic model is completely rewritten .
This is the state of our industry today .
These changes have affected not only our pilot population , but all those who support the operation – mechanics , gate agents , flight attendants , etc .
In many ways , the glory is gone and it has become “ just a job ” to many people .
I share this situation to make the case that Sully is right , that young people choosing a profession today are less and less attracted to the future they see in the aviation .
In some ways , this is a national crisis that has been years in the making and will only come to fruition some years in the future when pilots and other specialists become scarce .
The law of supply and demand dictates that scarcity will force improvements in conditions , but not if there are less experienced pilots willing to take the jobs formerly held by pilots with much greater experience .
This was the point Sully was trying to make …we have to deal with today ’s issues before they become tomorrow ’s crisis .
There are many ways to obtain flying experience , and no one of these is the “ right ” way .
But , there is no substitute for experience in the cockpit to enhance safety and prepare one for the unexpected emergency such as Sully and his crew faced .
We may be producing pilots but not nearly enough pilots with the robust training and background necessary to obtain the highest levels of competence in the cockpit .
Lest I seem all doom and gloom , there are solutions to these problems .
The beginning of solving any problem is awareness , and we ’ll talk in future blogs about steps we can take now to avoid a crisis of experience later .
Fly Safely ,
Captain Alan W. Price

Since Secretary of State Clinton set out for the Middle East over the weekend , it has seemed increasingly clear to me that Dennis Ross , contrary to my earlier speculation , pretty much got the job that he and WINEP were hoping for .
Not only has he claimed an office on the coveted seventh floor , but Obamaâ€™s conspicuous placement of Rossâ€™ name between those of Mitchell and Holbrooke in his speech on Iraq at Camp Lejeune last week strongly suggested that he considers
Ross to be of the same rank and importance as the other two .
More to the point is what Clinton and those around her have been saying during the trip , including , most remarkably , the report by an unnamed â€œsenior State Department officialâ€ that she told the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) that she was â€œvery doubtfulâ€ that diplomacy would persuade Iran to abandon its alleged quest for nuclear weapons .
This , of course , very much reflects Rossâ€™ own view ( as well that of neo - conservatives ) and will no doubt bolster hard - liners in Tehran who believe that Obamaâ€™s talk of engagement is simply designed to marshal more international support for eventual military action , be it a bombing campaign or a blockade to cut gasoline imports .
That Obama essentially confirmed todayâ€™s New York Times report about a proposed deal with Moscow whereby it would go along with increasing sanctions against Iran in exchange for Washingtonâ €™s non-deployment of anti-missile defenses in Poland and the Czech Republic only adds to the impression that some version of the Bipartisan Policy Centerâ€™s September â€˜08 report on Iran strategy ( drafted by hard - line neo-cons Michael Rubin and Michael Makovsky and signed by Ross ) , which I wrote about here , is in the process of being implemented .
( I was going to write about this later this week , but the Moon of Alabama beat me to the punch .
See also Stephen Waltâ€™s analysis of Clintonâ€™s scepticism on his Foreign Policy blog ) .
Adding to my growing sense that Ross occupies a critical role in policy - making , at least in the State Department , are what Clinton has had to say so far on her trip about Gaza , Hamas , and the Palestinian Authority .
As Marc Lynch reports in his truly excellent blog , also on the Foreign Policy website , â€œher remarks suggest that rather than seize on the possibility of Palestinian reconciliation , Clinton prefers to double - down on the shopworn â€ ˜West Bank first , Fatah onlyâ€™ policyâ€ strongly advocated by Ross .
In that respect , you should definitely read Tuesdayâ€™s extended colloquy between Lynch , Brookingsâ€™ Tamara Wittes ( who is more optimistic ) , and Carnegieâ€™s Nathan Brown , who shares Lynchâ€™s â€œdisappointmentâ€ about Clintonâ€™s performance .
As Lynch notes , it seems that Clinton is stuck â€ œin a bit of time - warpâ€  regarding Hamasâ€™ power in Gaza , the Palestinian Authorityâ€™s abject failure to enhance its legitimacy , and the Arab Leagueâ€™s renewed efforts to both unify itself and to reconstruct a Palestinian government of national unity .
This insensitivity to Palestinian and Arab public opinion bears all the hallmarks of Rossâ€™ failed Mideast diplomacy during the 1990â€™s .
I also have the impression that Ross and the so - called â€ œIsrael Lobbyâ€ whose interests he represents believe that enhancing conditions on the West Bank , combined with diplomatic engagement with Syria , will somehow be sufficient for Washington to regain its credibility in the region and rally the Sunni Arab states â€ ” along with the European Union , Russia , China , etc. â€ ” behind a policy of confrontation with Iran .
( CNN ) -- Rush Limbaugh brought a cheering crowd to its feet several times Saturday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington as he called on fellow conservatives to take back the country .
Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh energizes crowd of supporters in CPAC keynote speech .
" We conservatives have not done a good enough job of just laying out basically who we are , because we make the mistake of assuming that people know .
What they know is largely incorrect , based on the way we 're portrayed in pop culture , in the drive - by media , by the Democrat party , " the conservative talk show host told a mostly young crowd of energized supporters .
" We want every American to be the best he or she chooses to be .
We recognize that we are all individuals .
We love and revere our founding documents , the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence .
We believe that the preamble of the Constitution contains an inarguable truth , that we are all endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights , among them life , liberty , freedom -- and the pursuit of happiness , " he said , pausing several times for enthusiastic applause .
Looking ahead to the 2012 election , Limbaugh said conservatives will have to choose the right candidate to take the country back .
Limbaugh 's impassioned keynote speech , punctuated by chest - thumping , fist - pumping and chants of " USA " from the crowd , capped off three days of talk at CPAC focusing on rebuilding the Republican Party .
" He played to his crowd here , " CNN political editor Mark Preston said .
" And this crowd is now energized , something we have n't seen from Republicans , certainly not conservatives , since the November election . "
Limbaugh used his self - described " first national address , " which ran more than an hour longer than his allotted 20 minutes , to accuse President Obama of inspiring fear in Americans in order to push a liberal agenda of " big government . "
" He wants people in fear , angst and crisis , fearing the worst each and every day , because that clears the decks for President Obama and his pals to come in with the answers , which are abject failures , historically shown and demonstrated .
Does n't matter .
They 'll have control of it when it 's all over .
And that 's what they want , " Limbaugh said .
" They see these inequalities , these inequities that capitalism produces .
How do they try to fix it ?
Do they try to elevate those at the bottom ?
No , they try to tear down the people at the top . "
Limbaugh praised Obama as one of the most gifted politicians he has seen , but said , " It just breaks my heart that he does not use these extraordinary talents and gifts to motivate and inspire the American people to be the best they can be .
He 's doing just the opposite . "
Limbaugh also dismissed the notion of bipartisanship as a " false premise " given the diverging views of the Democratic and Republican Parties on a variety of issues , including the recent $ 787 stimulus package signed by Obama .
" Bipartisanship occurs only after one other result .
And that is victory , " he said .
Watch Limbaugh discuss bipartisanship »
" What [ Democrats ] mean is we check our core principles at the door , come in , let them run the show , and then agree with them , " he said .
Limbaugh 's rollicking speech came the day after Obama supporters put out a political ad implying that the conservative radio host has become the de facto head of the Republican Party in the absence of a clear GOP leader .
The ad argues that the Republican leadership in Congress is following Limbaugh 's lead in opposing the Obama administration 's stimulus package .
" So who are Republican leaders listening to ? " the announcer asks , before the 30 - second ad cuts abruptly to footage of Limbaugh saying , " I want him [ Obama ] to fail . "
It was paid for by Americans United for Change and the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees union , two groups that supported Obama during the election and are advocating for his agenda .
Limbaugh does n't speak for all Republicans or conservatives .
Copies of the American Conservative magazine with the headline " How radio wrecks the right " were distributed to CPAC attendees , Preston said .
" There is some criticism of Rush Limbaugh .
Some people think he is a reactionary , " Preston said .
Limbaugh defended his remark about wanting Obama to fail , comparing it to his desire to see the Arizona Cardinals " fail " in this year 's Super Bowl game against the Pittsburgh Steelers .

" This notion that I want the president to fail , folks , this shows you a sign of the problem we 've got , " he said .
" What is so strange about being honest and saying , I want Barack Obama to fail if his mission is to restructure and reform this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation ?
Why would I want that to succeed ? " he said , bringing the crowd once again to its feet .
" Did the Democrats want the war in Iraq to fail ?
Well , they certainly did .
And they not only wanted the war in Iraq to fail , they proclaimed it a failure . "

Almost all the newest hardware coming out has Linux support .
The critical mass has been reached , and it 's time everyone tried Ubuntu .
Every so often I take a stab at Linux , to see exactly what I like and do not like about the OS .
Many of its problems , for me , stem from its inability to run on my overloaded hardware , or the occasional driver that makes the OS impossible to use without hand - tweaking something or other .
That said , I seriously like the Ubuntu 8.10 implementation and will now install it permanently on my latest machines .
It 's a winner .
This OS has a lot of nice features , and it 's quick .
It 's freely downloadable all over the net as a ISO disk image , too .
Go to the official Web site for a download link .
Ubuntu is particularly cool because the install version is also a " live " version , meaning that you can boot it and run it from a CD without installing the OS at all .
More important , it 's a fully functional live CD , meaning that it can save and load files from drive C : or a NAS .
When I encountered a glitch , I changed to a safe graphics mode that limited my screen to 1,280 - by - 1,024 rather than 1,600 - by - 1,200  but this was no big deal .
While your PC is running Ubuntu as a live install , the CD is doing all the work for the OS , and even so , it 's at least as snappy as Windows .
Install it onto the hard disk as the OS for the system and the thing really flies .
I 'm not sure how many legacy old clunkers can run this operating system , but it 's the perfect reinstall for older machines that bog down under Windows .
The live feature is what it makes it so cool ; no need to install the OS before thoroughly testing it .
For lightweight work , the install disk comes with Firefox for Linux and AbiWord , a credible open - source substitute for MS Word .
In fact , there is probably a Linux program that will substitute for just about any Windows programs with as much or more functionality with the exception of Adobe Photoshop .
That said , there are plenty of photo editors for Linux .
The popular GIMP app comes to mind .
While the various Linux desktops generally are n't as polished as Vista , they are functional and easily as slick as Windows 2000 , the OS most observers think was the best Microsoft ever did .
In many instances the complexity of Linux turns out to be smoothed over by the Ubuntu architecture .
It 's so good that I 'm a little annoyed with myself for not getting to it sooner .
And I sure do n't want to hear " I told you so ! " from all the Linux mavens .
I 'm in the process of putting together a new Atom - based mini-ITX machine ( with an Intel D945 GCLF2 motherboard ) for use as a Web browser in the kitchen .
This OS would be ideal if for no other reason than the fact that I wo n't have to worry about anyone in the family fooling around online and getting the little machine clogged with viruses and Trojan horses .
I seriously appreciate the fact that Linux is mostly immune from malware , in much the same way as the Macintosh .
I had a small machine in the kitchen running Windows , and every time I ran a scan on the thing I kept discovering too many problems .
I know that if Linux becomes too popular , the malware will come .
But for now it 's rare a good thing as far as I am concerned .
I 'm tired of dealing with Windows malware , patch Tuesday , and the never - ending deterioration of the OS as it clogs up like a drain in a greasy - spoon restaurant .
I can't take it anymore .
And there 's something else that always bugs me about Windows .
I have an iMac that I use at the office , and a few times every month Apple has some patch that it sends out .
With few exceptions , each time a patch is installed with the Mac OS , the performance of the machine improves .
With Windows , the performance always declines .
I do n't think Microsoft has ever sent out a patch that improved the performance of the machine .
Ever .
And of course , the biggest differences between Ubuntu and Windows are the cost and the subsequent headaches , because Microsoft is constantly fretting over bootleg copies .
The company monitors machines to make sure they are running legal copies of software .
There have already been instances of computers shut down by Microsoft HQ because of some glitch in the cloud .
This is simply unacceptable .
I do n't want to rely on a system like that .
I cannot wean myself off Windows altogether because , well , I write about Windows .
But for ancillary machines that I put together where I need reliability and low price , I 'm always going to see whether Ubuntu works .
And if it does , that 's what gets installed .
If I had a small or mid-size company , I 'd probably use only Linux and open - source software , just to stay out of the way of the software police and their onerous " audits " another abhorrent situation that , to me , is intolerable .
You should also note that almost all of the newest hardware coming out has Linux support .
The critical mass has been reached .
Go download Ubuntu 8.10 and see for yourself what the fuss is about .
You wo n't regret it .

Its not good , raw meat is crawling with bacteria which can transmit a number of very unhappy illnesses to you from simple food poisoning to e coli infections .
Theres stuff like bacillus cereus which causes diarrhea and vomiting , campylobacter jejuni which causes diarrhea and severe fever , listereria , shigella , and staphlococcus which can be extremely serious , even fatal ( and all cause diarrhea ) .
When the FDA inspects food , it does so to ensure standards which will result in safe food ONLY IF THE FOOD IS COOKED .... if not , you have no clue what yorue eating ...
Basically unless you 're looking to miss work for a few weeks some pretty painful illnesses ( almost all which induce severe diarrhea ) , cook that bacon .
it can still be a delicious treat .
Demanding an end to military action in Gaza , eight to 10 Jewish activists chained themselves this morning to the Israeli Consulate building on Wilshire Boulevard .
Other activists who were not chained to the building walked in a circle outside the consulate , chanting : " Let Gaza live !
End the siege now . "
One of the signs they carried read : " The Israeli consulate has been closed for war crimes . "
Hannah Howard , a spokeswoman for the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network , which is conducting the protest , said demonstrators chained themselves to the front steps of the building at 8:30 a.m. and that two others blocked the walkway .
Several more stood in front of the driveway on Wilshire Boulevard to prevent cars from entering and exiting .
About 50 protesters participated in the demonstration , she said .
“ Jews will not allow the violence that is being done in our name to continue , " Howard said .
" Not all Jews are united in support of Israel .
We [ also ] recognized the humanitarian crisis in Palestine . ”
The consulate is on the 17th floor of the building at 6380 Wilshire Boulevard , and many other businesses have offices inside .
Updated , 5:11 p.m. : Authorities said demonstrators who chained themselves outside the Israeli Consulate ended their protest peacefully about noon , according to LAPD Sgt. Ronnie Crump .
Event organizers were told by police officers that demonstrators could be arrested , because it was against the law to block the entrances of buildings .
Shortly after that , demonstrators ended their protest , Crump said .
" It ended peacefully and quietly , " he said of the protest 's conclusion .
No arrest were made at the demonstration .

The ideas of Karl Marx - - that class society creates great wealth for the few at the expense of the many -- ring truer every day .
Brian Jones examines
Marx 's revolutionary ideas in this first of three articles .
IN THE last 150 years of U.S. history , you can't point to a generation whose most active , radical layers have not been drawn to the ideas of Karl Marx .
This was true of the abolitionist movement ( Marxist immigrants even fought with the Northern Army in the Civil War ) , the early pioneers of our labor movement , the hundreds of thousands ( if not millions ) who passed through Socialist and Communist Parties in the first half of the 20th century , and of the many thousands who joined the Black Panther Party and other parties that declared themselves against capitalism and in favor of socialism in the late 1960s and early 1970s .
Millions of people around the world have sought , from the Marxist tradition , a way to win a different kind of society free of poverty , oppression and war .
That rather hopeful premise -- that a different kind of world is actually possible -- goes a long way toward explaining how it could be that the only book that can compete ( in terms of paid sales ) with the Bible is the Communist Manifesto .
It was that project -- the fight for a better world -- that motivated Marx .
At his funeral , Marx 's lifelong collaborator and closest friend , Frederick Engels , said of him : " Marx was before all else a revolutionist .
His real mission in life was to contribute , in one way or another , to the overthrow of capitalist society and of the state institutions which it had brought into being ... Fighting was his element .
And he fought with a passion , a tenacity and a success such as few could rival . "
But when you try to go out and learn something about Marx , you will quickly discover that it is precisely this tenacious revolutionism that is discarded by mainstream treatments of him .
" Marx had good ideas , " they want you to believe , " but do n't try to put them into practice . "
Or , as another twist on the same idea : " He was good at analyzing the problems of capitalism , but obviously wrong about the solution . "
Time magazine recently published a feature article , " Rethinking Marx " ( interestingly , it was available only in Britain ) , with essentially the same thesis :
Series Marx is back SocialistWorker.org columnist Brian Jones introduces the ideas of Karl Marx and his contribution to the socialist tradition .
The return of Marx
Marx becomes a Marxist
Marx ’s vision of socialism
Marx 's utopian predictions about revolution and the triumph of socialism were dead wrong ; indeed , many of the policies carried out in his name in the 20th century brought misery to millions in countries ranging from Russia to China , and including large chunks of Africa .
Yet ... if you leave aside the prophetic , prescriptive parts of Marx 's writings , there 's a trenchant diagnosis of the underlying problems of a market economy that is surprisingly relevant even today ... He was moved by glaring inequalities between rich and poor that are more topical than ever today ...
In short , Marx painted a picture of the capitalism 's excesses , but forget trying to replace it .
Replacing capitalism , Time magazine warns , leads straight to Stalin 's prison labor camps .
Time wants us to " leave aside the prescriptive parts , " which is like going to the doctor for a diagnosis , but not for a cure .
MARX HAD a peculiar problem : People formed groups under his name -- but Marx actually had fundamental disagreements with their ideas .
" I , at least , " Marx was fond of joking , " am not a Marxist ... God save me from my friends ! "
In hindsight , it 's not too hard to see that figures like Stalin and Mao were precisely the sort Marx had in mind .
So what were Marx 's real ideas ?
Let 's start with what Marx actually said about capitalism -- the diagnosis .
Of course , the occasion for Time magazine 's feature article -- and this talk -- is the current global economic crisis .
The free market , touted as the best way to run the world , is currently in free fall .
Not only is the market apparently " broken " as an instrument for spreading wealth , it seems apparent to millions ( if not billions at this point ) that it was never intended to spread wealth in the first place .
New York Gov. David Paterson is making cuts in education and health care to fill a budget hole ( for 2009 - 2010 ) of about $ 15 billion .
He 's planning to cut funding for Head Start , Medicare and food stamps , for example .
Meanwhile , total Wall Street bonuses for 2008 ended up totaling $ 18.4 billion .
Merrill Lynch alone handed out $ 4 billion in bonuses to top executives before going belly up .
We could easily spend a whole evening imagining the miracles we could work if that kind of money were directed to social needs .
People who were hailed for decades as geniuses and heroes , are today exposed as frauds , liars and thieves .
But none of the gurus of free - market capitalism were praised to the heavens like Alan Greenspan .
Greenspan was the former head of the Federal Reserve , and he was one of those who supported getting rid of the regulations on Wall Street so that the free market could work its magic .
In his recent congressional testimony , though , he admitted that he found a " flaw " in his free - market model .
REP .
HENRY WAXMAN : In other words , you found that your view of the world , your ideology , was not right , it was not working ?
ALAN GREENSPAN : That is -- precisely .
No , that 's precisely the reason I was shocked , because I had been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well .
This should be called " The Madoff Defense " :
Your honor , with all due respect , my house of cards did stand for almost 40 years .
Yes , Greenspan found a flaw .
Shocking .
Now , it turns out that about 160 years ago , Marx also found a flaw with capitalism .
The flaw is related to what makes capitalism so dynamic in the first place , which is the fact that
[t ] he bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production , and thereby the relations of production , and with them the whole relations of society ...
All fixed , fast - frozen relations ... are swept away ... before they can ossify .
All that is solid melts into air ...
Capitalism is driven forward by relentless competition , and in an incredibly short time ( historically speaking ) , this new system has generated an immense output of wealth :
The bourgeoisie , during its rule of scarce one hundred years , has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together ... machinery , application of chemistry to industry and agriculture , steam - navigation , railways , electric telegraphs , clearing of whole continents for cultivation ... what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labor ?
But the flaw is that all of production is unplanned .
So the system has released this relentless innovative energy , but it 's out of human control , and every so many years , there 's a crisis .
Modern bourgeois society ... a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange , is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells ...
It is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put the existence of the entire bourgeois society on trial , each time more threateningly ...
There was a time , long ago , when people starved because there was not enough food .
Food was under - produced .
Along comes capitalism , and people starve because there 's too much food !
There 's also too many cars , too many TVs , too many basketballs ... capitalism 's competitive production for profit , means there 's too many of everything , and inevitably therefore , a crisis .
In these crises , there breaks out an epidemic that , in all earlier epochs , would have seemed an absurdity -- the epidemic of overproduction .
Society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism ; it appears as if a famine , a universal war of devastation , had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence ; industry and commerce seem to be destroyed ; and why ?
Because there is too much civilization , too much means of subsistence , too much industry , too much commerce .
And to what do we owe the honor of our current economic catastrophe ?
Too many houses !
Not too many houses to house people .
Not too many for the millions of homeless .
Only too many to be sold at a profit .
So houses must sit empty , people must be thrown out of work ( 2 million people were laid off in just the last four months ) , stores , factories and offices must be closed , it seems that a " universal war of devastation " is taking place -- all so that the free market can repair itself .
BUT EVEN without this flaw , even without overproduction , in " ordinary " times , even in a boom , great wealth and great poverty are two sides of the same capitalist coin .
How did rich people become rich , anyway ?
Are they rich because they 're so thrifty ?
Are they just more hardworking ?
No , it 's not just that some happen to be rich and others by chance are poor .
Under capitalism , people are rich because others are poor .
They 're rich because they exploit our labor -- but it 's not obvious how that happens .
In ancient Egypt , if you were a slave , they said to you , " Good morning , you 're going to build that pyramid over there until you die .
And no , we 're not going to give you anything in return .
Get started . "
If you were a peasant in the Middle Ages , the king would send a tax collector who would say , " Oh , what a wonderful crop you 've grown !
We 'll take half .
Good job . "
It 's obvious that they 're stealing from you in those systems .
In capitalism , however , it 's not as obvious .
Capitalists buy and then sell things to make a profit .
But it 's not just a question of marking up the price in between .
You could n't build a whole society on just marking up everything .
All the markups would cancel each other out .
Wealth has to be created somehow .
The capitalists buy a lot of things -- raw materials , machinery , buildings and labor .
Then they turn around and sell a product , hopefully for more than they paid for all of those ingredients .
The trick is that one of those ingredients is different from the others , one of them is special : labor .
As Paul D'Amato put it in The Meaning of Marxism :
It is , Marx noted , a " good piece of luck " that labor 's use is greater than " what the capitalist pays for that use . "
The value of labor power -- that is , wages -- is less than the value of output that this labor can produce .
Put another way , workers produce enough value to cover the cost of their wages ... in just part of the working day .
The labor performed for the rest of the working day does not have to be paid for -- it is " surplus labor , " which produces " surplus value , " and therefore when the product is sold , this unpaid portion goes into the pocket of the capitalists .
That our wages are calculated as an hourly payment hides the fact that for part of every working day , the boss is actually getting something for nothing .
Ultimately , that 's why capitalism creates such disparities of wealth - - it 's a system where a few people exploit the labor of many .
For a moment , though , leave aside the exploitation .
Leave aside the endemic poverty , leave aside the cyclical crises .
There remains the fact that capitalism perverts human nature .
Marx called this perversion " alienation . "
What does this mean ?
Keep in mind that creative , social labor is what makes us human in the first place -- work , in other words .
Under capitalism , however , we do n't have any real control over our work .
So the very thing that makes us human , is the thing this system takes from us .
In Marx 's words :
What constitutes the alienation of labor ?
Firstly , the fact that labor is external to the worker -- i.e. , does not belong to his essential being ; that he , therefore , does not confirm himself in his work , but denies himself , feels miserable and not happy , does not develop free mental and physical energy , but mortifies his flesh and ruins his mind .
Hence , the worker feels himself only when he is not working ; when he is working , he does not feel himself .
He is at home when he is not working , and not at home when he is working .
His labor is , therefore , not voluntary but forced , it is forced labor .
It is , therefore , not the satisfaction of a need but a mere means to satisfy needs outside itself .
Its alien character is clearly demonstrated by the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists , it is shunned like the plague .
Imagine a bird that hates to fly , or a fish that loathes nothing more than swimming , and you have an idea of just what kind of alienated creatures we are , living under a system that makes us hate working .
That 's a super - brief sketch of what Marx had to say about capitalism 's crises , about surplus value and about alienation .
The name or term Thrust refers to more than one character or idea .

Thrust is a loud - mouthed braggart who will claim victory before he 's even taken the field .
The other Decepticons have learned there 's no being sneaky when he 's around .
He tries to terrify and demoralize the enemy with loud rumbling roars from his engines and boasts from his vocal circuits .
The truth is that Thrust is mostly bluster with little to back it up .
Any sort of strong resistance can send him flying back the way he came .

Fiction
Marvel Comics continuity
Note : Events from the UK - only comic stories are in italics .
Thrust served Lord Straxus on Cybertron , operating out of the massive tower Darkmount in Polyhex .
He was one of the elite warriors targeted by the Wreckers in Operation : Volcano , but narrowly avoided his fate after a call from Megatron summoned the Decepticons away from the lure Impactor and his team had put out .
Target 2006
As Megatron and Straxus began a partnership to share resources between Earth and Cybertron , Thrust was reformatted and sent to Earth along with Ramjet and Dirge to supervise a massive drilling operation designed to suck the power out of Hoover Dam .
Their operation was invaded by the Aerialbots , but Thrust turned his disruptor engines on Skydive , forcing him to ground .
Still , the Autobots outnumbered the Seekers and soon forced them into retreat .
Aerialbots over America !
Soon after , Thrust joined Bombshell in attempting to hijack a shipment of fuel that G.B. Blackrock was delivering to the Autobots .
They managed to overcome Jazz and Jetfire , sparking off a chemical fire that could have polluted the whole area .
The realisation gave Jetfire enough motivation to take out both Decepticons single - handed and they fled the scene while he was extinguishing the fire .
The Gift
Thrust and his comrades began working on Earth full - time afterwards , first for Megatron , then Shockwave , and finally Ratbat .
He participated in an ill - fated raid on a fleshling oil tanker alongside Ramjet , Vortex and the Insecticons .
The heist went off without a hitch ... except that the tanker had already emptied its cargo .
Not the Decepticons ' finest moment .
Buster Witwicky and the Car Wash of Doom
He was among the Decepticons present when Galvatron attacked their new underwater headquarters , and was none too impressed with how Shockwave handled things , it seemed .

Later , he was part of the Decepticons ' major assault on the Autobots on the surface of the Moon .
He was disabled ( and seemingly exploded ) due to a blast from Blaster 's electro - scrambler gun during the battle .
Totaled !
Thrust was glimpsed later , however , transporting humans to the Decepticons ' holiday resort .
Club Con !
Earthforce
Note :
These stories do not fit into the normal Marvel continuity .
See Earthforce for details .
With Soundwave in command , Thrust joined a massive Decepticon offensive against the Autobot Earthbase .
Their goal was to kill some Autobots , while also distracting them as Starscream looted a human oil tanker in the Gulf of Mexico .
Both goals proved fruitless , and the Decepticons were driven off .
Divide and Conquer !
Note : First depicted rather late in the series , it is unknown whether Thrust served Megatron or Shockwave before the coup merged the Decepticon factions .
Marvel UK future timelines
By 2008 , Thrust had risen in the Decepticon ranks to become leader of his own albeit unidentified team .
At Soundwave 's command , he led them to a planned assault on the Autobots , only to be intercepted by Quintesson shock troopers and Trident assault craft .
The Decepticons were forced to join forces with their Autobot opponents in order to chase the Quintessons off Cybertron .
Thrust was last seen pursuing the remaining Quint ships as they fled atmosphere .
Space Pirates !
Classics
More than fifteen years after he was last seen , Thrust was the last Decepticon of Megatron 's fallen warriors to be rebuilt .
[ 1 ]
Some believe that this had something to do with why Thrust defected to Bludgeon 's command .
Thrust was later assigned to work with the mysterious Bug Bite on Earth along with Dirge and several others .

The Transformers cartoon continuity
Voice actor : Ed Gilbert ( US ) , ? ( Japan )
When the mighty Autobot Dinobots relocated to the time - displaced prehistoric Dinobot Island , Thrust was one of several Decepticon warriors who accompanied Megatron to the island in the hopes of exploiting the island 's vast energy resources .
After the Dinobots made their presence known , Thrust stood by to guard the energon cubes while Megatron conspired to eliminate their adversaries .
Dinobot Island , Part 1
When the Dinobots later convinced the native Dinosaurs to attack the Decepticons , Thrust and Ramjet were trampled in a stampede .
Ouchies .
Dinobot Island , Part 2
After Megatron successfully took control of Central City by manipulating his ally Shawn Berger and the other humans , Thrust was tasked with capturing the escaped human slave Chip Chase .
He chased the human into the Autobot base and seemingly prevented Chip from saving the Autobots from a collision course into the sun by destroying Teletraan I , but actually unwittingly saved his enemies by shutting off the autopilot that was navigating their doomed ship .
Thrust attempted to crush Chip before securing him in his jet cockpit and returning the human to the power plant , where he had his afterburner handed to him by the Autobots .
Megatron 's Master Plan , Part 2
Unlike virtually every other Decepticon in existence , Thrust seemed to possess no dreams of personal power .
After uncovering a secret supply of the element electrum , which made him invincible , Thrust ran right to Megatron and informed him of the pool instead of using it for his own gain .
Maybe he 's just too stupid to dream of greater glory .
It has happened before .
The Golden Lagoon
Thrust 's cowardice was legendary among the Decepticons , and they frequently had to put him in his place whenever his bluster became too unbearable .
He was particularly insipid on one occasion when he , Starscream and Astrotrain came to Saturn 's moon of Titan hunting the Autobot Cosmos .
When Astrotrain took advantage of the superstitious locals to force them into serving him as " greatest of the Sky Gods " , Thrust quickly fell into the role of lackey instead of challenging Astrotrain like Starscream did .
Later , when the Autobots Jazz and Perceptor arrived and engaged the two Seekers , Thrust was quick to flee rather than face even odds in battle .
Finally , when the Autobots ' transport Omega Supreme was repaired , Thrust voiced the Decepticons ' slim chances at survival and they beat a hasty retreat .
Not an unreasonable course of action , really -- it seems a coward is a useful point of view to consult during warfare .
The God Gambit
Of course , Thrust also is n't much of a people person either .
Megatron once gave him the simple task of explaining to the Insecticons that the Autobots had acquired some robotic insecticide to use against them , and that they were to stay clear of the battle until Megatron and his Decepticons could destroy the weapon .
Megatron actually planned to hoard the insecticide as a failsafe for himself , naturally , but he did n't tell Thrust that .
The Conehead 's delivery of the message lacked the slightest trace of sincerity , and the Insecticons flew off that very instant to intercept the Decepticons .
A future in politics , Thrust does not have .
Quest for Survival
During the Decepticons ' attack on Autobot City in 2005 , Thrust had the distinction of being the first Decepticon to be run over by Optimus Prime .
After the battle , he carried Shrapnel onto Astrotrain .
He was later part of the Decepticon armada defending Cybertron against Unicron 's onslaught .
He , Ramjet and Dirge flew into the chaos bringer 's mouth , which closed on and destroyed the trio .
Ouch .

Thrust was one of many Decepticon warriors who joined Shockwave in the assault on Iacon shortly after Optimus Prime rose to power .
The War Within
He was relatively loyal to Shockwave , and served under the one - eyed tactician during the Dark Ages when Megatron was AWOL , and then again after the Nemesis vanished in deep space .
The War Within : The Dark Ages
After the Great Shutdown , Thrust continued serving under Shockwave 's command on Cybertron , after the Autobots and Decepticons unified their efforts to control the planet and consolidate on energon reserves .
He was one of a select group of Decepticons chosen by Ultra Magnus to be " rehabilitated " , and operated under the Autobot 's direction when they traveled to Earth to collect the Ark and Nemesis ' crews .
Brothers ' Burden After the Autobots uncovered Shockwave 's malevolent plans for the future , the war began anew and Thrust fled to the wastelands with a small contingent of Shockwave 's forces .
They were assimilated into Megatron 's command once the great Decepticon leader returned with the Predacons and imposed his will on Shockwave .

Though he was eager to join the fight , Thrust was instead put in charge of the hidden Decepticon command bunker for two purposes .
First , to alert Megatron of the reborn threat of Thunderwing .
Second , to destroy the bunker , leaving no trace of their presence .
Thrust presumingly did both as Darkwing told Dreadwind that they were picking the seeker up before leaving the planet .

Left & right fists , 2 missile launchers , 2 small & 2 large " air to air missiles " , left & right wings , left & right tail fins , front landing gear
( 1985 , 2001 , 2004 )
The Generation One Thrust toy is a retool of the original Starscream , who was originally a Diaclone " Jet Robo Acrobat - Type " F - 15 Eagle .
His central F - 15 body is unchanged , but he has new wings with ducted VTOL fans , and new rear stabilizers .
Unlike his 1985 mold - mates Dirge and Ramjet , Thrust retained the original launchers , null - ray lasers and cluster bombs projectiles used in Starscream , Thundercracker and Skywarp .
In robot mode his official instructions have the user pulling down his nose cone to complete his head transformation , like Starscream .
However , Thrust 's television incarnation ( like Ramjet and Dirge ) depicts him as having his head untransformed , giving a distinctive ' conehead ' shape .
This has led many owners to do the same thing , differentiating the three later Decepticon jets from the three earlier ones .

As with most Classics toys , he features a heat - sensitive rubsign rather than a tampographed faction symbol .
Of note is the fact that each of the three BotCon Seekers had part of their original stickers drawn on them .
In Thrust 's case , these were the tops of the front - side parts of the jet and the arrows on his feet .
There were 1500 Classics Thrust figures produced .
A factory error put the new wings ' screw - holes on the top ; Fun Publications added a set of small decals to the head of the screws to hide them .
This mold was also used to make his fellow BotCon exclusive Dirge .
The original version of this mold was used to make Classics Starscream and Skywarp , Timelines Thundercracker , and Universe Acid Storm and Starscream .
Universe ( 2008 )
Aerial Rivals ( multi- pack , 2008 )
A redeco of the Cybertron Legends - class Starscream , Thrust transforms into a Cybertronic " tetrajet " .
His wings , which end up on his arms in robot mode , each feature a swing - out weapon ; the right arm has a blade , while the left has a ( non-firing ) cannon .
He was only available in a Target - exclusive five - pack with Air Raid , Blades , Skydive and Ramjet ( who shares his mold ) .
This mold was also used to make Cybertron Skywarp , Universe Ramjet , and Cybertron Sunstorm .

Thrust and his BotCon counterpart are a retool of the Classics Ramjet toy , transforming into a modified F - 15 with VTOL wings .
His spring - loaded missile launchers can mount under his wings , on his forearms , or serve as hand - held weapons .
Gentei !
Thrust has newly - molded wings with peg holes on the top and bottom of the front wings , and a peg holes on the bottom of the rear wings .
The VTOL thrusters are now detachable , have fans that can be spun by hand , and can be placed in any of the peg holes .
The mold has also been tweaked to allow the wings to be folded downwards for a more cartoon accurate root form ( incorrectly called " robot form " by the fandom , see the episode " The Autobot Run " ) .
Gentei !
Thrust does n't seem to have the same assembly problems as the Henkei !
Skywarp and Thundercracker did .
Although the lightning - bolt patterns on his wings are an odd choice .

Thrust is a repaint of his Gentei !
Gentei ! mold in darker shades of brown and with a yellow canopy .
His paint applications are simpler than his Henkei !
version , though he retains the stripes on the sides of his tailfins ( albeit replacing red with dark brown ) and the chrome on the inside of his cockpit .
Interestingly , the wings are attached with the circular protrusions facing upwards , in contrast to the Henkei ! version 's facing downwards .
Unfortunately , the wings are manufactured no longer bend backwards .
However , two minutes with the roto - tool of your choice applied to the necessary corners of the wing brackets with a steady hand will sort that problem right out .

Thrust 's distinctive wings and he has the proper null rays , different then Dirge and Ramjet's .
Notes
Thrust is one of the few Decepticons from the Generation One cartoon who did n't have red eyes .
He had yellow eyes instead , presumably because he was a complete and utter coward .

Thrust is one of the only modern Hasbro - produced figures to have label stickers .
Although all the Decepticon Jets were based around the same toy model , Thrust along with Dirge and Ramjet are typically depicted with their vehicular nosecones integrated into their humanoid forms , leading to their fan - derived Coneheads appellation .
Large Solar Thermal Electric Plant In Spain
The largest solar thermal plant in the world is now operational in Spain .
( thanks " Fat Man " for the heads - up )
The salts a mixture of sodium and potassium nitrate , otherwise used as fertilizers allow enough of the sun 's heat to be stored that the power plant can pump out electricity for nearly eight hours after the sun starts to set .
" It 's enough for 7.5 hours to produce energy with full capacity of 50 megawatts , " says Sven Moormann , a spokesman for Solar Millennium , AG , the German solar company that developed the Andasol plant .
" The hours of production are nearly double [ those of a solar - thermal ] power plant without storage and we have the possibility to plan our electricity production . "
7.5 hours is long enough to provide peak electric power during the peak late afternoon and evening hours of a very hot summer day .
The article says this is the first heat storage facility for a concentrated solar facility on this scale .
So we need to wait and see how well it works in practice .
The $ 380 million cost for a 50 MW facility sounds pretty pricey to me , especially since this is n't 50 MW of 24x7 power .
Maybe someone else can make better sense of this SciAm article than I can .
They quote only a doubling in electricity cost for electricity from this method as compared to coal .
How can solar thermal ( i.e. concentrated solar ) cost twice as much as coal regardless of whether molten salt storage is used ?
All told , that means thermal energy storage at Andasol 1 or power plants like it costs roughly $ 50 per kilowatt - hour to install , according to NREL 's Glatzmaier .
But it does n't add much to the cost of the resulting electricity because it allows the turbines to be generating for longer periods and those costs can be spread out over more hours of electricity production .
Electricity from a solar - thermal power plant costs roughly 13 cents a kilowatt - hour , according to Glatzmaier , both with and without molten salt storage systems .
Coal electric with no conventional pollutant emissions would cost more .
Add in the cost of carbon capture and then nuclear power becomes cheaper than coal .
Concentrating solar is n't going to compete with coal all that much .
Nuclear , geothermal , and ( with limits ) wind are the real competitors to coal because coal is a base load source of electric power .
Solar is n't for base load .
That price is still nearly twice as much as electricity from a coal - fired power plant the current cheapest generation option if environmental costs are not taken into account .
But Arizona 's APS and others can then use solar energy to meet the maximum electricity demand later in the day .
" Our peak demand [ for electricity ] is later in the evening , once solar production is trailing off , " Lockwood says .
That 's " the reason we went that direction and are so interested in storage technology . "
This is the big reason why concentrating solar might have a big future regardless of what happens with photovoltaic prices .
The heat generated by concentrating the light is a lot easier to store than electricity .
Concentrating solar with salt storage can stretch across the peak demand hours - at least in the US where summer is peak demand time .
In Britain peak electric demand is in winter when not a lot of sun shines .
So solar power does not work well in Britain .
The costs for this project seem high when total kwh per year are considered .
The 50MWe AndaSol plant is located in the community of Aldeire in the Marquesado valley in the Province of Granada , Southern Spain .
Thanks to the high altitude ( 1,100 m ) and the desert climate , the Marquesado Valley offers exceptionally high annual direct insolation of 2,200 kWh / m²yr .
The 549360 m² parabolic trough solar field is built - up by 1,008 EUROTrough collectors , arranged in 168 parallel loops .
It will occupy app. 200 hectares of land .
It will generate live steam of 100 bar / 371°C to the reheat steam turbine with a cycle efficiency of 38 % , gross .
With an annual direct normal radiation of 2,200 kWh / m² per year , the AndaSol plant will generate almost 182 million kWh per year of clean solar electricity in 100 % solar operation .
The plant will be built , owned and operated by the specific project company , Partner 1 .
Partner 1 will sell as renewable independent power producer the generated solar electricity to the utility under the standard renewable power purchase terms regulated by the Spanish Royal Decree 2818 / 98 .
Using solar beam radiation as its primary energy , the solar plant will avoid approximately 172,000 tons of CO2 annually in Southern Spain otherwise being emitted by coal and heavy fuel oil operated power plants in the region .
In a market that 182 million kwh might sell for , say , 10 cents per kwh .
It would probably sell for less in the US where the average retail cost of electricity is about 11 cents per kwh .
But let us assume a higher price in Europe .
Okay , that would still only amount to $ 18.2 million per year .
Seems like a small return on a few hundred million dollar investment plus operating costs and maintenance costs .
But if this electricity is sold during peak hours maybe it sells for more than 10 cents per kwh ?
Does a political deal assure a higher price ?
If so , how much higher ?
Let us consider the avoided CO2 emissions .
If the 172,000 tons of avoided emissions were taxed at $ 30 per ton ( which is one figure I 've heard proposed for how much carbon emissions should be taxed ) then the amount of avoided carbon taxes would be only $ 5.2 million per year .
That does n't improve profitability very much .
I am curious to know more about the real costs for concentrated solar plus molten salt storage .
Anyone have better sources of information on this topic ?
Resident Evil 5 is the first current - generation Resident Evil title to be released — unless you count the Wii light - gun game that took players through past games , and I do n't — and it labors under the pressure of following up Resident Evil 4 , which was one of the most - loved games of the past ten years .
Capcom seems more than willing to shake up the foundation of their beloved franchise , and if you thought the demo for this game was controversial , wait until the fans get their hands on the game .
There will be fallout .
I 'm not saying the game is bad , and I 'll explain in a moment why I think it 's good , but Capcom has a major PR issue with Resident Evil 5 — not with the racism issue , although we 'll address that later — but because fans of action games may not give any game with " Resident Evil " in the title a shot .
On the other hand , Resident Evil fans may not be willing to take this particular ride because it 's an action game .
Even more dizzying is that the game is designed to be played as a co-op experience .
This is not a good start for fans of the long - running series .
The cradle of civilization
The story begins with our old friend Chris Redfield heading to Africa to track some biological weapons , weapons that may or may not be linked to a certain company named after a device used to keep one dry .
There he meets up with his new partner , the street - tough Sheva , and they begin to work together to find out what 's going on in the dusty village .
Things go bad , as they always do in this sort of game , and thus begins their desperate fight for survival .
Title Resident Evil 5 Developer Capcom Publisher Capcom Price $ 59.99 Platform Xbox 360 , PS3
These early levels are the closest you get to survival horror in the game , filled as they are with tight corners , maze - like alleys , and an enemy you do n't quite understand .
While you 'll have to be careful with your shots , ammo is not as scarce as it was in past games .
You 'll also notice that these zombies — if you can even call them that — are much smarter than their predecessors .
Not only do they wield weapons like knives and bottles , but they 've mastered the use of crossbows and other firearms .
If you thought the argument between slow and fast zombies split fans in half , wait until you hear Internet arguments about whether these enemies could handle a grenade .
There are drawn - out gunfights that feel like they would be more in place in an action film than what used to be a plodding video game .
So after playing through the entirety of the game , are there racist undertones ?
That 's a difficult question to answer , and there are certainly scenes that will be disturbing to a large audience .
Black men dragging off a white woman to do ... well , terrible things .
You will finish many villagers off by slamming your boot into their brain .
These images have negative associations for many people , and the argument will be brought up again as more people play the full game .
You 'll see Africans wearing oversized masks and throwing spears at you as you fight your way through the game .
How this imagery is used is what people will discuss , but the feelings you get from seeing some parts of the game will be intensely personal .
It made me ask myself how people would react if some sort of freak biological weapons attack did occur in Africa , and the story we saw on the news was a team with white faces gunning down infected villagers .
The team behind Resident Evil may not have known they were playing with fire when they chose this setting , but in some ways the game is made deeper by asking these questions , and by forcing us to pay attention to how our feelings about race come into play as we experience the game .
My last observation on this aspect of the game is that there are almost no sympathetic white characters to be found .
Chris is basically a missile at this stage , his life turned to hell because of past experiences and friends lost .
The villain in the first part of the game is an irritatingly - voiced man in a sports suit with more money than morals ; imagine a less creepy , more douchey Salazar , and you get the idea .
On the other hand , Sheva was born and raised in Africa , and seems a much more human character .
The soldiers who support you in the game are black .
So though the racially - based criticisms of the game came from a fear that Africans were being portrayed as mindless , savage brutes to be used as canon fodder , that 's only part of the story ; the game features characters from many different backgrounds , with many accents , and there is no clear line that connects one race or the other with good or bad intentions .
If you should die before me , ask if you can bring a friend .
Now we get to the issue of the co-op play , which is a tricky one .
For fans of playing games alongside friends , this was incredible news — a Resident Evil title built from the ground - up for co-op !
Those who prefer a more solitary gaming sessions were sorely disappointed when the co-op details where announced — why can't anyone release a good single - player game anymore ?
The good news is that after playing the majority of the game with an AI companion , I can tell you that the title can easily be played without a human companion .
You may run into some annoyances , but overall Sheva does what you 'd like her to do , does n't complain when you saddle her with the lame weapons , and tags along very well .
I had a few problems with how the AI managed things , as it was a little too free with the healing items , and sometimes when we were split up , Sheva refused to pick up items .
But overall it was a fine experience .
The game does get significantly better when you play with a friend , though — sharing strategy , divvying up ammo , splitting up , and attacking groups of enemies together .
It 's a huge thrill , and playing co-op adds a whole new social layer to the game ; I see now why this is Capcom 's suggested way to play Resident Evil 5 .
With only one copy of the game , I was locked in the less - than - optimal split - screen mode , where a big chunk of the screen is missing , but after scooting our chairs closer , we had a great time .
I plan on buying a retail copy of the game simply so that I can play through it with friends over Xbox Live .
Otaku the world over just love to complain about live - action adaptations of beloved anime series , usually months – if not years – before they come out , determined to hate the final product regardless of what it is .
It could be argued that they 're not giving some of these projects a fair shake from the get - go ; they 're hating just to hate , swearing fealty to the original show or manga , convinced Hollywood just can't ever get it right .
Dragonball : Evolution was no exception .
Fans decried every scrap of material they could get their hands on , from leaked screencaps to shots of unpainted action figures to the teaser trailers , each time their derisive laughter and scorn growing louder and louder .
A tiny handful of people remained cautiously optimistic , praying that 20th Century Fox had managed to distill the essence of the eternally popular , internationally beloved and downright legendary Dragonball story into a 90 - minute action adventure that , while perhaps not adhering so closely to the exact plot and pacing of the original story , did provide a faithful and entertaining homage that might pave the way for increasingly loyal adaptations down the road .
Here 's what happened instead : a bunch of talentless hacks with studio money slapped together a big steaming pile of baffling garbage that fails utterly on every possible level and will please no one at all .
The fans were right .
Here 's how it goes : the movie opens with a brief montage about an evil alien named Piccolo and a monkey lookin’ god of destruction named Oozaru who destroyed the earth 's population 2000 years ago and were sealed up by an order of monks ( or something ) who imprisoned Piccolo and I guess sent Oozaru away to space jail or whatever .
So now it 's 2000 years later and we 're introduced to scrappy young Goku , who is training at his grandfather Gohan 's ranch - temple - Karate dojo thing out in the country , and has trouble at high school because he's so special and different ( why his classmates think he 's different or weird , we are never told nor shown ) .
After taking out some bullies ( who menacingly call him “ Geeko ” over and over again , for no discernable reason , especially considering he looks and dresses exactly like them ) he catches the eye of ChiChi , a cute girl who knows he 's using his Ki power after he opens her stubborn locker for her with his amazing airbending skills .
Turns out ChiChi is a fighter too , and she 's totally digging on Goku 's style .
Love interest alert !
Who 'da thunk ?
So then Piccolo – who has somehow broken out of imprisonment , the hows and whys of which are never explained at all - shows up in his big flying office building thing that nobody seems to notice hovering around in the clouds , crushes Gohan 's karate ranch using the Power of the Force after he discovers Gohan no longer has the 4 - star Dragonball .
After all , he gave it to Goku for his 18th birthday , and would n't you know it , Goku is at ChiChi 's bangin ’ high school party at a McMansion in the San Fernando Valley the futuristic city of Who Cares .
So Goku returns to conveniently find Gohan , just about to die , but just alive enough to tell Goku to believe in himself ( among a handful of other convenient noble one - liners destined to be repeated later in the film ) and that it's his destiny to sniff out all the Dragonballs he can ( which , as everyone knows , will grant the ball - handler a wish when collected together ) , stop Piccolo from destroying the world and do it all in 90 minutes so the kids can make it home in time for Spongebob and the rest of the paying audience can drown their sorrow in a bottle of cheap whiskey while lighting their Dragonball manga collections on fire in front of the 20th Century Fox offices .
Then Bulma ( sample dialogue : “ I'm Bulma Briefs ! ” ) shows up out of nowhere with a Dragonball detector and she and Goku become buddies , teaming up to stop Piccolo and to find Master Roshi ( sample dialogue : “ Punk , prepare for your clock is going to be cleaned ! ” ) , the only person who knows
Goku 's destiny and can train him not only to battle Piccolo , but to also assist in their quest to gently cup as many Dragonballs as possible .
Along the way they run into obnoxious bandit Yamcha ( sample dialogue : “ Cheese and rice , my nads got scorched ! ” ) who serves no purpose other than to deliver unfunny punchlines and become Bulma 's love interest 12 hours after meeting her .
There 's also Piccolo 's unnamed shapeshifting henchwoman , who sometimes shows up long enough to get punched , show off her terrible wig and lose a fight .
After about an hour and 15 minutes Piccolo has caressed all 7 Dragonballs ( and has had maybe 5 minutes of screentime total and around 4 or 5 lines , not one of which really offers a good solid reason why exactly he wants to destroy the planet ) , and Goku , now conveniently dressed in his trademark orange Gi and silly ribbed boots , which he managed to change into while his hovering transport jeep was exploding , Bulma , Yamcha and Roshi all show up for the big final battle .
Goku turns into an embarrassing CG monkey thing for a while , there 's a lot of yelling and whatnot , and then it 's over .
They hint at a sequel ( actual dialogue : " where are the Dragonballs ? "
" Looks like they 're gone again ! "
" Well , we better go find them ! " ) , and that 's about it .
There 's a lot wrong with Dragonball Evolution , but the one huge thing that overrides nearly everything else is that the script is an absolute , unmitigated disaster .
It 's clear that a metric ton of material was hacked out , but this thing would need another 30 minutes rise from “ unforgivably retarded ” to “ only mostly retarded ” .
If you walked into this movie cold – with only a cursory knowledge of who Goku is or what the original story is about – your jaw will be agape at what unbelievable horsecrap is unfolding before you .
They explain virtually nothing .
There is little to no character motivation .
Things just sort of happen – it's not difficult to keep up with ( once you realize the movie has no internal logic at all and is just checking off character names and plot points ) it 's just that so little of it feels connected or sensible at all .
Stuff happens , but who cares ?
Earth is basically unrecognizable and looks like the first 5 minutes or so of Bill & Ted 's Bogus Journey , the distant future circa 1992 .
None of the characters are compelling or interesting at all and they 're all caught up in this big nonsense story that feels like it was written in crayon .
It 'd probably be easy to excuse this trash pile of a script by claiming that the original material was pretty zany too , but while Dragonball may have been silly and overblown , it was n't insultingly stupid and senseless .
You can't even use the ‘ it 's a live - action cartoon ! ’ excuse – compared to Dragonball Evolution , your average episode of Chowder or Batman : The Brave and the Bold are shining examples of depth and meaning on par with the work of Dostoyevsky .
Kids are n't dumb enough to fall for this .
In terms of production values , nothing there works either .
The special effects are all Sci-Fi Original Movie - level quality , and the costume design is questionable to say the least .
Hell , even the makeup sucks – Bulma has cosmetics plastered on like a whore in a Ratt video , all heavy rouge and electric blue eyeliner , her hair teased and highlighted to where she 'd look much more comfortable writhing around on the hood of a 1987 TransAm than playing a “ badass ” genius scientist .
The film 's climactic moment – spoiler alert , it 's the Kamehameha – is so outrageously goofy looking and badly executed that you will laugh out loud .
It is perhaps the most enjoyable moment in the film , unintentionally so .
It 's hard to blame the actors for their across - the - board mediocre performances when they 're dealing with material this mind - boggling , but they can't be let off the hook either .
Justin Chatwin occasionally delivers his ridiculous dialogue with some measure of quality but most of the film requires him to grimace and flex his neck muscles , which he apparently is n't quite capable of doing in a convincing way ; imagine someone doing a bad job at faking " desperate , painful constipation " and you 're about there .
Emily Rossum spits her lines out like she just can't wait to get rid of them , and nobody can blame her for that , but she 's less engaging than your average Power Rangers guest star .
The guy playing Yamcha – Joon Park – is just not very good at this .
His delivery is godawful , like the guy who 's stuck playing the tired ‘ surfer dude ’ stereotype character in a Japanese roleplaying game from 1997 , back when they'd hire convenience store employees and hobos from the local YMCA to do the voiceover work .
Chow Yun -Fat does what he can , but even he stumbles over this stuff ; the role requires him to behave like a cartoon character and it just comes across as trying way , way too hard .
In the end , it all boils down to one thing : this movie appeals to nobody .
It was made for no one .
People who are n't familiar with the Dragonball story at all will be so flabbergasted by what 's happening that they will likely tell everyone they know that it's one of the worst movies they 've ever seen .
Fans who do know what the general story is will be furious at just how unbelievably badly they screwed this entire thing up .
Kids are used to better writing than this in their weekday afternoon cartoons ( although you may run into a kid who has never actually seen a movie before , and they might dig it until you show them another movie ) .
It 's a clunky , tiresome , badly executed , horribly written pile of shame that deserves no quarter .
In short , it 's as bad as the fans said it would be .
Some might say that Mathematica and A New Kind of Science are ambitious projects .
But in recent years I ’ve been hard at work on a still more ambitious project — called Wolfram|Alpha .
And I ’m excited to say that in just two months it ’s going to be going live :
Mathematica has been a great success in very broadly handling all kinds of formal technical systems and knowledge .
But what about everything else ?
What about all other systematic knowledge ?
All the methods and models , and data , that exists ?
Fifty years ago , when computers were young , people assumed that they ’d quickly be able to handle all these kinds of things .
And that one would be able to ask a computer any factual question , and have it compute the answer .
But it did n’t work out that way .
Computers have been able to do many remarkable and unexpected things .
But not that .
I ’d always thought , though , that eventually it should be possible .
And a few years ago , I realized that I was finally in a position to try to do it .
I had two crucial ingredients : Mathematica and NKS .
With Mathematica , I had a symbolic language to represent anything — as well as the algorithmic power to do any kind of computation .
And with NKS , I had a paradigm for understanding how all sorts of complexity could arise from simple rules .
But what about all the actual knowledge that we as humans have accumulated ?
A lot of it is now on the web — in billions of pages of text .
And with search engines , we can very efficiently search for specific terms and phrases in that text .
But we ca n’t compute from that .
And in effect , we can only answer questions that have been literally asked before .
We can look things up , but we ca n’t figure anything new out .
So how can we deal with that ?
Well , some people have thought the way forward must be to somehow automatically understand the natural language that exists on the web .
Perhaps getting the web semantically tagged to make that easier .
But armed with Mathematica and NKS I realized there ’s another way : explicitly implement methods and models , as algorithms , and explicitly curate all data so that it is immediately computable .
It ’s not easy to do this .
Every different kind of method and model — and data — has its own special features and character .
But with a mixture of Mathematica and NKS automation , and a lot of human experts , I ’m happy to say that we ’ve gotten a very long way .
But , OK .
Let ’s say we succeed in creating a system that knows a lot , and can figure a lot out .
How can we interact with it ?
The way humans normally communicate is through natural language .
And when one ’s dealing with the whole spectrum of knowledge , I think that ’s the only realistic option for communicating with computers too .
Of course , getting computers to deal with natural language has turned out to be incredibly difficult .
And for example we ’re still very far away from having computers systematically understand large volumes of natural language text on the web .
But if one ’s already made knowledge computable , one does n’t need to do that kind of natural language understanding .
All one needs to be able to do is to take questions people ask in natural language , and represent them in a precise form that fits into the computations one can do .
Of course , even that has never been done in any generality .
And it ’s made more difficult by the fact that one does n’t just want to handle a language like English : one also wants to be able to handle all the shorthand notations that people in every possible field use .
I was n’t at all sure it was going to work .
But I ’m happy to say that with a mixture of many clever algorithms and heuristics , lots of linguistic discovery and linguistic curation , and what probably amount to some serious theoretical breakthroughs , we ’re actually managing to make it work .
Pulling all of this together to create a true computational knowledge engine is a very difficult task .
It ’s certainly the most complex project I ’ve ever undertaken .
Involving far more kinds of expertise — and more moving parts — than I ’ve ever had to assemble before .
And — like Mathematica , or NKS — the project will never be finished .
But I ’m happy to say that we ’ve almost reached the point where we feel we can expose the first part of it .
It ’s going to be a website : www.wolframalpha.com.
With one simple input field that gives access to a huge system , with trillions of pieces of curated data and millions of lines of algorithms .
We ’re all working very hard right now to get Wolfram| Alpha ready to go live .
I think it ’s going to be pretty exciting .
A new paradigm for using computers and the web .
That almost gets us to what people thought computers would be able to do 50 years ago !
Windows / Mac / Linux :
If you spend your entire day staring into the pit of an eye - burning LCD , free application F.lux may be right up your alley .
Advertisement
This free utility adjusts the glow of your monitor — both the brightness and tint — based on the time of day , dimming your monitor later into the evening and tinting the screen color based on the kind of lighting you employ .
To get a better idea of what those changes will look like over the course of the day , F.lux has a preview option that runs through the dimming in a few seconds .
The dimming and tinting seems drastic in the preview , but I 'm giving this one a test run in real time to see how it really feels .
Obviously this app would n't work well for a designer or someone who relies on accurate screen color ( though you could use the Disable for one hour option ) , but as someone has lost more than a few battles with insomnia , I do appreciate the idea that coming to the computer at 3 am wo n't burn my retinas .
If you give it a try or have used it in the past , let 's hear how it works for you in the comments .

So I still have n’t seen Watchmen .
But friends , it ’s now Thursday ( 03.05.09 ) and tonight at midnight , all that will change .
But for God ’s sake , what will I do until then ?!?
I ’m sure all you avid MovieChopShop visitors ( or Choppers , as I ’ve just now decided to call you …or are we the Choppers ? … aw , fuck it ) have noticed that we ’ve been particularly Watchmen - centric for the past week or so .
Well , it ai n’t stopping yet , friends .
Before we ’re all able to punch out our reviews of the film we are all hoping will be AMAZING , I ’ve got one more Watchmen pre-gamer that I ’d like to try and push upon all of you .
This Tuesday saw the DVD release of Watchmen : The Complete Motion Comic , which ran in 12 different installments ( one for each chapter of the book ) which were available on iTunes , starting several months ago .
Well , it ’s finished up just in time for the release of the movie and it ’s been put out on DVD .
Now , I ’m a pretty big Watchmen fan and even I felt a twinge of “ Oh geez , am I gonna regret this ? ” when I bought the 2 - disc set .
Essentially , it ’s just what the title suggests .
It ’s every last panel of Dave Gibbons ’s original illustrations from the book set in motion , moving around and coming to life from right off of the page , complete with sound effects and music .
All of the dialogue is read by one voice - over actor by the name of Tom Stechschulte .
The finished product is a 325 - minute - long animated retelling of Alan Moore ’s Watchmen .
My girlfriend brought me down a little from my Watchmen : Motion Comic - induced high when she noticed the similarities between this and the technique of “ Reading Rainbow . ”
But , it ’s really a pretty solid little package .
The style takes a little bit of getting used to , but once the plot has sucked you in , as Watchmen certainly has a way of doing , you find yourself pretty swept up in it .
It ’s surprisingly cinematic !
Once you ’ve made it to the frankly stunningly put - together final five minutes of the second chapter , you start to wonder if Snyder ’s film will end up being this good .
Now , the thing is n’t really 100 % perfect .
Not close , either .
But let me start with the good and I ’ll work my way into the bad .
So what ’s good here ?
For one , the overall mechanics of its construction .
You ’re not just looking at the panel and it ’s moving around .
It really does take you right inside the artwork –it ’s a piece of animation that has been very carefully crafted and very well directed .
The camera pans around the panels , shifts focus , and fades and cuts to black at very appropriate and clever times .
The opening shots of each chapter zoom out in a seamless flow , creating a new feel from the panel - by - panel zooms in the book .
I mentioned earlier the final five minutes of the second chapter , because those in particular gave me a touch of the goosebumps .
The Comedian sits at the edge of Moloch ’s bed , drunkenly ranting .
In Gibbon ’s original artwork , each panel changed back and forth between color tints , reflecting the changing neon signs outside the bedroom window .
The way that this is edited together is flawless , adding a stirring dynamic to the scene that you could n’t quite get from just watching the drawings sit there .
This is just one of the many ways that the “ motion ” aspect and cinematic editing techniques enhance details within the book ’s artwork that I had taken for granted .
And just because I have to mention this , after that scene , it goes straight into Rorschach ’s monologue .
The music builds and builds as the monologue is intercut with flashback scenes of The Comedian , leading up to the classic shot of him thrown out the window right on the punchline of Rorschach ’s joke .
It ’s fucking mind - blowing .
And that brings me to another great thing about this : the music .
The DVD credits Lennie Moore with the music , so I assume it ’s original stuff that we ’re working with , but it ’s excellent .
It is n’t particularly complex or even really varied , you ’re mostly just hearing the same thing over and over again , but it ’s quite moving and has a really solid means of pulling you in .
Also worthy of note is the entire characterization of Rorschach .
The narrator does a great Rorschach voice and completely triumphs with the not - so - easy task of making his choppy - incomplete - sentences dialogue not sound ridiculous as spoken word .
( It ’s my understanding thus far that Jackie Earl Haley ’s Rorschach is equally excellent , if not better , and that gets me excited ! )
But the slow and slightly awkward motions of the images that come off a little odd for a lot of the other characters are perfect here for Rorschach and the changing inkblot on his mask is a fitfully hypnotic thing to watch .
Now onto some of the bad .
The thing about the narrator ’s voice being excellent for Rorschach … yeah , that does n’t really hold over to everyone else .
As I mentioned above , this guy does the voice for everyone and on some he just seems like he ’s either not trying or he ’s just too used to the book - on - tape style of voice - acting to make anything sound fluid or natural .
It ’s an odd sort of anomaly , really .
It seems as if he ’s speaking slowly and clearly so that the dialogue bubbles ( which appear on the screen as characters speak ) can keep up , but if the dialogue bubbles are being displayed and we can read the dialogue for any clarification we might need , then why is n’t he trying to sound a little more natural ?
And is it just me or is his voice for the kid reading the Black Freighter comic just a teensy bit racist ?
Some of his characterizations leave a lot to be desired , particularly Dr. Manhattan , who ’s given some sort of robot reverb from time to time .
And also lacking , for obvious reasons , is Laurie .
He kinda makes Silk Spectre II sound like a tranny .
And that ’s not cool .
The whole time you ’re just hearing what is essentially the same voice for everyone .
It comes dangerously close to making the tone of the entire thing pretty flat and one - note .
This is where the editing and the music help to bring it to life .
In its episodic form , this could all be less noticable and annoying , but to watch it all at once or in great big chunks , it gets somewhat cumbersome .
Also , and maybe this is nitpicky , but it bugs me that each chapter includes opening and closing credits , instead of just letting the thing flow straight through as if it were a giant 5 1/2 hour - long animated Watchmen movie , which it is , kinda … just with eleven intermissions .
And there are no special features .
None whatsoever .
Oh no , I ’m sorry there ’s a “ Special Sneak Peek ” at DC Universe ’s animated Wonder Woman movie .
Which was released on DVD the same day as this .
So yeah .
That ’s lame .
I do n’t know why they could n’t have given us a look at the forthcoming Green Lantern animated film instead .
The blu - Ray version also contains Zack Snyder ’s Watchmen Production Diary # 4 , which was the one about Dave Gibbons and his involvement with the film .
Anyway , complaints aside , if you ’re a Watchmen fan or , hell , even if you ’ve never read it , this is a succinct and fascinating way of reading the the entirety of what is surely the greatest and most subversive superhero story ever told .
Although , on second thought , I ’m inclined to dissuade Watchmen virgins from looking at this , as it excludes all of the between - chapter book excerpts and newspaper clippings and such .
But if you walk out of Zack Snyder ’s film this Friday , saying to yourself “ It just was n’t FAITHFUL ENOUGH !!! ” then maybe this is exactly what you need .

... every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can .
He generally , indeed , neither intends to promote the public interest , nor knows how much he is promoting it .
By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry , he intends only his own security ; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value , he intends only his own gain , and he is in this , as in many other cases , led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention .
Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it .
By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it .
I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good .
In this passage , taken from his 1776 book " An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations " Adam Smith set out the mechanism by which he felt economic society operated .
Each individual strives to become wealthy " intending only his own gain " but to this end he must exchange what he owns or produces with others who sufficiently value what he has to offer ; in this way , by division of labour and a free market , public interest is advanced .
Smith is often regarded as the father of economics , and his writings have been enormously influential .
Nowadays , " invisible hand " explanations are invoked to explain all sorts of phenomena , from scientific progress to environmental degradation .
In the modern context , mathematicians study " invisible hand " processes as part of Game Theory , the branch of mathematics that deals with payoffs and strategies ( see Game Theory and the Cuban Missile Crisis ) in Issue 13 of Plus .
Smith was profoundly religious , and saw the " invisible hand " as the mechanism by which a benevolent God administered a universe in which human happiness was maximised .
He made it clear in his writings that quite considerable structure was required in society before the invisible hand mechanism could work efficiently .
For example , property rights must be strong , and there must be widespread adherence to moral norms , such as prohibitions against theft and misrepresentation .
Theft was , to Smith , the worst crime of all , even though a poor man stealing from a rich man may increase overall happiness .
He even went so far as to say that the purpose of government is to defend the rich from the poor .
Here is a description of the way Smith imagined the universe operates :
There is a benevolent deity who administers the world in such a way as to maximise human happiness .
In order to do this he has created humans with a nature that leads them to act in a certain way .
The world as we know it is pretty much perfect , and everyone is about equally happy .
In particular , the rich are no happier than the poor .
Although this means we should all be happy with our lot in life , our nature ( which , remember , was created by God for the purpose of maximising happiness ) leads us to think that we would be happier if we were wealthier .
This is a good thing , because it leads us to struggle to become wealthier , thus increasing the sum total of human happiness via the mechanisms of exchange and division of labour .
It is clear why Smith says that moral norms are necessary for such a system to work - in order for exchange to proceed , contracts must be enforceable , people must have good access to information about the products and services available , and the rule of law must hold .
The modern " Invisible Hand "
Nowadays , something much more general is meant by the expression " invisible hand " .
An invisible hand process is one in which the outcome to be explained is produced in a decentralised way , with no explicit agreements between the acting agents .
The second essential component is that the process is not intentional .
The agents ' aims are not coordinated nor identical with the actual outcome , which is a byproduct of those aims .
The process should work even without the agents having any knowledge of it .
This is why the process is called invisible .
The system in which the invisible hand is most often assumed to work is the free market .
Adam Smith assumed that consumers choose for the lowest price , and that entrepreneurs choose for the highest rate of profit .
He asserted that by thus making their excess or insufficient demand known through market prices , consumers " directed " entrepreneurs ' investment money to the most profitable industry .
Remember that this is the industry producing the goods most highly valued by consumers , so in general economic well - being is increased .
One extremely positive aspect of a market - based economy is that it forces people to think about what other people want .
Smith saw this as a large part of what was good about the invisible hand mechanism .
He identified two ways to obtain the help and co-operation of other people , upon which we all depend constantly .
The first way is to appeal to the benevolence and goodwill of others .
To do this a person must often act in a servile and fawning way , which Smith found repulsive , and he claimed it generally meets with very limited success .
The second way is to appeal instead to other people 's self - interest .
In one of his most famous quotes :
Man has almost constant occasion for the help of his brethren , and it is in vain for him to expect it from their benevolence only .
He will be more likely to prevail if he can interest their self - love in his favour , and show them that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them .
Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind , proposes to do this .
Give me what I want , and you shall have this which you want , is the meaning of every such offer ; and it is the manner that we obtain from one another the far greater part of those good offices which we stand in need of .
It is not from the benevolence of the butcher , the brewer , or the baker that we expect our dinner , but from their regard to their own interest .
We address ourselves , not to their humanity but to their self - love .
For Smith , to propose an exchange is to attempt to show another that what you can do , or what you have , can be of use to the other .
When you carry out the exchange , it means the other person recognises that what you can do or that what you have is of value .
This is why so much of a person 's self - esteem is bound up in their job - a well - paid job is supposed to be a sign that others value your contribution and find it worth exchanging their own resources for .
How wise is the Invisible Hand ?

The theory of the invisible hand is certainly persuasive , and its simplicity is also very attractive .
No doubt every reader can see that it describes the way that things really work on many occasions , and , whether we find it palatable or not , we probably all recognise the truth of Smith 's assertion that paying for your dinner is a more reliable way to get it than appealing to the benevolence of others .
But , even assuming all the correct conditions , does the invisible hand theory really lead to the maximisation of human economic wellbeing in some sense , as Smith asserts ?
This is where mathematics , in the form of Game Theory , can provide us with some insights .
The Prisoner 's Dilemma
The " Prisoner 's Dilemma " is a very famous " paradox " in Game Theory .
It describes two people in a simple situation , acting in an informed manner , both attempting to maximise their wellbeing , and yet making choices that lead to an unnecessarily poor outcome for both .
Two people , who are suspected of being accomplices in a crime , are held prisoner in separate , non-communicating cells .
The police visit each prisoner , and tell both that if neither confesses , each will be sentenced to two years in jail .
However , if exactly one prisoner confesses , implicating each other , the one who confesses will get off scot - free as a reward , and the other , who did n't confess , will receive a punitive sentence of five years .
If each confesses and implicates the other , both will be sentenced to three years .
What should a prisoner in this situation do ?
Suppose that the other prisoner does n't confess .
Then the best course of action is to confess , and go free .
Even if the other prisoner does confess , it will be better to have done likewise - at least the sentence will be lower .
Both prisoners will reason thus , so both will confess and end up serving sentences of three years - even though , if both had remained silent , both would have served sentences of only two years .
It may not be immediately clear what the relevance of the Prisoner 's Dilemma is to Smith 's theory of the Invisible Hand .
In fact , it has a number of implications for economic behaviour .
The Prisoner 's Dilemma
The temptation to default
We can think of the prisoners as being asked to decide whether to keep a contract they have made with each other ( remain silent ) or to default ( confess and betray the other ) .
Similar choices have to be made all the time in economic society .
When two people freely agree to exchange goods or services to their mutual benefit , each must decide whether to try to cheat the other by defaulting , or handing over counterfeit goods , or whether to act in good faith and risk the other party defaulting .
Obviously , both parties are better off if neither default than if both default - after all , we suppose they willingly contracted with each other - but each would like to get something for nothing , and each is afraid the other will feel the same .
The result may well be that the parties are unable to carry out the exchange as arranged , and both lose out .
The reason we do n't see this behaviour too often is because we live in a society where courts can enforce contracts .
This reduces the fear of the other party defaulting , and makes it easier to hand over goods ahead of receiving whatever is to be exchanged for them .
In illegal exchanges , for example , receiving stolen goods , default is more common , and rather difficult for criminals to guard against .
Enforcing laws of contract requires cooperation and resources from someone else - in democratic societies , the courts on behalf of the government and the people .
But courts and prisons and police cost money and most of the costs fall on people who were not party to the contract in the first place - who are therefore paying for a service that does n't directly benefit themselves .
Such courts fall into the category of " public good " - we are all better off in a society where the rule of law is upheld - but are not created and maintained by any invisible hand mechanism .
Courts are set up deliberately to carry out a public good ; and , although they may not always work the way they are intended to , there is nothing unintended about their use to enforce contracts .
Subsidy - seeking
In a democratic society , there is a strong temptation for " special - interest " groups to form and lobby the government to provide tax - payers ' money to the group in the form of subsidies .
Politicians find the prospect of buying the loyalty of the group attractive , and the group sees the prospect of getting other people 's money for nothing .
Clearly , everyone would be better off if no one sought subsidies - by definition , subsidies are only needed for unprofitable activities , that is , activities that other people do not value sufficiently to pay their own money for .
However , if other people seek and gain subsidies , anyone who does n't bother trying to do the same for themselves will end up subsidising others while receiving no subsidies themselves .
This fear may force large numbers of people to spend their time lobbying the government for subsidies , rather than simply engaging in more profitable activities - a classic example of the Prisoner 's Dilemma , and one over which no court has jurisdiction .
A very similar situation occurs regarding monopolies .
Since pretty much every producer is a consumer , it is probably to everybody 's benefit overall if no producers attempt to raise prices by monopolising their market ; however , attempting to enforce a monopoly can be very attractive to individual producers .
Smith rather sardonically observed that
" People of the same trade seldom meet together even for merriment and diversion , but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public or some contrivance to raise prices . "
Arrow's Theorem
As explained in the Editorial of Issue 13 of Plus , Arrow 's Impossibility Theorem says that , in a certain sense , it is impossible to produce a consistent group preference by aggregating individual preferences .
It is normally stated in terms of votes and elections , and , in this format , says that is impossible to use information about individual voters ' preferences to decide what is " the will of the people " .
Every voting system in current use throws up anomalies , such as " flip - flops " , which occur when a third candidate enters the race and overturns the group preference between the other two candidates ( think of Ralph Nader in California , splitting Al Gore 's vote and handing George Bush the election ) .
The " will of the people "
Again , the relevance to allocation of public goods is not immediately obvious - until you recall that an essential part of the invisible hand process is that producers respond to an single signal that is meant to be an aggregate of all signals by consumers .
Arrow 's
Theorem is often interpreted as saying that there is no consistent way to aggregate the preferences of individuals to give a single preference which can be regarded as the preference of society - or " the will of the people " .
An economic version of the flip - flop could occur if a majority of customers would prefer to buy Product X to Product Y , but some of that majority actually like Product Z even better ( the equivalent of splitting the vote ) ; the producer may end up producing Product Y even though more people would have liked Product X , and presumably it would have been more profitable to produce it .
If this happens , then the invisible hand cannot be said to have worked to maximise economic wellbeing .
In a centralised society a few individuals make decisions on how to spend everyone 's money and direct everyone 's effort .
How far does the invisible hand reach ?
How economic systems work and what can be done to improve them is still very much a live area of research for economists .
Mathematicians are currently grappling with the implications of game theory for all sorts of social choice , in particular , what meaning , if any , can be attached to the expressions " the will of the people " and " the public good " .
The results of such analyses will not be the only factor in deciding whether societies move towards or away from laissez - faire economics ( " laissez - faire " means " let alone " and is shorthand for leaving things to the invisible hand ) .
Political will , whether the world becomes more peaceful or less , and the practicality of any alternatives will also be factors .
Alternative systems tend to require much more intervention and more stringent rules .
In the real world , such rules automatically introduce more and more opportunities for mistakes and corruption , which might mean that another system , even if better in principle , would be worse in practice .
Perhaps the strongest reason for leaving the allocation of effort and reward to the invisible hand is that when it misappropriates goods , it is likely to be on a small scale .
More centralised methods of allocating goods are more prone to corruption and waste .
Smith described people given the spending of other people 's money thus :
.. being the managers of other people 's money than of their own , it cannot well be expected that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own .
Like the stewards of a rich man , they ... consider attention to small matters as not for their master 's honour and very easily give themselves a dispensation from having it .
It is useful to remember the context in which Smith developed his theories - that of a heavily planned and rather dictatorial society , where some individuals were above the law and others were effectively without any rights .
In a centralised society a few individuals make decisions on how to spend everyone 's money and direct everyone 's effort .
As Smith said
It is the highest impertinence and presumption , therefore , in kings and ministers to pretend to watch over the economy of private people , and to restrain their expense ... They are themselves always , and without exception , the greatest spendthrifts in the society .

For most adults , the sensation of being proved right is usually a complex and bittersweet one .
You might have said that your brother - in - law would turn out to be a no - goodnik , or that the forty - third President would turn out to be the worst in American history , and you may regard subsequent events as inarguable proof that you were right — but it ’s not an especially happy feeling .
It changes nothing about the world outside your head .
You were right .
Congratulations .
And ?
The fragility of the banks was easily disguised : “ value , ” in the financial markets , was as elusive as “ meaning ” in deconstruction .
Illustration by Seymour Chwast
One of the peculiar things about the world of finance is that it freely offers the sensation of being proved right to its participants .
Every transaction in the markets has a buyer and a seller , and , in most cases , one of them is right and the other wrong , because the price goes either up or down .
The cumulative weight of this right - or - wrongness is one of the things that make financial types psychologically distinctive .
Artists , sportsmen , surgeons , plumbers , and the rest of us have secret voices of doubt , inner reservations about ourselves , but if you go to work with money , and make money , you can be proved right in the most inhumanly pure way .
This is why people who have succeeded in the world of money tend to have such a high opinion of themselves .
And this is why they seem to regard themselves as paragons of rationality , while others often regard them as slightly nuts .
The chairman and C.E.O. of Lehman Brothers , Richard Fuld , in his no-apologies testimony to a congressional committee after his company ’s collapse , gave us a glimpse of this state of mind in its full pomp .
This is also why the financial masters of the universe tend not to write books .
If you have been proved — proved — right , why bother ?
If you need to tell it , you ca n’t truly know it .
The story of David Einhorn and Allied Capital is an example of a moneyman who believed , with absolute certainty , that he was in the right , who said so , and who then watched the world fail to react to his irrefutable demonstration of his own rightness .
This drove him so crazy that he did what was , for a hedge - fund manager , a bizarre thing : he wrote a book about it .
The story began on May 15 , 2002 , when Einhorn , who runs a hedge fund called Greenlight Capital , made a speech for a children ’s - cancer charity in Hackensack , New Jersey .
The charity holds an annual fund - raiser at which investment luminaries give advice on specific shares .
Einhorn was one of eleven speakers that day , but his speech had a twist : he recommended shorting — betting against — a firm called Allied Capital .
Allied is a “ business development company , ” which invests in companies in their early stages .
Einhorn found things not to like in Allied ’s accounting practices — in particular , its way of assessing the value of its investments .
The mark - to - market accounting that Einhorn favored is based on the price an asset would fetch if it were sold today , but many of Allied ’s investments were in small startups that had , in effect , no market to which they could be marked .
In Einhorn ’s view , Allied ’s way of pricing its holdings amounted to “ the you - have - got - to - be - kidding - me method of accounting .
”
At the same time , Allied was issuing new equity , and , according to Einhorn , the revenue from this could be used to fund the dividend payments that were keeping Allied ’s investors happy .
To Einhorn , this looked like a potential Ponzi scheme .
The next day , Allied ’s stock dipped more than twenty per cent , and a storm of controversy and counter - accusations began to rage .
“ Those engaging in the current misinformation campaign against Allied Capital are cynically trying to take advantage of the current post - Enron environment by tarring a great and honest company like Allied Capital with the broad brush of a Big Lie , ” Allied ’s C.E.O. said .
Einhorn would be the first to admit that he wanted Allied ’s stock to drop , which might make his motives seem impure to the general reader , but not to him .
The function of hedge funds is , by his account , to expose faulty companies and make money in the process .
Joseph Schumpeter described capitalism as “ creative destruction ” : hedge funds are destructive agents , predators targeting the weak and infirm .
As Einhorn might see it , people like him are especially necessary because so many others have been asleep at the wheel .
His book about his five - year battle with Allied , “ Fooling Some of the People All of the Time ” ( Wiley ; $ 29.95 ) , depicts analysts , financial journalists , and the S.E.C. as being culpably complacent .
The S.E.C. spent three years investigating Allied .
It found that Allied violated accounting guidelines , but noted that the company had since made improvements .
There were no penalties .
Einhorn calls the S.E.C. judgment “ the lightest of taps on the wrist with the softest of feathers . ”
He deeply minds this , not least because the complacency of the watchdogs prevents him from being proved right on a reasonable schedule : if they had seen things his way , Allied ’s stock price would have promptly collapsed and his short selling would be hugely profitable .
As it was , Greenlight shorted Allied at $ 26.25 , only to spend the next years watching the stock drift sideways and upward ; eventually , in January of 2007 , it hit thirty - three dollars .
All this has a great deal of resonance now , because , on May 21st of this year , at the same charity event , Einhorn announced that Greenlight had shorted another stock , on the ground of the company ’s exposure to financial derivatives based on dangerous subprime loans .
The company was Lehman Brothers .
There was little delay in Einhorn ’s being proved right about that one : the toppling company shook the entire financial system .
A global cascade of bank implosions ensued — Wachovia , Washington Mutual , and the Icelandic banking system being merely some of the highlights to date — and a global bailout of the entire system had to be put in train .
The short sellers were proved right , and also came to be seen as culprits ; so was mark - to - market accounting , since it caused sudden , cataclysmic drops in the book value of companies whose holdings had become illiquid .
It is therefore the perfect moment for a short - selling advocate of marking to market to publish his account .
One can only speculate whether Einhorn would have written his book if he had known what was going to happen next .
( One of the things that have happened is that , on September 30th , Ciena Capital , an Allied portfolio company to whose fraudulent lending Einhorn dedicates many pages , went into bankruptcy ; this coincided with a collapse in the value of Allied stock — finally ! — to a price of around six dollars a share . )
Given the esteem with which Einhorn ’s profession is regarded these days , it ’s a little as if the assassin of Archduke Franz Ferdinand had taken the outbreak of the First World War as the timely moment to publish a book advocating bomb - throwing — and the book had turned out to be unexpectedly persuasive .
The well - disguised fact about Einhorn , though , is that he is rather old - fashioned .
His hedge fund , Greenlight , is a long - short value fund .
It bets directly on companies ( that is the “ long , ” and larger , part of the fund ) or against them ( that ’s the “ short ” side ) .
This is , in the world of high finance , not at all the new new thing .
Indeed , the very fact that Einhorn is able to explain in plain English what his fund does is a sign that he is n’t at the cutting edge of finance .
Another man who shuns that bleeding edge is Warren Buffett , who also happens to be quantifiably the greatest investor alive .
Buffett is unique in many respects , and one of them is his eagerness to explain how and why he does what he does .
His advice sounds so plain and so reasonable —
“ Put your eggs in one basket , and then watch the basket ” — that the reader thinks it ca n’t possibly be that simple .
Underlying the desire to explain what he ’s up to is the wish to be proved right , since Buffett regards himself as living proof that the “ efficient market ” theory of market pricing is wrong .
The theory holds that markets , given perfect information , will always set an accurate price for a stock , one that takes full account of all the relevant probabilities and variables .
Buffett thinks his own success shows that it ’s possible to use generally available information to consistently outperform the market .
This sounds so commonsensical that it ’s hard to explain just how at odds this is with the way people have been trained to think about stock markets .
Common sense is one of the hallmarks of Buffett ’s writings on finance — which are , very Buffettishly , to be found pretty much nowhere other than in his annual letters to shareholders of his company , Berkshire Hathaway .
Here is Buffett on the junk - bond boom , from 1989 :
We think so , and we do so .
Here are some points to ponder while considering whether or not you should be billing hourly for project management .
Project management hours typically account for 5 % to 20 % of a projects total hours
That is a lot of time to be giving away for free .
And when you have a small team of five , one of whom is a dedicated project manager , the other four all have to pull a little extra weight to bill enough hours to get everyone paid .
Consider that without a project manager or project scheduling software , the project will most likely take 5 to 20 % longer anyhow or fail completely
Online project management software can help keep designers and developers in touch with one another , and your company in touch with its clients .
Without project management , everyone is drowning in a sea of details .
Crosstrain the project manager
A small business usually requires its employees to wear multiple hats anyhow , so why not crosstrain the project manager ?
Our PM learned some HTML and Linux system administration skills , which goes a long ways in keeping simple requests off our team , and adds extra billable skills to his portfolio .
Project management is billable because of the expertise of managing a web design or development project
A project manager can answer most questions faster and at a lesser hourly rate without having to pass requests along to the billable employees , sparing your designers and developers a lot of time spent on trivial tasks .
And , in the long run , saving your clients money .
Consider billing at a lower hourly rate for project management
Many clients wo n’t like it that you are charging hourly for project management .
To help offset this , we bill project management at a lower rate than our other work types .
We do n’t mean to devalue the work of the project manager .
What we are doing is setting a precedent that gets clients used to paying something for project management , and puts them at ease by showing them it is our lowest billable rate .
Finally , if you are considering implementing a project management hourly rate , or need help convincing the client that it is a valid billable service , here is the definition we provide in all our contracts to help quantify the importance of project management :
Project management is the defining , planning , scheduling , and controlling of the tasks that must be completed to reach your goal and the allocation of the resources to perform those tasks .
Project Management involves balancing the tradeoffs between time , cost & scope to create the best possible end product .
Clients want the best you can offer them .
Billing hourly for project management is just one component in delivering that to them .
And we have to assume that more than once a day , some ancient worshiper dropped his coins in , got nothing in return , and then immediately rocked the machine back and forth while cursing under his breath .
At least we 've ironed that little wrinkle out .
1 The Dildo
Believed to have been invented in ...
1966 , by Ted Marche .
The 1960s were a volatile time for the world .
In the US , students were being shot and killed at anti-war rallies ; in Britain , the Rolling Stone 's were recording Street Fighting Man ; in France , there was rioting in Paris ; while in California , Ted Marche was designing things for women to stick in their vaginas .

One night in 1966 , middle - aged ventriloquist ( that 's right , ventriloquist )
Marche sat down at the family dinner table and began carving a six inch cock .
It was the beginning of something beautiful , sort of creepy and incredibly lucrative ; Marche went on to build a million dollar industry out of his invention .
By 1976 , Marche Manufacturing ( Cracked would have went with Ventriloquist Cock , Inc. ) had sold nearly five million dildos .
None of these though sold in Texas , where they passed a law banning their sale .
For more information on the state of Texas and their fear of dildos , why not read this 33 page essay by Phoebe Godfrey Ph.D. of Texas A&M on Texan dildos , the last page of which is a " dildo release form . "

Actually invented in ...
28,000 BC .
In 2005 , a group of archaeologists discovered 13 fragments of siltstone at a site in Germany .
Upon unearthing the 14th , they put the pieces together and realized that their great archaeological discovery was not , in fact , an ancient Greek computer or a primitive Mesopotamian battery , but a massive dildo .
Like Isaac Newton and gravity , Einstein and relativity and Columbus and America , their names would forever be associated with their discovery : really , really old cock .
The dildo is 20 centimeters long , three centimeters wide and dates to the Ice Age , where women , judging by the objects size , apparently had a " massive capacity " .
Professor Nicholas Conard , a member of the team that , ahem , examined the dildo , spoke about their find saying : " In addition to being a symbolic representation of male genitalia ...
It 's highly polished . "
Indeed .

While they may have discovered the oldest known sex toy , they did n't discover the only one .
It seems that as long as human beings have had holes , we 've invented things to put in those holes .
Sex toys were commonly used in ancient Greece and according to always reliable source Wikipedia , archaeologists regularly discover ancient dildos but are reluctant to label them as such , probably because they do n't want to be known as " that guy that keeps discovering dildos -- you know , Indiana Dongs .

BUILDING THE PERFECT BRAGGABOO
1.Â Â Â First , type your deepest childhood fear into
Programming is not fun .
It ’s boring , it ’s tedious , and it ’s certainly not challenging .
And no matter how much you stretch it , programming is most definitely not sexy .
I know what you ’re thinking .
Anyone who says that – let alone blogs it – should immediately be stripped of his software development license , have his keyboard taken away , and be permitted to only use only to CP / M on 8 " floppies with a 1200 baud modem .
Obviously , a lot of us – me included – enjoy writing code .
But should we ?
Why do we write code ?
Software development is a unique profession in that we can use our skills both on the job and for our hobby .
And unlike accountants , who generally do n’t rush home to balance the family budget , many of us actually do tinker with code for fun .
But for the sake of this article , let ’s only consider the non - hobbyist developer , and the work that he does .
In fact , let ’s narrow this down even further , and consider only developers of “ boring ” software .
And by “ boring ” , I mean bills of lading processing , corporate fleet usage tracking , expense report creating , etc. , all for internal use with lots and lots of company - specific requirements .
So , to reiterate , if you do n’t create “ boring ” software for a living , then this article does n’t fully apply .
While the line between “ boring ” and “ sexy ” software can be blurred at times , sexy software represents the type of things that we use on a regular , day - to - day basis : SVN , Google Maps , Visual Studio , Firefox , etc .
In fact , as software developers , we rarely have to use boring software ourselves .
From a development perspective , however , the percentages are flipped .
Only a select few get paid to develop “ sexy ” software , whereas most of us are stuck developing the boring stuff .
Basics of Boring Software
There ’s a term for this type of boring software : information systems .
And while the purpose of an information system changes from company to company , as do the specific requirements , they all are essentially the same .
There ’s a database that models the real world , rules to define how the data may be changed , an interface to the database , and lots of different reports .
The formal process of creating these information systems was first created in the sixties and has n’t changed much since the seventies ( Modern Structured Analysis is surprisingly still modern ) .
Essentially , you analyze the problem , map the dataflow , structure the dataflow , create the database , and create programs that interface with the database .
We ’ve gone from thin - client green screen terminals to thick - client PC applications .
Then we went to the thin - client web and , with platforms like Windows Presentation Foundation , we ’ll be back to thick - client in no time .
But either way , the systems do all the same thing : data in , data out .
Developing information systems has n’t changed much , either .
Whether you ’re using Visual Basic 3.0 or XHTML , the concepts are pretty much the same : the database needs to be exposed to the user in user - friendly terms .
The code required to do this is , and always has been , fairly tedious :
txtFirstName.DisplayWidth = 30 ; txtFirstName.MaxCharLength = 50 ; SetTextBoxValidator( txtFirstName , Validations.LettersOnly ) ; txtFirstName .
Enabled = securityContext .CanEdit ; txtFirstName .Value = customerRecord.FirstName ;
That ’s five lines of code just to set some UI properties .
Multiply that for every field , for every entity , and then by 1.5 , just because some fields have to be accessible in two different places .
Now add in all the code required to validate and save data from the UI .
If my math serves me right , that adds up to a crapton of tedious , boring code .
The Developer ’s Dilemma .
“ Tedious ” and “ boring ” are two words that do n’t sit well with developers .
We ’re an analytical bunch and oftentimes come with a computer science degree .
And we ’re much more capable than tying a front - end and a back - end together using line after line of code .
Perhaps we could even use our skills and capabilities to make our job easier .
And therein lies the rub .
As Michael A. Jackson said in his 1975 Principles of Program Design , “ Programmers … often take refuge in an understandable , but disastrous , inclination towards complexity and ingenuity in their work .
Forbidden to design anything larger than a program , they respond by making that program intricate enough to challenge their professional skill . ”
This thirty - five year - old observation is confirmed day - in and day - out here on TDWTF .
Some of the most egregious code and stories written here stem from the developer ’s desire for cleverness .
Carrying out these desires is neither malicious nor devious , but merely instinctual .
When I wrote about Soft Coding , I presented a snippet of business code to illustrate what the majority of code should look like : i.e. , very specific code to implement very specific business requirements .
It ’s pretty boring :
private void attachSupplementalDocuments ( ) { if ( stateCode == " AZ " || stateCode == " TX " ) { //SR008-04X/I are always required in these states attachDocument ( " SR008-04X " ) ; attachDocument ( " SR008 - 04XI " ) ; } if ( ledgerAmnt >= 500000 ) { // Ledger of 500 K or more requires AUTHLDG - 1A attachDocument ( " AUTHLDG - 1A " ) ; } if ( coInsuredCount >= 5 && orgStatusCode != " CORP " ) { //Non-CORP orgs with 5 or more co-ins require AUTHCNS - 1A attachDocument ( " AUTHCNS - 1A " ) ; } }
In the numerous responses to the article , some people offered some rather humorous feedback , demonstrating ways that the code could be “ complexified ” .
These examples were , sadly , fairly representative of what I ’ve actually come across in response to simple business requirements .
Others offered some serious refactoring suggestions involving all sorts of design patterns , interfaces , supplementers , and a whole lot of classes .
Naturally , all without ever seeing the module that the hypothetical code resided in , let alone a broad understanding of the overall system and its requirements .
And then there was this one guy , James Taylor , who basically called me an idiot for suggesting that developers get their hands dirty with business rules .
Apparently , we should all be building whiz - bang expert systems with fancy UIs that let the end user do all of the dirty work .
Of course , those of us ground in reality understand that such expert systems exist only in the land of pixie dust , unicorns , and lossless compression of random data .
But there ’s another reality that many of us have yet to accept : application development sucks , and no amount of XML or design patterns will change this .
Just Suck It Up .
It ’s not easy to reconcile the fact that the software we write each and every day is , for all intents and purposes , mind - numbingly boring .
Magazine subscription management .
Medical billing reports .
Realty inventory management .
This is not the type of software that changes the world .
In fact , it probably wo n’t even put a smile on someone ’s face .
Its sole purpose is to add to the bottom line by making other workers be more productive .
As unexciting as it may be , it ’s our job to do work * exclusively * to benefit our employer , not for own personal satisfaction .
That ’s just what it means to be a professional .
I ’m sure that many aspiring lawyers would jump at the chance for an exciting jury trial , but would just as quickly give it up if it was in his client ’s best interest to settle .
While architects dream of opportunities like Fallingwater , if the design calls for a large warehouse with loading docks , then that ’s all the blueprints will reflect .
And if our employer needs software to manage voucher payments , then they should get exactly that , not a “ plug - in based system with extensible , run - time parsed UI templates , ” or whatever else we tricked ourselves in believing was necessary .
Rethinking Software Development .
As frustrating as it can be to work with the uninspired , sloppy developer , the contrary – the inspired - yet - misguided one – is several magnitudes worse .
A few bugs and painful - to - maintain code pale in comparison to the disastrous results an improperly motivated developer can deliver .
Everything from the platform ( “ let ’s try out Ruby ! ” ) to the architecture ( “ ca n’t just have two tiers ” ) to the techniques used in the code itself ( “ we need an aspect - oriented framework ” ) can be – and often are – influenced more by the desire to learn the technology than to serve the actual business need .
Pick the wrong platform or invent the wrong technique , and the project is inevitably doomed .
Having doomed more than one project as a result of my desire to challenge myself , I ’ve come to learn that there are some essential rules that must be followed when developing business information systems .
1. Learn the Business .
It ’s preposterous to believe that you do n’t need to understand the business in order to develop software for the business .
Without understanding what their actual needs are , it ’s impossible to give stakeholders what they actually need .
That ’s right : when they say they want a “ new database for every day ” , they do n’t actually mean a new database for every day .
2. Serve the Business .
Every tradesman wants to use the latest , greatest , and most powerful tools , but rarely are they appropriate for the job .
Likewise , there ’s hardly ever a business case to immediately upgrade all platforms / libraries / languages .
That 10 - year old “ Classic ASP ” code has n’t gotten worn out , just much less fun to maintain .
3. Learn Off The Job .
Self - improvement is a tenet of every profession , but the place to do that is “ off the job , ” i.e. not while developing information systems1 .
Instead , learn by creating applications for yourself , your team , or perhaps even some open source project .
4. Code mostly Business .
If the overwhelming majority of your hand - written code is n’t domain - specific and does n’t relate to the application ’s purpose , then you ’re using the wrong tools .
If you truly believe that the system needs a custom logging framework , then externalize it and get a buy - in from the stakeholder .
5. Tedium is Inescapable .
No O / R - mapper or code - generator can ever solve the fact that records , fields , validators , etc. need to be defined , by hand , in at least two places ( front - and back - end ) .
A UI generated from the database is just as bad as the database that ’s generated from the UI .
6. Find Satisfaction Elsewhere .
If your only satisfaction comes from writing complex code , then you ’ll never be a good and satisfied applications developer .
Personally , I ’m happy to know that I helped increased productivity for the end - user and / or created new opportunity for the organization .
... and , if all else fails ...
7. Get Another Job .
Maybe you ’ve reached your value apex .
Or maybe you ’re just sick this type of development altogether .
Either way , there are plenty of programming opportunities out there that do n’t involve boring , information systems .
Of course , the competition is much fiercer since the Paula Bean - types seem to only fly under Corporate IT 's radar .
At the end of the day , the best programmers are not the ones who create the most beautifully - elegant , exceedingly - innovative code .
The true rockstars can deliver software before deadlines , under budget , and that does exactly what the business needs .
And those are the type we should all strive to be .
UPDATE : To clarify , “ off the job ” does not mean that you should’t learn at work .
Learning is important , but do n’t do so while developing an information system for the stakeholder ( “ on the job ” ) .
Save that for your own or your team ’s internal projects .
Not happy with pushing the EU Data Retention Directive which would make ISPs store communication data for 12 months Vernon Coaker , the U.K .
Home Office security minister , now wants all social networking sites and IM messaging service monitored as well .
The Interception Monderisation Programme ( IMP ) is the government proposal for legislation to use mass monitoring of traffic data as an antiterrorism tool .
The IMP has two objectives ; that the government use deep packet inspection to monitor the Web communications of all U.K. citizens ; and that all of the traffic data relating to those communications are stored in a centralized government database .
The problem is that social networking sites are n’t covered by the directive
“ Social - networking sites such as MySpace or Bebo are not covered by the directive , ” said Coaker , speaking at a meeting of the House of Commons Fourth Delegated Legislation Committee .
“ That is one reason why the government ( is ) looking at what we should do about the Intercept ( ion ) Modernisation Programme , because there are certain aspects of communications which are not covered by the directive . ”

わたしがprintf ( ) デバッグをしない理由とか わたしがprintf ( ) デバッグをする理由とかを見て、 私も何か書こうかと思ったんですが、 面倒くさくなってやめてました。 でもちょっとだけ書くことにします 。
前にも書いたんですけど、 Ian Lance Taylor のDebuggingというエッセイ を読んでください、でお終いだったりします。 特にここ。
Of course , sometimes a debugger does not help . [ 省 略 ]
In such cases simple print statements can sometimes help locate the source of the bad behaviour .
Add print statements to relevant locations , rebuild the program , replicate the problem with the new program , and use the print statements to hone in on exactly what code is being executed when the problem occurs .
まあ、要するに使える方法を使いましょうね、ってこと。
どっちかしか駄目なんてことはありません。
これまた前も書いたことですが、「全か無か」みたいな主張は大体において間違っています。
ちなみに、C前提の話だと、私はほとんどprintfデバッグです。
ソースコード・レベルのデバッガ（gdbとか）が最適化したコードだとまともに追えなくなることが多いので、結局-O0とか付けてコンパイルし直す羽目になる上、そうしたらいきなり問題が起きなくなるという、とてつもなく嫌な現象に何度も出会ってきたもので。
後 、TwitterではデバッガのUIの問題とかつぶやいてましたが、それはまあどうでもいいや。
デバッガ使うのはピンポイントできそうな時ぐらい。
そうでないと、大抵余計に時間がかかる気がしますね。
それはともかく、デバッグなんてのは、時間と労力を大量に必要とする作業なんですから、効率のいいデバッグ方法を考えるのも結構なんですが、
その前にバグのないコードを書くことをもっと考えた方がいいでしょう。enbug.orgを持っている私が言うのも何ですが。
現実には私もそれ相応にバグを生産しているわけではありますが、
今まで見てきた他の開発者と比べると、ほとんどの場合、私の方がバグが少ないです。
これは思い切り自慢です。
それには当然コツがあります。 でもケチなので教えてあげません。 冗談です。 本当はどうやったら言葉に出来るか、よくわからないだけです。
一つ確実に言えるのは、いきなり書かないってことでしょうね。 書く前に頭の中に絵を描くことが大事。 その絵がきちんとはまらない、動かないようなら、そんなものはコードにして動くわけないです。 そもそもうまく書けないです。 大抵のバグは、書いた本人でさえ、自信を持ってどうなっているか説明できないような所にあります。
しかしそれでもバグ全然なしってのは無理です。
この前同僚にデバッグにはコツがあるのかと訊かれました。
そのとき、私は「あったらこっちが知りたい」と答えました。
でもデバッグのときも私は大抵の人よりは早いみたいです。
だから自分なりの何かがあるんだと思います。 いくつか例をあげると、
When one of my software engineer friends was in 6th grade his teacher decided it would be a good learning experience for the kids if she created a mock economy .
She had no idea how popular and profound the experiment would be .
Kids could now trade for durable goods ( lunch components , spit wad shooters ) without immediately needing an equally valuable item to trade back as required in the barter system .
The introduction of currency was a massive success and the classroom economy blossomed .
Even as a kid my friend was well known for his analytical skills so was assigned the job of class banker .
He turned out to be a very good banker .
In adult society , bankers play an important role loaning money to people with earning potential and a need to buy .
For example , buying a car to drive to your first job* , or a house to raise a family .
In short , a healthy banking environment is a lubricant of possitive economic activity .
I suppose the teacher intended that the classroom banker would loan out small amounts of money to kids who just had to have that cookie for lunch .
However , it did n’t work out quite that way .
For each loan my friend gave he received a 10 % commission .
It did n’t take him long to realize that the more transactions he as involved in the richer he ’d be .
So when fellow students wanted to buy goods he was quick to market his services .
The teacher ’s photocopy machine offered an endless supply of cash so his bank rapidly pushed tens of thousands of dollars into the classroom economy .
The flood of cash rapidly pushed up prices .
Spit - wad shooters started selling for thousands of dollars each .
The rising prices encouraged further borrowing .
The bank had positioned itself at the very center of the economy .
Much of the classroom spun deeply into debt–except for the banker who happily kept amassing his 10 % cut .
The banking industry was booming .**
Part of the classroom however boycotted the raising inflation .
Literally – ” boy ” cott .
In typical grade school fashion the girls did n’t believe in doing business with the boys .
They happily traded with each other in tens and occasionally hundreds of dollars .
They did n’t have a banker raking 10 % off the top of every major transaction , nor did they need one .
The isolated girls economy was breached only once when a girl let one of the boys buy part of her lunch for $ 2,000 — instantly re-aligning the value of cash in the girl ’s economy .
I would have liked to have known what eventually would have happened to the mock economy , but unfortunately about then the teacher decided to bring it to a close and the classroom reverted to the barter system once again .
* After that pay cash .
** The expansion of the US banking industry during the mortgage boom was a very bad sign .
The controlled collapse of the financial sector we ’re seeing today is hopefully the start of a return to sustainable banking .

The Market is Not The Economy
Repeat after me : “ The market is not the economy .
The market is not the economy . ”
Of course the market is doing well .
Geithner , Bair and Bernanke promised to put around $ 2 - $ 3 trillion more into the market in various forms .
Everyone now knows that the Obama administration will do whatever it takes to turn the market and financial sector around — even if that means trillions of dollars of risk for taxpayers .
Rule # 1 of Investing : when the government puts its full muscle behind something , be sure to ride it , and do n’t get in the way .
What you want to watch now are :
Currency Rates
Does the dollar go up or down ?
The government printing and borrowing tons of money may not look so good to foreign debtors .
Or they may decide it ’s the only game in town .

The government printing and borrowing tons of money may not look so good to foreign debtors .

The Treasury Market
Same thing .
Are private investors and foreign governments willing to buy ?
Or will the Fed have to buy more treasuries ?
Same thing .

Oil prices
All of this money is going to show up somewhere , and a lot of people are ( literally ) betting on it showing up in energy prices .
What ’s probably going to happen is a technical recovery that shakes apart based on unacceptable inflation before the recovery has reached a lot of people at the middle and bottom of the economy .
Unless Geithner ’s plan fails in absolute rather than relative terms , in which case there is n’t enough lube in the universe to make what will occur even tolerable , let alone pleasant .
In the meantime , remember that the market is n’t the economy , and unless you ’re connected to the financial sector , odds are you are n’t going to see much of all this money .
The banks are being bailed out , not you .
NASA researchers are on a quest to take the boom out of sonic booms , a development that could lead to a new generation of supersonic aircraft and perhaps even usher in a new era of supersonic passenger flight .
Researchers at Dryden Flight Research Center in California are wrapping up a test program called Lift and Nozzle Change Effects on Tail Shock , which is a wordy way of saying they 're studying the impact that wing lift and exhaust plumes have on shock waves .
It 's an early step toward building aircraft that can break the sound barrier without the telltale boom people on the ground so often object to .
" Big picture :
We want to learn how to build a plane with a low sonic boom , " project manager Tim Moes told Wired.com .
" Understanding shock waves is going to help get us there . "
Airplanes create pressure waves as they move through the air , much like boats create a wake in the water .
When supersonic airplanes exceed the speed of sound — 343.14 meters per second or 767.58 mph ( in dry air at 68 degrees Fahrenheit ) — these waves form shock waves that create a boom when they hit the ground .
Public opposition to the racket is one reason supersonic passenger travel never really caught on in America .
NASA 's attempt to stifle sonic booms is focused on changing the shape of the shock waves — a technique called boom - shaping — to spread them out over a larger area so they sound more like distant thunder .
Earlier experiments focused on shaping the shock wave at the front of the craft ; now NASA is focusing on the rear by experimenting with different wing shapes and air flow over the jet engines .
The tests , known by the acronym LANCETS , uses two F - 15 fighter jets .
The first , shown in the picture above , has been fitted with canards , or small wings , just ahead of the main wings .
" It 's the only F - 15 in the world that has canards , " Moes says .
The canards and engine nozzles can be adjusted in flight , allowing NASA to better understand the role they play in the strength of a shock wave .
Trying to accomplish similar results in conventional aircraft would be impossible without major modifications to the wings .
A second F - 15 outfitted with a nose - cone spike and specialized instrumentation follows close behind , measuring shock waves produced by the lead aircraft .
This " real world " data will help calibrate computer models of how shock waves form .
Once NASA has crunched all the data , the next step is modifying a jet to make its sonic boom more of a sonic rumble .
Such a craft would cost as much as $ 100 million , Moes told New Scientist , and could be airborne within four or five years .

President Obama said the US is grateful for Irish - Americans US President Barack Obama has proclaimed March as Irish - American heritage month .
" I encourage all Americans to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies , programmes , and activities , " said President Obama .
" Irish - Americans are integral to the rich fabric of the US , and we are grateful for their service . "
He said he wanted to honour " their journey and their lasting contributions to the history and culture of the US " .
" Following the colonial migrations , the United States enjoyed the greatest influx of Irish during the 1840s as Ireland suffered the Great Famine , " he said .
" Hungry but hopeful , poor but perseverant , Irish - Americans seized the opportunity to work hard , enjoy success , and pursue the American Dream .
' Leaders '
" Many took on the difficult work of constructing America 's infrastructure .
Others assumed positions of leadership .
" Among those leaders were signers of the Declaration of Independence and Presidents of the United States .
Still others enjoyed great success and influence in the arts and literature .
Many US cities stage huge St Patrick 's Day celebrations " From social activists to business leaders , athletes to clergy , and first responders to soldiers , distinguished Irish - Americans have made indelible contributions to our national identity .
" Today , tens of millions of Irish - Americans can look back with pride on the legacy of their forebears . "
Stella O'Leary , of the Irish - American Democrats , said : " We 're getting a great reaction to it . "
" People are saying it 's wonderful , they 're delighted we 're being acknowledged .
" The White House issues these proclamations to honour various ethnic groups .
" We 're not the only ones , there 's an African - American heritage month , and an Indian one . "
Ms O'Leary said she believed the idea for the proclamation for Irish - Americans came from the president himself .
" In my brief conversations that I 've had with him , he tells me that he 's very proud of his own Irish ancestry in County Offaly .
" I think he 's very conscious of his Irish associations . "

Blackwater Worldwide has changed its name to Xe ( pronounced zee ) .
A spokesman said the company 's rebranding effort reflects a change of business focus .
Like Philip Morris ( aka Altria ) and ValueJet ( now AirTran ) , the timing makes us think different .
In January five former Blackwater contractors pleaded not guilty to charges linked to the killing of 17 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad .
The firm was involved in nearly 200 shootings in Iraq since 2005 , according to a congressional report .
Famousnamechanges.net tracks those who seek to reinvent themselves in a word - whether Backrub ( we call it Google ) or Natalie Hershlag ( Star Wars star Portman ) .
Do you think this Xe will make us forget about Blackwater ?

It ’s new fun in some Russian cities , to jump from the bridge with the rope in a big group , when there is no water under the bridge but raw firm ice , also they use to jump at that same moment when the train is going thru the bridge – just imagine what the machinist could think when he sees a bunch of people standing on the rails just before the moving train , so he probably starts slowing down and then all those people jump out of the bridge …
And then police came …

I 'm tired .
I 'm tired of the career politicians who do nothing but deny knowledge and lay blame on others in an effort to do nothing more than save their own political skins to the detriment of you and me .
Politicians like Chris Dodd who said on Tuesday March 17th that he absolutely had nothing to do with the language in the bailout bill that allowed AIG bonuses to be paid by Feb.
11th with bailout money .
Then today , March 18th , he appeared on CNN and in his words : " stepped up to the plate " ( political talk for doing the right thing , which is a big deal inside the beltway ) and said that " people " from the treasury department came to him and asked him to add an amendment ( loophole ) to the AIG bailout bill at the last minute to allow for the payment of bonuses .
When asked who these " people " were he said he did n't know exact names .
He also said that he did n't write the amendment and did n't know what exactly it said , even though his name was on it .
What a load of bulls * *t.
Especially considering Sen .
Dodd was the biggest recipient of AIG - related donations in the 2008 presidential campaign cycle .
To his credit he did apologize for the " confusion " ( more political talk for lying and getting caught ) .
I 'm tired of the federal government , in their holier - than - thou arrogance , prosecuting people for " lying to federal prosecutors " or " lying to federal investigators " .
Are you kidding me ?
It 's logistically impossible for anyone to lie on a greater scale and with more profound consequences to our country than what the government engages in on a daily basis .
I 'm tired of the shenanigans of these bloated politicians assuming that I 'm an idiot and do n't get it .
I 'm tired of being told we live in a democracy and can vote for whomever we want when there are only 2 candidates on my ballot and if I vote for whom I want , and his name is not on the ballot , then my vote will not be counted .
I 'm tired of being associated with the herd of sheep mindlessly being herded towards the slaughter house with the doors wide open and feeling as if we somehow deserve our oncoming fate .
I 'm tired of reading about how we need more people like Ron Paul in office so we can make a peaceful change from the inside out .
Well Dr. Paul , bless his heart , has been on the inside for a long time as the government continues to grow to universal proportions and he continues to be marginalized .
I was born in 1963 and my whole life someone has been protesting : the Vietnam war , President Nixon , stagflation , the Iran contra scandal , the S&L bailout , slick Willy 's hummer in the oval office , G.W. 's private war and now the socialization of our nation .
AND NOTHING CHANGES .
How many dot com's are there out there for policing the government ?
This tax group and that tax group ; this civil rights group and that one .
And for all their well - intentioned , valiant efforts the government continues to grow in size and power and our civil liberties , our American dream continues to die .
I 'm tired of working as an indentured slave in order to fund the federal government 's antics with special interests and high - stakes fundraisers .
I 'm tired of the police state coming into my car , my home , my life assuming that I do n't have the common sense that the good lord gave me so they have to be my moral compass ; what a joke !
I 'm tired of the uneducated majority continuing to elect one puppet after another .
It 's become obvious that the time for peaceful measures is long past .
No monarchy , no despot , no tyrannical government has ever been brought down without blood - shed and ours will be no different .
It 's time to strike the federal government at the heart .
The problem is that the federal government is at the top of the social food chain : they have the military and the money .
There 's not much we can do about the military but I propose we do something about the money .
If we just simply stop funding the vile , infectious vermin in our government then they will have no choice but to stop doing what they are doing .
My first thoughts about this were to calculate what my share of a constitutional government would be and to only pay that amount in income taxes : defense , treasury , executive , legislative , judicial etc … I rejected that idea though for the following reasons :
Over the course of my working life , I 've already paid more than my share to fund a constitutionally legal government for the duration of my life .
As I mentioned earlier : the time for half measures is long past .
A measure is needed that will actually make a difference and kick these sons - a - bitches in the ass .
Therefore , I have gone to my HR department at work and doubled my allowances on my W - 4 from 5 to 10 .
I 'm going to do whatever I need to do to make sure that during the year I pay as close to $ 0 in income tax as possible .
Then in April rather than filing a tax return I 'm going to file my personal declaration of independence from the federal government .
Not a declaration of independence from the United States but rather from the despotic government that enslaves her .
I realize the consequences this will mean for me and my family ( I have two children 10 and 4 ) , but I 'm tired .
It will be the most meaningful thing , the most important thing , the most patriotic thing that maybe I 've ever done .
I 'm finished being an enabler .
I 'm doing it for my family and all the other families that suffer .
I 'm doing it for the courageous people that have come before me .
People who have had the intellect and courage to speak regardless of the consequences : Cindy Sheehan , Ron Paul , Peter Schiff and others .
Shame on us if we do n't do whatever needs to be done to change things .
We need to fight smarter not harder and if we can't outfox the numb - nuts in congress and B.O. then shame on us .
I 'm just tired of the bulls **t!

The pointed - set monad
Chatting with Andres Löh , I wondered :
Is the following pointed - set monad useful , besides for analyzing focus in natural language ( Rooth 1985 , 1996 ) ?
data Pointed a = Pointed a [ a ] deriving ( Eq , Ord , Show , Read ) toList ( Pointed x xs ) = x:xs instance Monad Pointed where return x = Pointed x [ ]
Pointed x xs >>= k = Pointed y ( ys ++ ( xs >>= toList.k ) ) where Pointed y ys = k x
Here is an example of use :
* Main > Pointed 3 [ 4 ] >>= \x -> Pointed x [ x * 10 , x*20 ] Pointed 3 [ 30,60,4,40,80 ]
Ok , I know , I should put it on Hackage .
Is there a corresponding monad transformer ?

Pythagoras .
“ Magic is the Highest , most Absolute , and most Divine Knowledge of Natural Philosophy , advanced in its works and wonderful operations by a right understanding of the inward and occult virtue of things ; so that true Agents being applied to proper Patients , strange and admirable effects will thereby be produced .
Whence magicians are profound and diligent searchers into Nature ; they , because of their skill , know how to anticipate an effect , the which to the vulgar shall seem to be a miracle . ”
The Goetia of the Lemegeton of King Solomon .
“ Wherever sympathetic magic occurs in its pure unadulterated form , it is assumed that in nature one event follows another necessarily and invariably without the intervention of any spiritual or personal agency .
Thus its fundamental conception is identical with that of modern science ; underlying the whole system is a faith , implicit but real and firm , in the order and uniformity of nature .
The magician does not doubt that the same causes will always produce the same effects , that the performance of the proper ceremony accompanied by the appropriate spell , will inevitably be attended by the desired results , unless , indeed , his incantations should chance to be thwarted and foiled by the more potent charms of another sorcerer .
He supplicates no higher power : he sues the favour of no fickle and wayward being : he abases himself before no awful deity .
Yet his power , great as he believes it to be , is by no means arbitrary and unlimited .
He can wield it only so long as he strictly conforms to the rules of his art , or to what may be called the laws of nature as conceived by him .
To neglect these rules , to break these laws in the smallest particular is to incur failure , and may even expose the unskilful practitioner himself to the utmost peril .
If he claims a sovereignty over nature , it is a constitutional sovereignty rigorously limited in its scope and exercised in exact conformity with ancient usage .
Thus the analogy between the magical and the scientific conceptions of the world is close .
In both of them the succession of events is perfectly regular and certain , being determined by immutable laws , the operation of which can be foreseen and calculated precisely ; the elements of caprice , of chance , and of accident are banished from the course of nature .
Both of them open up a seemingly boundless vista of possibilities to him who knows the causes of things and can touch the secret springs that set in motion the vast and intricate mechanism of the world .
Hence the strong attraction which magic and science alike have exercised on the human mind ; hence the powerful stimulus that both have given to the pursuit of knowledge .
They lure the weary enquirer , the footsore seeker , on through the wilderness of disappointment in the present by their endless promises of the future : they take him up to he top of an exceeding high mountain and shew him , beyond the dark clouds and rolling mists at his feet , a vision of the celestial city , far off , it may be , but radiant with unearthly splendour , bathed in the light of dreams . ”
Dr. J. G. FRAZER , “ The Golden Bough ” .
“ So far , therefore , as the public profession of magic has been one of the roads by which men have passed to supreme power , it has contributed to emancipate mankind from the thraldom of tradition and to elevate them into a larger , freer life , with a broader outlook on the world .
This is no small service rendered to humanity .
And when we remember further that in another direction magic has paved the way for science , we are forced to admit that if the black art has done much evil , it has also been the source of much good ; that if it is the child of error , it has yet been the mother of freedom and truth . “
Ibid .
“ Prove all things ; hold fast that which is good . ”

“ The word of the Law is [ in Greek ] Thelema . ”
LIBER AL vel xxxi : The Book of the Law .
This book is for
ALL :
for every man , woman , and child .
My former work has been misunderstood , and its scope limited , by my use of technical terms .
It has attracted only too many dilettanti and eccentrics , weaklings seeking in “ Magic ” an escape from reality .
I myself was first consciously drawn to the subject in this way .
And it has repelled only too many scientific and practical minds , such as I most designed to influence .
But
MAGICK
is for
ALL .
I have written this book to help the Banker , the Pugilist , the Biologist , the Poet , the Navvy , the Grocer , the Factory Girl , the Mathematician , the Stenographer , the Golfer , the Wife , the Consul — and all the rest — to fulfil themselves perfectly , each in his or her own proper function .
Let me explain in a few words how it came about that I blazoned the word
MAGICK
upon the Banner that I have borne before me all my life .
Before I touched my teens , I was already aware that I was THE BEAST whose number is 666 .
I did not understand in the least { XI} what that implied ; it was a passionately ecstatic sense of identity .
In my third year at Cambridge , I devoted myself consciously to the Great Work , understanding thereby the Work of becoming a Spiritual Being , free from the constraints , accidents , and deceptions of material existence .
I found myself at a loss for a name to designate my work , just as H. P. Blavatsky some years earlier .
“ Theosophy ” , “ Spiritualism ” , “ Occultism ” , “ Mysticism ” , all involved undesirable connotations .
I chose therefore the name .
“ MAGICK ”
as essentially the most sublime , and actually the most discredited , of all the available terms .
I swore to rehabilitate
MAGICK ,
to identify it with my own career ; and to compel mankind to respect , love , and trust that which they scorned , hated and feared .
I have kept my Word .
But the time is now come for me to carry my banner into the thick of the press of human life .
I must make
MAGICK
the essential factor in the life of
ALL .
In presenting this book to the world , I must then explain and justify my position by formulating a definition of
MAGICK
and setting forth its main principles in such a way that
ALL
may understand instantly that their souls , their lives , in every relation with every other human being and every circumstance , depend upon
MAGICK
and the right comprehension and right application thereof .
I ) DEFINITION .
Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will .
( Illustration :
It is my Will to inform the World of certain facts within my knowledge .
I therefore take “ magickal weapons ” , pen , ink , and paper ; I write “ incantations ” — these sentences — in the “ magickal language ” ie , that which is understood by the people I wish to instruct ; I call forth “ spirits ” , such as printers , publishers , booksellers and so forth and constrain them to convey my message to those people .
The composition and distribution of this book is thus an act of Magick by which I cause Changes to take place in conformity with my Will . )
In one sense Magick may be defined as the name given to Science by the vulgar .
II ) POSTULATE .
ANY required change may be effected by the application of the proper kind and degree of Force in the proper manner , through the proper medium to the proper object .
( Illustration : I wish to prepare an ounce of Chloride of Gold .
I must take the right kind of acid , nitro - hydrochloric and no other , in a vessel which will not break , leak or corrode , in such a manner as will not produce undesirable results , with the necessary quantity of Gold : and so forth .
Every change has its own conditions .
In the present state of our knowledge and power some changes are not possible in practice ; we cannot cause eclipses , for instance , or transform lead into tin , or create men from mushrooms .
But it is theoretically possible to cause in any object any change of which that object is capable by nature ; and the conditions are covered by the above postulate . )
III ) THEOREMS .
1 ) Every intentional act is a Magickal act .
( Illustration : See “ Definition ” above . )
By “ intentional ” I mean “ willed ” .
But even unintentional acts so seeming are not truly so .
Thus , breathing is an act of the Will to Live .
2 ) Every successful act has conformed to the postulate .
3 ) Every failure proves that one or more requirements of the postulate have not been fulfilled .
( Illustrations :
There may be failure to understand the case , as when a doctor makes a wrong diagnosis , and his treatment injures the patient .
There may be a failure to apply the right kind of force , as when a rustic tries to blow out an electric light .
There may be failure to apply the right degree of force , as when a wrestler has his hold broken , There may be failure to apply the force in the right manner , as when one presents a cheque at the wrong window of the Bank .
There may be failure to employ the correct medium , as when Leonardo da Vinci saw his masterpiece fade away .
The force may be applied to an unsuitable object , as when one tries to crack a stone , thinking it a nut . )
4 ) The first requisite for causing any change is thorough qualitative and quantitative understanding of the conditions .
( Illustration :
The most common cause of failure in life is ignorance of one 's own True Will , or of the means to fulfill that Will .
A man may fancy himself a painter , and waste his life trying to become one ; or he may really be a painter , and yet fail to understand and to measure the difficulties peculiar to that career . )
5 ) The second requisite of causing any change is the practical ability to set in right motion the necessary forces .
( Illustration : A banker may have a perfect grasp of a given situation , yet lack the quality of decision , or the assets , necessary to take advantage of it . )
6 ) “ Every man and every woman is a star ” .
That is to say , every human being is intrinsically an independent individual with his own proper character and proper motion .
7 ) Every man and every woman has a course , depending partly on the self , and partly on the environment which is natural and necessary for each .
Anyone who is forced from his own course , either through not understanding himself , or through external opposition , comes into conflict with the order of the Universe , and suffers accordingly .
( Illustration : A man may think it is his duty to act in a certain way , through having made a fancy picture of himself , instead of investigating his actual nature .
For example , a woman may make herself miserable for life by thinking that she prefers love to social consideration , or vice versa .
One woman may stay with an unsympathetic husband when she would really be happy in an attic with a lover , while another may fool herself into a romantic elopement when her only pleasures are those of presiding over fashionable functions .
Again , a boy 's instinct may tell him to go to sea , while his parents insist on his becoming a doctor .
In such a case he will be both unsuccessful and unhappy in medicine . )
8 ) A Man whose conscious will is at odds with his True Will is wasting his strength .
He cannot hope to influence his environment efficiently .
( Illustration : When Civil War rages in a nation , it is in no condition to undertake the invasion of other countries .
A man with cancer employs his nourishment alike to his own use and to that of the enemy which is part of himself .
He soon fails to resist the pressure of his environment .
In practical life , a man who is doing what his conscience tells him to be wrong will do it very clumsily .
At first ! )
9 ) A Man who is doing his True Will has the inertia of the Universe to assist him .
( Illustration :
The first principle of success in evolution is that the individual should be true to his own nature , and at the same time adapt himself to his environment . )
10 ) Nature is a continuous phenomenon , though we may not know in all cases how things are connected .
( Illustration : Human consciousness depends on the properties of protoplasm , the existence of which depends on innumerable physical conditions peculiar to this planet ; and this planet is determined by the mechanical balance of the whole universe of matter .
We may then say that our consciousness is causally connected with the remotest galaxies ; yet we do not even know how it arises from–or with –the molecular changes in the brain . )
11 ) Science enables us to take advantage of the continuity of Nature by the empirical application of certain principles whose interplay involves different orders of idea connected with each other in a way beyond our present comprehension .
( Illustration :
We are able to light cities by rule - of - thumb methods .
We do not know what consciousness is , or how it is connected with muscular action ; what electricity is or how it is connected with the machines that generate it ; and our methods depend on calculations involving mathematical ideas which have no correspondence in the Universe as we know it . )
For instance “ irrational ” , “ unreal ” and “ infinite ” expressions .
12 ) Man is ignorant of the nature of his own being and powers .
Even his idea of his limitations is based on experience of the past , and every step in his progress extends his empire .
There is therefore no reason to assign theoretical limits
note : i.e. , except — possibly — in the case of logically absurd questions such as the Schoolmen discussed in connection with “ God ” .
to what he may be , or what he may do .
( Illustration : A generation ago it was supposed theoretically impossible that man should ever know the composition of the fixed stars .
It is known that our senses are adapted to receive only a fraction of the possible rates of vibration .
Modern instruments have enabled us to detect some of these supra-sensibles by indirect methods , and even to use their peculiar qualities in the service of man , as in the case of the rays of Hertz and Roentgen .
As Tyndall said , man might at any moment learn to perceive and utilize vibrations of all conceivable and inconceivable kinds .
The question of Magick is a question of discovering and employing hitherto unknown forces in nature .
We know that they exist , and we cannot doubt the possibility of mental or physical instruments capable of bringing us into relation with them . )
13 ) Every man is more or less aware that his individuality comprises several orders of existence , even when he maintains that his subtler principles are merely symptomatic of the changes in his gross vehicle .
A similar order may be assumed to extend throughout nature .
( Illustration :
One does not confuse the pain of a toothache with the decay that causes it .
Inanimate objects are sensitive to certain physical forces , such as electrical and thermal conductivity ; but neither in us nor in them–so far as we know –is there any direct conscious perception of these forces .
Imperceptible influences are therefore associated with all material phenomena ; and there is no reason why we should not work upon matter through these subtle energies as we do through their material bases .
In fact , we use magnetic force to move iron and solar radiation to reproduce images . )
14 ) Man is capable of being , and using , anything which he perceives , for everything which he perceives is in a certain sense a part of his being .
He may thus subjugate the whole of the Universe of which he is conscious to his individual Will .
( Illustration : Man has used the idea of God to dictate his personal conduct , to obtain power over his fellows , to excuse his crimes , and for innumerable other purposes , including that of realizing himself as God .
He has used the irrational and unreal conceptions of mathematics to help him in the construction of mechanical devices .
He has used his moral force to influence the actions even of wild animals .
He has employed poetic genius for political purposes . )
15 ) Every force in the Universe is capable of being transformed into any other kind of force by using suitable means .
There is thus an inexhaustible supply of any particular kind of force that we may need .
( Illustration : Heat may be transformed into light and power by using it to drive dynamos .
The vibrations of the air may be used to kill men by so ordering them in speech so as to inflame war - like passions .
The hallucinations connected with the mysterious energies of sex result in the perpetuation of the species . )
16 ) The application of any given force affects all the orders of being which exist in the object to which it is applied , whichever of of those orders is directly affected .
( Illustration :
If I strike a man with a dagger , his consciousness , not his body only , is affected by my act , although the dagger , as such , has no direct relation therewith .
Similarly , the power of my thought may so work on the mind of another person as to produce far - reaching physical changes in him , or in others through him . )
17 ) A man may learn to use any force so as to serve any purpose , by taking advantage of the above theorems .
( Illustration : A man may use a razor to make himself vigilant over his speech , by using it to cut himself whenever he unguardedly utters a chosen word .
He may serve the same purpose by resolving that every incident of his life shall remind him of a particular thing , making every impression the starting point of a connected series of thoughts ending in that thing .
He might also devote his whole energies to some one particular object , by resolving to do nothing at variance therewith , and to make every act turn to the advantage of that object . )
18 ) He may attract to himself any force of the Universe by making himself a fit receptacle for it , and arranging conditions so that its nature compels it to flow toward him .
( Illustration :
If I want pure water to drink , I dig a well in a place where there is underground water ; I prevent it from leaking away ; and I arrange to take advantage of water 's accordance with the laws of Hydrostatics to fill it . )
19 ) Man 's sense of himself as separate from , and opposed to , the Universe is a bar to his conducting its currents .
It insulates him .
( Illustration : A popular leader is most successful when he forgets himself and remembers only “ The Cause ” .
Self - seeking engenders jealousies and schism .
When the organs of the body assert their presence other by silent satisfaction , it is a sign they are diseased .
The single exception is the organ of reproduction .
Yet even in this case its self - assertion bears witness to its dissatisfaction with itself , since it cannot fulfil its function until completed by its counterpart in another organism . )
20 ) Man can only attract and employ the forces for which he is really fitted .
( Illustration :
You can not make a silk purse out of a sow's ear .
A true man of science learns from every phenomenon .
But Nature is dumb to the hypocrite ; for in her there is nothing false . )
It is no objection that the hypocrite is himself part of Nature .
He is an “ endothermic ” product , divided against himself , with a tendency to break up .
He will see his own qualities everywhere , and thus obtain a radical misconception of phenomena .
Most religions of the past have failed by expecting nature to conform with their ideals of proper conduct .
21 ) There is no limit to the extent of the relations of any man with the Universe in essence ; for as soon as man makes himself one with any idea the means of measurement cease to exist .
But his power to utilize that force is limited by his mental power and capacity , and by the circumstances of his human environment .
( Illustration :
When a man falls in love , the whole world becomes , to him , nothing but love boundless and immanent ; but his mystical state is not contagious ; his fellow - men are either amused or annoyed .
He can only extend to others the effect which his love has had upon himself by means of his mental and physical qualities .
Thus Catullus , Dante and Swinburne made their love a mighty mover of mankind by virtue of their power to put their thoughts on the subject in musical and eloquent language .
Again , Cleopatra and other people in authority moulded the fortunes of many other people by allowing love to influence their political actions .
The Magician , however well he succeed in making contact with the secret sources of energy in nature , can only use them to the extent permitted by his intellectual and moral qualities .
Mohammed 's intercourse with Gabriel was only effective because of his statesmanship , soldiership , and the sublimity of his command of Arabic .
Hertz 's discovery of the rays which we now use for wireless telegraphy was sterile until it reflected through the minds and wills of the people who could take his truth and transmit it to the world of action by means of mechanical and economic instruments . )
22 ) Every individual is essentially sufficient to himself .
But he is unsatisfactory to himself until he has established himself in his right relation with the universe .
( Illustration : A microscope , however perfect , is useless in the hands of savages .
A poet , however sublime , must impose himself upon his generation if he is to enjoy ( and even to understand ) himself , as theoretically should be the case . )
23 ) Magick is the Science of understanding oneself and one 's conditions .
It is the Art of applying that understanding in action .
( Illustration : A golf club is intended to move a special ball in a special way in special circumstances .
A Niblick should rarely be used on the tee or a brassie under the bank of a bunker .
But also , the use of any club demands skill and experience . )
24 ) Every man has an indefeasible right to be what he is .
( Illustration :
To insist that any one else should comply with one 's own standards is to outrage , not only him , but oneself , since both parties are equally born of necessity . )
25 ) Every man must do Magick each time he acts or even thinks , since a thought is an internal act whose influence ultimately affects action , though it may not do so at the time .
( Illustration :
The least gesture causes a change in a man 's own body and in the air around him ; it disturbs the balance of the entire Universe , and its effects continue eternally throughout all space .
Every thought , however swiftly suppressed , has its effect on the mind .
It stands as one of the causes of every subsequent thought , and tends to influence every subsequent action .
A golfer may lose a few yards on his drive , a few more with his second and third , he may lie on the green six bare inches too far from the hole , but the net result of these trifling mishaps is the difference between halving and losing the hole . )
26 ) Every man has a right , the right of self preservation , to fulfill himself to the utmost .
Men of “ criminal nature ” are simply at issue with their true Wills .
The murderer has the Will to Live ; and his will to murder is a false will at variance with his true Will , since he risks death at the hands of Society by obeying his criminal impulse .
( Illustration : A function imperfectly performed injures , not only itself , but everything associated with it .
If the heart is afraid to beat for fear of disturbing the liver , the liver is starved for blood and avenges itself on the heart by upsetting digestion , which disorders respiration , on which cardiac welfare depends . )
27 ) Every man should make Magick the keystone of his life .
He should learn its laws and live by them .
( Illustration : The Banker should discover the real meaning of his existence , the real motive which led him to choose that profession .
He should under - stand banking as a necessary factor in the economic existence of mankind instead of merely a business whose objects are independent of the general welfare .
He should learn to distinguish false values from real , and to act not on accidental fluctuations but on considerations of essential importance .
Such a banker will prove himself superior to others ; because he will not be an individual limited by transitory things , but a force of Nature , as impersonal , impartial and eternal as gravitation , as patient and irresistible as the tides .
His system will not be subject to panic , any more than the law of Inverse Squares is disturbed by elections .
He will not be anxious about his affairs because they will not be his ; and for that reason he will be able to direct them with the calm , clear - headed confidence of an onlooker , with intelligence unclouded by self - interest , and power unimpaired by passion . )
28 ) Every man has a right to fulfill his own will without being afraid that it may interfere with that of others ; for if he is in his proper place , it is the fault of others if they interfere with him .
( Illustration :
If a man like Napoleon were actually appointed by destiny to control Europe , he should not be blamed for exercising his rights .
To oppose him would be an error .
Any one so doing would have made a mistake as to his own destiny , except insofar as it might be necessary for him to learn the lessons of defeat .
The sun moves in space without interference .
The order of nature provides an orbit for each star .
A clash proves that one or the other has strayed from its course .
But as to each man that keeps his true course , the more firmly he acts , the less likely others are to get in his way .
His example will help them to find their own paths and pursue them .
Every man that becomes a Magician helps others to do likewise .
The more firmly and surely men move , and the more such action is accepted as the standard of morality , the less will conflict and confusion hamper humanity . )
I hope that the above principles will demonstrate to
ALL
that their welfare , their very existence , is bound up in
MAGICK .
I trust that they will understand , not only the reasonableness , but the necessity of the fundamental truth which I was the means of giving to mankind :
“ Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law . ” I trust that they will assert themselves as individually absolute , that they will grasp the fact that it is their right to assert themselves , and to accomplish the task for which their nature fits them .
Yea , more , that this is their duty , and that not only to themselves but to others , a duty founded upon universal necessity , and not to be shirked on account of any casual circumstances of the moment which may seem to put such conduct in the light of inconvenience or even of cruelty .
I hope that the principles outlined above will help them to understand this book , and prevent them from being deterred from its study by the more or less technical language in which it is written .
The essence of
MAGICK
is simple enough in all conscience .
It is not otherwise with the art of government .
The Aim is simply prosperity ; but the theory is tangled , and the practice beset with briars .
In the same way
MAGICK
is merely to be and to do .
I should add : “ to suffer ” .
For Magick is the verb ; and it is part of the Training to use the passive voice .
This is , however , a matter of Initiation rather than of Magick in its ordinary sense .
It is not my fault if being is baffling , and doing desperate !
Yet , once the above principles are firmly fixed in the mind , it is easy enough to sum up the situation very shortly .
One must find out for oneself , and make sure beyond doubt , “ who ” one is , “ what ” one is , “ why ” one is .
This done , one may put the will which is implicit in the “ Why ” into words , or rather into One Word .
Being thus conscious of the proper course to pursue , the next thing is to understand the conditions necessary to following it out .
After that , one must eliminate from oneself every element alien or hostile to success , and develop those parts of oneself which are specially needed to control the aforesaid conditions .
Let us make an analogy .
A nation must become aware of its own character before it can be said to exist .
From that knowledge it must divine its destiny .
It must then consider the political conditions of the world ; how other countries may help it or hinder it .
It must then destroy it itself any elements discordant with its destiny .
Lastly , it must develop in itself those qualities which will enable it to combat successfully the external conditions which threaten to oppose is purpose .
We have had a recent example in the case of the young German Empire , which , knowing itself and its will , disciplined and trained itself so that it conquered the neighbours which had oppressed it for so many centuries .
But after 1866 and 1870 , 1914 !
It mistook itself for superhuman , it willed a thing impossible , it failed to eliminate its own internal jealousies , it failed to understand the conditions of victory ,
At least , it allowed England to discover its intentions , and so to combine the world against it .
{ WEH NOTE :
This footnote in Crowley 's text belongs to this page , but it is not marked in the text .
I have assigned it this tentative point , as following the general context .
it did not train itself to hold the sea , and thus , having violated every principle of
MAGICK ,
it was pulled down and broken into pieces by provincialism and democracy , so that neither individual excellence nor civic virtue has yet availed to raise it again to that majestic unity which made so bold a bid for the mastery of the race of man .
The sincere student will discover , behind the symbolic technicalities of his book , a practical method of making himself a Magician .
The processes described will enable him to discriminate between what he actually is , and what he has fondly imagined himself to be .
Professor Sigmund Freud and his school have , in recent years , discovered a part of this body of Truth , which has been taught for many centuries in the Sanctuaries of Initiation .
But failure to grasp the fullness of Truth , especially that implied in my Sixth Theorem ( above ) and its corollaries , has led him and his followers into the error of admitting that the avowedly suicidal “ Censor ” is the proper arbiter of conduct .
Official psycho-analysis is therefore committed to upholding a fraud , although the foundation of the science was the observation of the disastrous effects on the individual of being false to his Unconscious Self , whose “ writing on the wall ” in dream language is the record of the sum of the essential tendencies of the true nature of the individual .
The result has been that psycho-analysts have misinterpreted life , and announced the absurdity that every human being is essentially an anti-social , criminal , and insane animal .
It is evident that the errors of the Unconscious of which the psycho-analysts complain are neither more nor less than the ” original sin ” of the theologians whom they despise so heartily .
He must behold his soul in all its awful nakedness , he must not fear to look on that appalling actuality .
He must discard the gaudy garments with which his shame has screened him ; he must accept the fact that nothing can make him anything but what he is .
He may lie to himself , drug himself , hide himself ; but he is always there .
Magick will teach him that his mind is playing him traitor .
It is as if a man were told that tailors ' fashion - plates were the canon of human beauty , so that he tried to make himself formless and featureless like them , and shuddered with horror at the idea of Holbein making a portrait of him .
Magick will show him the beauty and majesty of the self which he has tried to suppress and disguise .
Having discovered his identity , he will soon perceive his purpose .
Another process will show him how to make that purpose pure and powerful .
He may then learn how to estimate his environment , learn how to make allies , how to make himself prevail against all powers whose error has caused them to wander across his path .
In the course of this Training , he will learn to explore the Hidden Mysteries of Nature , and to develop new senses and faculties in himself , whereby he may communicate with , and control , Beings and Forces pertaining to orders of existence which have been hitherto inaccessible to profane research , and available only to that unscientific and empirical
MAGICK
( of tradition ) which I came to destroy in order that I might fulfil .
I send this book into the world that every man and woman may take hold of life in the proper manner .
It does not matter of one 's present house of flesh be the hut of a shepherd ; by virtue of my
MAGICK
he shall be such a shepherd as David was .
If it be the studio of a sculptor , he shall so chisel from himself the marble that masks his idea that he shall be no less a master than Rodin .

A right - wing pundit has been caught red-handed manufacturing controversy after claiming US President Barack Obama 's Wikipedia page was being whitewashed , in a scandal that fooled big news outlets including Fox News .
Aaron Klein , the Jerusalem bureau chief at online news publication WorldNetDaily ( WND ) , reported that Obama 's Wikipedia entry was far too positive and did not mention his claimed links with controversial pastor Jeremiah Wright and " Weatherman terrorist " Bill Ayers .
The entry also did not mention concerns surrounding Obama 's eligibility to serve as US commander - in - chief due to an alleged lack of proof that he was born in the US , Klein said .
But Klein neglected to mention that there was an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to the Obama citizenship claims .
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
As stocks on Friday tallied another month of stiff losses , investors were especially focused on the S&P 500 Index , with the broad market gauge closing below its November lows -- and also below the 740 - to - 750 range some had hoped for .
" Only on a two - day close below 740 will I run for the hills .
A close over 740 today would be considered a successful test of the November 2008 low , " said Elliot Spar , market strategist at Stifel Nicolaus .
The S&P closed at 752.44 on Nov. 20 , though the benchmark on Monday undercut that prior bear - market low .
The S&P 500 SPX , - 0.48 % fell points to 17.74 points , or 2.4 % , to 735.09 , giving it a weekly loss of 4.5 % and a monthly hit of 11 % .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % shed 119.15 points , or 1.7 % , to 7,062.93 , leaving it with a weekly loss of 4.5 % and a monthly decline of 11.7 % .
" Hopefully we can get back to 800 on the S&P , but first we have to get past resistance at 752 .
If we can close above that one resistance level I think it would be a mild positive , " said Robert Pavlik , chief market strategist at Banyan Partners LLC .
On Friday , financials led the declines , with Citigroup Inc. C , - 2.12 % down 39 % on news the U.S. government was hiking its stake in the battered bank .

February falls
After a horrendous January , stocks presented a like scenario for February .
The S&P 's finish was its worst since the 731.54 hit at the close of Dec. 18 , 1996 , with its percentage decline in February proving to be the second - worst on record following the 18.4 % hit that came in 1933 .
After the worst January performance in its 113 - year history , the Dow industrials tallied the index 's worst February point decline , and its second - worst percentage drop since 1933 , when it lost 15.6 % .
The Nasdaq decline proved its worst percentage drop since 2001 , when it discarded 22.67 % of its value .
" For the session we are going to see a disproportionate amount of attention given to the close on the S&P , and whether we see a close below the cycle low from November that would signal potential large losses , " said Alan Ruskin , an analyst with RBS Greenwich Capital , in comments ahead of the opening bell .
For the S&P , " the 740 to 750 area that we 've been hanging around here is pretty important because that is where we 've seen support in 2002 and 2003 .
Below that there is really not a lot of market support from a technical perspective , " said Paul Nolte , director of investments at Hinsdale Associates .
Last week we covered 5 Websites to Scan for Viruses Online .
This week we continue the fight against viruses with ten pieces of completely free software that will help protect you from autorun.inf viruses .
The autorun.inf file is used to automatically launch applications on CDs / DVDs / Flash drives etc .
This becomes really useful when you want to display a menu that allows the user to view the contents of the CD or to start presentations and so on .
However , over the last two years the autorun.inf file has been used by viruses and worms to automatically launch themselves and thus effect computers .
These viruses are all from less harmful blocking of sites ( like the popular Orkut virus ) to wrecking total havoc on your system requiring a complete reinstall of the operating system .
Since then , antivirus software have become smarter at detecting and removing these viruses and worms .
In addition to this , you have a complete dedicated set of applications that help you protect your computer from autorun.inf viruses .
Without further ado , here ’s a list of some of them .
Autorun Protector is a two way protection standalone software that prevents your PC from infecting with autorun worms and also protecting your removable device from being infected from other sources .
Hence , it decreases the spread of the worms .
In addition , it also come with additional features like custom protected autorun.inf file , removing of autorun.inf & resolving drive opening issue .
i Kill prevents the spread of viruses / trojans through autorun.inf files .
It works by scanning the drives for the presence of removable drives .
If found , it parses the autorun.inf file for the executables it may run .
If AutoProtect is enabled , it will automatically delete the files present on the drive .
otherwise , you will be asked if you want the suspected files deleted .
Autorun Eater was born due to increase of malwares using the â€˜autorun .
infâ€™ tactic to infect users unknowingly be it from flash drives , removable hard disks or any other removable storage device .
When an infected device is infected with a malware and an â€˜autorun .
infâ€™ file is dropped , the shell menu is normally modified to execute the malware whenever the unsuspecting user double - clicks the infected drive .
Autorun Eater will remove any suspicious â€˜autorun .
infâ€™ files even before the user attempts to access the drive .
This files are auto - backupâ€™ed in case of false positives .
This ninja awaits quietly in the system tray for the times whenever a USB pendisk is inserted on the computer which will be examined to uncover the commonly malicious or virulent files known as “ autorun.inf ” and “ ctfmon.exe ” amongst many others .
AutorunRemover checks the Autorun files on your all drives and asks you to delete them if it appears dangerous for you computer .
USB FireWall blocks all virus and other wilful programs that try to spread in your system when an USB device is inserted .
The application runs in background task and alerts you immediately in case of try of intrusion .
You can stop the program and delete the file associated with .
USB FireWall doesnâ€™t need any virus definition update .
USB FireWall can too clean your hard disk partition from auto launched application .
Noob Killer is a small tool designed to easily rid common worms and viruses , it has many useful tools that would help users and administrators get back control and clean their PC ’s / Workstations .
a -squared HiJackFree is a detailed system analysis tool which helps advanced users to detect and remove all types of HiJackers , Spyware , Adware , Trojans and Worms .
In late 2007 , hundreds of dead seabirds washed up on the shores of the Monterey Bay , just 45 minutes south of San Francisco .
Their feathers were covered in grease , much like oil spill victims .
Yet rescue workers were left scratching their heads when no petroleum could be found in local waters .
" There were no confirmed reports of oil .
That was the first thing that the bird people looked for , " said Raphael Kudela , an oceanographer at the University of California , Santa Cruz .
To investigate the strange incident , Kudela teamed up with researchers from the California Department of Fish and Game ( CDFG ) , the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute ( MBARI ) , and the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories ( MLML ) .
Last Friday , the team published the first report of the incident online in the academic journal Public Library of Science One .
Mystery oil acts like soap
Eighty miles north of where the birds were found , the Cosco Busan oil spill had just dumped 50,000 gallons of oil into the San Francisco Bay .
The two species that kept popping up on the shores of Monterey were loons and grebes — the very birds most commonly affected by winter oil spills in the region .
Yet birds usually wash up in the immediate vicinity of a spill , said Kudela , and no patches of petroleum could be located in the Monterey Bay .
To make matters more confusing , researchers soon discovered the yellow - green slime that coated the birds ' feathers was not petroleum - based .
Like oil , the mystery substance stripped the natural waterproofing from the feathers , killing 207 birds and leaving another 350 soggy , hypothermic , and unable to hunt for food .
Further tests confirmed the slime was protein - based — it had come from a living creature , not an oil well .
The researchers now say the mystery slime is a soap - like protein made by the infamous Red Tide algae , which happened to be in full bloom along the central coast in late 2007 .
" We knew that generally , all [ algae in Red Tide 's class ] are capable of producing proteins like this ( including this particular Red Tide ) , but we had not previously seen this type of an impact . "
Usually , soap - like substances , called surfactants , consist of circular clusters of lipids with opposite charges on either end .
While Kudela and his colleagues were not able to identify this specific compound 's structure , the protein they isolated behaves much like a surfactant .
" It 's highly polar , and forms foam , " says Kudela , who believes the structure consists of two proteins linked together .
Studies with the algae made the protein look even more suspicious .
When samples were swished around in beakers , a sticky , slimy foam formed .
" We grew the algae in the lab , and when we shook it up it produced foam , " says Kudela .
Reports of a dense sea froth had accompanied the incident , and researchers speculate the waves in the ocean acted like a blender .
Because the water was churning hard when the bloom peaked , the algae were crushed open , spilling the proteinaceous soap into the water .

The frequency , size and duration of Red Tides have increased substantially around the world since 2004 , and researchers link the rise to climate change and the impact on surface water temperatures
The final test involved dipping clean feathers into clean and foamy water samples .
It turns out the Red Tide by itself did n't damage the feathers — the foam had to be present .
" We were able to demonstrate that normal bird feathers dipped in the foam became water soaked ( this did n't happen in normal sea water ) , " says Dave Jessup , of the California Department of Fish and Game , Office of Spill Prevention and Response .
Jessup and Kudela worked collaboratively on the project .
" We tested deionized water , laboratory cultures of algae with no foam , and foam we ' made ' in the laboratory with [ Red Tide ] algae .
We also tried mixing in beach sand , to make sure it was n't something else .
In each case , it was the algal foam that caused the problem , " says Kudela .
Researchers speculate the foam concentrates the soap - like proteins , making it possible for them to coat the feathers .
Without this froth , the same proteins in seawater simply wash off .
Warming oceans may mean more slime
" This is an interesting paper because it brings to light a previously unreported mechanism whereby harmful algal blooms ( HABs ) can have deleterious impacts on the health of marine animals , " says David Caron , a biologist at the University of Southern California who did not contribute to the research findings .
" We are presently witnessing an increase in the number and severity of HAB events , and it is essential to document and fully understanding any linkages between harmful algal blooms and ecosystem health , " he says .
The frequency , size and duration of Red Tides have increased substantially around the world since 2004 , and researchers link the rise to climate change and the impact on surface water temperatures .
Red Tide is a dinoflagellate , and goes by Akashiwo sanguinea in scientific circles .
It turns the water a rusty - brown color , and often produces toxins that harm humans and wildlife .

The winter 2007 bloom proved to be benign , with the exception of the foam .
Even the sticky slime proved not to be directly toxic .
" It is , however , very harmful to birds , " adds Kudela .
Birds may not be the only victims , though .
A study published in 1990 linked Red Tide to a mysterious slime that smothers coral reefs in Costa Rica and Panama .
Kudela believes the findings may help answer questions about other mysterious bird - stranding events .
Sometimes a few dozen birds wash up coated in oil , but no spill can be found .
In other news reports , a stream of petroleum appears on the surface of the water , even when there has been no recent leak .
As shipwrecks sometimes take decades to begin leaking oil , mystery bird strandings are often blamed on unidentified sunken ships , even when there is no conclusive evidence of petroleum in the water or any reason to believe the oily birds actually floated above the site of a wreck .
Kudela believes Red Tide may play a role in at least some of these cases .
“ There was another ' mystery spill ' in Monterey about 10 years ago , during a red tide , that caused bird strandings , ” says Kudela “ so we think this has occurred in the past , but has never been associated with Red Tides . ”
After testing samples taken from 283 dead birds , Kudela was able to rule out the presence of any trace petroleum , as well as a long list of other harmful algal byproducts .
Water samples were similarly clean , save for the Red Tide and mystery protein .
Of the 350 rescued animals , about 40 percent recovered and returned to life at sea .

The UK spends more than £ 16bn per year on government databases A quarter of all government databases are illegal and should be scrapped or redesigned , according to a report .
The Joseph Rowntree Reform
Trust says storing information leads to vulnerable people , such as young black men , single parents and children , being victimised .
It says the UK's " database state " wastes billions from the public purse and often breaches human rights laws .
But the government says the report contains " no substantive evidence " on which to base its conclusions .
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the government was " never losing sight " of its obligations under the data protection and human rights acts .
" It takes its responsibilities seriously and will consider any concerns carefully , adapting existing safeguards where necessary , " he added .
The government spends £ 16bn a year on databases and plans to spend a further £ 105bn on projects over five years but does not know the precise number of the " thousands " of systems it operates , the trust claims .
DATABASES CRITICISED ContactPoint :
To hold name , address , gender , date of birth , school and health provider of every child in England National DNA database :
Of 4.5 m people whose genetic fingerprints are on the database , more than 500,000 are innocent , including 39,000 children Communications database :

A profiling tool which examines a child 's behaviour and social background to identify potential child offenders Detailed Care Record :

In the wake of numerous data loss scandals , the cross-party trust - which campaigns for civil liberties and social justice - examined 46 public sector systems .
It said 11 were " almost certainly " illegal under human rights or data protection laws .
These included the national DNA database and ContactPoint , an index of biographical and contact information on all children in England which notes their relationship with public services .
ContactPoint , intended to aid child protection , has been criticised by opponents , who say at £ 224 m it is too costly and could put children at risk if security is lax .
When examining criminal justice systems , the trust discovered one woman 's caution over a playground fight when she was 13 will stay on the Police National Computer until she is 100 .
Meanwhile , the genetic fingerprints of nearly four - in - 10 black men aged under 35 were held on the DNA database in England , where records are not deleted even when people are acquitted or released without charge , the report claimed .
Author , Professor Ross Anderson of Cambridge University , said : " Britain 's database state has become a financial , ethical and administrative disaster which is penalising some of the most vulnerable members of our society . "
Co-author Terri Dowty , director of Action on Rights for Children , said systems such as Onset - a tool for identifying potential youth offenders - can stigmatise youngsters .

With programmes under way to store Onset assessments and make them available to police , the information could cloud officers ' judgement , she said .
Ms Dowty said the fear of being monitored was such that young mothers were covering up their post-natal depression or not taking children to casualty for fear of triggering social services involvement .
Meanwhile , the Department for Work and Pensions is developing an £ 89 m data - sharing system for anyone issued with a National Insurance number , accessible to 140,000 government staff and 445 local authorities .
Staff at 30 councils have already abused the system and information has been made available to private firms , according to the trust .
" The problem with a lot of these information systems is the number of people who have access to them .
It 's the slack attitude to data security which is most worrying , " said Ms Dowty .
The trust wants the government to store data more transparently and to allow sensitive information to be shared only with people 's consent , or at least when subject to clear legal rules .
DATA PROTECTION ACT
People can make a ' subject access request ' to gain - and correct - information held on them by government departments
This also applies to banks , councils , schools , health services , employers , internet and mail order firms Requests are made in writing or by email , stating full name and address including postcode
The act allows you to ask organisations to stop using your information for marketing by mail , phone , fax , email and text message .
You may be refused all or some information , if there is a ' good reason ' - for example , it is being used in criminal investigations Source : Information Commissioner 's Office
But the report claims civil servants and politicians do not want to address the issue in case it damages their career .
" Like Chernobyl , some brave souls need to go in and sort it out , " it says .
Peers on the Lords constitution committee warned last month that electronic surveillance and collection of personal data had become " pervasive " in British society and threatened to undermine democracy .
The Data Protection
Act requires organisations to allow individuals to see and amend information held about them on request , barring a good reason for withholding it - such as that its release would impede a criminal investigation .
It also allows people to demand organisations stop using their details .
Conservative justice spokeswoman Eleanor Laing said : " The government must urgently adopt a principled , proportionate , less centralised approach to collecting personal information that takes real account of our privacy and is based on the consent of individuals and families . "
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said : " In their desperation to track our every move , ministers have created a glut of databases , many of which are quite simply illegal . "
A Home Office spokesman said ministers were committed to " striking the balance " between individuals ' rights and the ability to fight crime , with DNA testing and CCTV providing " clear benefits " .
Tests were carried out to make sure measures were proportionate , transparent and featured safeguards , he said .

Ken Blackwell speaks at a 2006 rally in Cleveland .
Blackwell : Obama plan a partisan ploy
Former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell said Friday President - elect Barack Obama ’s economic stimulus plan is designed in part to give a political edge to Democrats .
Blackwell , a candidate for chair of the Republican National Committee , blasted Obama in a column for the conservative website Townhall.com , writing that the stimulus package “ as currently designed , has serious flaws , some of which convey a partisan advantage . ”

Specifically , Blackwell charged that Obama ’s plans to create hundreds of thousands of government jobs could be a thinly - veiled effort to swell Democratic voter rolls in Maryland and Virginia .
“ Most federal employees , that are not political employees , vote Democrat , ” Blackwell argued .
“ Creating 600,000 new jobs might help cement Virginia in the Democrat column , making it harder for Republicans to retake the White House . ”
In addition , Blackwell also suggested that Democrats would pack the stimulus bill with earmarks targeted at voters in the 2010 midterm election .
He pointed specifically at Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , whose home state of Nevada may receive federal funding for a controversial – and some say frivolous – museum of organized crime .
“ Is that the kind of project that requires emergency federal funding ? ” Blackwell asked rhetorically .
“ Is it irrelevant that Mr. Reid is facing a tough reelection next year ? ”
The former Cincinnati mayor , a favorite target of liberal bloggers due to his role in overseeing Ohio ’s 2004 presidential balloting , has distinguished himself in the RNC contest as the most aggressive and sharply ideological conservative in the field .
In early January he received endorsements from a host of conservative movement leaders , including Family Research Council President Tony Perkins , Eagle Forum founder Phyllis Schlafly , American Conservative Union President David Keene and Virginia RNC Committeeman Morton Blackwell .
The American Religious Identification Survey has released numbers for 2008 ( previous surveys were done in 2001 and 1990 ) .
The theme : Atheism is more popular than ever before , as is overall non-religiosity .
Hallelujah !
Not just that , our numbers are up in every state !
USA Today has fantastic graphics if you want to check them out .
I love the bit where you can see the changes in percentage in each state from 1990 to 2008 .
Watch the circles grow for the non-religious !
What else have we learned ?
Fifteen percent of respondents said they had no religion , an increase from 14.2 percent in 2001 and 8.2 percent in 1990 , according to the American Religious Identification Survey .
Our numbers have doubled in nearly twenty years .
I predict we ’ll see that number grow for another 10 - 20 years before it begins to drop or stabilize .
So many Americans claim no religion at all ( 15 % , up from 8 % in 1990 ) , that this category now outranks every other major U.S. religious group except Catholics and Baptists .
In a nation that has long been mostly Christian , “ the challenge to Christianity … does not come from other religions but from a rejection of all forms of organized religion , ” the report concludes .
We have numbers .
We need to begin effectively using that clout , especially politically .
Northern New England surpassed the Pacific Northwest as the least religious region , with Vermont reporting the highest share of those claiming no religion , at 34 percent . …
“ No other religious bloc has kept such a pace in every state , ” the study ’s authors said .
That ’s fantastic news , though I suppose not all that surprising .
The current survey , being released Monday , found traditional organized religion playing less of a role in many lives .
Thirty percent of married couples did not have a religious wedding ceremony and 27 percent of respondents said they did not want a religious funeral .
Ok , I am surprised by that .
I ’ve been to several weddings in the past year , all of which were religious .
That ’s a small , isolated sample , of course , but I did n’t realize nearly a third of weddings were not religious !
I ’m clearly being invited to the wrong weddings .
The ARIS report should be out while I ’m at work .

Fortunately , I do n't use my printer nearly as much as I used to — but that does n't mean I enjoy paying ridiculous prices for ink .
Imagine if you could replace that pricey ink with old coffee grounds ?

If the RITI coffee printer existed as a real - world product , you could do just that .
The design calls for spent grounds to be poured into a cartridge and for the printing mechanism to be manually moved back and forth to create an image .
I think the whole " manual labor " thing takes the eco-friendly concept a bit too far , but if old coffee could actually be used for ink I would be all for it .
It would also infuse a delightful scent into your resume that would give you the edge on any job application .
Plus you could lick your documents if you were ever really jonesing .

Newswise — School children who receive more recess behave better and are likely to learn more , according to a large study of third - graders conducted by researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University .
The study , published in Pediatrics , suggests that a daily break of 15 minutes or more in the school day may play a role in improving learning , social development , and health in elementary school children .
The study 's principal investigator is Romina M. Barros , M.D. , assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at Einstein .
Dr. Barros looked at data on approximately 11,000 third - graders enrolled in the national Early Childhood Longitudinal Study .
The children , ages 8 to 9 , were divided into two categories : those with no or minimal recess ( less than 15 minutes a day ) and those with more than 15 minutes a day .
There were an equal number of boys and girls .
The children 's classroom behavior was assessed by their teachers using a questionnaire .
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics , free , unstructured play is essential for keeping children healthy , and for helping them reach important social , emotional , and cognitive developmental milestones .
Unstructured play also helps kids manage stress and become resilient .
However , some studies indicate that children are getting less and less unstructured playtime , a trend exacerbated by the 2001 No Child Left Behind Act .
" Many schools responded to No Child Left Behind by reducing the time for recess , the creative arts , and physical education in an effort to focus on reading and mathematics , " says Dr. Barros .
A 2005 survey conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics showed that the 83 percent to 88 percent of children in public elementary schools have recess of some sort .
But the number of recess sessions per day and the duration of the recess periods have been steadily declining .
Since the 1970s , children have lost about 12 hours per week in free time , including a 25 percent decrease in play and a 50 percent decrease in unstructured outdoor activities , according to another study .
The present study shows that children from disadvantaged backgrounds are especially affected by this trend .
" This is a serious concern , " says Dr. Barros .
" We know that many disadvantaged children are not free to roam their neighborhoods , even their own yards , unless they are with an adult .
Recess may be the only opportunity for these kids to practice their social skills with other children . "
" When we restructure our education system , we have to think about the important role of recess in childhood development , " adds Dr. Barros .
" Even if schools do n't have the space , they could give students 15 minutes of indoor activity .
All that they need is some unstructured time . "
Dr. Barros ' coauthors include Ellen J. Silver , Ph.D. , associate professor of pediatrics , and Ruth E.K. Stein , M.D. , professor of pediatrics .
The paper , " School Recess and Group Classroom Behavior , " was published in the February 1 issue of Pediatrics .

Rush whacks
Newt : ' He wishes they were running TV ads against him '
Rush Limbaugh responded to Newt Gingrich 's shot at him with a broadside at the former speaker on today 's show .
" I 'm frankly getting tired of talking about Newt .
I mean , it 's a pointless exercise , " Limbaugh said of Gingrich 's dismissal of him on " Meet the Press . "
" I 'm surprised by nothing when I 'm dealing with people in the media who think they 're in politics .
...
They are fly - by - night operators , and most of them stand for nothing until they see a poll about what the American people want , and then they go out and try to say one way or another what the American people want while trying to falsely hold onto an ideology at the same time — and you can't count on them .
You can't depend on them .
They will sell you out ; they will throw you overboard to save themselves , faster than anything .
And they 'll use you on their way up as often as they can at the same time . "
" I mean , next week Newt could come out and profess his total admiration and love for me if it would serve his purposes , " he continued .
" They 're running TV ads against me .
Newt Gingrich wishes they were running TV ads against him . "
Transcript ( which includes some of the quotes in the video ) after the jump .
RUSH : This is Anna Lee in Grass Valley , California .
Hi .
CALLER : Hi there .
It 's a pleasure to speak to you , Rush .
I listened to your speech to the nation a couple of times , enjoyed every minute of it , and I 'm really confused .
I heard a blurb on Fox News last night that was Newt Gingrich , and I thought he was a friend of yours and in a very derogatory tone , he partially quoted you saying , " I want Obama to fail . "
Now , what 's up with Newt ?
RUSH : Um ...
You know , let 's listen to the sound bites .
You want to listen to the sound bites with me ?
There are two sound bites here .
CALLER : Yours or his ?
RUSH : No , his .
CALLER : Okay .
RUSH : His from Meet the Press .
CALLER : Okay .
RUSH : Where he basically called me " irrational . "
CALLER : I know !
RUSH : I did n't see this .
I do n't know if this was a roundtable or if he was a guest , but he had this exchange with the host , David Gregory .
GINGRICH : You 're irrational if you do n't want the new president to succeed , because if he does n't succeed the country does n't succeed .
So , fifth -- I mean , that 's -- that 's not his --
GREGORY : Do you think Republicans are discordant on that point about whether they want him to fail or succeed ?
GINGRICH : I -- I do n't think anyone should want the president of the United States to fail .
I want some of his policies to be stopped .
GREGORY : Right .
GINGRICH : But I do n't want the president of the United States to fail .
I want him to learn new policies .
RUSH : Uhhh .
CALLER : That 's what I heard , yeah .
RUSH : Yeah .
You know , I 'm frankly getting tired of talking about Newt .
I mean , it 's a pointless exercise .
CALLER : So were you surprised also that he would ...?
RUSH : No .
Let me tell you something .
I 'm learning a lot here in the last three weeks .
I 'm surprised by nothing when I 'm dealing with people in politics , absolutely nothing .
CALLER : Really ?
RUSH : I 'm surprised by nothing when I 'm dealing with people in the media who think they 're in politics .
No , as has always been the case , Anna Lee , the strength and the courage , the energy that I get is from my audience .
I wrote a book once , and one of the chapters is " My Success is Not Determined by Who Wins Elections , " ' cause they come and go .
They are fly - by - night operators , and most of them stand for nothing until they see a poll about what the American people want , and then they go out and try to say one way or another what the American people want while trying to falsely hold onto an ideology at the same time -- and you can't count on them .
You can't depend on them .
They will sell you out ; they will throw you overboard to save themselves , faster than anything .
And they 'll use you on their way up as often as they can at the same time .
So ...
CALLER : Well , he ticked me off , I 'll tell you .
RUSH : Well , it 's not worth the energy .
Here 's the second bite , by the way .
The question Gregory asked him was , " In this environment , is Rush Limbaugh helping or hurting the Republican Party ? "
GINGRICH : Rush -- Rush Limbaugh is in the long run an interesting radio personality who -- it 's like saying --
WOMAN : ( giggling )
You 're being diplomatic .
GINGRICH : No , it 's like saying , " Does Chris Matthews help or hurt the Democratic Party ? "
The fact is he has a large audience , the audience believes him , the audience calls their members , the audience has an effect .
He 's not the leader of the Republican Party .
RUSH : Uh , nor ... ( laughs )
There is n't a leader of the Republican Party , Newt , and there wo n't be --
CALLER : Well , it 's not gonna be him .
RUSH : -- until we have a presidential nominee in 2012 .
CALLER : Yeah .
RUSH : Now , anyway , what you have to do is you have to learn long ago like I did , not to take this stuff personally .
Because if you take it personally , it can disappoint you .
CALLER : Right .
RUSH : It 's just part of the territory .
I mean , next week Newt could come out and profess his total admiration and love for me --
CALLER : Which he used to do .
RUSH : -- if it would serve his purposes .
CALLER : Yeah .
Yeah .
RUSH : So anyway , look , Anna Lee , I appreciate the call .
Anything else you wanted to add ?
CALLER : No , that was it .
Love ya !
RUSH : I appreciate it .
Thanks much .
( interruption ) Snerdley ... ( sigh ) Snerdley .
Snerdley is asking me if it 's part of territory , why do n't I take him out ?
Do you really want me to answer that question ?
You 're making this far more personal , Mr. Snerdley , than I understand .
Okay .
Here 's my attitude on this .
I am at the top of the mountain of what I do .
Everybody underneath it wants what I 've got .
That 's great .
That 's human nature .
As such , they 'll do what they can to take me down or to criticize me or what have you .
It is beneath my dignity to be critical of those beneath me .
It 's just a waste of time .
All this is such human nature .
I know that Newt would give his whatever to have what I 've got .
So would any of these other critics of mine .
They 'd love to have it , and they 've taken their best shot .
But for me to get ...
This is what 's silly about Obama talking about me .
You know , he 's the president of the United States !
The fact that he 's got time to dispatch his people out to do this means something .
It means we 're effective .
It means we pose a problem .
If we were n't effective on this program doing what we 're doing , none of this would be happening .
No assaults , no attacks , no attempts to discredit , ' cause we would be irrelevant .
So the question you have to ask yourself then Mr. Snerdley is , " Okay , why am I relevant .
Why are we relevant here ? "
' Cause this guy was hoping for a highway with no cars coming the other way , and he's got a caravan of cars heading the other way trying to stop it from going from where we he 's going , led by me .
This guy can't speak off of a teleprompter .
They can't send him out on ad - lib missions .
They can't send him out .
He can debate other Democrats because they do n't disagree about anything , but you can't go and debate others in public off the prompter .
He just ca n't do it .
So you have to ask , " Is he really the leader of the Democrat Party ? "
They 're talking about who 's the leader of the Republican Party .
Is it me ?
No .
There is n't a leader of the Republican Party , as it should be .
What 's going on right now is a bunch of people trying to become the leader setting themselves up to either be anointed or to self - anoint themselves in that position .
It 's not even one that I want .
Remember : " My Success is not Determined by Who Wins Elections . "
The fact that Obama 's coming after me and has got all these media minions coming after me ?
To me , again , it 's human nature .
I must present a problem , must present an obstacle .
If I had no impact , if I had no influence , if I was such an extremist appealing to such a small number of people , why , what they'd be doing is laughing , or ignoring .
But they 're running TV ads against me .
Newt Gingrich wishes they were running TV ads against him .
But they 're running TV ads against me .
So I love it .
I 'm up for it .
I raise my hand .
I 'm the Last Man Standing .
I 'm not going to back down .
I 'm not going to stop saying what I say or what I believe , ' cause I 'm an American .
I 'm a citizen , and I happen to have the good fortune of having a microphone to blare what I believe , and I happen to have the opportunity to be able to do it very well , talent on loan from God .
And I know if we just keep plugging away hard enough , we 're going to break through .
That , combined with the fact that the Obama administration is over reaching ...
Let me give you a football analogy .
Here we are in the midst of a recession that people are claiming is going to be a depression .
We 're doing everything theoretically wrong to get out of it .
We 're compounding it .
Yet Obama is not doing anything to really get out of it .
He 's starting to ad all these dream liberal ideas to the mix because " a crisis is a terrible thing to waste . "
Obama is essentially trying to run three plays on first down .
Now , you people that played football understand : that 's total chaos and distortion .
Three plays on first down !
Use a hose to soften the dirt on the ground first .
Then you can use sturdy shovels to dig out the mud .
Since you probably have stairs that lead down into your basement , it 's best to strap some bags on your dog and train it to haul the dirt out .
Alternately , wait for the dirt to dry and place it on a large canvas , which you can fold up and haul out .
Watch out for electrical wires and foundational posts while you dig .
It 's never fun to get shocked or have your house fall on you just because you wanted some extra room for your model trains !
If you encounter cement , be careful breaking it up with a sledgehammer because it may be important .
Finally , you can use the Shawshank Redempton technique to get rid of the dirt .
Simply put it in your pockets as necessary , and sprinkle as you make your way around town .
Just be careful not to let too much out at your desk at work - your coworkers might get suspicious of mounds of dirt .
Good luck !

The music streaming service Spotify has been targeted by hackers .
The Swedish company says people 's personal details , including e-mail addresses , dates of birth and addresses , were all stolen .
However , it is thought credit - card details , which were handled by a third party , have remained secure .
Spotify has apologised for the security lapse and advised users who registered on the site before 19 December 2008 to change their passwords .
It is thought hackers gained access to user data at the end of 2008 , although the security breach only came to light at the end of last week .
In the dark Spotify 's communications manager , Jim Butcher , told BBC News the company had only become aware of the attack after receiving a message from the hackers .
" We have n't had direct contact , it 's all via third - party sources , so we do n't know who they are and we do n't know where they are from .
" This was n't some kid playing on a computer , someone has spent hundreds of hours looking to hack into our system . "
" We 're still trying to find out the reasons they actually hacked our site , so it 's difficult for me to say what they want at the present time . "
Rory Cellan - Jones on Spotify Launched in 2006 , Spotify has more than one million registered users .
Instead of receiving a pay - per - download service , users can access the music for free , with tunes interrupted by advertising , or they can pay £ 10 a month for an ad - free service .
It is thought there are more than 250,000 users registered in the UK , but Spotify stressed that the number of compromised accounts was small .
" We think about 10,000 accounts [ could be ] at risk , although we are 95 % sure it is a fraction of that , " said Mr Butcher .
In a blog posting , the company explained how the hack actually took place .
" The information that may have been exposed when our protocols were compromised is the password hashes [ codes ] .
" As stated , we never store passwords , and they have never been sent over the internet unencrypted , but the combination of the bug and the group 's reverse - engineering of our encrypted streaming protocol may have given outsiders access to individual hashes . "
The company has apologised for the security lapse and promised users that it was making efforts to ensure the hack was not repeated .

Congress is in the midst of creating regulatory changes that could change the agency ’s fate , Mr. Kanjorski warned the panel of official witnesses .
Lawmakers want immediate candor about the handling of the Madoff matter , not generalities , he said .
But the hearing became a collision of frustrations that , at one point , prompted Mr. Kanjorski to accuse the staff members of refusing to cooperate with a branch of government that could wipe their entire agency off the regulatory map , if necessary .
Representative Gary L. Ackerman , Democrat of New York , was more blunt in his condemnation of the S.E.C. officials sitting before him : “ We thought the enemy was Mr. Madoff .
I think it is you . ”
Mary L. Schapiro , the new chairwoman of the S.E.C. , later released a letter to the subcommittee ’s senior members , conceding that the hearing “ cannot have been satisfactory for you . ”
She asked to meet with them promptly to work out “ a course forward ” that would both provide accountability and maintain the integrity of continuing investigations .

“ There needs to be a full accounting , both of Mr. Madoff ’s activities and why we did not detect the fraud , which we truly regret , ” she said .
The hearing had opened with Mr. Markopolos telling the panel he had discovered another possible fraud , a $ 1 billion Ponzi scheme , that he would report to regulators on Thursday .
Neither he nor his lawyers would provide any additional details .
Credit Suisse has hatched a cunning plan to avoid public condemnation over executive bonuses this year : it is going to pay top managers not in cash , but in the toxic mortgage assets that caused the credit crisis .
Thousands of managing directors and directors will be handed a slice of a new internal hedge fund , into which the bank is transferring some of its $ 5 bn ( £ 3.3 bn ) in illiquid investments .
These are the complex mortgage derivatives and leveraged loans whose collapsing value has cost the global finance industry $ 800bn in writedowns in the past 18 months , triggered recessions around the world and caused a public outcry over Wall Street excess .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Credit Suisse is the first bank to use the debt to pay employees , who were told about the plan in a memo from Brady Dougan , the chief executive , and Paul Calello , the head of the Zurich - based investment bank .
" While the solution we have come up with may not be ideal for everyone , we believe it strikes the appropriate balance among the interests of our employees , shareholders and regulators and helps position us well for 2009 , " they wrote .
The new Partner Asset Facility is expected to be run as a mini- hedge fund and could take on debt of its own from Credit Suisse .
If the troubled assets rebound in value , employees stand to gain from future payments ; if they decline , it will be the value of employee bonuses that will be eroded – Credit Suisse will not have to book the losses .
This makes the scheme particularly attractive for a bank that has been struggling to offload tens of billions of dollars of illiquid credit instruments .
Participants in the fund will receive a small twice - yearly interest payment on the bonus , but will only be able to get their hands on the cash in five years , if the fund has any value left .
Credit Suisse 's move is the biggest shock so far in an already - traumatic bonus season for Wall Street employees .
Most banks are significantly scaling back the size of their payouts , even for relatively junior employees , and the payments are more likely to be made in shares than in cash this year .
Goldman Sachs was reported yesterday to have slashed the value of bonuses to its partners by 80 per cent after reporting its first quarterly loss since the Great Depression .
Credit Suisse said earlier this month that it would cut 5,300 jobs and cancel bonuses for top executives after saying it suffered new losses totalling $ 2.8bn in October and November .

With every Linux kernel release come a few surprises , and this December ’s 2.6.28 release was no exception .
This release is the first of a stable ext4 file system ( among a variety of other cool things , such as the Btrfs , which is still under heavy development ) .
This next generation of the extended file system provides improved scalability , reliability , and considerable new functionality .
Ext4 is so scalable that the maximum file system would consume one million 1 - terabyte ( TB ) disks .
A short history of the extended file system
The virtual file system switch
The VFS is a layer that abstracts the details of the underlying file systems from the upper - layer file system users .
In doing this , the VFS allows Linux to support many file systems simultaneously on a given Linux system .
The first supported file system for Linux was the Minix file system .
This file system had some significant performance issues , so another file system was created specifically for Linux called the extended file system .
The first extended file system ( ext ) was designed by Remy Card and introduced into Linux in April 1992 .
The ext file system was the first to use the virtual file system ( VFS ) switch implemented in the 0.96 c kernel and supported file systems up to 2 gigabytes ( GB ) in size .
The second extended file system ( ext2 ) , also implemented by Remy Card , was introduced in January 1993 .
It adopted advanced ideas from other file systems of the day ( such as the Berkeley Fast File System [ FFS ] ) .
Ext2 extended supported file systems of 2TB in size , although 2.6 kernels extended the maximum size of ext2 file systems to 32TB .
The third extended file system ( ext3 ) was a major advance in Linux file systems , even though its performance was less than some of its competitors .
The ext3 file system introduced the concept of journaling to improve the reliability of the file system when the system is abruptly halted .
And although competing file systems had better performance ( such as Silicon Graphics ’ XFS and the IBM ® Journaled File System [ JFS ] ) , ext3 supported in - place upgrades from systems already using ext2 .
Ext3 was introduced in November 2001 and implemented by Stephen Tweedie .
Fast - forward to today .
We now have the fourth extended file system ( ext4 ) .
Ext4 introduces numerous new advancements for performance , scalability , and reliability .
Most notably , ext4 supports file systems of 1 exabyte in size .
Ext4 was implemented by a team of developers , led by Theodore Tso ( the ext3 maintainer ) , and was introduced in the 2.6.19 kernel .
It is now stable in the 2.6.28 kernel ( as of December 2008 ) .
Ext4 borrows many useful concepts from a variety of competing file systems .
For example , the extent approach to block management had been implemented in JFS .
Another block management - related feature ( delayed allocation ) was implemented in both XFS and in Sun Microsystems ’ ZFS .
You ’ll find various improvements and innovations in the new ext4 file system .
The improvements cover a number of feature angles from new functionality ( new features ) , scalability ( scaling beyond current file system constraints ) , reliability ( in the face of failures ) , and of course , performance .
Functionality
Ext4 includes a large amount of new functionality , but most important is its backward and forward compatibility with ext3 and improvements in timestamps that look to the future of higher - performing Linux systems .
Forward and backward compatibility
As ext3 is one of the most popular file systems in use by Linux today , migrating to ext4 should be simple and painless .
For this reason , ext4 was designed to be both forward and backward ( to an extent ) compatible ( see Figure 1 ) .
Ext4 is forward compatible in that you can mount an ext3 file system as an ext4 file system .
To fully take advantage of ext4 , a file system migration is necessary to convert and exploit the new ext4 format .
You can also mount an ext4 file system as ext3 ( backward compatible ) , but only if the ext4 file system does not use extents ( which is discussed in the performance section ) .
Figure 1 .
The forward and backward compatibility of ext4
In addition to the compatibility features , when you want to migrate an ext3 file system to ext4 , you can do so gradually .
This means that old files that you have not moved can remain in the older ext3 format , while new files ( or older files that have been copied ) will occupy the new ext4 data structures .
In this way , you can migrate an ext3 file system online to an ext4 file system .
Amazingly , timestamps in the extended file system arena prior to ext4 were seconds based .
This was satisfactory in many settings , but as processors evolve with higher speeds and greater integration ( multi- core processors ) and Linux finds itself in other application domains such as high - performance computing , the seconds - based timestamp fails in its own simplicity .
Ext4 has essentially future - proofed timestamps by extending them into a nanosecond LSB .
The time range has also be extended with two additional bits to increase the lifetime by another 500 years .
Scalability
One of the most important aspects of file systems moving forward is their ability to scale given the growing demands placed on them .
Ext4 accomplishes this in a number of ways , going beyond ext3 limits and breaking new ground in areas of file system metadata management .
Extending file system limits
One of the first visible differences in ext4 is the increased support for file system volumes , file sizes , and subdirectory limits .
Ext4 supports file systems of up to 1 exabyte in size ( 1000 petabytes ) .
Although that seems huge by today ’s standards , storage consumption continues to grow , so ext4 was definitely developed with the future in mind .
Files within ext4 may be up to 16TB in size ( assuming 4 KB blocks ) , which is eight times the limit in ext3 .
Finally , the subdirectory limit was extended with ext4 , from 32 KB directories deep to virtually unlimited .
That may appear extreme , but one needs to consider the hierarchy of a file system that consumes an exabyte of storage .
Directory indexing was also optimized to a hashed B - tree - like structure , so although the limits are much greater , ext4 supports very fast lookup times .
Extents
One of the primary disadvantages of ext3 was its method of allocation .
Files were allocated using a bit map of free space , which was not very fast nor very scalable .
Ext3 ’s format is very efficient for small files but horribly inefficient for large files .
Ext4 replaces ext3’s mechanism with extents to improve allocation and support a more efficient storage structure .
An extent is simply a way to represent a contiguous sequence of blocks .
In doing this , metadata shrinks , because instead of maintaining information about where a block is stored , the extent maintains information about where a long list of contiguous blocks is stored ( thus reducing the overall metadata storage ) .
Extents in ext4 adopt a layered approach to efficiently represent small files as well as extent trees to efficiently represent large files .
For example , a single ext4 inode has sufficient space to reference four extents ( where each extent represents a set of contiguous blocks ) .
For large files ( including those that are fragmented ) , an inode can reference an index node , each of which can reference a leaf node ( referencing multiple extents ) .
This constant depth extent tree provides a rich representation scheme for large , potentially sparse files .
The nodes also include self - checking mechanisms to further protect against file system corruption .
Performance
One of the most important attributes used to measure new file systems is their fundamental performance .
This is also one of the most difficult areas , as when a file system grows to massive sizes and expectations are placed on it to be highly reliable , performance can ultimately suffer .
But even as ext4 addresses scalability and reliability , it provides a number of enhancements for improved performance .
File - level preallocation
Certain applications , such as databases or content streaming , rely on files to be stored in contiguous blocks ( to exploit sequential block read optimization of drives as well as to maximize Read command - to - block ratios ) .
Although extents can provide segments of contiguous blocks , another brute - force method is to preallocate very large sections of contiguous blocks in the size desired ( as was implemented in the past with XFS ) .
Ext4 implements this through a new system call that preallocates and initializes a file of a given size .
You can then write the necessary data and provide bounded Read performance over the data .
Delaying block allocation
Another file size - based optimization is delayed allocation .
This performance optimization delays the allocation of physical blocks on the disk until they are to be flushed to the disk .
The key to this optimization is that by delaying the allocation of physical blocks until they need to be written to the disk , more blocks are present to allocate and write in contiguous blocks .
This is similar to persistent preallocation except that the file system performs the task automatically .
But if the size of the file is known beforehand , persistent preallocation is the best route .
Multi-block allocation
A final optimization — again , contiguous block related — is the block allocator for ext4 .
In ext3 , the block allocator worked by allocating a single block at a time .
When multiple blocks were necessary , it was possible to find contiguous data in non-contiguous blocks .
Ext4 fixes this with a block allocator that allocates multiple blocks at a time , likely contiguous on disk .
Like the previous optimizations , this optimization collects related data on the disk to optimize for sequential Read optimization .
The other aspect of multi-block allocation is the amount of processing required for allocating the blocks .
Recall that ext3 performed allocation one block at a time .
In the simplest units , that required a call to block allocation for each block .
Allocating multiple blocks at a time requires many fewer calls to the block allocator , resulting in faster allocation and reduced processing .
Reliability
As file systems scale to the massive sizes possible with ext4 , greater reliability concerns will certainly follow .
Ext4 includes numerous self - protection and self - healing mechanisms to address this .
Checksumming the file system journal
Like ext3 , ext4 is a journaling file system .
Journaling is the process of logging changes to the file system through a journal ( which is a dedicated circular log on a contiguous region of the disk ) .
Actual changes to the physical storage are then performed from the log , which can more reliably implement the changes and ensure consistency , even if the system crashes or power is lost during the operation .
The result is a reduced chance of file system corruption .
But even with journaling , corruption is still possible if erroneous entries find their way into the journal .
To combat this , ext4 implements checksumming of the journal to ensure that valid changes make their way to the underlying file system .
You can find additional references to journaling — an important aspect of ext4 — in the Related topics section .
Ext4 supports multiple modes of journaling , depending upon the needs of the user .
For example , ext4 supports a mode in which only metadata is journaled ( Writeback mode ) , a mode in which metadata is journaled but data is written as the metadata is written from the journal ( Ordered mode ) , and a mode in which both metadata and data are journaled ( Journal mode — the most reliable mode ) .
Note that Journal mode , although the best way to ensure a consistent file system , is also the slowest , because all data flows through the journal .
Online defragmentation
Although ext4 incorporates features to reduce fragmentation within the file system ( extents for sequential block allocation ) , some amount of fragmentation is impossible to avoid when a file system exists for a long period of time .
For this reason , an online defragmentation tool exists to defragment both the file system and individual files for improved performance .
The online defragmenter is a simple tool that copies files into a new ext4 inode that refers to contiguous extents .
The other aspect of online defragmentation is the reduced time required for a file system check ( fsck ) .
Ext4 marks unused groups of blocks within the inode table to allow the fsck process to skip them entirely to speed the check process .
When the operating system decides to validate the file system because of internal corruption ( which is inevitable as file systems increase in size and distribution ) , ext4 ’s overall design means improved overall reliability .
What ’s next ?
The extended file system obviously has a long and rich history within Linux — from the first introduction to ext in 1992 to ext4 in 2008 .
It was the first file system designed specifically for Linux and has proved one of the most efficient , stable , and powerful file systems available .
Ext4 has evolved with advancements in file system research , incorporating ideas from other novel file systems ( such as the XFS , JFS , Reiser , and the IRON fault - tolerant file system techniques ) .
Although it ’s too early to know what ’s coming for ext5 , it ’s clear that it will lead the way for enterprise - ready Linux systems .
If a tinge of melancholy haunts the cocktail hour , if a croquet mallet left derelict on the lawn evokes a broken merriment , if the bar car of a commuter train gives off a stale whiff of failed promise and bitter alimony , pause and pay homage to John Cheever .
Light a bug candle on the patio in his honor .
For Cheever — novelist , master of the short story , prolific diarist — is the patron saint of Eastern Seaboard pathos and redemption , the Edward Hopper of suburban ennui , preserving minor epiphanies in amber .
Despite his patrician patina , Cheever was no saint in his personal life and not quite one of nature ’s noblemen .
The publication in 1991 of The Journals of John Cheever put a permanent wrinkle in that façade , publicizing Cheever ’s previously cloaked bisexual appetites and polecat propensities , along with a lesser host of miseries , vanities , and maunderings that left an oily residue .
A greater smirch on Cheever ’s name recognition was inflicted a year later , on an episode of Seinfeld where George Costanza ( Jason Alexander ) discovered that his prospective future father - in - law was a former lover of Cheever ’s , hoarding a secret stash of letters from the dear man .
Millions of viewers who may never have read a single story of Cheever ’s now had his identity branded into their brains as a gay punch line .

But if some of the mahogany richness has worn off of Cheever ’s individual reputation following his death , in 1982 , the influence of his imagination and sensibility has swum ever deeper into the cultural bloodstream , its unique formula of magical elixir and embalming fluid winding its way through everything from Ordinary People to The Ice Storm to American Beauty to Far from Heaven to Revolutionary Road to TV’s Mad Men .
Nearly every stylized retro examination of the hidden tooth decay of the American Dream owes Cheever symbolic royalties ( see also “ Rethinking the American Dream , ” by David Kamp ) .
As this country edges into the prospect of losing so much of what it once had , a vast devaluing of everything it took for granted , the bittersweet pang of Cheever ’s nostalgia and the bleak apprehension underlying idle chitchat have never been more apropos — perfect timing for the publication of Blake Bailey ’s Cheever : A Life ( Knopf ) , a biography of monumental heft and picky asides that certifies Cheever ’s enduring relevance while smacking his wrist with a nun ’s ruler .
After one of Cheever ’s typical lyrical effusions , his biographer chides , “ Perhaps , but the fact remained that he was impotent , and often drunk before lunch . ”
Even when you ’re dead , you ca n’t get away with anything .
My God , the suburbs !
They encircled the city ’s boundaries like enemy territory , and we thought of them as a loss of privacy , a cesspool of conformity and a life of indescribable dreariness in some split - level village where the place - name appeared in the New York Times only when some bored housewife blew off her head with a shotgun .
— John Cheever , Esquire , July 1960 .
In the halo ’d circles where the craft of fiction is a devotional calling , Cheever is held up as an exemplar of a writer ’s writer , tending to his tiny plot of fallen paradise .
First published at the age of 18 , with an account in The New Republic of being expelled from Thayer Academy ( a private school ) , Cheever had the good fortune to land under the aegis of * The New Yorker ’*s fiction editor William Maxwell , whose solicitude and self - effacement were the stuff of Vatican legend .
In 1938 , Cheever , who had published a few stories in the magazine under Katharine White ’s editorial wand , was lateraled off to Maxwell .
“ Maxwell ’s attentiveness was all the more flattering — and his editorial advice valuable — because he himself was already , at age thirty , the author of two well - regarded novels , Bright Center of Heaven and They Came Like Swallows , ” Bailey writes .
“ For most of his career , though , his own reputation would be eclipsed by the greater fame of the writers he edited : Nabokov , Salinger , Welty , and ( as Maxwell put it ) ‘ three wonderful writers all named John ’ — O’Hara , Updike , and Cheever . ”
Under Maxwell ’s tutelage , Cheever produced a basket of golden eggs , stories that by the late 40s — “ miraculous years for Cheever ” — placed him near the top tier of the fiction writers at The New Yorker , an exclusive fraternity that included O’Hara , Nabokov , Salinger , and Irwin Shaw .
But literary cachet did n’t stock the pantry or cover the dry cleaning , especially during dry spells .
“ In his journal Cheever wrote , ‘ We are as poor as we ever have been .
The rent is not paid , we have very little to eat . …
We have many bills . ’
Determined to write ‘ a story a week , ’ he was rejected four times in a row by The New Yorker , which meant he would n’t be receiving a yearly bonus either .
Faced with dire poverty , and forced into writing ‘ lifeless and detestable ’ fiction , Cheever chided himself for entertaining an ‘ unreasonable ’ degree of petulance . ”

" more like standard
C# code " ( Brad )
OK , enough with the funny stuff .
The new Obama administration is shaping up to be a disaster for Copyfighters everywhere .
In particular the new Department of Justice is stacked with lawyers who ’ve been on the wrong side of copyright and intellectual property lawsuits for the last eight years .
First off , there ’s the # 3 man at Justice , Thomas Perrelli , accurately described by CNET as “ beloved by the RIAA ” .
Not only has this guy been on the wrong side in the courtroom , he ’s fingered as instrumental in convincing the Copyright Board to strangle Web radio in its crib by imposing impossible fee structures .
Then there ’s Neil MacBride , who used to be the Business Software Alliance ’s general counsel .
The BSA , to its credit , has n’t been suing teenagers .
Generally their name is associated with large - scale raids on companies that are mass - producing illegal copies of software .
Still , it ’s an industry flak group .
Then there ’s the # 2 man , currently slated to be David Ogden .
If that name only rings a faint bell it ’s because you have to cast your mind back to Eldred v Ashcroft , the argument on whether retroactive copyright term extensions were legal .
Sitting over there on Ashcroft ’s side ?
That ’s Mr. Odgen .
For extra - bonus ick points ,
Ogden also was involved in defending the heinous COPA legislation , fortunately now dead and buried ( but not forgotten ) .
The capper on this line - up of suspicious characters is Donald Verrilli , now up for Associate Deputy Attorney General .
This specimen of legal acumen is front and center in the Cartel ’s jihad , having appeared for Viacom when it sued YouTube , for the RIAA against Jammie Thomas , single mother .
And if we peer back a little farther , we find Verrilli ’s dirty fingerprints on MGM v Grokster .
So what does all this portend ?
Well , if you ask Julian Sanchez over at Portfolio.com he thinks it ’s a tempest in a teapot .
He thinks they ’ll all behave and recuse themselves properly and just because a lawyer consistently goes to bat for a certain kind of client does n’t mean much about their professional views .
Lawyers are paid guns , after all , and the Cartel ’s side has consistently paid well .
Declan McCullagh , over at CNET , is much less sanguine , pointing out that many of these cases are still ongoing ( e.g. big lawsuits against YouTube ) and further noting that Vice President Biden showed a great deal of hostility toward free use when he was in the Senate .
I ’m on Declan ’s side .
To the extent that someone has to set the tone of this administration in dealing with intellectual property matters , it ’s looking pretty grim .
Update : Man found dead in cold was turned away from shelters in past because he was sex offender
GRAND RAPIDS --
To those who knew him , Thomas Pauli was an educated man , a quiet , gentle person who loved to read .
So it 's unclear why the 52 - year - old man , who recently completed a rehab program , died on the streets in the cold .
His body was discovered Monday in the snow inside a fenced auto salvage business , huddled near the wheel of a car in the 600 block of South Division Avenue .
Pauli was among eight Michigan men and women -- four of them senior citizens -- found dead in the cold since Jan. 17 .
Most of the deaths occurred near the victims ' homes , where it appears four of them fell on their property .
Two victims were homeless .
One teen died on the Saginaw River and a 93 - year - old Bay City man with a $ 1,100 unpaid utility bill froze to death in his home after the utility restricted his electricity use .
" As I read them , some ( deaths ) were freakish sort of things and difficult to prevent for someone who is alone , " said Robert Barnes , executive director of Senior Neighbors Inc. , 820 Monroe Avenue NW .
DEADLY TOLL
Seven Michigan residents have been found dead outside during the recent cold snap , and a Bay City man died inside his unheated home :
Jan. 17 : Helen Funderburg , 86 , found in her Norton Shores backyard
Jan. 17 : Marvin Schur , 93 , found frozen to death inside his Bay City home
Jan. 18 : The body of a homeless man , 58 , found near Inkster
Jan. 18 : Karoline Benedict , 85 , found dead in the driveway of her Saranac home
Jan. 25 : Michael Gibbs , 16 , found frozen on Saginaw River in Bay County
Jan. 25 : Francis Buford , 81 , suffering from Alzheimer 's found in Oakland County .
He walked away from son's home
Sunday : Cynthia Hillis , 37 , found outside her friend 's home in Allegan County .
Monday : Thomas Pauli , 52 , found in 600 block of South Division Avenue lying near a car at a business
Senior Neighbors has a program for isolated or frail area seniors ages 60 and older called " Daily Connections . "
Volunteers call seniors daily at a specific time .
Emergency procedures go into effect if the senior does not respond , Barnes said .
There are 40 seniors in the program and room for more participants and volunteers , he said .
It also has a team of social workers ready to assess needs of low - income seniors , he said .
" The reality is it 's a tremendous challenge .
There are many isolated seniors who do n't network much or have contacts and there is a risk for them , " Barnes said .
Last year , Kent County had two deaths attributed to the cold weather and , in 2007 , three deaths were attributed to the cold , according to Kent County health records .
Pauli had created a small network .
He used Degage Ministries Life Enrichment Center as his address , said center supervisor Lori King , who saw him regularly until about three weeks ago .
" He was very quiet and intelligent , soft - spoken , and he had great manners , and that is a rarity .
He struggled off and on with addiction and he ( recently ) showed me a certificate as he went through rehab , " she said .
Pauli once told her he wanted to go back to school for a degree in journalism and writing .
He had a girlfriend and was trying to get a place to live .
" He was tired of being downtown and tired of the shuffle .
He was middle - aged , and running around all day outside was wearing on him , " she said .
The center , at 144 S. Division Ave. , expanded its dining - room hours from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. so the homeless do n't have to be outside so long .
Degage provides showers , mail service and a referral desk to help with substance abuse issues .
" Tom was a very nice man .
He had beautiful eyes and , when he smiled , his whole face lit up .
He was n't violent or mean , but he struggled with demons , like we all do , " King said .
Pauli 's autopsy showed no specific cause of death and no foul play is suspected , so Grand Rapids Police are awaiting toxicology reports for more answers .
Allegan County authorities also completed the initial autopsy of 37 - year - old Cynthia Hillis , whose body was found Sunday outside the home where she was staying , and found no cause for suspicion in her death .
They were awaiting toxicology reports and do not know why she left the house without proper attire .
She was found wearing tennis shoes , a T - shirt and sweat pants .
The homeowner said it was odd that a fan was knocked over and a door was ajar , but police noted that several cats live in the house , Allegan County Sheriff 's Lt. Scott Matice said .

FSFE launches Free PDF Readers campaign
on : 2009-02-02
The Fellowship of the Free Software Foundation Europe is proud to announce its latest initiative : pdfreaders.org , a site providing information about PDF with links to Free Software PDF readers for all major operating systems .
" Interoperability , competition and choice are primary benefits of Open Standards that translate into vendor - independence and better value for money for customers , " says FSFE president Georg Greve .
" Although many versions of PDF offer all these benefits for formatted text and documents , files in PDF formats typically come with information that users need to use a specific product .
pdfreaders.org provides an alternative to highlight the strengths of PDF as an Open Standard . "
The coordinators of pdfreaders.org , Hannes Hauswedell and Jan-Hendrik Peters , are pleased to present the latest revision of the site with short and compact information how users can seize the full benefits of both Open Standards and Free Software .
" Free Software gives us control over the software we use , and Open Standards give us control over our data and allow implementations by many different groups , " explains Jan-Hendrik Peters .
" We wanted to show that with the Portable Document Format people can have both . "
Hannes Hauswedell adds : " Similar to a Free Software project we started off with an idea , provided a first implementation , received lots of feedback , and worked that into a better version of the site .
We are grateful to all the people who got involved .
This was a collaborative effort that would not have been possible without all the contributors . "
" The site offers buttons in several languages that we encourage everyone to put next to PDF files offered on their sites , " explains Matthias Kirschner , FSFE 's Fellowship Coordinator .
" We hope that in a year from now , no PDF is offered without the vendor - independent alternative buttons of pdfreaders.org . "

Uproar over plans for giant wind farm off Dorset 's Jurassic coast
As a 95 - mile stretch of unspoilt British coastline that dates back hundreds of millions of years , it has been designated a World Heritage Site .
Now the Jurassic Coast has been earmarked for a more modern and controversial use - as the site of an off - shore wind farm .
Developers have been invited to submit plans for the project which could see up to 100 300ft giant turbines positioned in the sea off the Dorset coast .
There are plans to build a giant off - shore wind farm 10 miles out to sea off the Dorset coastline
Yesterday the idea of a wind farm on the ancient stretch of coast sparked outrage after it was revealed the idea had progressed without any consultation with local residents .
The area is hugely popular with walkers , fossil hunters and holiday makers for its natural beauty and history which make it the only wholly natural World Heritage Site in England .
Yesterday it was claimed that the Crown Estate , who are responsible for Sovereign owned land , had tried to keep local authorities in the dark about their plans for a multi-million pound wind farm .
Bournemouth Borough Council only found out about the proposal because an officer happened to attend a meeting with a company that was in the process of bidding for the contract .
Now , in a rare move , the local authorities affected have released a joint statement attacking the Crown Estate , which owns the sea bed around the UK , for failing to consult with them .
The Dorset site is one of eleven potential areas named by the Crown Estate , after a study of geology , wind strengths and shipping lanes .
Others include East Sussex , Cardigan Bay in Wales , the Irish Sea off Cumbria and the North Sea off Norfolk .
Energy firms will bid to build the turbines , which rise 300ft above sea level and usually stand in water less than 100 ft deep .
Cllr Brian Leverett , leader of Borough of Poole council , said the news had come as a shock to both him and his constituents .
Outrage :
An artist 's impression of the wind farm off of the Jurassic coast
He said : ' This is very poor consultation indeed .
This is not a minor development , it 's a major proposal and a very controversial one .
' I think the government has fallen far short of the standards of consultation we have a right to expect from them .
' We are elected to represent the people of Poole - how can we do that if we do n't even know what is possibly being proposed right on our doorstep ?'
Cllr Nick King , a Conservative cabinet member at Bournemouth Borough Council , criticised the Crown Estate and said : ' They are really by - passing democracy by not consulting the councils .
' They have shown complete disregard for the hundreds of thousands of people who will be affected . '
He added : ' They clearly did n't want to consult us so they could go away then present it as a fait accompli . '
Part of the statement from Bournemouth , Poole , Christchurch and Purbeck councils stated : '... we are collectively disappointed that no approach appears to have been made by The Crown Estate to either advise us of these plans or seek our views and the views of local residents , partners and businesses . '
Controversial :
This wind farm in Whistable shows what Dorset 's coast could look like in the near future
It concludes : ' We ask Crown Estates to ensure that the consultation they have started includes direct discussion with us and ensures that the views of local people , partners and industry , are taken into account . '
A Crown Estate spokesman played down the plans and said consultation was not due to start until the developer had been chosen in the autumn .
She said : ' There 's nothing really to say at this stage .
Everything is subject to the developers ' research .
' The Crown Estate identified an area of coast off Dorset that we thought would be good for a wind farm .
' We are receiving applications from developers and when we haven chosen a developer the consultation will start .
At the moment there is nothing to consult about . '
She said the number of turbines and the cost was unknown at present and the zone off the Dorset coast was one of several around Britain .
Any construction would start in 2014 and it could be in operation by 2018 .
With the world swirling about it , the House takes a moment to honor the Greek letter .
Ya can't make it up : House praises pi
With the world swirling about it , the House took a moment Thursday to honor pi , the Greek letter symbolizing that great constant in mathematics representing the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter .
An irrational number that has been calculated to more than 1 trillion digits , pi is a concept not totally foreign to today ’s Washington .
But in this case , the goal was to promote efforts by the National Science Foundation to improve math education in the United States , especially in the critical fourth to eighth grades .

Rounded off , pi equates to 3.14 , hence the designation of March 14 as Pi Day under the resolution .
Informal celebrations have been held around the country for at least 20 years , but Thursday ’s 391- 10 vote is the first time Congress has joined the party .
“ I ’m kind of geeked up about it , ” Rep. Brian Baird ( D - Wash . ) told POLITICO .
“ It ’s crazy , but I ’m a whole lot more excited about that than congratulating the winner of last year ’s Rose Bowl .
“ I ’m not making this up .
I have been fascinated by pi since I was a kid .
It blows my mind .
It ’s lovely .
The fact that it ’s sort of this infinite number .
I just think it ’s this magical thing .
...
There ’s a real beauty to mathematics . ”
Engineering and technology companies backed the effort , and like most things in the House , there ’s a San Francisco angle .
Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif. ) has pressed hard for Congress to do more to promote science , and the San Francisco Exploratorium , in her home city , takes credit for the first Pi Day celebration in 1988 , with staff and public marching around one of its circular spaces and then consuming fruit pies .
“ I am asking our nation ’s students and teachers , for all of our sake , to go out and have fun around Pi Day , ” said Rep. Lincoln Davis ( D - Tenn . ) who managed the bill on the floor this week for the House Science Committee .
March 14 is also the birthday of Albert Einstein — adding to the convergence of big ideas .
“ It makes you realize how consequential you really are , ” Rep. Bill Delahunt ( D - Mass . ) said with a smile .
But there ’s always one : “ We were never good at math in my family , ” said Rep. John P. Murtha ( D - Pa. ) .
“ I thought I was voting for p-i-e . ”
" In a move meant to ensure that the public has access to their money from banks , the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has introduced a new family of banknotes which will gradually come into circulation , starting with the Z$ 10 trillion , " the Herald said , citing a statement from the central bank .
Sir Alex Ferguson has accused Internazionale of negativity ahead of Wednesday 's Champions League game at Old Trafford and predicted that Jose Mourinho 's side will play for penalties in the second - leg of their last - 16 tie .
Mourinho claimed before the two sides ' initial meeting at the San Siro , which ended 0 –0 , that United would not be willing to meet Inter " eye to eye " and would change their usual approach .
Now Ferguson has turned the tables and tried to second - guess his opponents ' tactics , perhaps in the hope that it will goad the Portuguese into taking a more attacking approach .
" Could he really have believed that we would n't attack at the San Siro ? " Ferguson said in an interview with Gazzetta dello Sport .
" Well , I 'll tell you that at Old Trafford Inter will play for penalties .
There is always that Italian mentality .
Even with Argentinians and other foreigners , that remains the idea .
They will look to suffocate the game and aim for 120 minutes of goalless football .
But I 'm not worried about anything .
My players have shown they have what it takes when it comes to penalties .
I hope it continues like that . "
United won last season 's European Cup and this month 's Carling Cup on penalties and Ferguson feels that nothing the Portuguese tries in the build - up will surprise or disturb him .
" We are used to Jose , " he said .
" I 'm not a little lad from the Govan alleys who finds himself on Fifth Avenue in New York .
I 'm not shocked by anything any more .
Mourinho has a magnetic power over the media ; everyone wants him because he goes from the amusing to the spirited to the offensive .
He 's a great media tactician .
But he also know that when the game begins it will only be Inter against the Reds , he can't do anything more .
Personally I trust in those I send out on the pitch . "
Ferguson has urged his players to find the spirit of last year 's semi-final against Barcelona as they prepare to welcome Inter .
United were level at 0 –0 after the first - leg of that tie and won thanks to a Paul Scholes goal .
" In the build - up to a match against Jose I have to expect everything from him , " he said .
" But we are preparing in the same way as after the 0 - 0 in the Nou Camp .
An intense and efficient preparation , which worked very well .
" We controlled them well in Milan – Inter only had a couple of half - chances in the second half .
My players played with an incredible level of concentration .
They have to do the same in the return leg . "
Inter have not been looking their usual selves in Serie A of late , although they won 2–0 at Genoa on Saturday to move seven points clear of Juventus at the top of the table , but Ferguson believes that is because they have had one eye on Wednesday .
" Inter are in command in Serie A and after they came back against Roma [ 3 - 3 ] , they have the Scudetto in their pocket , " he added .
" He must also believe it , judging from the players he 's been putting out since the first leg .
He 's obviously thinking of us . "
Mourinho has spiced up the game by saying he could take over as manager at Old Trafford when Sir Alex Ferguson retires .
" If you want me to rule out ever being Manchester United manager I can't , " Inter 's coach added .
" Special clubs need special managers so in theory it could work , but nobody knows what the future is in football .
The England national team wanted me as coach and that is the biggest job in England , so I am sure when Sir Alex retires they will look at the best managers in the world and I certainly fall into the category . "
But Ferguson laughed off the idea that he might be close to the end at Old Trafford .
" Who 's talking about stopping ? " he said .
" You would have to take me out of here by force .
I 'm really not thinking about it at all .
And even less so is Mourinho thinking about coming to United . "
StarChild Question of the Month for December 2002
Question :
Why is space black ?
Answer :
Your question , which seems simple , is actually very difficult to answer !
It is a question that many scientists pondered for many centuries - including Johannes Kepler , Edmond Halley , and German physician - astronomer Wilhelm Olbers .
There are two things to think about here .
Let 's take the easy one first and ask " why is the daytime sky blue here on Earth ? "
That is a question we can answer .
The daytime sky is blue because light from the nearby Sun hits molecules in the Earth 's atmosphere and scatters off in all directions .
The blue color of the sky is a result of this scattering process .
At night , when that part of Earth is facing away from the Sun , space looks black because there is no nearby bright source of light , like the Sun , to be scattered .
If you were on the Moon , which has no atmosphere , the sky would be black both night and day .
You can see this in photographs taken during the Apollo Moon landings .
So , now on to the harder part - if the universe is full of stars , why does n't the light from all of them add up to make the whole sky bright all the time ?
It turns out that if the universe was infinitely large and infinitely old , then we would expect the night sky to be bright from the light of all those stars .
Every direction you looked in space you would be looking at a star .
Yet we know from experience that space is black !
This paradox is known as Olbers ' Paradox .
It is a paradox because of the apparent contradiction between our expectation that the night sky be bright and our experience that it is black .
Many different explanations have been put forward to resolve Olbers ' Paradox .
The best solution at present is that the universe is not infinitely old ; it is somewhere around 15 billion years old .
That means we can only see objects as far away as the distance light can travel in 15 billion years .
The light from stars farther away than that has not yet had time to reach us and so can't contribute to making the sky bright .
Another reason that the sky may not be bright with the visible light of all the stars is because when a source of light is moving away from you , the wavelength of that light is made longer ( which for light means more red . )
This means that the light from stars that are moving away from us will become shifted towards red , and may shift so far that it is no longer visible at all .

RNC chairman Michael Steele , being obsequious before La Rush Petit , Glenn Beck , on his Fox show yesterday , let slip an inadvertent truth about Republicans in general :
Beck : Michael , ah , you know , the Democrats should not be pushing for the Fairness Doctrine , because quite honestly , um , I think , at least my radio audience is more pissed at you guys than they are the Democrats .
We expect socialism from some of the Democrats , we do n't expect it from you .
And if I may be so bold to speak for a lot of people here , I can tell you how I feel , and I think a lot of people feel this way .
We actually believed in something in 2000 .
We believed in something in 2004 .
It 's not really easy to be , you know , the pariah in your office , to be the hatemonger racist that wants to steal , you know , starve everybody 's children and just hates anybody who is different .
We actually took a lot of crap for a long time , and then you guys betrayed us .
Why we would we even think twice of pulling a lever again ?
Fool me once , shame on me , fool me twice -- oh my God !
Steele : No , Glenn , look , I 'm not going to soft - pedal this with you , I 'm not going to try to blow smoke either .
The reality of it is you are absolutely right .
You have absolutely no reason -- none -- to trust our word or our actions at this point .
So yeah , it 's going to be an uphill climb .

Younger adults are more likely to be able to illegally download music or get hold of a pirate DVD than wire a plug or bake a cake .
Almost a third of them do n’t even know how to knot a tie .
Less than half of adults can change a tyre on a car or a bike , the study by internet search engine Ask.com found .
Of 1,000 adults polled , only 49 per cent could darn a sock , though this falls to 21 per cent of the under - 30s and rises to 68 per cent of those over 60 .
But this could change as more people look to the forgotten arts of domestic life to save money in the current climate .
Ask.com has noticed a big rise in searches for “ how to ” guides online , from car repairs to baking .
I want to start with a question .
Why do you think political parties exist ?
Because I think in the answer to that question lies the truth about just how profoundly the internet is going to change politics and journalism .
Here ’s my own answer .
Political parties exist because of the mass media .
They grew up with the mass media .
Before the mass media , we did n’t really have political parties .
Sure , we had loose coalitions and factions , but the current monsters with their tight whipping and insistence that everybody say the same thing about everything ?
That came only after the newspapers and broadcasters had come first .
After the creation of the mass media , a very small number of people – proprietors , editors , political journalists – began to act as the gateway to the voter .
So politicians organised themselves in tight groupings to make their message intelligible to that small group , to lobby them and to seduce them .
There was little space for mavericks .
They just confused things .
In his book The Long Tail , Chris Anderson described how limited shelf space for goods works .
A shop can only fit a few things in its premises .
The constraint is physical .
For niche products , there was n’t really a way of reaching customers at all .
The internet changes that , argues Anderson .
A long tail of products with a small potential market ( specialist books , for instance ) can be easily obtained .
And easily produced , too .
New production technologies allow retailers to source , or even produce , single items when they are requested .
As it is with produce , so it is with politics .
This first struck me with force when the Labour MP Siôn Simon made that YouTube video impersonating David Cameron .
( “ Want to sleep with my wife ?
That ’s cool .
Come down , check it out , we ’ll sort it out .
Safe .
I ’ve got two kids , kid one , kid two .
You like them ?
Take one .
That ’s cool . ” )
It was n’t so much that Siôn made an idiot of himself ; it was , rather , what it cost to do that .
In order to make that big an idiot of myself , I had , when working for the Conservative Party , required hundreds of thousands of pounds and M&C Saatchi .
Siôn had required only a video camera and his fellow Labour MP Tom Watson .
I realised then that the days when only a huge central operation could get any sort of message across were over .
To use another example , look at John Prescott .
He has managed , using a BlackBerry and a blogging account , to communicate with voters without needing to have his message approved by anybody .
And his success will draw in others .
The result will be a weakening of central party control .
It is already happening in the Tory party .
The ConservativeHome website – a stunning endeavour , certainly one of the biggest developments in right - wing journalism for 20 years – is now an important rival to the official party site .
It is the place where members meet , where campaigns start and where news can be exchanged .
I recently read a story on that site about the resignation of a Conservative Party area officer in Northern Ireland .
The Conservatives have concluded an electoral pact with the Ulster Unionists .
One consequence has been a dispute over the party ’s name when the two fight together in Northern Ireland , and this caused the resignation .
This is a tale too arcane to make a news story , but there it was on the site , with a frequently updated account of the whole row .
And ConservativeHome readers expect to find that sort of stuff there .
The internet has allowed a relatively tiny number of party insiders and obsessives to find one another and form their own community .
Without the party ’s permission .
Without the party ’s database .
Without the party ’s money .
The internet has hugely reduced the entry cost for new publications .
Iain Dale ’s very popular blog , or the witty Guido Fawkes site , cost little more than the time of those who write them .
With only themselves for backing , they are able to get very similar audience figures to ( plucking a random example out of the air ) my own Comment Central blog on the Times site .
And the impact that the Guido site , in particular , has made on the political debate has been significant .
It will make it cheaper , too , for MPs to reach their own voters locally .
The requirement for activists to deliver leaflets and knock on doors will diminish , as voters can be reached on their home computers .
MPs may also gain some freedom from the national party .
So the internet will devolve power .
But that ’s not all it will do .
It could be a powerful weapon in the hands of the party organisations , too .
If they knew how to use it .
So far , the parties have got to the point of developing better websites , making use of YouTube and trying a touch of viral marketing .
The Obama campaign of course did so much more than that .
It was using the internet as a social networking tool .
It was getting its activists to communicate with their friends over the net and using mobile phones .
It harnessed their enthusiasm , getting them to make ads , ceding to them a tiny bit of control in exchange for a huge increase in reach .
The major parties have to catch up with what his campaign achieved , and quickly .
The danger for them is not that their rivals in other parties will outperform them .
It is that their own members and supporters will grab control , taking over the functions of party HQ without asking .
One more thing .
The modern political party was the creation of the mass media .
And the mass media are being replaced , becoming part of something much larger , sprawling , impossible to control .
It has hardly started .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. wheat , beef , rice and bean exports to Mexico face possible retaliatory duties in a dispute over whether Mexican trucks will be able to operate in the United States , Republican lawmakers said on Monday .
Mexico said earlier on Monday it would raise tariffs on 90 U.S. industrial and agricultural goods in reprisal for U.S. cancellation of a pilot cross - border trucking program .
That program was intended to move the United States closer to implementing a commitment it made under the North American Free Trade Agreement .
“ Because Congress has terminated the pilot program in violation of our NAFTA obligations , Mexico has announced that it will retaliate against us , as it is entitled to do , by increasing duties on $ 2.4 billion of U.S. exports of key commodities like wheat , beans , beef , and rice , ” Representative Kevin Brady , a Texas Republican , said in statement .
Congress killed the pilot program , which allowed some Mexican trucks to travel long distances in the United States , in a 2009 appropriations bill recently signed by President Barack Obama .
“ Unfortunately , this is a predictable reaction by the Mexican government to a policy that now puts the United States in clear violation of the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) and was inappropriately inserted into the Omnibus appropriations bill , ” said Senator John McCain , an Arizona Republican .
Mexican Economy Minister Gerardo Ruiz said Mexico would soon publish a list of goods to be hit with the increased duties .
MEXICO A MAJOR GRAIN MARKET
Last year , Mexico was the top export destination for U.S. rice , the No. 2 destination for soybeans and the third largest buyer of U.S. wheat , according to U.S. Agriculture Department data .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters the White House wanted to work with lawmakers , Mexican officials and the U.S. trade representative to come up with a new trucking scheme to replace the canceled program .
When it signed the North American Free Trade Agreement , the United States agreed to allow Mexican trucks to travel on U.S. highways beginning in 1995 .
Under a pilot program , a limited number of Mexican trucks were being allowed to drive beyond a zone near the U.S. border .
The recently passed legislation to fund most U.S. government operations through the rest of the 2009 fiscal year included an amendment by Senator Byron Dorgan , a Democrat from North Dakota , to kill the trucking program .
“ Congress has opposed the ( trucking ) project in the past because of concerns about the process that led to the program ’s establishment and its operation , ” Gibbs told a briefing .
“ The president has tasked the Department of Transportation to work with the U.S. trade representative and the Department of State , along with leaders in Congress and Mexican officials to propose legislation creating a new trucking project that will meet the legitimate concerns of Congress and our NAFTA commitments , ” he said .
Gibbs said Dorgan had written the White House to “ express his willingness to work with the administration in good faith to address this issue . ”
Each year the office of the US Trade Representative releases " Special 301 " watch lists , identifying countries that it believes " deny adequate and effective protection for intellectual property rights , " in order to pressure trading partners to strengthen IP laws or step up enforcement against piracy .
The US - based International Intellectual Property Alliance — a consortium of copyright industry trade groups that includes the Business Software Alliance , Entertainment Software Association , Motion Picture Association of America , and Recording Industry Association of America — released its own humble recommendations for the lists this week , naming 38 countries that it believes need to do more to crack down in IP infringement — and once again singling out China , Russia , and ( yes , really ) Canada for special attention as " priority " offenders .
The USTR must produce its final " watch list " and " priority watch list " by April 30 .
The IIPA 's 2009 report recommends 13 countries for the " priority " list : Argentina , Brunei , Canada , Chile , China , Egypt , India , Indonesia , Mexico , Pakistan , the Philippines , Russia , and Thailand .
A further 25 are nominated for the plain vanilla watch list , including Israel , which the group suggests downgrading from the priority list , as well as new additions Sweden , Bulgaria , and Kazakhstan , due to " recent troubling legislative and / or enforcement developments in their respective markets . "
Taiwan is dropped from the proposed watch lists entirely for the first time in a decade — though it remains on a shorter list of honorable - mention countries deserving " special monitoring . "
To justify its recommendations , the report also includes industry - specific breakdowns for purported dollar losses to US industry attributable to each targeted country .
All told — and including both the recommended watch - list countries and those named for " special monitoring " — IIPA claims member groups lost some $ 18.4 billion due to lax IP enforcement or insufficiently stringent laws in 2008 , down from $ 20.1 billion in 2007 — though much of that decline is presumably attributable to the exclusion of the movie , book publishing , and video game industries , for which current figures were n't provided : Video games claimed $ 2.7 billion in losses for 2007 , books $ 529 million .
The current number , then breaks down as $ 16.4 billion in claimed losses for business software makers and $ 1.97 billion for the music industry .
Though a precise 2008 number is n't yet available , video game makers did attempt to gauge the scale of piracy abroad .
In December alone , they claimed that 13 popular titles were downloaded 6.4 million times — with just two titles accounting for 4.7 million of those .
Italy and Spain alone were named as the top downloaders , together accounting for nearly a third of the illicit copying , with France , Germany , and Poland following close behind .
Not everyone takes industry loss estimates at face value , of course .
As an appendix explaining the methodology behind the numbers makes clear , the Business Software Association is in the habit of counting every pirated copy of software installed on a computer abroad as a lost sale at full market price — a plainly invalid inference that Ars has criticized with depressing frequency , to little avail .
The RIAA appears to follow the same model , though the appendix is somewhat vague , while in the past the movie and video game industries have at least attempted to adjust their figures by estimating the proportion of pirate customers who might otherwise buy the legal product .
Countries that find themselves on the list have raised their own objections in the past .
Canadian officials have complained that the " Special 301 " process " lacks reliable and objective analysis " and is " driven entirely by U.S. industry . "
The USTR 's 301 lists may have added significance this year , thanks to the passage of the PRO - IP
Act which creates a federal copyright " czar " charged with developing a coordinated , interagency IP protection plan , including aid to help pirate - friendly countries step up enforcement and special liaisons to piracy " hotspots . "
A full list of public submissions to the USTR on the 301 process can be found at Regulations .

Several years ago , I helped develop some software that integrates and monitors certain business processes .
We chose to use Linux - based systems because of some key free and open source software that allowed us to put together a sophisticated and comprehensive software platform .
So often , the defense of Linux involves a price argument .
More important than the free price is the freedom Linux and other GPL software represent .
Lately , I have noticed a lot of bloggers disparaging Linux - based operating systems for all kinds of reasons , from aesthetics to business strategies .
Of these , Linux Hater ’s blog stood above the rest , and though his criticisms are generally valid , he completely misses the mark .
Though we should never avoid holding Linux - based operating systems to the same standards as proprietary platforms , we must recognize that any shortcomings are minor in the context of all of the successes of Linux and open source software .
We Need Linux
Linux and GPL - type free and open source software are welcome and normal reactions to a culture that remains generally oblivious to the consequences of proprietary technology .
Most culturally significant geeks speak fondly of hacking gadgets and software in the dawn of the Information Age , but a lot of what was normal then is against federal law now .
Just as we have seen the nearly unbelievable consolidation of just about every other industry , we now see some of the same players trying to lock customers out of products by design , technology and legislation .
GNU and Linux are essential to repelling this notion of complete privatization wherein developers would presumably have to pay royalties to use software development tools , if they were even available to lone programmers .
The world of ubiquitous proprietary software looks disturbingly like broadcast media when you put it all in place .
Rather than the latest frontier for the Marketplace of Ideas , if closed - source commercial software actually killed off FOSS , the Internet would effectively be cable TV .
This model has worked really effectively for powerful market participants , and they ’re eager to get the Web under control and employing a more familiar revenue model in place of the prevailing ad hoc anarchy .
Ignorance Is Ignorant
I empathize and / or agree with many of the allegations and complaints of critics inside and outside the Linux community , but I ’m somewhat astounded that people who seem so otherwise clever overlook the key idea of this whole exercise .
The GNU General Public License has provided an alternative to the status quo , which is hopelessly infatuated with this idea that ignorance is bliss .
Rather than having good ideas stolen and privatized , the copyleft GPL makes sharing the rule .
Whether you ’re distributing it or writing software to hook into it , you are legally compelled to distribute your source code as well .
There are ways around the spirit of the GPL and other open source platforms that accommodate proprietary software , but the GPL and Linux play essential roles in ensuring tomorrow ’s geeks are n’t stuck telling stories about writing Facebook widgets .
The user interface and apps may not be as polished as OS X , but a lot of Linux - based programs are well done enough to be viable alternatives to commercial software for users who do n’t have a lot of money to spend on after - market software .
Great Expectations
Moreover , another key element of Linux and open source software is that more users mean interest and more demand .
It ’s easy to identify fledgling free and open source software projects , but objective observation and assessment of Linux - based software over the past three , five and 10 years clearly point to significant forward progress .
Today ’s users complain about Linux - based operating systems because they expect a high - quality user experience .
The operating system that is on the one hand disparaged as being an illegitimate hobbyist platform is simultaneously judged by the same standards as the top commercial operating system , and it is on the same playing field — clearly not as refined , but definitely competitive in features .
Rather than rattling off deficiencies , providing specific feedback would be a more constructive use of time and keystrokes .
To that end , the open source landscape is littered with abandoned software projects , not altogether unlike the commercial software world .
This can be a real nuisance , but unlike with commercial software , you can arbitrarily continue developing open source software projects ( or fork them , of course , at your own risk ) .
Depending on your needs , you can modify the software to be custom for your organization or release it back to the general public with your changes and updates .
The GPL model admittedly presents challenges for some businesses and developers that produce proprietary software , but it more than compensates by creating a collection of software that is always growing in both size and sophistication .
When observed from the standpoint of being a completely free and open source operating system that has gone from a kernel - less mishmash of programs to a stable , feature - rich platform that is used by a significant percentage of domestic servers and international desktops , one sees critics attacking straw men .
Frankly , open source software is bigger than GPL , and all kinds of open source software has benefitted businesses large and small .
When the Linux Hater ’s blog rails about meta community quirks and legitimate software issues , it seems almost like a ( perhaps obsessed ) fellow traveler , but when detractors criticize open source generally , as if it ’s some sort of homogenous group , I take pause .
That sort of talk makes me wonder if they ’re even offering earnest tirades .

He is a director of Intarcorp , publisher of the Linux - oriented educational comic book series , “ Hackett and Bankwell . ”
A fair number of people , including some editors I know , are amazed that Barack Obama is actually trying to do what he said he would do during the campaign .
And , I must admit , I was n’t convinced he would go all the way with programs like cap - and - trade limitations on carbon emissions .
But he is .
And , I suspect , the public is ready for it .
Republicans , stunned that what passed for conventional wisdom for thirty years is no longer operative , are still attempting arguments like this one :
“ The risks are too much too soon , and piling on , and triggering class warfare , ” said Kenneth Khachigian , a former aide to Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan .
In truth , class warfare is what the Reagan Era gave us : thirty years of tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of the common weal , thirty years of lax regulations which enabled the bankers to strip - mine the savings of average Americans while reaping huge rewards in Ponzi schemes , like the micro-dividing of mortgage assets that were really debits .
Once again , I ’m not sure Obama ’s proposals will work–some will surely be more successful than others , there ’s a good chance that rather than being too bold , he is n’t being bold enough–but I am absolutely certain where the continuation , or augmentation , of Reagan - Bush policies would leave us : even worse off than we are now .
Update : E.J. Dionne has more on this theme , laying out the real stakes of the game .
Cheaper Concentrating Solar For Photovoltaics
While the bulk of concentrating solar now in use is for solar thermal steam electric power generation it is not the only use of concentrating solar .
Highly concentrated light shined on photovoltaic ( PV ) materials greatly lowers the amount of PV needed .
If the concentrator costs less than PV for the same area then concentrator plus PV can be a cheaper way to go .
A Canadian company , Morgan Solar , claims to have a better way to concentrate sunlight for PV solar .
A couple of years ago , Nicolas 's brother John Paul Morgan came up with the idea of a solid - state solar concentrator system : a flat , thin acrylic optic that traps light and guides it toward its center .
Embedded in the center of Morgan Solar 's concentrator is a secondary , round optic made of glass .
With a flat bottom and convex , mirrored top , the optic receives the incoming barrage of light at a concentration of about 50 suns and amplifies it to nearly 1,000 suns before bending the light through a 90 - degree angle .
Unlike other concentrators , the light does n't leave the optic before striking a solar cell .
Instead , a high - efficiency cell about the size of an infant 's thumbnail is bonded directly to the center bottom of the glass optic , where it absorbs the downward - bent light .
There 's no air gap , and there 's no chance of fragile components being knocked out of alignment .
They think they can compete with thin film solar on costs by 2011 .
Some business and engineering decisions must still be made , but he expects that the company will be able to build its system for less than $ 1 per watt by 2011 - -" and with some vertical integration , considerably less . "
This would lead to a product close to 30 percent efficient at costs competitive with thin film .
FirstSolar is the market leader for low cost thin film photovoltaics .
In Q1 2008 FirstSolar claimed a manufacturing cost of $ 1.14 per watt .
They are n't sitting still .
By 3Q 2008 they were claiming $ 1.08 per watt .
Their cost will be even lower in 2 years time .
Morgan Solar needs to come in under $ 1 per watt to compete .
Concentrating solar for PV is best used with higher priced PV that has higher conversion efficiencies .
The higher cost for materials with higher conversion efficiency does not matter because the amount of PV used is very small .
Concentrating solar 's ability to compete might end up hinging on how much conversion efficiencies improve .
A doubling of conversion efficiency would probably cut Morgan 's cost in half .
More than a doubling in PV conversion efficiency might be possible .
Update : First Solar claims a manufacturing cost below $ 1 per watt for 4Q 2008 .
TEMPE , Ariz .--( BUSINESS WIRE ) -- Feb. 24 , 2009 -- First Solar , Inc. ( Nasdaq : FSLR ) today announced it reduced its manufacturing cost for solar modules in the fourth quarter to 98 cents per watt , breaking the $ 1 per watt price barrier .
 This achievement marks a milestone in the solar industrys evolution toward providing truly sustainable energy solutions ,  said Mike Ahearn , First Solar chief executive officer .
 First Solar is proud to be leading the way toward clean , affordable solar electricity as a viable alternative to fossil fuels . 
First Solar has cut their cost by about 16 % in less than a year .
Impressive .
Complaints that solar PV costs go down too slowly are starting to sound outdated .
Listverse has published a couple of fine lists on misquotes from Shakespeare , movies and other subjects .
What follows is a list of 15 of the more notable political and military misquotes .
Sources I used were some books from my shelves , Snopes.com , the New York Times and good ol ’ Google .
Quote numbers 15 - 11 are usually attributed to the correct person , but the words are different or twisted .
Numbers 10 - 7 are correct attributions but the person in question did n’t coin the phrase .
Numbers 6 - 1 usually are attributed to the wrong person entirely .
15 William T. Sherman
Quote : “ If nominated , I will not run .
If elected , I will not serve . ”
What he actually said : “ I will not accept if nominated and will not serve if elected . ”
It means exactly the same thing , but the actual language is less poetic than the misquote .
14 George Santayana
Quote : “ Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it . ”
What he actually said :
In “ Life of Reason , ” Santayana wrote , “ Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . ”
The differences are more than just subtle , because “ history ” implies a fixed set of events while “ the past ” refers to all of history .
13 Lord Acton
Quote : “ Power corrupts ; absolute power corrupts absolutely . ”
What he actually said : “ Power tends to corrupt ; absolute power corrupts absolutely .
Great men are almost always bad men . ”
The subtle difference between the misquote and actual quote is akin to the difference between kinetic energy and potential energy .
In the misquote , it ’s implied that all power corrupts .
In the real quote , it states that power has the potential to corrupt , but not automatically .
12 Karl Marx
Quote : “ Religion is the opiate of the masses . ”
What he actually said : “ Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature , the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions .
It is the opium of the people . ”
The bastardized quote makes more sense when it ’s placed in context with Marx ’s poetic words .
11 Calvin Coolidge
Quote : “ The business of America is business . ”
What he actually said : “ After all , the chief business of the American people is business .
They are profoundly concerned with producing , buying , selling , investing and prospering in the world . ”
The full quote is much more meaningful than the misquote .
10 Thomas Jefferson
Quote : “ The price of liberty is eternal vigilance . ”
Where it came from :
It ’s probable that the brilliant Jefferson uttered or wrote these words , but they did n’t originate with him .
John Philpot Curran , an Irish judge , said it first : “ The condition upon which God hath given liberty to man is eternal vigilance ; which condition if he break , servitude is at once the consequence of his crime , and the punishment of his guilt . ”
9 Benjamin Franklin
Quote : “ Nothing can be said to be certain , except death and taxes . ”
Where it came from :
While Ben Franklin definitely used the quote in his “ Poor Richard ’s Almanac , ” it did n’t originate with him and first appeared earlier .
Edward Ward in his 1724 “ Dancing Devils ” wrote “ Death and Taxes , they are certain . ”
And Christopher Bullock wrote in his 1716 “ Cobler of Preston ” that “ ’ Tis impossible to be sure of anything but Death and Taxes . ”
8 Harry S. Truman
Quote : “ The Buck Stops Here ”
Where it came from :
Although permanently identified with my fellow Missourian , “ The Buck Stops Here ” most likely did n’t begin with Truman .
He adopted this phrase in 1945 , apparently after receiving a gift from El Reno , Oklahoma , bearing the words .
As further proof , a Yale librarian discovered an El Reno newspaper photograph from 1942 that clearly displays the phrase on the desk of a colonel at the Federal Reformatory at El Reno , where the gift to Truman came from .
7 William Prescott
Quote : “ Do n’t fire ‘ til you see the whites of their eyes ! ”
Where it came from : Usually William Prescott is credited with saying this at the 1775 battle of Bunker Hill : “ Do n’t fire ‘ til you see the whites of their eyes .
Then , fire low ! ”
However , he was n’t the first .
Frederick the Great said it in 1755 during the Seven Years War , and a British officer named Sir Andrew Agnew said the first recorded instance at Dettingen in 1743 .
( A couple of sources claim that Andrew Jackson said this at the battle of New Orleans , but it ’s probably apocryphal . )
6 Chief Seattle
Quote : “ How can you buy or sell the sky , the warmth of the land ? …
The end of living and the beginning of survival . ”
( Those are the opening and closing lines of a speech attributed to him . )
Who really said it : Not Chief Seattle .
He never said that long speech in 1854 or any other time .
Instead , a screenwriter named Ted Perry wrote the entire speech in 1971 for a 1972 ecological movie called “ Home ” — about 115 years after Seattle died .
Nevertheless , the bogus speech has been treated as authentic by various authors , environmentalists and Al Gore .
5 Edmund Burke
Quote : “ It is necessary only for the good man to do nothing for evil to triumph . ”
Who really said it :
Who knows ?
Although this quote and its various iterations are almost universally attributed to the British statesman , the phrase never appears in any of Burke ’s writings .
See here for more information .
4 Plato
Quote : “ Only the dead have seen the end of war . ”
Who really said it : Not Plato .
Blame retired Gen. Douglas MacArthur for this one .
In giving a speech , he attributed to Plato what George Santayana wrote thousands of years later in his 1953 book , “ The Life of Reason . ”
Nevertheless , the phrase is wrongly associated with Plato even today .
3 Otto Von Bismarck
Quote : “ To retain respect for sausages and laws , one must not watch them in the making . ”
Who really said it : Probably not Bismarck .
An 1869 issue of The Daily Cleveland Herald quotes lawyer - poet John Godfrey Saxe as having said , “ Laws , like sausages , cease to inspire respect in proportion as we know how they are made . ”
The phrase did n’t come to be associated with the Iron Chancellor until the 1930s , well after his death .
( It ’s still true , though ! )
2 Andrew Jackson
Quote : “ To the victors belong the spoils . ”
Who really said it : Not Jackson , although he certainly agreed with the sentiment .
An ally of Jackson , New York Gov. William Marcy , actually coined the phrase in 1828 to explain why the new president would be doling out offices and appointments to friends and supporters as he saw fit .
The relevant part of the exact quote is : “ When they are contending for victory , they avow their intention of enjoying the fruits of it . …
They see nothing wrong in the rule that to the victor belongs the spoils . ”
Nevertheless , the quote is an accurate assessment .
1 Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto
Quote : “ I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant . ”
Who really said it :
The screenwriters for the 1970 movie “ Tora ! Tora ! Tora ! ”
While it is true that the admiral believed that Japan could not win a * protracted * war against the United States , an actor uttered the famous phrase , not him .
I own the definitive bio on Yamamoto ( Hiroyuki Agawa ’s “ The Reluctant Admiral ” ) and the phrase does not appear there .
The sleeping giant phrase started in 1970 and has been repeated ever since , even appearing in the ( laughably stupid ) “ Pearl Harbor . ”
The closest Yamamoto came to saying the “ sleeping giant ” quote came in early 1942 ( quoted in that book ) : “ A military man can scarcely pride himself on having ‘ smitten a sleeping enemy ’ ; it is more a matter of shame , simply , for the one smitten .
I would rather you made your appraisal after seeing what the enemy does , since it is certain that , angered and outraged , he will soon launch a determined counterattack . ”

In just their latest posturing for the 2012 Republican presidential race , governors Sarah Palin ( R - AK ) and Mark Sanford ( R - SC ) joined Texas ' Rick Perry , Mississippi's Haley Barbour and Louisiana 's Bobby Jindal in announcing they would reject some of the federal stimulus funds allocated to their states .
But as the steady one - way flow of tax dollars and earmarks spreading the wealth from Washington to their states shows , de facto red state socialism is alive and well .
As a 2007 analysis ( above ) of federal spending per tax dollar received by state shows , the reddest states generally reaped the most green .
Eight of the top 10 beneficiaries of federal largesse voted for John McCain for President .
Unsurprisingly , all 10 states at the bottom of the list - those whose outflow of tax revenue is funding programs elsewhere in the country - all voted for Barack Obama in 2008 .
The numbers for Sarah Palin's Alaska are particularly telling .
While Palin declared she would reject $ 288 million ( 31 % ) of the $ 931 million funds allocated for schools , energy assistance and social services , her state led the nation in earmark dollars received per capita in the omnibus spending bill just passed .
( Alaskans got almost $ 210 per person in earmarks , while Californians got $ 16 and New Yorkers $ 13 in comparison . )
Overall , Alaska ranks third in the federal gravy train , taking in $ 1.84 from Washington for each dollar sent there .
Bobby Jindal 's Louisiana also gets a pretty sweet deal from taxpayers around the United States .
Jindal 's home rates # 4 in pocketing federal spending per tax dollar contributed , just behind Haley Barbour 's Mississippi ( # 2 ) and Palin 's Alaska .
( In all likelihood , the massive spending of the Hurricane Katrina recovery effort may have moved Louisiana to number one since this 2005 data was compiled . )
Foregoing $ 98 million in funds designated for unemployment insurance out of $ 3.5 billion set aside for his state wo n't be a sacrifice for Bobby Jindal .
For the residents of his state , that is another matter altogether .
After the Obama Office of Management and Budget refused South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford 's request to use $ 700 million to pay down the Palmetto State 's debt , Sanford confirmed he would refuse those funds altogether .
( Ironically , Sanford , too , is rejecting intended to provide extended unemployment benefits in a state where joblessness is a staggering 10.4 % . )
Still , Sanford will take the rest of the $ 2.8 billion headed for South Carolina , which already receives $ 1.35 from DC for every tax dollar paid .
Alone among the Republican refuseniks in leading a state which is a net contributor to federal coffers is Texas Governor Rick Perry .
While Perry has threatened to turn down $ 555 million in unemployment benefits from the $ 787 billion ARRA recovery package , Texas at least gives more to the U.S. Treasury than it receives in return .
Ranking 35th , the Lone Star State gets back only 95 cents on its tax dollar .
( That will come as welcome news to Texas secessionist Chuck Norris . )
None of which is to suggest that there is anything untoward or inappropriate in the underwriting of red states by blue ones .
On the contrary .
After all , many of these Republican states are home both to key defense contractors and military bases which help ensure U.S. national security .
Just as important , Americans nationwide want to provide the funding and resources for the education , health care and anti-poverty programs their red state brethren badly need - and deserve .
So while Palin , Perry , Jindal , Sanford and Barbour vie for the crown of mythical fiscal conservative , most Americans want them to just take the stimulus money .
( Sadly , a report from the CBO this week suggests that state legislature may not have the constitutional authority to override them . )
No doubt , most of the residents in their own states feel the same way .
First , Kanye demanded that straights “ take back the rainbow ” from the gays and now this .
Is there no end to the Rainbow Wars ?
David Svornic , a school principal in Peoria , Arizona has a letter waiting on his desk when he gets back from Spring Break next week .
After calling Natali Quintanilla and telling her that her 14 - year - old son could n’t wear a rainbow wristband with the phrase “ Rainbows are Gay ” , or at the very least , he had to turn it inside out , because her son was , he allegedly said “ putting his sexuality out there . ”
Svornic , who called the wristbands “ offensive ” an a “ disruption ” is the target of an ACLU complaint , which points out that students were allowed to wear black armbands in opposition to the Vietnam War , based on a Supreme Court ruling 40 years ago .
The letter concludes , “ “ It is our hope that the district will now allow Chris and other students to wear or otherwise display messages or symbols expressing their support of LGBT rights . ”
From the ACLU press release :
“ The Supreme Court has held that students have a right to free speech at school , and that includes gay students .
The ACLU has won dozens of cases over the years where schools have tried to get away with illegal censorship , ” said Elizabeth Gill , staff attorney for the ACLU national Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Project .
“ A handful of teachers supposedly working themselves into a tizzy over one little wristband is hardly an excuse for violating Chris Quintanilla ’s right to free speech . ”
You can read the letter they sent to Svornic here ( pdf ) .
The only thing we can think to add to this discussion is that the wristband is pretty clever , since the phrase sort of fucks with the whole “ gay means weak ” meme so popular with the middle school set .
Afghanistan on the Brink The West Stares into the Abyss

Pictured : British safari park ranger gives a relaxing foot massage ... to a LION
Most people shy away from giving their partner a foot massage let alone dishing one out to a 40 stone killing machine .
But British park ranger Alex Larenty is made of sterner stuff and has no qualms about gently rubbing the paws of a lion under his care .
The 50 - year - old regularly treats Jamu to a foot massage and these pictures make it clear the eight - year - old lion is appreciative .
Rolling around like a kitten , Jamu appears to be having the time of his life .
Foot master : British zookeeper Alex Larenty gives Jamu the lion a relaxing massage
The shots were taken at The Lion Park , near Johannesburg , South Africa , just weeks before a man who broke into the reserve was mauled and killed .
Mr Larenty , who is originally from Chipping Norton , Oxfordshire , said the animal has complete trust in him .
He said : ' The photographs demonstrate how much at ease he is with me .
' Trust me , though , you need to know what you are doing and our relationship is one that has built up over the last six years .
Jamu wo n't just let anyone touch him the way I do .
' We have 75 lions here at the park and I know everyone by name , Jamu is a star in his own right though .
' While these lions know me and they are tame in some way , they are still dangerous to people they do n't know or in situations they are unsure about . '
Best of friends : Mr Larenty hugs Jamu , who he says has complete trust in him
Mr Larenty revealed that tragically a local a man was killed a few weeks ago after breaking into the park while trying to fulfil a tribal right of passage .
He said : ' The man broke into the park because he was told by his tribal elders that he must walk with lions to prove himself .
' He broke through three fences and walked 150 yards into the park before the lions got him , I found two of them sitting on top of the body the next day .
' It shows that even lions who are not fully wild can still be a real threat if they are not used to you or they do n't know you . '
Father - of - two Mr Larenty said he and Jamu had worked together on several wildlife films recreating ' wild ' behaviour .
He said : ' Often filmakers want to use Jamu for the shots which they just can't get in the wild and that is where his training comes in .
' People in Britain might recognise Jamu from the TV show Wild At Heart on ITV which he is a regular on . '
( CNN ) -- International scientists have announced the discovery of a tiny moon orbiting Saturn .
The speck of light , captured by cameras on board the Cassini spacecraft , was first observed on August 15 .
The speck of light , captured by cameras on board the Cassini spacecraft , was first observed on August 15 .
A review found the moonlet on two earlier images and it has since been seen on multiple occasions .
The finding appeared in Tuesday 's edition of the International Astronomical Union circular .
The moon is about one - third of a mile ( a half - kilometer ) across and circles Saturn as a part of the planet 's sixth , or G , ring .
" Before Cassini , the G ring was the only dusty ring that was not clearly associated with a known moon , which made it odd , " said Matthew Hedman , a Cassini imaging team associate at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York .
" The discovery of this moonlet , together with other Cassini data , should help us make sense of this previously mysterious ring . "
Early next year , Cassini 's camera will take a closer look at the moonlet .
The Cassini Equinox mission , an extension of the original four - year mission , is expected to continue until fall 2010 .
If the craft continues to function properly , the mission could be extended up to two more years .
Cassini , which was funded by NASA and the European and Italian space agencies , launched in 1997 and took seven years to make the 934 million - mile ( 1.5 billion - kilometer ) trip to Saturn .
Since its arrival , Cassini has been making a looping voyage through the Saturn system and is returning loads of data on the ringed planet and its moons .
Three years ago , a space probe launched from Cassini found evidence of geysers erupting from underground pools of liquid water on Saturn 's moon Enceladus .
High - definition pictures beamed back from the probe showed huge plumes of ice coming from the moon 's south pole .

Great Lakes : The Next Great Offshore Wind Power Source
March 5th , 2009 by Dave Tyler
Are we destined to see offshore wind farms cropping up all over the Great Lakes ?
Presenters at the Michigan Wind Conference , which closed Wednesday in Detroit , think so .
The bountiful prevailing winds and relatively shallow depths make the lakes excellent locations for farms , speakers told the more than 1,000 people attended the event , according to WWJ radio .
“ Offshore wind is the next wave — lots of puns , folks , I warn you , ” said Peter Mandelstam , founder and president of Bluewater Wind , LLC , of Delaware .
“ The Northeast and the Great Lakes are natural markets . ”
Mandelstam also said the Great Lakes offer no significant water use conflicts and accessible transmission and ports .
There ’s also little opposition from the public if the turbines are built more than 10 miles from shore , he said .
Offshore wind farms are much more common in Europe than they are in the U.S.
And the lakes have their own set of construction and maintenance challenges because they freeze almost completely in the winter and saltwater farms usually do n’t encounter the same level of ice .
Ice floes and ridges formed when lakes freeze could damage the turbine towers , some studies have cautioned .
But an official with the Trillium Wind Power Corp. , which is building a 700 megawatt wind farm in Canadian waters in Lake Ontario told the New York Times last month the problems can be overcome with barriers around the turbines and other defenses .
Michigan has been planning to capitalize on its wind power potential for some time .
New York has ambitious plans for wind power as well .
Building wind farms offshore seems to be a convenient way to deal with the NIMBY issue that many terrestrial wind farms create .
Let ’s see if more companies begin looking at the Lakes for their projects .

" Oh , bollocks . "
No , we can't definitively prove that Gordon Brown said that after witnessing a " Wrong Region " code when inserting a DVD given to him by Barack Obama , but we 're sure something of the sort was uttered .
You see , the ridiculous DVD region coding system recently prevented the British Prime Minister from viewing a set of 25 " American classics " on DVD , all of which were bestowed upon him by President Obama during a recent visit to Washington , D.C.
We hate to bludgeon a dead mule , but seriously , when will the DRM madness end ?
Er , on second thought , maybe this is precisely what 's necessary to keep those region - free player outlets in business , and thus , the economy strong .

One of my favorite websites of all time was the American Song - Poem Music Archive .
Back in 2004 , all the song - poem mp3s from the ASPMA site mysteriously disappeared .
However , I 've managed to collect all the tunes from the site and squirreled them away into my collection on randomly - sequenced audio CDs .
I always wanted to make them available again and thanks to Otis Fodder and the WFMU team , I now have a means of doing so .
I humbly present the Song - Poem Archived Music series - I have at least nine volumes planned for re-release and I will be posting one each month .
All tracks have been fixed up ( I hesitate to say remastered ) and re-encoded at a higher bitrate for maximum enjoyment .
Any audio quality problems are with the original files , and this is the best they can be .
And of course , a huge thank you to Phil Milstein , who hosted these files in the first place .
And from his original mp3 page he also thanks " MP3 contributors : John Fitzpatrick , Brian Linds , Tom Ardolino , Jeff Miller , Jeremy Pisani , Michael Greenberg , Will Louviere , Barbara Economon , Pea Hicks , John Trubee , Robert Dayton , Chuck Foster , Jim Blanchard , Bob Purse , Narkspud , Marc Smith and Gregg Turkington .

Yet many experts say that even if the tests were accurate , there would still be uncertainty in how to treat patients .
There is considerable debate about how much vitamin D is needed and whether vitamin D supplements even prevent various diseases .
Vitamin D is usually made by the body when the skin is exposed to sunlight and is also contained in oily fish and some fortified drinks like milk .
Some doctors said they had switched to other testing laboratories because of Quest ’s problems .
But Quest , based in Madison , N.J. , offers numerous tests , from routine blood work to sophisticated genetic tests .
No one type of test represents a large potion of its revenue , which was $ 5.45 billion for the first nine months of 2008 .
The company said the retesting would not have a material effect on its earnings .
The company ’s stock price rose 80 cents Wednesday to $ 49.20 , approximately in the middle of its 52 - week range .
Image Dr. Lawrence D. Rosen , of Oradell , N.J. , said retesting was an inconvenience for the more than 20 of his patients needing it .
Credit ... Juan Arredondo for The New York Times
Quest ’s problems with the vitamin D analysis arose after it shifted in 2006 and 2007 to a new test of its own design , replacing an older F.D.A. - approved test .
The new test promised to be more accurate and offer more detailed information , Quest executives said .
But the test relied on a sophisticated instrument called a mass spectrometer , which can be tricky to use , especially for high - volume testing .
Dr. Wael A. Salameh , the medical director for endocrinology at Quest ’s most sophisticated laboratory , which is in San Juan Capistrano , Calif. , said some materials used to calibrate test results had been faulty .
And four of the seven Quest testing laboratories around the country did not always follow proper procedures , he said .
Quest would not say how many patients were affected .
But a spokesman did not deny that thousands of doctors were sent letters in October .
Each doctor had at least one patient , and in many cases dozens of patients , who had a possibly inaccurate test result .
Sarah wrote to a birth email list : Just a question to everyone .
What is your position on circumcision ?
Do you try to talk your clients out of it ?
If you feel strongly against it , would you make it a condition of your practice not to take on clients who plan to do it ?
Hi Sarah , I speak to EVERYONE about ending circumcision .
The only people who cut the genitals of infant boys are those who do not have all the facts .
It ’s a matter of education .
It ’s also a human rights issue .
The question to ask clients is : “ Do you plan to leave a boy intact ? ”
If the clients say “ Yes , I want my son kept intact ” , it ’s important to give them information about not EVER retracting the foreskin .
The boy should be the only one doing that .
There ’s a very good information pamphlet at http://www.circumstitions.com/Itsaboy.html
If the parents say “ Yes , I plan to cut my son ’s genitals ” , it ’s important to find out what their reasoning is .
You can then direct them to this video which explains the role and function of the foreskin : http://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/video/prepuce.html
There are websites for Jewish and Muslim parents to support them in keeping their son intact and more and more religious families are abolishing this cruel and archaic practice .
I have an email list called prepuceprotectinprofessionals@yahoogroups.com if anyone wants to join a support list for professionals where we share resources to protect baby boys .

Sarah wrote in reply : I ’m new to being a doula and this is the one thing I ’m most nervous about –when I get a client , and I ca n’t change their mind what do I do ?
Gloria wrote : I had a hard time when I started out doing childbirth work especially when people were religious .
It was a matter of getting informed and more confident as I went along .
I learned a lot from being on the forums at www.mothering.com
Have you checked out their discussions at “ The Case Against Circumcision ” – the men and women there were really great at educating me and now I have no hesitation even going toe to toe with Jewish grandmothers –the most formidable of all !
There are two expressions that come up there a lot : 1 . Circumcision , the more you know , the worse it gets .
2 . ( When women say they ’ll let their cut husband make the decision ) YOU are the only one in the family with intact genitals so it ’s YOU who should decide .
Thanks for caring enough to be scared .
We have a lot of work to do to turn the tide on male genital mutilation and each and every birth worker makes a difference .
Sarah wrote : I ’m so glad to hear that .
I guess what I ’ll do is just take everybody , and try to show them the light every step of the way .
If they do n’t like it , they can find another doula 🙂 that way , I ’ll know I tried .. . . . it seems like such a cop -out to turn a client away , right ?
Gloria wrote : that ’s right , you never know what will change someone ’s mind .
I like to tell the resistant ones “ If you ’re going to do that , you ’ll have to drive over my body which will be in front of your car tires as you leave the house . ”
I do n’t make bad friends with people if they do it .
I just had clients who cut their first two sons against my strong objections and kept their third son intact .
I think that third boy would have been cut , too , if I was n’t in their lives .
Sarah wrote :
Thank you so much !
it ’s been so hard to get a straight answer out of other midwives and doulas I know .
Most of the responses are along the lines of , “ present the info , let the parents decide ” , etc. and I know I could n’t do that –be “ unattached ” that is .
That ’s wonderful about the 3rd boy .
I think that ’s the kind of story I needed to hear –that it ’s better to keep trying , because you never know what will sway someone or at what point .
I ’m HONORED you want to use our conversation on your blog as an example !
I hope it will help others like me who need encouragement .
Most animals , like humans , have separate sexes — they are born , live out their lives and reproduce as one sex or the other .
However , some animals live as one sex in part of their lifetime and then switch to the other sex , a phenomenon called sequential hermaphroditism .
What remains a puzzle , according to Yale scientists , is why the phenomenon is so rare , since their analysis shows the biological " costs " of changing sexes rarely outweigh the advantages .
A report by Yale scientists in the March issue of The American Naturalist says that while this process is evolutionarily favored , its rarity cannot be explained by an analysis of the biological costs vs benefits .
Sequential hermaphroditism naturally occurs in various organisms from plants to fishes .
Following four decades of research that established why sex change is advantageous , the question remained why it is rare among animals .
In this study , Yale graduate student Erem Kazancıoğlu and his advisor Suzanne Alonzo , assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology , demonstrate that sex change is surprisingly robust against costs .
While the adaptive advantage of sex change is well understood , it is not clear why relatively few animals change sex .
According to Alonzo , " An intuitive , yet rarely studied , explanation is that the considerable time or energy it takes to change sex make hermaphroditism unfeasible for most animals . "
To test whether the biological costs of changing sex affect sex change actually occurs , the researchers built theoretical models of the hermaphrodite and separate - sex life histories .
In their " game " models , sex change " players " vary the age of their sex change , while the separate - sex strategy responds by altering the number of male and female offspring it produces .
" We were surprised to see that a hermaphrodite could spend 30 percent of its lifetime in the process of change sex , and still persist in a population , " said Kazancıoğlu .
" This suggests that only huge costs can disfavor sex change . "
So , why is sex change so rare ?
And , why does one species of fish reproduce strictly as separate sexes , while another very closely related species flexibly changes sex ?
A comparative study of hermaphroditic and separate - sex mating systems , which the authors are currently performing , may provide a clue , according to Kazancıoğlu , " Reproductive behaviors such as parental care seem to disfavor sex change in some species .
We are investigating whether general patterns like these may explain the rarity of hermaphroditism . "
Yale University and the National Science Foundation funded the research .
U.S. President Barack Obama could step into a trade squabble when he visits Ottawa on Feb. 19 . ( ( Charles Dharpak / Associated Press ) )
There is unsettling news for Canada in U.S. President Barack Obama 's economic stimulus bill , or at least in the version approved Wednesday night by the House of Representatives .
It says that steel used in public projects under the $ 819 - billion US plan must be made in the United States , an idea likely to cause trade disputes and block sales by Canadian mills .
As passed by the House , Section 1110 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 says , " None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this act may be used for a project for the construction , alteration , maintenance , or repair of a public building or public work unless all of the iron and steel used in the project is produced in the United States . "
The exceptions to the rule are if " the head of the federal department or agency involved finds that " the rule " would be inconsistent with the public interest , " there is insufficient U.S. iron and steel of satisfactory quality , or including U.S. iron and steel will increase the cost of the project by more than 25 per cent .
This language wo n't necessarily be in the bill when it gets to Obama 's desk for signing , but the final version could be even worse from the point of view of U.S. trading partners .
The Washington Post reported Thursday that a Senate version of the bill , yet to be acted upon , goes further , requiring , with few exceptions , that all stimulus - funded projects use only U.S. - made equipment and goods .
Differences between House and Senate bills are reconciled in a process called conference .
Although the president may ask for legislation , he does n't get to write it , even when his party controls both chambers .
The CBC's Rosemary Barton , reporting from Ottawa , said the suspense is considerable .
" We do n't exactly know what the final language will look like , so you can expect a big push from Canadian lobbyists down in the United States to try and get this as limited as possible so that there is little impact here in this country , " she said .
" Already , there are some American companies expressing concerns about it , about potential retaliation if this were to go further . "
' Countries around the world are expressing grave concern ' : PM
Asked about the issue during question period in the House of Commons , Prime Minister Stephen Harper agreed that it was a serious matter and a serious concern for the government .
" I know that countries around the world are expressing grave concern about some of these measures that go against , not just the obligations of the United States but , frankly , the spirit of our G20 discussions , " Harper said .
" We will be having these discussions with our friends in the United States and we expect the United States to respect its international obligations . "
Industry Minister Tony Clement also did not hide his unease .
" We 're always concerned when there are protectionist pressures in the United States , " he told CBC News .
" The U.S. Congress is a place where you get manifestations of protectionist pressures , there 's no doubt about that , " he added .
" At the same time , the United States has treaty obligations that they have signed on to — NAFTA is one , the World Trade Organization is another — and we expect the United States to live up to its treaty obligations of open and fair trade . "
Canadian steel producers and builders say they have " grave , grave concerns " about the bill .
` There 's no question about it that some of our members and even non-members export work to the U.S. , and it's a substantial part of their business , " said Mike Gilmor , president of the Canadian Institute of Steel Construction .
Canada 's big steelmakers , the former Dofasco , Stelco , Ipsco and Algoma Steel , which have all been bought by foreign buyers , sell to the energy , auto , construction and energy - pipe markets on both sides of the border .
The matter is likely to come up for discussion when Obama visits Ottawa on Feb. 19 in his first foreign trip as president , although the bill could be law by then , given his eagerness to start stimulating the economy .
There are already complaints from overseas about what 's being called the " Buy American " rule .
Europeans also upset
In Brussels , the European Union warned Thursday that it would protest the provision , the Associated Press reported .
Europe will not " stand idly by and ignore " a provision that " prohibits the sale or purchase of European goods on American territory , " EU spokesman Peter Power said .
In Toronto , CBC business reporter Jeannie Lee said there is a great deal at stake for Canada — and especially for southern Ontario , where Canada 's steel industry is concentrated and where the global slump has already gutted the auto industry .
Canadian steel plants produced almost 16 million tonnes of steel in 2007 , employing about 32,000 people and , by one estimate , supporting 140,000 indirect jobs , she said .
Perrin Beatty , president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce , said the proposed U.S. rule is bad for all concerned .
" It 's bad for Canada , it 's bad for the U.S. , it 's bad for the global economy , " he said .
" When you see people engaging in protectionism at the time of a recession , the fear is that other countries will retaliate as well . "
It would leave U.S. taxpayers paying higher prices for public works and could spark " tit for tat " in trade policies , he said .
" The temptation will always be there for someone to say , ' Look , somebody has put up a barrier against us ; we will put up a barrier against them , ' and everybody loses as a result , " he said .

Apple released a new , even smaller iPod shuffle model today .
The third generation of the miniscule mobile music player somewhat resembles a tiny USB flash drive , comes with a 4GB capacity and costs just $ 79 .
The previous generation 1GB models are still available for $ 49 .
The new shuffle comes in anodized silver or black aluminum , so no flashy colors here — Apple suggests that this " makes iPod shuffle a wardrobe essential . "
A new forged stainless steel clip is said to make it attach securely to nearly anything .
The most striking change , however , is that Apple has moved the controls to the earbud cord , giving the shuffle an even more minimalist look .
It still retains the Off / Straight / Shuffle switch of previous shuffles .
Its major new functionality is the addition of Voice Over .
" Imagine your music player talking to you , telling you your song titles , artists and playlist names , " said Greg Joswiak , Apple ’s vice president of iPod and iPhone Product Marketing , in a statement .
" The amazingly small new iPod shuffle takes a revolutionary approach to how you listen to your music by talking to you , also making it the first iPod shuffle with playlists . "
First seen on the fourth - gen iPod nano , which offered " spoken menus , " Voice Over will speak the title and artist of the currently playing song in one of 14 languages — including English , Czech , Dutch , French , German , Greek , Italian , Japanese , Mandarin Chinese , Polish , Portuguese , Spanish , Swedish and Turkish .
And , the new Voice Over functionality enables the shuffle to carry multiple playlists for the first time , as Joswiak said , since it can also tell you the name of the playlists on the device .
The new iPod shuffle is available now via Apple retail stores and the online Apple Store .
I will not pose nude for ANY reason .
I will do implied ( topless only ) but thats it .
NO NUD3S !
If you want to shoot with me send me a message , I check this site pretty regularly .
I prefer some type of compensation for my time !
smile I would like to shoot for tearsheets in popular magazines ... come on , that 's what we all want , right !?
smile so , with that said if you think we can get some published work , or if you just want to shoot me to put in your port ( which I usually would ask for some type of compensation if thats the case ) then message me and lets make it happen !

NEW YORK , March 5 ( Reuters ) - Bank of America Corp BAC.N said it could suffer " grave harm " if it is forced to reveal data about an estimated $ 3.6 billion of bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch & Co officials in the days before the bank acquired the brokerage .
In a petition filed late Wednesday in a New York state court in Manhattan , the bank urged Justice Bernard Fried to reject New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo ’s demand for the data , which the bank believes should be kept confidential .
Charlotte , North Carolina - based Bank of America bought Merrill on Jan. 1 , shortly after the bonuses were awarded .
Bank of America said revealing the data could help rivals poach talent , prompt employees to leave because their privacy was violated , cause “ internal dissension and consternation , ” increase security risks for bonus recipients , and give rivals a better idea of which businesses it considers most valuable .
Cuomo is investigating whether the bonuses violated securities laws .
His office subpoenaed seven Merrill executives who got tens of millions of dollars of compensation in 2008 , a person familiar with the probe said on Wednesday .
Bank of America said neither the names nor the job titles of bonus recipients are relevant to Cuomo ’s probe or the public .
“ Disclosing such highly sensitive and confidential information to the public will cause grave harm and severe competitive disadvantage ” to the bank , it said .
Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis and former Merrill Chief Executive John
Thain have testified under subpoena about the bonuses .
The names of some of Merrill ’s top earners were published Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal .
Fried has scheduled a March 13 hearing on whether the bonus data can be disclosed .
The judge is considering a separate request from a third party to broadcast the hearing .
The case is Cuomo v. Thain , New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ) , No. 400381/09 .

It ’s time for another security report .
You know , those reports that tally vulnerabilities , and then plot or graph them in such a way that their benefactors or clients come out most favourably .
Ok , that might be a bit cynical , but fact remains that there is usually something wrong with such reports .
The one that ’s making its rounds across the internet today is certainly one of them .
According to IBM , AIX is the most secure operating system , and Mac OS X the least secure .
Not only is the report rather slim on details when it comes to operating system vulnerabilities , it seems like most websites reporting on this story have misunderstood what it was about .
The table making its way onto various websites can be found on page 40 of the report .
Websites copying this table state that it lists the percentages of unpatched known vulnerabilities in each operating system ( here or here ) – but reading the accompanying text blob , I ca n’t help but think that ’s not what the table lists .
If I ’m reading it correctly , the table lists the percentages per platform of the total amount of disclosed vulnerabilities .
The text blurb :
X - Force tracks vulnerabilities by platform and has produced metrics this year
to show the operating systems with the most disclosed vulnerabilities .
The following chart shows the operating systems with the most vulnerabilities documented in 2008 .
The top ten operating systems account for nearly 75 % of all vulnerability disclosures affecting operating systems .
That seems pretty clear to me ; they are looking at the share each operating system has of the total amount of reported vulnerabilities .
Still , that does n’t mean this report has any significant meaning on this specific subject .
As has been said many times before – just counting vulnerabilities is n’t a good measure of security .
At the end of the day , what matters is not only quantity , but also quality .
Any report on security that does not take severity into account is a little hard to take seriously when it comes to making general statements about a platform ’s security record .
The report does tell that 1 % of the total amount of reported issues has the critical severity rating , but it does n’t break it down per platform .
This report by IBM sates that AIX is the most secure , but by not having any information on severity , this conclusion reeks of “ We from IBM recommend IBM … ” , greatly reducing confidence in this report .
( CNN ) -- Erik Prince , founder of the Blackwater Worldwide security firm , announced Monday he has resigned as head of the company , recently renamed Xe .
Blackwater founder Erik Prince testifies at a congressional hearing in October 2007 .
Prince , in an e-mail to employees and independent contractors , said Danielle Esposito will become chief operating officer and executive vice president .
Esposito has worked for the firm and its partners for nearly 10 years .
Blackwater / Xe 's president , Gary Jackson , is also retiring , Prince said .
The position of CEO will remain open , the company said .
Prince did not elaborate on what he planned to do next , saying only that " I will be taking on new challenges that I have not yet had the chance to tackle . "
The State Department has decided not to renew Blackwater / Xe 's contract in Iraq when it expires in May , a State Department official told CNN in late January .
That followed a refusal by the Iraqi government to renew the firm 's operating license because of a 2007 incident in which the Iraqi government says security guards -- then employed by Blackwater -- fired upon and killed 17 Iraqi civilians .
As part of a contract to protect American diplomats and other employees around the world , the State Department hired Blackwater for a multiyear assignment in Iraq , renewable annually .
Blackwater , one of three security firms working for the United States in Iraq , has one of the biggest security contracts in that country .
Officials said the State Department is talking with security firms DynCorp International and Triple Canopy , which share the Iraq contract with Blackwater , about picking up the duties handled by Blackwater .
The Iraqi government has been unclear about when Blackwater will have to cease operations , but the State Department official said , " We are working to make sure our people are protected . "
Losing the contract will be a huge blow to Blackwater , which was renamed Xe last month .
While the company is privately held , the Iraq contract has been estimated to make up one - third to one - half of its business .
Blackwater / Xe has about two dozen aircraft in Iraq , as well as 1,000 personnel .
Five former Blackwater security guards pleaded not guilty in January to charges of voluntary manslaughter and other serious crimes stemming from their involvement in the September 16 , 2007 , incident in a Baghdad square .
A sixth former security guard has pleaded guilty to charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempted manslaughter .
Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after they were attacked by armed insurgents , but an Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation .
The Iraqi government says 17 civilians were killed , although the indictment alleges 14 died .
The company does not face any charges .
But the Baghdad incident exacerbated the feelings of many Iraqis that private American security contractors have operated since 2003 with little regard for Iraqi law or life .
The indictment of the five men represents the first prosecution of non-Defense Department contractors under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act .
The act was amended in 2004 to allow the Justice Department to prosecute such personnel providing services " in support of the mission of the Department of Defense overseas . "
The current U.S. - Iraqi security agreement -- which was approved in December -- specifies that U.S. civilian contractors will no longer be immune from Iraqi prosecution for crimes committed in that country .
Iraq has required the licensing of private security companies since 2004 , but the provision was not strictly enforced .
Last year , the State Department renewed Blackwater 's contract over strong objections from the Iraqi government .
Starting January 1 , the Iraqi government has mandated that all contractors obtain Iraqi licenses to operate .

The Fourth Cycle of the " Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland "
by Michele Simionato
March 21 , 2009
Episode 18 closed part III of my Adventures .
I have not exhausted everything there is to say about functional programming .
Actually , there is much more that could be written on the subject .
However , the third cycle was conceived just as a detour from the main topic of this series , i.e. macros .
In part II I have just scratched the surface of what macros are and can do .
The next cycle of Adventures , i.e part IV , will be entirely devoted to the most sophisticated aspects of macros .
I will show typical patterns of macro programming , examples of advanced macros , as well as the issue of ( breaking ) hygiene .
[ UPDATE : after some thinking , I have changed my mind .
Part IV will describe the R6RS module system and I will come back to macros in part V .
The reason is I want to write portable macros and in order to do so a discussion of the module system is essential . ]
Part IV will not begin immediately , since I have to finish various Python - related papers first , so there will be a little pause .
The pause should give you enough time to digest part III .
I see that part III was little commented ( except for the remarks of Elizabeth Wiethoff , hi Elizabeth ! ;)
I hope I have not lost all of my readers !
I know that this is not an easy series and requires some effort .
I would like some feedback , though .
Are you still reading the series ?
Is it going well and would you rather prefer a change of direction or style ?
Notice that by design the series is not too much practically - minded , since it focuses on the features that make Scheme Scheme , and that are missing in other languages .
I could write a Practical Scheme series , explaining things like how you interact with the file system , with a database , how to use a GUI toolkit and such , but then you would not learn much about Scheme : this kind of tasks are more or less the same in any language .
I am also curious about what the background of my readers is .
The series is not really intended for Schemers ( they should know already everything ! ) but for curious programmers with experience in other languages , say dynamic languages such as Perl , Python , Ruby or functional languages such as ML , Haskell , and somewhat Scala .
I am not sure how readable the series is for people with experience only in Java or C ++.
Some feedback would be welcome !

I will keep a close watch on these forums , and when people begin to report errors from the runs on those stripes , I will promptly take them down .
The errors that people are reporting on the bgset_2 runs should stop in the next couple days as the old runs all finish trickling in .
All of the testing runs have come down ( there may be more in the future ) .
Thank you all for your continued support with this project .
Stay safe ( and sane ) in these strange times .

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANNOUNCE : Holumbus - MapReduce 0.0.1
The Holumbus framework is known for building specialized search - engines like the Hayoo !
Haskell API search .
Now , I 'd like to announce the newest libraries of the Holumbus framework : Holumbus - MapReduce 0.0.1 Holumbus - Distribution 0.0.1 Holumbus - Storage 0.0.1
As part of my Master 's Thesis at the University of Applied Sciences in Wedel , Germany , I have developed a library for building distributed MapReduce systems in Haskell .
The existing Holumbus - Searchengine library already offers a MapReduce implementation , but it does not provide mechanisms for distributed computing .
The newly developed Holumbus - MapReduce library contains of tools and modules for building individualized distributed MapReduce systems .
Holumbus - MapReduce is based on two libraries : Holumbus - Distributed and Holumbus - Storage .
Maybe they could be useful for building other distributed systems , not only a MapReduce system .
Holumbus - Distribution consists of modules and tools for the implementation of distributed systems in general .
Besides common data types and small helper functions , this library provides a mailbox - based data transfer mechanism .
It offers an easy - to - use interface for inter- and intra-process communication like in Erlang or Mozart / Oz .
Holumbus - Storage is designed to build a distributed storage system which can be linked into other programs .
It is used by the MapReduce system for the data management .
All three libraries are still under heavy development and should not be considered for creating applications in productive environments .
But I think , it 's time to give them to the community for suggestions on further development and features .

The experiments , thus far performed only in mice , appear to overcome a major drawback of vaccinations - the lag time of days , or even weeks , that it normally takes for immunity to build against a pathogen .
This new method of vaccination could potentially be used to provide instantaneous protection against diseases caused by viruses and bacteria , cancers , and even virulent toxins .
The work is being published in the Early Edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) the week of March 2 , 2009 .
The team , led by Scripps Professor Carlos Barbas , III , Ph.D. , tested the vaccination method - called covalent immunization - on mice with either melanoma or colon cancer .
The scientists injected these mice with chemicals specifically designed to trigger a programmable and " universal " immune reaction .
They developed other chemicals , " adapter " molecules , " that recognized the specific cancer cells .
Once injected into the animal , the adapter molecules self - assembled with the antibodies to create covalent antibody - adapter complexes .
" The antibodies in our vaccine are designed to circulate inertly until they receive instructions from tailor - made small molecules to become active against a specific target , " Barbas says .
" The advantage of this method is that it opens up the possibility of having antibodies primed and ready to go in the time it takes to receive an injection or swallow a pill .
This would apply whether the target is a cancer cell , flu virus , or a toxin like anthrax that soldiers or even civilian populations might have to face during a bioterrorism attack . "
Only those mice that received both the vaccine and the adapter compound generated an immediate immune attack on the cancer cells that led to significant inhibition of tumor growth .
This is the first time that such a covalent vaccine has been successfully designed and tested - typically , antibodies do not bind to chemicals in this covalent fashion .
The current breakthrough builds on work the Barbas laboratory has been engaged in for the past few years on chemically programmed monoclonal antibodies , a new class of therapeutics that the group invented .
In this type of therapy , small , cell - targeting molecules and non-targeting catalytic monoclonal antibodies self - assemble to target pathogens .
Monoclonal antibodies are produced in the laboratory from a single cloned B - cell - the immune system cell that makes antibodies - to bind to a specific substance .
Three clinical trials are now under way by Pfizer to test the therapeutic effectiveness of this new type of therapy in cancer and diabetes .
The antibodies in the antibody - adapter complex are monoclonal antibodies engineered to link themselves to adapter molecules .
The Search for the Ideal Vaccination
The practice of vaccination has been extraordinarily successful in controlling certain diseases , but there are drawbacks .
Vaccine development can be an educated guessing game - in the case of the flu , for example , scientists must study worldwide outbreak patterns to anticipate which type of flu might strike a particular area .
In addition , the most common vaccination strategies use whole proteins , viruses , or other complex immunogens - not just the specific part of the macromolecule that is recognized by the immune system - to elicit an immune response , which makes for wasted immune activity .
Then there is the body 's own kinetics - the time it takes to mount a disease - relevant immune response to immunogens limits the speed with which immunity can be achieved .
Finally , age - related declines in the ability to mount strong immune responses to biological - based vaccines present another challenge to the effectiveness of such vaccines .
Barbas 's chemical - based - rather than biological based - approach to vaccine development addresses many of these challenges .
" Our approach differs from the traditional vaccine approach in the sense that when we design an antibody - adapter compound we know exactly what that compound will react with , " Barbas says .
" The importance of this is best exemplified with HIV .
In current vaccines , many antibodies are generated against HIV , but most are not able to target the active part of the virus . "
In the near term , Barbas will apply his covalent vaccination approach to HIV , cancer , and infectious diseases for which no vaccines currently exist .
A particular focus will be creating adapter molecules specific to these diseases .
" We believe that chemistry - based vaccine approaches have been underexplored and may provide opportunities to make inroads into intractable areas of vaccinology , " Barbas says .
In addition to Barbas , co-authors of the paper , " Instant immunity through chemically programmable vaccination and covalent self - assembly , " are Mikhail Popkov ( who is first author ) , Beatriz Gonzalez , and Subhash C. Sinha , all of The Scripps Research Institute .

One of the more interesting questions about the history of science is whether certain theories are inevitable .
Given a set of data and the prevalent intellectual environment , does it become difficult to avoid formulating , say , a theory of evolution by natural selection ?
Biology would seem to argue yes .
After all , Darwin and Wallace , having been influenced by Malthus and Lyell , both spent time as naturalists in the Pacific and developed matching theories within about a decade of each other .
Similarly , several people recognized the significance of Mendel 's work within a few years of each other shortly after 1900 , and they helped develop modern genetics at the same moment .
In a commentary in Nature Physics , MIT 's Seth Lloyd considers whether this sort of fertile intellectual environment might extend across fields of study .
He considers the fact that , at the same time Mendel 's work on genes as discrete units of inheritance was being elaborated , quantum mechanics , with its emphasis on discrete energy states and behaviors , was also being developed .
Is it possible that the intellectual environment was simply ready to see things in the form of quantized entities ?
It 's a fascinating question , but after touching on it peripherally , Lloyd drops it .
Which is a shame , really , as the two theories developed in very different ways .
Quantum mechanics has been wildly successful by extending the basic principles outlined at the start of the last century .
Genetics , almost from the beginning , was successful largely because it started identifying all the ways that Mendel 's basic principles are violated — things like genetic linkage , incomplete dominance , environmental influences , etc .
Long before we gained the ability to sequence DNA , researchers had realized that genes were anything but discrete , as mutations in a single gene could produce wildly different phenotypes .
Instead , Lloyd contemplates what he terms the " digital gifts " that quantum mechanics has provided to biology .
Some of these are just an odd form of the anthropic principle : if physics did n't have the properties it does , genetics would n't look like it does .
Moving on , Lloyd argues that the information processing and randomness of quantum mechanics is echoed in gene expression and random mutation .
Conceptually , he may have a point , but these biological processes take place at a scale where quantum mechanics does n't apply .
So , a large chunk of the essay seems to either be facile or wrong .
Ultimately , he does come back to an interesting question : has natural selection produced any biological structures that take advantage of quantum properties ?
The answer seems to be yes , as there are a number of cases where the quantum mechanical properties of some parts of a biological system help influence the system 's behavior .
Unfortunately , the behavior of one of these systems is described as performing quantum computations .
Although that might be true in the formal sense , it will undoubtedly blur the issues for anyone who is trying to follow the development of useful quantum computers .
Finally , Lloyd comes to an idea that has been floated in the physics community recently .
Although there is no real reason why some of the basic physical properties of the universe have the values they do , varying them can create universes that rapidly collapse or expand into nothingness .
It 's possible that universes spawn through some sort of regular process , and the equivalent of natural selection has eventually produced one that 's stable enough for life to evolve .
It 's an interesting idea but , by this point , we 're so far from Mendelian genetics as to have lost the plot .
The commentary was published as part of a series of articles in the March issue of the journal , motivated by this year 's Darwin anniversaries .
The remaining stories are a bit less grand in their approach , and harder to find fault with as a result .
Still , it 's not so much the overreach of attempting to link quantum mechanics and genetics that causes problems for this article .
Instead , it 's the fact that Lloyd glided past topics where he could have said useful things in order to focus on analogies that are strained past the breaking point .

I Know Who [ News of the World ]
As with other forms of technology , cell and mobiles can be hit with computer viruses which will wipe your phone clean , leaving you with no way to call or access anything on your phone .
There are many different ways to protect your mobile so that this does n’t happen to you .
Here are three ways in detail on how to protect your mobile from virus attack .
The first one is an obvious choice .
Install anti - virus software for your phone .
There are many different anti-virus software programs such as Kapersky that can be downloaded onto your phone .
Image credit : Sunna.info
This is your first line of defense against viruses and worms .
Mobile is not excluded when it comes to picking up viruses and Trojans on the mobile .
In fact mobile is just as likely to pick up these viruses as a laptop or desktop computer .
Installing this software and keeping it updated will allow your phone to stay running smoothly without loss of information or loss of programs on your mobile .
Suffice it to say that a good antivirus killer is the top defense for your mobile phone to protect it from these viruses .
Another tip is to be careful where you download from .
There are many places on the internet that have hacked goods , but beware when doing this .
A lot of these types of places have worms , viruses and Trojans that can really destroy your phone .
If you are planning to download anything , do it from a respected source or one that is well known .
You may find out that the sites that charge for subscription do n’t have as many viruses as the ones that are hack sites .
Whenever you download , you need to be sure of the site that you want to download anything phone based from .
While it may be tempting to go to a hack site , doing so can cost you your phone if you are not careful .
As stated before , using a well known and clean site will allow you to download applications , ringtones and wallpapers from a verified source that is clean of any viruses .
Our next tip is to be careful when opening attachments .
This is the way that most of the viruses both on computer and mobile can be spread .
Make sure when you are opening attachments that they come from a reliable source .
This can be the difference between having your phone working and losing everything on the phone , including all applications and having your mobile hijacked .
So be careful and make sure that the source is a known one to you before opening any attachment that is sent to your phone .
If you take the time and take these steps to protect your phone , you will not risk losing information and also risking hijacking of your mobile .
These are common sense steps that when done up the protection factor on your phone and allow you to use applications , email and games safely .
This will give you peace of mind when using your mobile .

As Oakland struggled for answers Sunday in the somber aftermath of its deadliest police shooting , the family of the parolee who killed three officers and left another brain - dead , before being gunned down himself , could offer none .
Just an apology — and expressions of shock and dismay — but no answers .
Some relatives said Lovelle Mixon , convicted in a 2002 San Francisco carjacking and once a “ person of interest ” in a 2007 Oakland slaying , almost wanted to go back to prison .
But when two motorcycle officers stopped the 26 - year - old ’s Buick just after 1 p.m. Saturday near 74th Avenue and MacArthur Boulevard , he apparently was n’t ready to go .
Lovelle Mixon ’s uncle , Curtis Mixon of Fremont , remembers his last cell phone call with his nephew .
One minute they were talking about the recently purchased Buick ’s 22 - inch rims , the next Lovelle Mixon was being pulled over by a police officer .
Then , nothing .
Other relatives told how Mixon had been “ lost ” after an adult life spent mostly behind bars .
They talked about his depression .
And they talked of last month ’s missed meeting with a parole officer , leaving him a fugitive and once again on a collision course with prison .
“ He did n’t know really where to start , ” said Mixon ’s wife , Amara Langston , 25 .
“ He was trying to make himself a better person and trying to realize his mistakes and what he was doing was wrong . ”
But none of that , for a city all too familiar with spasms of violence and stories of remorse , could explain how Saturday ’s seemingly routine traffic stop in broad daylight sparked the brutality that finally played out in another tragic shootout later that afternoon .
As a tight - knit law enforcement community mourned the loss of four respected veterans , neighbors in hardscrabble East Oakland shook their heads at the senseless violence and pondered their own historically tense ties with police .
Still , from all corners of the city , there was an outpouring of support from residents and business owners — even from Attorney General Jerry Brown and a visiting Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger — with flowers and candles appearing at the shooting scenes and in front of police stations , and offers of food and money extended to the victims ’ stricken families .
“ I feel sick and sad , ” said Sharon Chipman , walking in the city ’s well - heeled Montclair district .
“ This is such a complex , painful reality that people have to come together and heal .
There is so much anger , frustration and tension , I ’m just praying the community gets stronger .
We need to reach out to each other . ”
On Sunday afternoon police spokesman Jeff Thomason said that 41 - year - old Officer John Hege of Concord was brain - dead but still on life support pending donating of his organs .
Killed Saturday were Sgt. Mark Dunakin , 40 , of Tracy , who was shot along with Hege during the traffic stop ; and Sgt. Ervin Romans , 43 , of Danville , and Sgt. Daniel Sakai , 35 , of Castro Valley , both slain at the apartment where the gunman was holed up .
An unidentified fifth officer was grazed by a bullet and released after receiving treatment .
Investigators have still not disclosed whether the officers knew who Mixon was — or whether he was a fugitive likely bound for prison .
Mixon , police say , eventually opened fire at the officers and then barricaded himself in his sisters ’ apartment around the corner , killing two more officers as they tried to arrest him nearly two hours later .
Mixon ’s 16 - year - old sister , Reynete Mixon , said she was sleeping when police kicked in the door and threw flash grenades , one of which struck her and caused minor burns on her leg .
She said she did not know her brother was in the apartment when she fled as shots rang out .
One woman , hosing down her driveway two doors down from the apartment where Mixon was killed , said some of those lives could have been saved .
She said neighbors knew immediately where Mixon had run , but they did n’t tell police — who combed the neighborhood — until nearly an hour later .
But in East Oakland , lamented the woman , Elaine , who did n’t give her last name , that cooperation does n’t easily happen .
“ It makes you feel bad , ” she said , wiping her eyes steps from blood spatters that clung stubbornly to a broken sidewalk on 74th Avenue .
“ But you just do n’t want to be a snitch .
The word , ‘ snitch , ’ it ’s almost worse than murderer . ”
The shootings weighed heavily on residents walking and worshipping Sunday in Oakland ’s Eastmont neighborhood , where trash was blowing down busy streets in front of struggling businesses and where wrought - iron fences and window bars forebodingly frame humble bungalows on treeless side streets .
It ’s a neighborhood where homicides are common enough to make residents concerned , although residents say the drug hustling and prostitution that pervaded the area has died down considerably since Oakland police opened a substation nearby 17 years ago .
On the minds of many was the New Year ’s Day shooting of Oscar Grant , a black resident , by a white BART police officer , a killing that triggered bursts of outrage in the city .
The shooting , and its subtext of racial discord , remains a sensitive subject .
Only a few feet away from where the first two officers were killed , a flier alerts the community about an upcoming meeting on the Grant shooting .
“ All we want is respect , ” said Everstine Martin , whose husband is pastor at Prayer Mission Pentecostal Church on MacArthur Boulevard , and says she has lived in the neighborhood for 40 years .
“ I see police harassing people for no reason .
Everyday , they are in this neighborhood casing the area .
Do I think this is about Oscar Grant ?
No .
But I would like to see more respect on both sides . ”
The last assault on police this deadly came in 1970 , when four California Highway Patrol officers were shot dead by two men in Southern California .
The case prompted a reappraisal of police practices , and it ’s likely Saturday ’s shootings will do the same .

Exploding pension fund shortfalls are blowing billion - dollar holes in the balance sheets of some of the Chicago area ’s biggest companies , forcing them to make huge contributions to retirement plans at a time when cash flow and credit are already under stress .
[ efoods ]
Boeing Co. ’s shareholder equity is now $ 1.2 billion in the hole thanks to an $ 8.4 - billion gap between its pension assets and the projected cost of its obligations for 2008 .
At the end of 2007 , Boeing had a $ 4.7 - billion pension surplus .
If its investments do n’t turn around , the Chicago - based aerospace giant will have to quadruple annual contributions to its plan to about $ 2 billion by 2011 .
Stock market losses also pounded pension funds at Abbott Laboratories Inc. , Caterpillar Inc. and Exelon Corp. , with others sure to emerge as companies file their annual financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission in coming weeks .

One doctor said a patient recently offered him a free shopping trip to Dubai , an offer he declined .
The issue of health care corruption gained national attention in January when a 63 - year - old man , Mihai Constantinescu , died of a heart attack in the waiting room of a hospital in Slatina , in southern Romania .
Mihaela Ionita , the nurse who wheeled him from room to room trying to get a doctor to treat him , said in an interview that she believed he had been refused care “ because he appeared poor and could not afford a bribe . ”
The hospital said Mr. Constantinescu had not seemed an emergency case .
Dr. Vasile Astarastoae , a biomedical ethicist who is president of the Romanian College of Physicians , which represents 47,000 doctors , blamed a pitifully low average monthly wage of about $ 510 for doctors for the bribe - taking .
“ Patients do n’t want to go to a doctor who is distracted thinking , ‘ How will I feed my kids or pay the rent ? ’ ” Dr. Astarastoae said .
“ So there is a conspiracy between the doctor and the patient to pay a bribe . ”
He said that unlike in many Western countries , where doctors are respected and handsomely rewarded for years of hard study , the medical profession here had been denigrated under Communist leaders who made workers in factories the country ’s heroes .
A 2005 study conducted by the World Bank for the Romanian Ministry of Health concluded that so - called informal payments amounted to $ 360 million annually .
When an illness requires hospitalization , patients typically pay bribes equivalent to three - quarters of a family ’s monthly income , the study showed .
Some doctors say that the bribery culture is so endemic that when they refuse bribes , some patients become distraught and mistakenly conclude it is a sign that their illnesses are incurable .
Doctors and patients say the bribery follows a set of unwritten rules .
The cost of bribes depends on the treatment , ranging from $ 127 for a straightforward appendix - removal operation to up to more than $ 6,370 for brain surgery .
The suggested bribery prices are passed on by word of mouth , and are publicized on blogs and Web sites .

The U.S. Army dispatched soldiers to patrol the streets of Samson , Alabama , a small southern town where a rampaging gunman killed 10 people on Tuesday .
This obvious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act prohibiting the federal uniformed services from exercising state and local law enforcement was completely ignored by the corporate media with the exception of Reuters and the London Telegraph ( see photo and video ) .
From Reuters : “ U.S. Army soldiers from Ft. Rucker patrol the downtown area of Samson , Alabama after a shooting spree March 10 , 2009 . ”
On September 30 , 2008 , the Army Times reported the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team , a component of Northern Command , would be “ on - call ” in response to “ natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks . ”
The Army Times article reported the military would be used for “ crowd and traffic control ” and be issued “ nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them . ”
According to the article , “ expectations are that another , as yet unnamed , active - duty brigade will take over and that the mission will be a permanent one .. ” ( Emphasis added . )
In early 2006 , the 109th Congress passed a bill containing controversial provisions granting the president the ability to use federal troops inside the United States in emergency situations .
These changes ( in Section 1076 ) were included in the John Warner Defense Appropriation Act for Fiscal Year 2007 .
[ efoods ]
In 2008 , Congress restored many of the earlier limitations on the president ’s ability to deploy troops within the United States , but Bush issued a signing statement indicating he was not bound by the changes .
“ The story of how Section 1076 became law vivifies how expanding government power is almost always the correct answer in Washington , ” James Bovard wrote for the American Conservative on April 23 , 2007 .
“ Some people have claimed the provision was slipped into the bill in the middle of the night .
In reality , the administration clearly signaled its intent and almost no one in the media or Congress tried to stop it . ”
The dispatch of troops to Alabama in response to a local law enforcement situation represents a further erosion of Posse Comitatus and the continued federalization of state and local law enforcement .
A Telegraph video on the shootings in Alabama propagandizes against the right to own
firearms in the United States and the Second Amendment .
Finally , the corporate media in Britain has exploited the situation in an effort to denigrate the Second Amendment and the Bill of Rights .
In a transparent propaganda piece ( see video above ) , the Telegraph states that “ mass shootings have become a feature of life in the U.S. in recent years .
Guns are widely available for purchase in a country that prides itself on the right to own weapons for self defense and hunting . ”
Britain has some of the most restrictive gun legislation in the world .
After Britain ’s government banned guns in 1997 , the rate of violent crime more than doubled .
“ A recent study of all the countries of western Europe has found that in 2001 Britain had the worst record for killings , violence and burglary , and its citizens had one of the highest risks in the industrialized world of becoming victims of crime , ” historian Joyce Lee Malcolm wrote for the fall 2004 issue of Journal on Firearms & Public Policy .

Four Cores For The Power Consumption Of Two
Intel ’s Core i7 processor family has been available for a few months now , but despite being the undisputed performance champion , it is not yet ready for the true mainstream .
Processors , and especially motherboards , are still too expensive ; and the existing models deliver their impressive performance at equivalently impressive power consumption figures .
But users looking for the best balance between performance and efficiency have an interesting new option now : Intel has released its first 45 nm Core 2 Quad processors that stay below a specified power consumption of 65 W -- the Core 2 Quad S series .
Bringing Power Consumption Down
Although processors have reduced their power consumption by more than 50 % since the good old Pentium 4 powerhouse , the addition of processing cores typically increases power consumption , at least during high load conditions .
While we believe it is absolutely acceptable to live with a certain power requirement for high performance parts , everything should be done to keep power consumption reasonable while the processor is idle or running at a low load level .
Features Versus Technology
All modern processors implement power saving features .
Cool ’n’ Quiet by AMD and SpeedStep from Intel allow the operating system to lower the clock speed and processor voltage to decrease power consumption .
In addition , processors are capable of switching into halt states , which means they may interrupt execution for very short periods of time .
Finally , some sections of modern processors can be completely shut down when they are not needed ; this has traditionally applied to caches , but is increasingly being used for processor cores as well .
Manufacturing technology keeps improving , and processor manufacturers use these advances to introduce minor improvements to their products .
Our article AMD ’s Athlon Stepping Improvements , which we published in March of 2008 , is a great example .
We took four different processors that are all named “ Athlon 64 X2 5000 + ” but are all based on different silicon steppings , and compared them .
Improvements at the silicon level can be used to accelerate processors within particular thermal envelopes , or to decrease processor power .
Intel did the latter here , introducing additional Core 2 Quad processors named the Q8200S , Q9400S , and Q9550S .
These are as fast as the regular versions , but they do n’t require up to 95 W of power .
All three models stay below the mainstream thermal envelope of 65 W , which finally makes Intel quad cores interesting for low - power systems .

PC sales are in free fall as the weak demand for Windows desktops and full - size notebooks in a poorly performing global economy is being compounded by an influx of low cost netbooks , which are gobbling up the remains of profitability in the PC industry .
According to an IDC report issued last week , worldwide PC processor unit shipments in the fourth quarter of 2008 declined â 17.0 % quarter over quarter and â 11.4 % year over year .
Those tragic numbers were buoyed somewhat by sales of mini-laptop netbooks running low powered processors .
Take out Intel 's Atom chips that power netbooks , and processor unit shipments declined by â 21.7 % over the previous September quarter and â 21.6 % over last year 's holiday quarter .
Shane Rau , IDC 's director of Semiconductors in Personal Computing research , said the " decline in PC processor unit shipments in the fourth quarter was the worst sequential decline since IDC started tracking processor shipments in 1996 .
After hinting at a decline last September , the market fell of a cliff in October and November . ''
IDC 's report stated that " the decline of the PC processor market in 4Q08 was due to a precipitous drop in end system demand that quickly moved up the PC supply chain through OEMs and contract manufacturers to the processor vendors . "
In addition to tightening consumer spending , sickly PC sales have also been blamed upon weak interest in Windows Vista , which only runs well on desktops and full powered laptops .
Most netbooks run the simpler Windows XP , and about a quarter run Linux .
Netbook erosion
That has hit Microsoft particularly hard , resulting in an 11 % drop in profits over its year ago quarter and plans to cut 5,000 jobs over the next year and a half .
On the other hand , Apple posted its best quarterly results ever , with 9 % growth in its Mac sales over the previous year .
How is Apple bucking the collapse of PC sales ?
In large measure , Apple is sidestepping the fate of other PC makers because it sells machines differentiated by Mac OS X Leopard .
While other PC makers are all diving to the bottom of the barrel to offer the cheapest Windows PCs at unsustainable prices , Apple is selling a product with unique value that is n't available elsewhere .
The company is also leveraging its strong retail presence of 251 stores worldwide , which offer training and support that can't be found at big box retailers , preventing many Mac buyers from leaving its ecosystem to find a bargain among cheap PCs .
However , another component to Apple 's healthy sales figures is its refusal to sell netbooks .
While pundits have insisted that Apple jump on the netbook bandwagon , the company has consistently insisted that it can't offer any value in the sub - $ 500 PC market .
That strategy has prevented corrosion of the Mac OS X market for desktops and full sized notebooks at the hands of low powered , ultra cheap Mac netbooks .
Apple 's Netbook alternative
Instead , Apple has focused its interests in selling the iPhone and iPod touch to fill the demand for low - end , highly mobile devices in Mac market .
The company does n't break out iPod touch sales from other iPods , but iPhone sales growth in the fourth quarter exploded by 88 % over the year ago quarter .
Apple sold 13.6 million iPhones in the last year , well above the 11.3 million netbooks sold in 2008 by all vendors combined .
Pundits say there 's no stopping netbook sales , with 21.5 million expected to be sold in 2009 .
However , analysts are also predicting incredible growth for the iPhone , with Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray estimating an installed base of roughly 60 million iPhones by the end of 2009 .
That would require sales of 44 million iPhones this year , well more than twice the number of netbooks expected to be sold worldwide .
Additionally , that does n't even include Munster 's estimate of 23.4 million iPod touch users by the end of the year .
Rather than losing money to chase a fraction of the netbook market share , Apple is creating its own market for handheld WiFi mobile devices that is not only outpacing the entire netbook market in units sold but also in profitability .
Because the iPhone and iPod touch are designed to sync with a computer rather than replace one like a netbook , Apple 's desktop and notebook sales are not being cannibalized by its mobile sales .
Of course , the fear is that PC netbooks running Windows XP or Linux will soon impact Mac notebooks , too , unless Apple scrambles to release its own netbook competitor .
While the company said it was keeping a close watch on the market for netbooks , any threat to the Mac might be well off in the future .
Around 70 % of all netbooks were sold in Europe , many subsidized by a mobile network plan .
That makes netbooks more akin to glorified smartphone , and a more direct competitor to Apple 's iPhone and iPod touch .
Macs moving upscale
Apple has migrated away from selling low end , simple Internet browsing computers over the last decade , repositioning the iMac from an appliance PC ( it was originally intended to serve as a Network Computer ) into a luxury desktop with a big screen aimed directly at higher powered tasks such as editing movies , working with high resolution RAW photography , and making music .
The company has also pushed its notebooks upscale , converting its entry level iBook line into MacBooks closer to the low end of its MacBook Pro models .
That has resulted in Apple offering no new notebook models for much less that $ 1,000 , but also taking the lion 's share ( 66 % ) of the $ 1,000 and up notebook market , where most of the profits in notebooks are to be found .
Apple has n't just been pushing its products up scale rather than into junk territory by raising its hardware prices ; it has also developed software to make use of faster systems , assembling both the iLife suite for consumers and a series of Pro Apps .
Netbooks are designed primarily to do text entry and browse the web , making them natural replacements for low end PCs the cost roughly the same and do n't offer to do much more besides take up more space .
That 's killing Microsoft 's model for advancing Windows Vista on the sheer volume of new PC sales , because netbooks are making a large chunk of the low end market for new PCs obsolete , and replacing them with a low powered device that not only can't run Vista , but can run Linux .
If netbooks continue to grow as predicted , they will cause a major erosion of the low end of PC market , forcing Microsoft to either scale down Vista to something closer to Windows XP , or to continue to develop the older XP code base .
Either way , that change will have minimal impact on Apple 's business , the majority of which is well above the floodplain threatened by the promised wave of $ 400 netbooks .
Apple 's Mac business will be no more at risk than Microsoft 's higher - end gamer PC users .
However , if netbooks can manage to replace over 20 million low end PCs this year it will have a significant impact on the standing of Windows Vista and its successor due later this year as an increasingly large chunk of the 300 million PCs sold annually wo n't need a full desktop operating system .
Meanwhile , Apple is targeting the release of Snow Leopard as being fully 64 - bit .
In the last nine quarters since Apple transitioned its lowest end MacBooks and iMacs to 64 - bit Core 2 Duo CPUs , the company has sold 19 million Macs .
Apple 's installed base of Macs running Mac OS X is approaching 30 million .
That means that at around two thirds , or 66 % , of the entire Mac installed base is 64 - bit .
Tennessee ’s Stacey Campfield , the third - term state rep who tried to ban public school teachers from talking about sexuality in any manner with his “ Do n’t Say Gay ” bill , has never submitted a bill that became law .
Ever .
And it looks like he racked up another point : “ Do n’t Say Gay ” wo n’t be addressed this term .
Meanwhile , we just found Rep. Campfield ’s blog !
He posts jokes sometimes !
Here are two ( slightly amusing ) nuggets :
Paddy was driving down the street in a sweat because he had an important meeting and could n’t find a parking place .
Looking up to heaven he said , ‘ Lord take pity on me .
If you find me a parking place I will go to Mass every Sunday for the rest of me life and give up me Irish Whiskey ! ’
Miraculously , a parking place appeared .
Paddy looked up again and said , ‘ Never mind , I found one . ’
In May 2007 , the websites of a number of prominent Estonian politicians were attacked and crippled for several weeks .
The attacks came at a time when Estonian / Russian relations were already chilly , thanks in part to the Estonian government 's plan to move a Russian war memorial statue from the city center and into a cemetery .
Ars has covered the issue since the attacks began , including the arrest of an Estonian student last year in connection with the prolonged DDoS siege .
The arrest of 20 - year - old Dmitri Galushkevich in January , 2008 raised doubts as to whether he was solely responsible for weeks of disruptions .
On Wednesday , January 11 , the doubters were victorious ; comments from Konstantin Goloskokov , a commissar with the Russian youth movement Nashe , has admitted that the group organized and masterminded the Estonian barrage .
The Baltic Business News quotes Goloskokov defending the group 's actions as necessary in order to defend Russian interests .
" I would n't have called it a cyber attack ; it was cyber defense , " Goloskokov said .
" We taught the Estonian regime the lesson that if they act illegally , we will respond in an adequate way . "
Note that the commissar does not characterize his own group 's actions as illegal — on the contrary , it was actually Estonia 's fault that it could n't handle the impact of the DDoS assault .
" We just visited the various Internet sites , over and over , and they stopped working ...
We did n't block them : they were blocked by themselves because of their own technical limitations in handling the traffic they encountered . "
Goloskokov has something of a technical point , since the attacks that brought the Estonian government 's servers down consumed relatively low bandwidth , but a DDoS attack is defined by its characteristics and success , not a certain arbitrary bandwidth floor .
Nashe ( also spelled Nashi ) translates into " Youth Democratic Anti-Fascist Movement " Ours ! " ) and has been compared by some to the Communist - era youth party branch known as Komsomol .
Nashi is much smaller than this predecessor organization ; Wikipedia estimates its membership at some 120,000 members aged 17 - 25 in 2007 .
Goloskokov 's admission of guilt was accompanied by further denials that the Russian government had anything to do with the Estonian attacks .
We 've discussed " hacktivism " before at Ars , but the fact that the attack was coordinated by a government - sponsored youth organization suggests that the government was aware of what was happening , at least at some level .
With the perpetrators unmasked , the more important question is whether or not Russian authorities will actually take any actions to censure Nashi or Goloskokov himself .
It would also behoove the Estonian government to release additional information on the case against Dmitri Galushkevich .
Was he actually working with Nashi in attempting to bring down the Estonian sites , or was he an independent protestor who got wind of what was happening abroad and decided to launch a little home - grown protest of his own ?

Conspiracy Theories .
Shadow Powers .
Problem / Reaction / Solution .
Are we missing the BIG picture by focusing on “ how they did it ’?
25 + years ago JFK was boldly and callously assassinated .
The Warren Commission Report , authored by Hitler ’s personal historian , began the cover - up in earnest .
This was aided by Gerald Ford ’s intentional lie regarding the point of entry of the bullet .
[ See Prez Ford Admitted Doctoring Warren Rpt . ]
[ More JFK murder trivia . ]
Just like the “ official ” 9/11 Report , also written by an officially unattributed author .
It too began the cover - up in earnest .
And , in years yet to be seen , the Engineered Global Economic Collapse occurring now will be dissected and explained for the masses .
But maybe the real message is the one a former “ magic bullet ” debunker eventually uncovered .
Philadelphia lawyer Vincent Salandria was one of the earliest and best critics of the Warren Commission .
Immediately after its Report was issued , he wrote a highly detailed critique for The Legal Intelligencer analyzing how the trajectories and ballistics were all wrong .
In 1975 , as Gaeton Fonzi was preparing for work as a government investigator on the staff of the House Select Committee on Assassinations , he visited Salandria , whom he found dejected about the fruits of a dozen years of research .
Fonzi quotes Salandria in his important book , The Last Investigation :
“ I ’m afraid we were misled .
All the critics , myself included , were misled very early .
I see that now .
“ We spent too much time and effort microanalyzing the details of the assassination when all the time it was obvious , it was blatantly obvious that it was a conspiracy .
“ Do n’t you think the men who killed Kennedy had the means to do it in the most sophisticated and subtle way ?
They chose not to .
“ Instead , they picked the shooting gallery that was Dealey Plaza and did it in the most barbarous and openly arrogant manner .
The cover story was transparent and designed not to hold , to fall apart at the slightest scrutiny .
“ The forces that killed Kennedy wanted the message clear :
“ We are in control and no one– not the
President , nor Congress , nor any elected
official — no one can do anything about it . ”
“ It was a message to the people that their government was powerless .
And the people eventually got the message …
“ The tyranny of power is here .
Current events tell us that those who killed Kennedy can only perpetuate their power by promoting social upheaval both at home and abroad .
And that will lead not to revolution but repression .
“ I suggest to you that the interests of those who killed Kennedy now transcend national boundaries and national priorities .
“ No doubt we are dealing now with an international conspiracy .
We must face that fact – and not waste any more time microanalyzing the evidence .
That ’s exactly what they want us to do .
“ They have kept us busy for so long .
And I will bet that is what will happen to you .
They ’ll keep you very , very busy and , eventually , they ’ll wear you down . ”

Video : Fed up Feder packs his false stats and goes home
by Jeremy Hooper
Don Feder is , quite frankly , a far - right propagandist whose work is fringe even among " pro-family " circles .
Back in July of 2006 , while Don was blaming conflict in Israel on God 's anger over a gay pride parade , he " jokingly " suggested that the gays should move their parade to Gaza , an area that was embroiled in widespread , daily - reported violence .
Then there was June of 2008 , when Don called gays " a sorry collection of individuals ( connected only by their carnal appetites ) caught up in a perverted lifestyle , " directly compared marriage - seeking gay couples to the North American Man / Boy Love Association , and rolled out that tired " pro-family " nugget about gay marriage leading to man / poultry unions .
And that 's just two of many , many examples culled from a five minute perusal of our archives .
Yet despite ( because of ? ) his obvious extremism , Mr. Feder was recently invited by the UMass College Republicans to speak on the topic of inclusive hate crimes legislation .
But as you will see in these video clips , the reception was less than warm .
And you will also see that Mr. Feder is much better at dishing it in a private setting than he is at taking it in public :
Free speech goes both ways .
Would we have acted the same way if we were in that crowd ?
No .
But harsh rhetoric like Mr. Feder 's can understandably elicit emotional responses , especially when dealing with a problem as serious as bias crimes .
And when people , born out of their own organic passions and beliefs , show up to express their own right to assemble , speak , and demonstrate , the speech itself can stir unimaginably intense reactions .
That 's what we would seem to have here : Passionate people who are seeing a man paid and presented as an " expert " to convey flawed , biased facts that keep LGBT people more vulnerable .
Unable to let the Federic rhetoric go on unfettered , they put those passions to voice .
We get it , even if we see better , more tasteful ways that it could have been handled ( e.g. protest silently , waiting until the Q & A session for the opportunity to state your positions clearly and staunchly ) .
The breakdown of the crowd , with large representation from the opposition , is itself an expression .
It is an expression that the militant anti-gay agenda will not be allowed to hurt people in an unchecked fashion .
It is a reminder that while everyone has a right to speak without government intervention , everyone also has a right to organize in resistance to hurtful , hateful views .
It 's a statement from the students regarding the kind of bashings that they will unabashedly reject .
That 's one thing that is often overlooked with situations like this :
The fact that the speech brought out such opposition in the first place .
You have to consider the inflammatory body of work that inspired these students to show up , not just the incident at hand .
Of course it 's frustrating for Mr. Feder and the Republicans who wanted to hear this speech to have these demonstrators on - site .
But you know what else is frustrating ?
TO BE CALLED 'A SORRY COLLECTION OF INDIVIDUALS ' WHO ARE NON - DESERVING OF BEING PROTECTED FROM REAL , DEMONSTRABLE HATE CRIMES !
And if he is going to go around spouting such things about human beings who are sick and tired of being hurt , then Mr. Feder is going to have to deal with strong ( and growing ) push back .
Minority groups eventually get tired of being harassed , waiting for the day when the population at - large will reject condemnations of their lives in the same way they reject bias against other population sects .
If he truly believes in the righteousness of his cause and his power to seize public opinion , then nobody should have the power to shut him down .
We know that as long as there is breath when us , no crowd , big or small , will ever be free to do the same to us .
** ALSO : It should also be noted that in his introduction , Feder completely provoked the crowd :
Your thoughts
This speach is even more vile with the spike in hate crimes since the passage of prop8 .
Posted by : RainbowPhoenix | Mar 17 , 2009 4:30:23 PM
Ironic he can't take a little heckling , yet thinks it 's okay for gays to be harassed day after day .
Posted by : Bill Ware | Mar 17 , 2009 7:03:31 PM
I think he should have been given a chance to speak , with silent forms of protest ( signs , sitting with backs turned like they did ) , and then torn a new one during Q&A .
But it 's easy for me to say that sitting here , privileged all ways but one , maybe having forgotten what it 's like to be student in that situation .
I 'm sure it 's much different being a queer person of color listening to some old white ideological fossil telling you that hate crimes are n't a problem .
Posted by : zortnac | Mar 17 , 2009 7:14:42 PM
What bugs me is how often they say that they have a right to express their OPINION .
OK , express your OPINION , but DO NOT express lies and suggest that they are fact .
You do not have the right to repeatedly lie and go unchallenged .
Tell me I 'm a sinner and going to hell , but do not tell me that all I want to do all day long is have sex with animals and recruit children as I sit here working on yet more paperwork for my husband and I to adopt our own child !
Posted by : nashtrav | Mar 17 , 2009 8:04:01 PM
Agreed , zortnac .
In a perfectly scripted world , most of us would want it to play out differently .
But life is not a directed movie .
This man , via his life 's work , has invited gay ire , and in this case , that ire manifested into this particular scenario .
It 's hard for me to come down too hard on it , even if I wish things had gone more smoothly .
Plus , as mentioned , Feder was provoking the audience .

Everyone in this country has the right to speak freely without any governmental intervention .
That does n't mean that they have the right to be heard , or that their freedom of speech is any more valuable than the heckler 's freedom is .
In a public forum , especially one where a large percentage of the audience disagrees with the incendiary rhetoric of the speaker , it is pretty doubtful that they will be quiet .
Verbal , non-violent civil disobedience that is a direct response to an inflammatory speech , is in every way free speech .
Does Feder have the right to speak , surely .
Do the hecklers have the right to boo him off the stage , absolutely .
That heckler 's veto is exactly the free speech that our founding fathers fought , and died for - just as much as for Feder 's free speech rights .
And , Bill Ware , you make a very good point .
In his case , the little bit of verbal harassment that he endured was specifically in response to his purposeful rhetoric .
His actions elicited the response that he got , and he invited that ridicule .
And even knowing that , he could n't withstand even the barest minimum of harassment .
And at exactly the same time , he was up on that stage suggesting that the unprovoked , unsolicited verbal and physical harassment and abuse that LGBTs suffer everyday is unimportant .
The words hypocrisy and duplicity were never more appropriate .

Forget all the rhetoric and the massaged data ( No , not everyone has a 0.0013 % chance of being the victim of a hate crime .
Mr. Feder 's chances as a white , straight , umpteenth generation American are lower , while a lesbian Hispanic immigrant 's is much higher ) .
Mr. Feder made the cardinal sin of speech - giving :
He wrote a really bad speech .
It 's dry , it 's got too many numbers packed together too tightly , it 's impersonal .
And to top it all off he pounds his fist on the podium .
HUGE NO -NO !
Feder gets paid for this ?!?

Interrupting him speaking is not helpful to our side .
I understand people being mad but protest outside .
Your stance will still be known .
This makes our side look intolrant and only gives fuel to our enemies who already fear that we will silence them .
Protesting like this makes the people protesting feel better but its about as helpful as comments RAndy Thommason makes to the anti-gay side .
We 've got to stop tactics like this if we 're going to win hearts and minds .
Posted by : Pomo | Mar 19 , 2009 3:11:33 PM
There have already been well - articulated reasons why protests like this can understandably come to be , so I wo n't address them again .
But I do want to address two points .
( 1 ) The idea that they should only protest outside .
I find that completely unfair .
The opposition has just as much right to turn out as the supporters .
And as I stated in the post :
The fact that they opposition did turn out in such large numbers is itself a form of expression .
So regardless of how we might feel about the way it played out inside , I do n't think it 's right to say that they should have just waited outside while blatant and dangerous lies were passed off as fact inside the walls .
( 2 ) I reject the common " this makes us no better than [ insert name ] " comparisons that often arise in discussions like this .
I get it , in practical terms .
But I think those lines of thinking often overlook the simple fact that there is a premium placed on certain ideas .
And in the fight of gay acceptance vs. bigotry , the former innately holds more value .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Mar 19 , 2009 3:34:48 PM
Youre right G - A- Y , so lets just keep on doing things the way we 've done them .
Its working well so far .
We 're changing lots of minds by our refusal to let the other side have their meetings .
Had a group of Christians done this to one of our meetings people would be crying " bigotry ! " " hatred ! " " homophobia ! "
But we do it and its ok because it " innately holds more value . "
I 'm not saying out position is n't justified for I certainly believe equality is right and spreading lies is wrong .
But I used to be one of those people .
I know how they think .
And I know these types of tactics are looked down upon and only add fuel to their disgust of what we stand for .
It does n't help our cause , it hurts our cause .
Thats the point .
The only people who felt good about themselves after that was the protestors .
It did not bring us one step closer to equality .
And thats what i want .
Posted by : Pomo | Mar 19 , 2009 5:23:22 PM
Pomo : I find your comment to an unfair reduction of what I have said , both in my comment and the post itself .
So that being the case , I 'm gonna respectfully move on and not engage you any further on this one .
Posted by : G - A - Y | Mar 19 , 2009 5:29:46 PM
I think its just that I have a good point you can't answer but thats your right seeing as how this is your blog :)
And i'm not gonna stand up and scream and interrupt you until you adress what i've said .
That would n't further OUR cause ...
And we are on the same team !
I just want us to be willing to change our tactics to something thats actually going to help us with the other side .
Posted by : Pomo | Mar 19 , 2009 6:40:00 PM
Feel free to think that , Pomo .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Imagine the Batmobile busting bad guys in Bismarck , North Dakota , or " Knight Rider 's " KITT corralling criminals on the Pennsylvania Turnpike .
Carbon Motors Corp.'s E7 concept vehicle was on display recently near the U.S. Capitol .
Carbon Motors Corp .'s new high - tech cop car prototype might not be quite up to superhero specs , but some police say it could be a welcome addition to their arsenal .
" I do n't see any downside to this car , " said Carl Latorre , a Pennsylvania State Police dispatcher who served 35 years as a Philadelphia police officer .
" I am so excited about this car .
This car rates up there with cops carrying automatic weapons to combat what the criminals carry now .
It 's about time that something like this came about . "
OK , so it does n't have a nanotech cloaking capability or rocket boosters , but every feature on the Carbon E7 concept vehicle draws on suggestions from more than 3,000 law enforcement professionals .
The result is a futuristic prowler with a 300 - horsepower clean diesel engine , flashing lights visible from all angles , an ergonomic cockpit , an onboard computer with voice command and instant license plate recognition , integrated shotgun mounts , and more .
( Weapons of mass destruction detectors are available as an option -- seriously . )
See how the E7 stacks up against KITT and the Dark Knight 's Tumbler »
The E7 was designed by cops for cops , breaking the tradition of recruiting family sedans into the force , company co-founder Stacy Dean Stephens said .
" The current vehicles that they ( police departments ) use were designed for driving around , going to the grocery store , taking kids to school -- things like that , " Stephens said .
" You do n't have an engineer sitting at one of the other automakers who says , ' Y ' know , I think what we need to do is we need to take this car , and we need to run into a curb at 50 miles an hour and see how many times it takes before the wheels and the suspension fails on it . "
The rear passenger compartment alone is enough to make experienced cops get teary - eyed .
The rear - hinged " suicide doors " make it easier for handcuffed passengers to get in and out , and the seat is designed so " guests " can ride comfortably with their hands cuffed behind their backs .
For officer safety , Latorre likes how the seat belts are anchored in the center of the seat and buckle near the door so the officer does n't have to lean across the prisoner .
" When you put a prisoner in the back seat , you 're supposed to strap him in , " Latorre said .
" Nowadays , you have to make sure your gun is n't going close to his hands , and how are you going to strap somebody in doing that ? "
Perhaps most popular among cops is the rear compartment , which is sealed off from the front and made entirely of seamless , washable plastic , with drain plugs in the floor .
" Numerous times I 've had less than pleasant experience " with prisoners vomiting or relieving themselves in the back seat , said Stephens , a former Texas police officer .
The seat innovations are up front , too , where the seats have recesses to accommodate officers ' bulky gun belts .
" The front seat -- I could n't believe the front seat .
They thought of everything , " Latorre said .
" You do n't know how difficult it is to get out of a car .
The first thing you 've got to do is adjust your gun belt .
The gun belt should n't be a problem . "
The E7 can go 0 to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds , has a top speed of 155 mph and can withstand a 75 - mph rear impact , according to the company 's Web site .
It has bullet - resistant panels in the doors and dash and has push bumpers incorporated into the aluminum frame .
The upper flashing lights are integrated into the roof panel , eliminating the need for a bolted - on light bar that causes aerodynamic drag -- reducing fuel economy -- and can lead to rust .
Watch police check out the car and hear the engine growl »
Despite the technological " wow " factor and officer enthusiasm , the E7 could prove to be a tough sell .
" The people are very intelligent and smart that are setting this up , " said Lt. Michael Arnold , fleet manager of the Bismarck , North Dakota , police department .
" What scares me is they do n't give you a price . "
Company officials say the price -- possibly around $ 50,000 per unit -- will be " competitive " considering the cost of equipping a conventional car for police work and how long each vehicle lasts .
The Carbon E7 will be built to last 250,000 miles , compared with 75,000 to 120,000 miles for the typical patrol car , Stephens said .
" When it 's all said and done it 's a matter of how much it costs per mile , " said Bismarck Deputy Chief Fred Wooten .
Regardless of how good it looks on paper , a state or big-city agency wo n't be willing to take a chance on a vehicle with no track record , said Detective Mary Wheat , spokesperson for the Portland , Oregon , police department .
" If they do cost $ 50,000 , nobody 's going to buy them , " Wheat said .
" Nobody 's going to buy them .
No , police agencies can't afford $ 50,000 cars .
We have huge fleets of cars .
We have hundreds of them ; hundreds and hundreds of cars .
And we turn them over .
I mean , we ride them hard .
Those cars are used on a 24 - hour basis .
That would n't work . "
But municipalities do n't balk at paying large sums for other purpose - built vehicles such as firetrucks and ambulances , countered Latorre , the Pennsylvania officer .
" They do n't say , ' Oh , here 's a box truck ; go fight fires with it ' or ' Here 's an E - 250 cargo van ; go pick up patients with it , ' do they ? , " he said .
" So I do n't see why the municipality would n't say , ' You know what ?
This [ police car ] is nothing but a plus for us . ' "
The company , based in Atlanta , Georgia , does n't yet have a factory , but has named five states where it could locate : Georgia , Indiana , Michigan , North Carolina and South Carolina .
Production is scheduled to begin in 2012 , Stephens said .
Carbon does n't expect to take over the market quickly , instead counting on a few " early adopters " willing to take a risk on a few vehicles and work out the kinks to everyone else 's satisfaction , Stephens said .
Hundreds of agencies already have made online reservations for thousands of Carbon Motors vehicles , putting the company " very well on our way to selling out our first year , " he said .
Wheat praised the Carbon team 's entrepreneurship and suggested the company market its car first in smaller towns with less red tape and simpler bidding processes .
That works for Wooten , the deputy chief in Bismarck .
" We 'll be more than happy to field test one , " he offered .
" If it works as advertised , we 'll probably have a fleet of them someday . "

Last week I had a discussion about the legalization of drugs with a friend , who remained convinced that the legalization of drugs would cause an instant and damaging spike in the incidence of use / abuse despite what ’s generally accepted as a relatively inelastic demand curve ( and despite centuries of evidence to the contrary with alcohol ) and that this spike in use / abuse would lead to an increase in violent crimes .
Strangely enough he that Big Leaguers should be allowed to Roid Rage whenever they want , but that ordinary people should n’t be able to do lines of coke in their own living rooms without the fear that some Stasi Jackboot might kick down their doors , kill their Labrador retrievers , and haul them off to prison .
There are countless flaws I could expose in the abbreviated summary of his arguments ( above ) , but I ’d like to take a more substantive approach :
People who overestimate the malevolence of human nature are quick to conclude that , upon legalizing marijuana and cocaine , for example , all of these drug dealers would quickly find another lucrative , criminal enterprise in which to engage .
I reject this hypothesis for ( at least ) two reasons which come immediately to mind , but first let ’s put the picture in perspective .
In Holland , the cannabis trade alone is valued at $ 3 Billion [ 1 ] .
It is so profitable only because competition is artificially hindered .
.
It is so profitable only because competition is artificially hindered .
Globally , the illicit drug trade is something like $ 1 Trillion per year .
Even the production of opiates in U.S. military occupied and embattled Afghanistan has been increasing ! [ 2 ] .
. The U.S. alone spends over $ 20 Billion per year on the “ drug war ” , about one - third of which is used to incarcerate 250,000 + non-violent offenders , at an average cost of about $ 70/day [ 3 ] .
If that sounds expensive , do n’t stop there .
The true cost of the drug war is far greater .
The explicit cost of incarceration is $ 70 / inmate / day .
The true cost would correctly include whatever productivity would n’t have been sucked out of the economy by the 1 in 3 state employees currently working in a correctional capacity .
I ’ve previously estimated that the true cost of incarceration is not the $ 28,000 widely reported , but rather that the true economic cost is closer to $ 100,000 per inmate , per year [ 4 ] .
That works out to be $ 25 Billion annually , or about the size of the GM Bailout , in the U.S. economy alone !
The profits accruing in the illicit drug trade are kept artificially high by prohibition .
Any restriction in supply ( partial or complete prohibition , etc. ) only serves to cement the profitability of foreign cartels and warlords .
If the cartels are n’t making money , then neither are the footsoldiers and corner dealers .
Take away the monopoly profits , or eliminate the institution which encourages monopoly profits , and few people will want to waste their time on these endeavors .
Although some people would have you believe that your average , run -of - the - mill drug dealer is truly a “ bad ” person , the fact of the matter is that for most of them , they believe ( rightly or wrongly ) that selling controlled substances is the most lucrative opportunity afforded to them , even given the extreme risks involved [ 5 ] .
In a report funded by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute , researchers concluded that “ drug sales in poor neighborhoods are part of a growing informal economy which has expanded and innovatively organized in response to the loss of good jobs . ”
The report characterizes drug dealing as “ fundamentally a lower class response [ to the information economy ] by men and women with little formal education and few formal skills , ” and the report notes “ If the jobs wo n’t be created by either the public or private sector , then poor people will have to create the jobs themselves . ”
At least one factor contributing to all crime ( not just pseudo - crimes like drug - dealing ) is lack of employment opportunities .
Unable to earn a licit living , they will find another way to put food on the table .
Some of them work off the books fixing cars , painting houses , etc .
Others sell dope .
The availability of alternative means of earning incomes is artificially reduced .
There is a chapter in Freakonomics that examines drug gangs [ 6 ] .
If I recall accurately , the authors find that the average drug dealer only earns something like $ 3 an hour , so , much less than minimum wage across the country which make it illegal for a gas station owner to hire someone for $ 4 an hour .
There are so many other restrictions on who can be hired , how they must be employed , what they must be paid , what actions people are “ permitted ” or “ licensed ” by the state to perform , and the costs of these restrictions are borne disproportionately by the poor and the unskilled ( who often happen to be poor ) .
Inner cities everywhere are blights : vacant houses and buildings that man is forbidden to occupy , state - housing projects in gross disrepair , open fields that no man may farm .
Unable to find employment , some of these people will eventually decide to take the other $ 4 / hour job , where they face a one - in - four chance of being killed over a few rocks of crack .
Almost all violent crime can be traced back to the drugs , not because of some inherent quality in the drug itself , and not because of some malevolent human element , rather because the monopoly profits earned by cartels in the drug trade are sufficient to compensate for the costs of war , and the illusion of these profits is sufficient to entice those willing to do the dirty work .
In reality , if we eliminate all of the pseudo - crimes like smoking pot or selling cocaine , pretty much all that ’s left are actual crimes , against person and / or property , crimes against which it is infinitely easier to protect oneself .
CanSecWest Internet browser security took a beating during Day 1 of an annual hacking competition , with Apple 's Safari , Microsoft 's Internet Explorer and Mozilla 's Firefox all being felled in a matter of hours .
The uncontested champion of the contest was a University of Oldenburg , master 's candidate , who managed to fell Safari , IE 8 and Firefox at the Pwn2 Own contest at the CanSecWest security conference in Vancouver , British Columbia .
He joined security researcher Charlie Miller , who was able to successfully hack Safari with a separate remote - execution exploit .
" It 's not as easy as a few years ago , " said Nils , the University of Oldenburg student , referring to the difficulty of piercing the many built - in protections of Safari , IE and Firefox .
" Still , browsers have a lot of problems .
It 's really a lot of codes that are exposed to the internet . "
The computer science student declined to give his last name .
The Pwn2 Own contest has thrived at proving to the world that with the proper financial incentive , virtually any internet - facing software can be proven vulnerable to real - world exploits .
Amid the awe that took hold as four exploits materialized before spectators ' very eyes was this sad realization :
Despite the formidable resources of the world 's biggest software organizations , browser users remain susceptible to drive - by attacks that can install keylogging software , rootkits and other software parasites with little or no warning .
Perhaps more remarkable than watching hackers in one room make mince meat of three of the world 's most popular browsers was the realization that they were willing to do so for well under the going rate .
According to some researchers , a reliably exploitable IE vulnerability now fetches $ 100,000 on the black market .
Yet Nils was willing to accept just $ 5,000 and a new Sony Vaio for his attack .
The contest is sponsored by security firm TippingPoint , which for several years now has paid a bounty to researchers for exploits that target commonly used programs .
" If this competition had n't existed , I never would have found this bug , " said Miller , who is principal analyst at Independent Security Evaluators , referring to the Safari flaw he exploited this year .
He exploited a separate vulnerability last year that allowed him to pwn a brand new Mac Book Air running a fully patched version of Leopard .
The challenge was enough to motivate him to dust off a separate Safari bug he had been sitting on for more than 12 months for this year 's competition .
" If it was n't for the competition , there 'd still be these two bugs from this year and last year , " he added .
" Apple gets free bugs , I get money and people 's computers get fixed . " ®
Free Trade is Common
Tweet
Persons who , fancying themselves observant realists , insist that " free trade does n't exist " have their visions and brains distorted by political boundaries .
It is quite true that national governments almost universally erect barriers that hinder their citizens ' freedom to trade with citizens ruled by other national governments .
Some governments erect higher barriers than do other governments .
But , indeed , it 's rare to find a national government that does n't indulge the greed of politically powerful interest groups , as well as the prejudice and economic ignorance of much of its population , with trade barriers .
And yet free trade is ubiquitous .
Freedom to trade generally reigns within political borders .
For example , the 50 U.S. states are united on one very large and very successful free - trade zone .
Karol , Thomas , and I live in Burke , Virginia .
We are free to trade not only with cabbage growers in Culpeper , Virginia , but with cabbage growers in California .
We trade freely with residents of any state , from the Atlantic to the Pacific , from the U.S. border with Canada to the U.S. border with Mexico .
That is , whatever taxes and burdens Uncle Sam might impose ( however wisely or foolishly ) on economic activity within the U.S. , those burdens are nation - wide .
No special space - specific burdens are placed on my and my family 's ability to trade with other Americans ; no extra tariff or restriction applies to our exchanges with an Alaskan or with a Floridian simply because we do not live in those states .
Practically speaking , therefore , there is free trade throughout the United States .
My family and I routinely buy wine from California and Oregon , oranges and lemons from Florida , computer software from Washington state , maple syrup from Vermont , peaches from South Carolina , television newscasts from New York and Atlanta , lumber from Alabama , spicy sauces from Louisiana , crabs from Maryland .
The list is long .
And yet no one , not even Lou Dobbs , insists that the Boudreaux family would be richer if only the government in Richmond could fine a successful way around the U.S. Constitution and managed to slap stiff tariffs on California wine , Florida citrus fruits , cajun seasoning from Louisiana , and you name it .
Surely the burden of persuasion is on those who would insist that each American would be more prosperous if only his or her state were better able to restrict trade with citizens of other states .
If this burden of persuasion cannot be met , then the case for free international trade is pretty solidly established .
Anyone skeptical of free trade must explain why political borders are economically relevant .
With the exception of pointing to ( mostly rather vague and poorly considered ) national - defense issues , protectionists have never managed — and I dare say never will manage — to impart genuine economic relevance to political borders .
Because all reasonably prosperous countries today impose no , or only very few , internal restrictions on trade , two facts stand : ( 1 ) free trade is in fact quite common , and ( 2 ) free trade is beneficial .
Comments
A visit to Western Europe in early March provided some slightly different — if unsettling — insights into global economic arrangements and their socio-cultural co-ordinates .
As the crisis unfolds , people everywhere are questioning current economic institutions and processes , and naturally enough their fears , insecurities and concerns also affect their visions for the future .
The fundamental issues relate to income and resource distribution ( do n’t they always ? ) but in this time of global crisis , the expression of these issues can become sharper and even more openly divisive in spirit .
Two features of some current public responses in these societies are especially relevant in this context .
The first is the barely concealed animosity towards China and India ( inevitably clubbed together , despite all the huge differences ) as perceived beneficiaries of globalisation and voracious consumers of global resources .
The second is the general inability to conceive of a way out of the current global economic crisis in any way other than simply replicating the past , even though those past trends clearly cannot be sustained .
European attitudes towards Asia have long been characterised by varying combinations of fear and fascination , respect and revulsion , competition and colonialism — as studies of Orientalism have made only too evident .
But the current public perceptions are somewhat different : fed by sensationalising media that cannot waste time or space on complexities , they move in pendulum swings from seeing populous Asia as the breeding ground for poverty and terrorism to believing that aggressive exporting based on underpriced labour is causing more than two billion people to lead “ middle class lives ” that draw unsustainably on the world ’s resources .
Of course , sheer ignorance explains a lot .
Among the general public in Europe , and even in the more informed sections , there is almost no realisation of how globalisation has adversely affected livelihoods and employment of the majority of the population in the developing world including in fast - growing Asian countries .
The agrarian crisis is largely seen to be history , supposedly vanquished by the rising prices of agricultural goods in world trade between 2002 and mid 2008 , even though farmers ’ incomes continue to stagnate and cultivation is still barely viable in large parts of the developing world .
Because of the volumes of manufacturing exports from Asia , there is still widespread perception of shift of manufacturing jobs from North to South — even though manufacturing employment has declined in the developing world as a whole , has barely increased in most countries of Asia and has actually declined since 1997 in what is generally accepted to be the workshop of the world , China .
A member of the audience at a public debate in London asked whether China and India , newly enriched by exploiting the globalization process , would therefore use the current crisis as opportunity to ride through the global economic tsunami that threatens to engulf everyone else and emerge stronger than the US and Europe .
A distinguished - looking and apparently eminent elderly gentleman at a large conference in Berlin was even sharper : “ China and India ” , he claimed , “ benefited from the Asian economic crisis in 1997 - 98 at the cost of their neighbours , and now they will benefit from the global crisis ” .
Another participant from the floor expressed it slightly differently : “ These countries are not poor , they are full of billionaires and have four out of ten of the world ’s richest people , and yet they come blaming us for the crisis and demanding assistance from us ” .
These are obviously not politically correct positions , nor are they necessarily even the majority view , since they were opposed by other participants in each of these events .
Yet the sheer honesty of their expression is useful , since it provides some idea of what must be a widespread underlying perception .
And the concerns do not relate only to potential shifts in geopolitical or economic power .
Even among more progressive people in Europe , there is a palpable fear ( sometimes unspoken and sometimes expressed only in subtle and qualified arguments ) that growing consumption of such a large part of the world ’s population will put an unbearable strain on global resources and therefore cannot really be supported .
There is certainly some degree of truth in this — there is no question that current “ Northern ” standards of life cannot be sustained if they were made accessible to everyone on this planet .
This means that future economic growth in the developing world has to involve more equitable and sensible patterns of consumption and production .
But that hardly deals with the basic problem .
Even if the elite and middle class of the developing world , and particularly China and India , just stopped increasing their consumption , simply bringing the vast majority of the developing world ’s population to anything resembling a minimally acceptable standard of living will involve extensive use of global resources .
It will necessarily imply more natural resource use and more carbon emissions .
So the stark reality is that the developed world must , on the whole , consume less of the world ’s resources and reduce its contribution to global warming absolutely .
This in turn has effects on income as well .
It is not immediately clear why rich countries with falling populations necessarily need to increase their GDP , and why they should not focus instead on internal redistribution and changing lifestyles , which could in fact improve the quality of life of every citizen .
The current crisis is an excellent — even unique — opportunity to bring about such shifts in socially created aspirations and material wants , and to reorganise economic life in the developed world to be less rapacious and more sustainable .
But sadly , this message is not being heard at least among the major policy makers in the core capitalist countries .
In the United States , even the relatively environment - friendly Obama administration simply talks about promoting “ cleaner , greener technologies ” rather than altering absurd and wasteful consumption patterns .
For example , it is still basing its transport strategy on excessive reliance on private automobile use rather than more extensive and efficient public transport .
In Europe , too , the focus is on reviving and increasing the old ( outdated ? ) patterns of consumption .
Silvio Berlusconi in Italy has just pleaded with his people not to change their lifestyles because of this crisis , because this would reduce economic activity immediately !
The implication is that wasteful and excessive consumption is socially desirable because that is the only way to preserve employment .
Globally , too , policy makers are displaying the same startling lack of imagination .
The focus is on the US and all eyes are on the Obama recovery package , since direct or indirect dependence on exports to the US is so great for most countries that this is seen as the only way for all economies to recover .
Yet the US simply cannot continue to be the engine of world growth , given its huge external debt and current deficit , nor is it desirable that it should do so .
This creates an inevitable and urgent need for other economies to redirect their trade and investment , at least at the margin .
And associated with that , it also creates an opportunity for other countries to think about generating different , more sustainable and possibly more desirable , consumption patterns .
Why is it that so few people , especially those in a position to influence economic policies today , are raising these rather obvious questions ?
What we do not seem to realise is that unless we sort out these basic issues , we will not only be marching with lemming - like intensity and desperation to the sea , but we will also be squabbling , fighting and even killing each other for the privilege of getting there first .

This article was published by the International Development Economics Associates on 24 March 2009 ; it is reproduced here for educational purposes .
The two basic parts of the tumbled pebble and the arrowhead we considered are hard and soft rock .
Two basic parts of every living system are DNA and protein .
DNA is the famous molecule of heredity .
It ’s a focus of crime scene investigations , and we often hear news stories about it .
This is the molecule that gets passed down from one generation to the next .
Each of us starts oﬀ as a tiny little ball about the size of a period on a printed page .
In that tiny ball , there are over six feet ( 2 m ) of DNA all coiled up .
All of our physical characteristics ( height , skin color , etc. ) are “ spelled out ” in that DNA .
What are proteins ?
Proteins are the molecules of structure and function .
Hair is mostly protein ; skin cells are packed full of proteins ; the enzymes that break down food and build it up are proteins ; the filaments that slide together to make muscles work are proteins .
So DNA and protein are two basic “ parts ” of every living system .
When you get down to a virus , that ’s all you find — DNA and protein .
( In some viruses , RNA substitutes for DNA . )
The DNA molecules code for the protein molecules that make us what we are .
That same principle applies to all life forms : viruses , plants , and animals , as well as human beings .
My students study all of the details , 1 but DNA and protein molecules are really quite simple in their basic structure .
If you can picture a string of pearls , you can picture DNA : it is a chain of repeating units .
Figure 2 - A is a diagram of a DNA molecule .
The parts that look like railroad boxcars are sugar and phosphate groups , and the parts that stick out from each boxcar in the chain are groups called bases .
Proteins are built in about the same way .
Proteins are also chains of repeated units .
As shown in Figure 2 - B , the links in protein chains are called amino acids .
In all living things , inherited chains of DNA bases are used to line up chains of amino acids .
These amino acid chains are the protein molecules responsible for structure and function .
For example , chains of several hundred DNA bases tell the cell how to make a protein called hemoglobin , and that protein functions as the oxygen carrier in red blood cells .
In short form , DNA → protein → trait , and that relationship is the physical basis of all life on earth .
Now , what about that relationship between DNA and protein ?
How did it get started ?
Evolutionists picture a time long ago when the earth might have been quite diﬀerent .
They imagine that fragments of DNA and fragments of protein are produced .
These molecules are supposed to “ do what comes naturally ” over vast periods of time .
What ’s going to happen ?
Will time , chance , and chemical reactions between DNA and protein automatically produce life ?
At first , you might think so .
After all , nothing is more natural than a reaction between acids and bases .
Perhaps you ’ve used soda ( a base ) to clean acid from a battery .
The fizz is an acid - base reaction .
So is using “ Tums ” to neutralize stomach acid .
Nothing is more common than reactions between acids and bases .
If you just wait long enough , acid - base reactions will get DNA and protein working together , and life will appear — right ?
Wrong !
Just the opposite .
The problem is that the properties of bases and acids produce the wrong relationship for living systems .
Acid - base reactions would “ scramble up ” DNA and protein units in all sorts of “ deadly ” combinations .
These reactions would prevent , not promote , the use of DNA to code protein production .
Since use of DNA to code protein production is the basis of all life on earth , these acid - base reactions would prevent , not promote , the evolution of life by chemical processes based on the inherent properties of matter .
These wrong reactions have produced serious problems for Stanley Miller , Sidney Fox , and other scientists trying to do experiments to support chemical evolution .
Almost all biology books have a picture of Miller ’s famous spark chamber ( Figure 3 ) .
In it , Miller used simple raw materials and electric sparks to produce amino acids and other simple molecules — the so - called “ building blocks of life . ”
Some newspapers reported that Miller had practically made “ life in a test tube . ”
Miller ’s experiment was brilliant , and I loved to tell my students about it .
Then I came to see there were just three little problems : he had the wrong starting materials , used the wrong conditions , and got the wrong results .
What do I mean by “ wrong starting materials ” ?
Miller left out oxygen .
Why ?
Because of the scientific evidence ?
No .
He left it out because he knew oxygen would destroy the very molecules he was trying to produce .
It ’s hard for us to realize how “ corrosive ” oxygen is , since most modern living things depend on it .
But oxygen is so valuable to life precisely because it ’s so chemically reactive , and aerobic living things today have systems to protect themselves against the harmful eﬀects of oxygen , while using its chemical power to their advantage .
( Anaerobic organisms and some viruses are quickly destroyed by contact with oxygen . )
A.I. Oparin , the Russian biochemist who “ fathered ” modern views of spontaneous generation or chemical evolution , knew oxygen in the atmosphere would prevent evolution .
He also “ knew , ” by faith in Engels ’ materialistic philosophy ( the view that matter is the only reality ) , that creation was impossible ( there was no spiritual dimension ) .
As an act of faith , then , Oparin believed evolution must have occurred , and as a concession to his faith , he left oxygen out .
Science has not been kind to that belief .
We find oxidized rocks , suggesting an oxygen atmosphere , as deep as we can dig .
Furthermore , methane ( CH 4 ) and ammonia ( NH 3 ) , two prime gases in the Miller spark chamber , could not have been present in large amounts .
The ammonia would be dissolved in the oceans , and the methane should be found stuck to ancient ( deep ) sedimentary clays .
It ’s not there !
Those who still believe in chemical evolution are aware of these problems ( as is Miller himself ) , so they are simply trying ( as yet unsuccessfully ) to simulate the origin of life using diﬀerent starting materials .
( Carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide are two popular , if unlikely , gases being used today . )
Wrong conditions ?
Miller used an electric spark to get the gas molecules to combine , and that works .
Problem :
The same electric spark that puts amino acids together also tears them apart , and it ’s much better at destroying them than making them , meaning that few , if any , amino acids would actually accumulate in the spark chamber .
Miller , a good biochemist , knew that , of course , so he used a common chemist ’s trick .
He drew the products out of the spark chamber and into a “ trap ” that would save the amino acids from destruction by the same electric spark that made them .
Using product removal ( the principle of LeChatelier or law of mass action ) to increase yield is ordinary chemical practice , but it depends on intervention by informed intelligence .
Miller was supposed to be demonstrating that the gases could make the “ building blocks of life ” all by themselves without any outside help , yet his outside , intelligent help was necessary to save the molecules from their destructive chemical fate .
( Moreover , creating life in a test tube as a consequence of intelligent design would oﬀer more support to creation than to evolution . )
Wrong results ?
How could that be ?
Miller wanted to make amino acids , and he got amino acids ( along with sugars and a few other things ) .
How could those results be wrong ?
The proteins in living cells are made of just certain kinds of amino acids : those that are “ alpha ” ( short ) and “ left - handed . ”
Miller ’s “ primordial soup ” contained many long ( beta , gamma , delta ) amino acids and equal numbers of both right - and left - handed forms .
Problem : Just one long or right - handed amino acid inserted into a chain of short , left - handed amino acids would prevent the coiling and folding necessary for proper protein function .
What Miller actually produced was a seething brew of potent poisons that would absolutely destroy any hope for the chemical evolution of life .
The “ left - handed amino acid problem ” is particularly well - known to evolutionists , and several have been trying to solve it .
One brilliant researcher , after working unsuccessfully for years on the problem , just smiled and chuckled when asked about it : “ Perhaps God is left - handed . ”
He may have been closer to the truth than he realized .
From what we know about the chemistry of the molecules involved , it really looks like the molecules could never put themselves together into living cells apart from the careful selection , engineering genius , and deliberate design of the transcendent , creative intelligence we call God!
2
Chemistry , then , is not our ancestor ; it ’s our problem .
When cells lose their biological order and their molecules start reacting in chemical ways , we die .
A dead body contains all the molecules necessary for life and approximately the right amount of each , but we never see a “ road kill ” get up and walk oﬀ because sunlight energy shining on the carcass made all the molecules of life start working together again .
What ’s lost at death are balance and biological order that otherwise use food to put us together faster than chemistry tears us apart !
( See Bliss and Parker3 ; Illustra Media4 ; and Thaxton , Bradley , and Olsen5 for details . )
Time and chance are no help to the evolutionist either , since time and chance can only act on inherent chemical properties .
Trying to throw “ life ” on a roll of molecular dice is like trying to throw a “ 13 ” on a pair of gaming dice .
It just wo n’t work .
The possibility is not there , so the probability is just plain zero .
The relationship between DNA and protein required for life is one that no chemist would ever suspect .
It ’s using a series of bases ( actually taken three at a time ) to line up a series of R - groups ( Figure 4 ) .
R - groups are the parts of each amino acid that “ stick out ” along the protein chain .
“ R ” stands for the “ variable radical , ” and variable it is !
An R - group can be acid ; it can be a base ; it can be a single hydrogen atom , a short chain , a long chain , a single ring , a double ring , fat - soluble , or water - soluble !
The point is this :
There is no inherent chemical tendency for a series of bases ( three at a time ) to line up a series of R - groups in the orderly way required for life .
The base / R - group relationship has to be imposed on matter ; it has no basis within matter .
The relationship between hard and soft rock in the arrowhead in Figure 1 had to be imposed from the outside .
All of us could recognize that matter had been shaped and molded according to a design that could not be produced by time , chance , and weathering processes acting on the hard and soft rock involved .
In the same way , our knowledge of DNA , protein , and their chemical properties should lead us to infer that life also is the result of plan , purpose , and special acts of creation .
Let me use a simpler example of the same kind of reasoning .
Suppose I asked you this question : Can aluminum fly ?
Think a moment .
Can aluminum fly ?
I ’m sure that sounds like a trick question .
By itself , of course , aluminum ca n’t fly .
Aluminum ore in rock just sits there .
A volcano may throw it , but it does n’t fly .
If you pour gasoline on it , does that make it fly ?
If you pour a little rubber on it , that does n’t make it fly , either .
Suppose you take that aluminum , stretch it out in a nice long tube with wings , a tail , and a few other parts .
Then it flies ; we call it an airplane .
Did you ever wonder what makes an airplane fly ?
Try a few thought experiments .
Take the wings oﬀ and study them ; they do n’t fly .
Take the engines oﬀ , study them ; they do n’t fly .
Take the pilot out of the cockpit ; the pilot does n’t fly .
Do n’t dwell on this the next time you ’re on an airplane , but an airplane is a collection of non-flying parts !
Not a single part of it flies !
What does it take to make an airplane fly ?
The answer is something every scientist can understand and appreciate , something every scientist can work with and use to frame hypotheses and conduct experiments .
What does it take to make an airplane fly ?
Creative design and organization .
Take a look at the features of a living cell diagrammed in Figure 5 .
Do n’t worry ; I am not going to say much about this diagram .
Just notice the DNA molecule in the upper left circle and the protein in the lower right .
What are all the rest of those strange looking things diagrammed in the cell ?
Those represent just a few of the molecules that a cell needs to make just one protein according to the instructions of just one DNA molecule .
A cell needs over 75 “ helper molecules , ” all working together in harmony , to make one protein ( R - group series ) as instructed by one DNA base series .
A few of these molecules are RNA ( messenger , transfer , and ribosomal RNA ) ; most are highly specific proteins .
6
Figure 5 . Living cells use over 75 special kinds of protein and RNA molecules to make one protein following DNA ’s instructions .
What we know about airplanes convinces us that their flight is the result of creative design .
What scientists know about the way living cells make protein suggests , just as clearly , that life also is the result of creative design .
The real “ heroes , ” the molecules that establish the non-chemical , grammatical / linguistic coding relationship between triplet base codons and amino acid R - groups are the set of specific activating enzymes I call “ translases . ”
( Drawing from Bliss and Parker , Origin of Life [ Green Forest , AR : Master Books , 1979 ] ) .
Contrary to popular impression , DNA does not even possess the genetic code for making protein , but only the genetic alphabet .
The “ alphabet letters ” of DNA ( the four bases , abbreviated GCAT ) are used in groups of three ( triplet codons ) as code names for the 20 diﬀerent amino acids of proteins .
But bases are equally spaced along DNA ; there ’s nothing in the structure or chemistry that even hints why or which bases should be grouped as triplet codons .
Three letter groupings are not inherent in base sequences ; they are imposed on the base series by huge cellular particles called ribosomes .
Ribosomes do n’t act directly on DNA , but on expendable “ base pair copies ” of DNA called messenger RNA , or mRNA .
The production of mRNA , and of more DNA for reproduction , is magnificently profound , but it ’s a simple consequence of interlocking base shapes and ordinary chemical attraction ( mediated by enzymes ) .
The way ribosomes establish the genetic coding system , however , completely transcends the inherent properties of DNA bases .
Ribosomes are “ molecular machines ” each consisting of about 50 specific proteins and three large RNA molecules .
Its overall 3 - D shape gives a ribosome two adjacent slots each precisely shaped to hold three and only three bases , thus establishing the triplet coding system .
This coding system is not based on time , chance , and the properties of the bases , but on plan , purpose , and intelligent design .
In the structure of the ribosome , however , as in the arrowhead , nothing supernatural , complex , or even unusual is involved , and the function of the ribosome is easy to understand and explain .
In both the ribosome and the arrowhead , the evidence of creation is not in what we ca n’t see and do n’t know ; it ’s in the pattern of order ( “ exherent ” ) that we do see and can explain : matter shaped and molded to accomplish the purpose of its Creator , not to satisfy inherent chemical properties .
Besides the above , the ribosomes which establish the amino acid code names for making proteins are themselves made of 50 or more specific proteins .
It takes specific proteins to establish the code for making specific proteins , so how did the system get started ?
Evolutionists admit that ’s a problem for them because they insist evolution based on time , chance , and the properties of matter is a blind process that ca n’t plan ahead or work toward a goal .
On the other hand , creationists see the goal - oriented function of ribosomes as another evidence of creation .
Like batteries can be used to start car engines that then recharge the batteries , so proteins can be used to code for the production of proteins that can then “ recharge ” the coding proteins .
And there ’s more .
Even after ribosomes establish triplet codon names for amino acids , the protein building blocks have no chemical way to recognize their code names !
All sorts of wrong chemical reactions between amino acids and base triplets are possible , but these would destroy the code .
It falls to transfer RNA ( tRNA ) molecules to pick up amino acids and base pair them with their codons on the ribosome slots .
The base pairing of tRNA and mRNA triplets is based on interlocking shapes and ordinary chemical attraction , but the proper pairing of tRNAs with amino acids requires much more than ordinary chemistry .
When it comes to “ translating ” DNA ’s instructions for making proteins , the real “ heroes ” are the activating enzymes that unite specific tRNA / amino acid pairs .
Enzymes are proteins with special slots for selecting and holding other molecules for speedy reaction .
As shown in Figure 5 ( circle 3 ) , each activating enzyme has five slots : two for chemical coupling ( c , d ) , one for energy ( ATP ) , and , most importantly , two to establish a nonchemical three - base “ code name ” for each diﬀerent amino acid R - group ( a , b ) .
You may find that awe - inspiring , and so do my cell biology students !
The living cell requires at least 20 of these activating enzymes I call “ translases , ” one for each of the specific R - group / code name ( amino acid / tRNA ) pairs .
Even so , the whole set of translases ( 100 specific active sites ) would be ( 1 ) worthless without ribosomes ( 50 proteins plus rRNA ) to break the base - coded message of heredity into three - letter code names ; ( 2 ) destructive without a continuously renewed supply of ATP energy to keep the translases from tearing up the pairs they are supposed to form ; and ( 3 ) vanishing if it were n’t for having translases and other specific proteins to re-make the translase proteins that are continuously and rapidly wearing out because of the destructive eﬀects of time and chance on protein structure !
Most enzymes are proteins that select and speed up chemical reactions that would occur slowly without them .
Translases are an entirely diﬀerent category of enzymes .
They impose a relationship that transcends the chemistry of base triplets and amino acids , a code that would not occur at all , slowly or otherwise , in their absence .
Let ’s forget about all the complexity of the DNA - protein relationship and just remember two simple points .
First , it takes specific proteins to make specific proteins .
That may remind you of the chicken - and - egg problem : how can you get one without the other ?
That problem is solved if the molecules needed for “ DNA - protein translation ” are produced by creation .
Second , among all the molecules that translate DNA into protein , there ’s not one molecule that is alive .
There ’s not a single molecule in your body that ’s alive .
There ’s not a single molecule in the living cell that ’s alive .
A living cell is a collection of nonliving molecules !
What does it take to make a living cell alive ?
The answer is something every scientist recognizes and uses in a laboratory , something every scientist can logically infer from his observations of DNA and protein .
What does it take to make a living cell alive ?
Creative design and organization !
Only creative acts could organize matter into the first living cells , but once all the parts are in place , there is nothing “ supernatural ” or “ mysterious ” in the way cells make proteins .
If they are continually supplied with the right kind of energy and raw materials , and if all 75 - plus of the RNA and protein molecules required for DNA - protein “ translation ” are present in the right places at the right times in the right amounts with the right structure , then cells make proteins by using DNA ’s base series ( quite indirectly ! ) to line up amino acids at the rate of about two per second .
In ways scientists understand rather well , it takes a living cell only about four minutes to “ crank out ” an average protein ( 500 amino acids ) according to DNA specifications .
Scientists also understand how airplanes fly .
For that very reason , no scientist believes that airplanes are the result of time , chance , and the properties of aluminum and other materials that make up the airplane .
Flying is a property of organization , not of substance .
A Boeing 747 , for example , is a collection of 4.5 million non-flying parts , but thanks to design and creation ( and a continuous supply of energy and of repair services ! ) , it flies .
Similarly , “ life ” is a property of organization , not of substance .
A living cell is a collection of several billion non-living molecules , and death results when a shortage of energy or a flaw in the operational or repair mechanisms allows inherent chemical processes to destroy its biological order .
It ’s what we do know and can explain about aluminum and the laws of physics that would convince us that airplanes are the products of creation , even if we never saw the acts of creation .
In the same way , it ’s what we do know and can explain about DNA and protein and the laws of chemistry which suggests that life itself is the result of special creation .
My point is not based on design per se , but on the kind of design we observe .
As creationists point out , some kinds of design , such as snowflakes and wind - worn rock formations , do result from time and chance — given the properties of the materials involved .
Even complex relationships , such as the oxygen - carbon dioxide balance in a sealed aquarium , can result from organisms “ doing what comes naturally , ” given the properties of living things .
But just as clearly , other kinds of design , e.g. , arrowheads and airplanes , are the direct result of creative design and organization giving matter properties it does n’t have and ca n’t develop on its own .
What we know about the DNA - protein relationship suggests that living cells have the created kind of design .
It ’s not so much the molecular complexity as it is the transcendent simplicity .
In the well - known Scientific American book , Evolution , Dickerson7 seems to support my point ( without meaning to , I ’m sure ) .
After describing the problems in producing the right kinds of molecules for living systems , he says that those droplets that by “ sheer chance ” contained the right molecules survived longer .
He continues , “ This is not life , but it is getting close to it .
The missing ingredient is . . . . ”
What will he say here ?
The “ missing ingredient ” is . . . one more protein ? . . . a little more DNA ? . . . an energy supply ? . . . the right acid - base balance ?
No , he says : “ The missing ingredient is an orderly mechanism . . . . ”
An orderly mechanism !
That ’s what ’s missing — but that ’s what life is all about !
As I stated before , life is not a property of substance ; it ’s a property of organization .
The same kind of reasoning applies to the pyramids in Egypt , for example .
The pyramids are made of stone , but studying the stone does not even begin to explain how the pyramids were built .
Similarly , until evolutionists begin to explain the origin of the “ orderly mechanism , ” they have not even begun to talk about the origin of life .
When it comes to the evolutionary origin of that orderly mechanism , Dickerson adds , we have “ no laboratory models ; hence one can speculate endlessly , unfettered by inconvenient facts . ”
With “ no laboratory models ” to provide data , the case for the evolution of life must be based on imagination .
But , as Dickerson admits , “ We [ evolutionists ] can only imagine what probably existed , and our imagination so far has not been very helpful . ”
The case for creation , however , is not based on imagination .
Creation is based instead on logical inference from our scientific observations , and on simple acknowledgment that everyone , scientists and laymen alike , recognize that certain kinds of order imply creation .
Let me give you another example of the same sort of reasoning .
Imagine that you have just finished reading a fabulous novel .
Wanting to read another book like it , you exclaim to a friend , “ Wow !
That was quite a book .
I wonder where I can get a bottle of that ink ? ”
Of course not !
You would n’t give the ink and paper credit for writing the book .
You ’d praise the author , and look for another book by the same writer .
By some twist of logic , though , many who read the fabulous DNA script want to give credit to the “ ink ( DNA base code ) and paper ( proteins ) ” for composing the code .
In a novel , the ink and paper are merely the means the author uses to express his or her thoughts .
In the genetic code , the DNA bases and proteins are merely the means God uses to express
His thoughts .
The real credit for the message in a novel goes to the author , not the ink and paper , and the real credit for the genetic message in DNA goes to the Author of life , the Creator , not to the creature ( Rom. 1:25 ) .
The message conveyed by DNA is the kind called “ specified complexity ” in contrast to randomness or “ mere ” order .
It takes only a simple program or algorithm , for example , to generate a random sequence of letters : ( 1 ) Print any letter ; ( 2 ) Repeat step 1 .
An ordered , repeat pattern , such as ABCABCABC , could be generated by an algorithm nearly as simple : ( 1 ) Print ABC ; ( 2 ) Repeat step 1 .
A program ENORMOUSLY larger and more sophisticated would be required to specify , for example , the letter sequence in the first volume of an encyclopedia set !
The letter sequence is complex and specific ( “ specified complexity ” ) , like the base letter sequence in human DNA — except that the DNA contains more information than a thousand volumes of literary works !
8
Occasionally , naïve evolutionists argue that crystal formation demonstrates that order can appear spontaneously , without “ supernatural ” help .
Crystal order , yes ; specified complexity , no .
A crystal is a beautiful but simple repeat pattern produced by the shape and charge of its constituents .
At 32 °F ( O°C ) , for example , the areas of partial plus and minus charges on water molecules attract them with a force greater than the thermal motion that keeps them apart at higher temperatures .
The exquisite shape of the ice crystal is an automatic consequence of the shape and charge distribution ( “ design features ” ) of the water molecules .
( Incidentally , ice crystal formation is driven by decreasing electrostatic potential , an illustration — not a contradiction — of the famed second law of thermodynamics . )
The “ specified complexity ” in a DNA sequence is nothing like the “ ordered simplicity ” or repeat pattern in the ice crystal .
Breaking a big ice crystal produces little ice crystals , each with structures and properties like the original .
Breaking a DNA chain produces fragments that are dissimilar in structure and lose their function entirely .
A child at home can make ice crystals ; it takes a team of chemists using expensive equipment to produce a specific DNA sequence from scratch .
The specified complexity in a DNA gene sequence has very high information content .
Scientists know two things about information .
First , information is independent of the material that carries it .
The phrase “ In God We Trust ” can be written in pen or pencil , typed onto paper or a computer screen , embroidered in lace , etched in stone , impressed on American coins , etc .
The message is the same in any case , and it is obviously not produced by the material that conveys it .
In other words , informational messages — including genetic messages — have the “ exherent ” kind of design , reflecting plan , purpose , and special acts of creation .
Thus , the meaning of a message lies with its Creator , not its carrier .
Second , information comes only from pre-existing information .
Much more information on information can be found in the landmark9 book by internationally respected information theorist Werner Gitt , In the Beginning Was Information .
Biblically , that concept is expressed as “ In the beginning , God . . . ” ( Gen. 1:1 ) and as “ In the beginning was the Word ” ( John 1:1 ) .
The word “ Word , ” identified as Jesus Christ in John 1:14 , is the Greek word “ Logos . ”
Logos is a grand word in Greek , connoting divine plan , reason for being , etc. , and means “ study of ” as the suﬃx “ ology ” attached to the various academic disciplines .
Wow !
Our DNA ties us back to the ultimate source of meaning and purpose for the whole universe !
Creation thus stands between the classic extremes of mechanism and vitalism .
Mechanists , including evolutionists , believe that both the operation and origin of living things are the result of the laws of chemistry which reflect the inherent properties of matter .
Vitalists believe that both the operation and origin of living systems depend on mysterious forces that lie beyond scientific description .
According to creation , living things , including their DNA codes , operate in understandable ways that can be described in terms of scientific laws , but such observations include properties of organization that logically imply a created origin of life .
In this sense , the Bible proved to be , as it often has , far ahead of its time .
Into the 1800s , most scientists and philosophers believed living things were made of something fundamentally diﬀerent from non-living .
Genesis 1 – 2 tells us living things , human beings included , were just made of “ dust of the ground . ”
Indeed , scientists now recognize that living cells are composed of only a few simple elements .
It ’s not the stuﬀ ( “ dust ” ) we ’re made of that makes us special ; it ’s the way we ’re put together .
It ’s not the metal and glass that make an airplane fly , nor the ink and paper that write a novel .
Similarly , it ’s not the “ dust ” that makes life , but the way it ’s put together with creative design and organization .
When that organization is lost , we return to “ dust , ” the simple elements that we are made of , just as other created objects break down into their simpler parts when left to the ravages of time , chance , and chemistry .
The creationist , then , recognizes the orderliness that the vitalist does n’t see , but he does n’t limit himself to only those kinds of order that result from time , chance , and the properties of matter , as the evolutionist does .
Creation introduces levels of order and organization that greatly enrich the range of explorable hypotheses and turn the study of life into a scientist ’s delight .
Science requires an orderliness in nature .
One of the real emotional thrills of my changing from evolution to creation was realizing both that there are many more levels of order than I had once imagined and that order in nature , and a mind in tune with it , were guaranteed by God himself .
It ’s no wonder that explicit biblical faith gave initial success to the founding fathers of modern experimental science ( a couple of centuries before evolution came along to shift the basis toward time and chance ) .
If the evidence for the creation of life is as clear as I say it is , then other scientists , even those who are evolutionists , ought to see it — and they do .
I once took my students to hear Francis Crick , who shared a Nobel Prize for the discovery of DNA ’s structure .
After explaining why life could not and did not evolve on earth , he argued instead for “ directed panspermia , ” his belief that life reached earth in a rocket fired by intelligent life on some other planet .
Crick admitted that his view only moved the creation - evolution question back to another time and place , but he argued that different conditions ( which he did not specify ) might have given life a chance to evolve that it did not have on earth.10
Creationists are pleased that Crick recognized the same fatal flaws in chemical evolution that they have cited for years , but creationists also point out that the diﬀerences between “ chemical chemistry ” and “ biological chemistry ” are wrapped up with the fundamental nature of matter and energy and would apply on other planets as well as on earth .11
That opinion seems to be shared in part by famed astronomer Sir Fred Hoyle , 12 who made the news under the heading : “ There must be a God . ” Hoyle and his colleague , Chandra Wickramasinghe , independently reached that conclusion after their mathematical analyses showed that believing that life could result from time , chance , and the properties of matter was like believing that “ a tornado sweeping through a junkyard might assemble a Boeing 747 from the materials therein . ”
Drawing the logical inference from our scientific knowledge , both scientists concluded that “ it becomes sensible to think that the favorable properties of physics on which life depends are in every respect deliberate ” ( emphasis Hoyle ’s ) .
Both were surprised by their results .
Hoyle called himself an agnostic , and , in the same article , Wickramasinghe said he was an atheistic Buddhist who “ was very strongly brainwashed to believe that science cannot be consistent with any kind of deliberate creation . ”
My purpose in quoting these scientists ( and others later on ) is not , of course , to suggest that they are creationists who would endorse all my views .
13 Rather , it is simply to show that experts in the field , even when they have no preference for creationist thinking , at least agree with the creationists on the facts , and when people with diﬀerent viewpoints agree , we can be pretty sure what the facts are .
I also want to show that scientists who are not creationists are able to see that creation is a legitimate scientific concept , whose merits deserve to be compared with those of evolution .
In that light , I ’d like to call your attention to a fascinating and revolutionary book , Evolution : A Theory in Crisis , by a prominent molecular biologist , Dr. Michael Denton .14
In a television program we did together , and in our extensive personal conversations , Dr. Denton describes himself as a child of the secular age who desires naturalistic explanations when he can find them .
When it comes to the origin of life , Dr. Denton explains with authority and stark clarity that evolutionists are nowhere near a naturalistic explanation at present .
After comparing the genetic programs in living things to a library of a thousand volumes encoding a billion bits of information and all the mathematically intricate algorithms for coordinating them , Dr. Denton refers to the chemical evolution scenario as “ simply an aﬀront to reason , ” i.e. , an insult to the intelligence ! ( p. 351 ) .
He openly and frankly states that the thesis of his book is “ anti-evolutionary ” ( p. 353 ) , but it seems to me that he is cautiously taking a step even further .
The first chapter of his book is titled “ Genesis Rejected , ” and he would react very strongly against being called a creationist , but in his honest analysis of the creation - evolution controversy through history , Dr. Denton freely admits that many of the scientific views of the early creationists have been vindicated by modern discoveries in science .
Take William Paley ’s classic argument that design in living things implies a Designer just as clearly as design in a watch implies a watchmaker .
In The Blind Watchmaker ,15 discussed later , Richard Dawkins argues — incorrectly — that Paley was wrong .
Denton states , “ Paley was not only right in asserting an analogy between life and a machine , but also remarkably prophetic in guessing that the technological ingenuity realized in living systems is vastly in excess of anything yet accomplished by man ” ( emphasis added ) .
Then Denton goes on to summarize his thinking on life ’s origin ( p. 341 ) as follows :
The almost irresistible force of the analogy has completely undermined the complacent assumption , prevalent in biological circles over most of the past century , that the design hypothesis can be excluded on the grounds that the notion is fundamentally a metaphysical a priori concept and therefore scientifically unsound .
On the contrary , the inference to design is a purely a posteriori induction based on a ruthlessly consistent application of the logic of analogy .
The conclusion may have religious implications , but it does not depend on religious presuppositions ( emphasis added ) .
Now that ’s quite an admission !
Even though he would deny any leaning toward a Christian concept of creation , this leading molecular biologist sees quite plainly that a scientific concept of creation can be constructed , just as I ’ve said , using the ordinary tools of science , logic , and observation .
In fact , Denton intimates that creation scientists have shown more respect than evolutionists for empirical evidence and a “ ruthlessly consistent ” application of logic !
It ’s also true , as Denton concludes , that creation may have religious implications , but so does evolution , and that should not prevent our evaluating their scientific merits on the basis of logic and observation alone .
In a short but thought - provoking article , British physicist H.S. Lipson16 reached the same conclusion .
First he expressed his interest in life ’s origin , then his feeling — quite apart from any preference for creation — that , “ In fact , evolution became in a sense a scientific religion ; almost all scientists have accepted it and many are prepared to ‘ bend ’ their observations to fit with it . ”
After wondering how well evolution has stood up to scientific testing , Lipson continues : “ To my mind , the theory [ evolution ] does not stand up at all . ”
Then he comes to the heart of the issue : “ If living matter is not , then , caused by the interplay of atoms , natural forces , and radiation [ i.e. , time , chance , and chemistry ] , how has it come into being ? ”
After dismissing a sort of directed evolution , Lipson concludes : “ I think , however , that we must go further than this and admit that the only acceptable explanation is creation ” ( emphasis his ) .
Like Hoyle and Wickramasinghe , Lipson is a bit surprised and unhappy with his own conclusion .
He writes , “ I know that this [ creation ] is anathema to physicists , as indeed it is to me . ”
But his sense of honesty and scientific integrity forces him to conclude his sentence thus : “. . . but we must not reject a theory that we do not like if the experimental evidence supports it . ”
By the way , let me assure you that not all who see the evidence of creation are unhappy about it !
Witness Dr. Dean Kenyon .
Dr. Kenyon is a molecular biologist whose area of research interest is specifically the origin of life .
His book on life ’s origin , Biochemical Predestination , opened with praises for Darwinian evolution , and he taught evolution at San Francisco State University for many years .
A couple of students in Dr. Kenyon ’s class once asked him to read a book by Dr. Duane Gish on creation science .
He did n’t want to , but thanks to their polite persistence ( 1 Pet. 3:15 ) , he resolved to read it and refute it , but , as I heard him tell it , he read it and could n’t refute it .
Instead , Dr. Kenyon got interested in creation science and began a long re-evaluation of the scientific evidence , which finally led him to the happy conclusion that life , including his , is here as a result of creation , the deliberate plan and purpose of a personal Creator God!17

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The government 's financial bailout for troubled banks has not worked so far , a majority of respondents to a national poll say , and six in 10 do n't want Washington to spend more money on the rescue .
Sixty - one percent of those questioned in a CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey released Friday oppose providing more government money in the financial bailout .
There are some supporters , however -- 38 % said the government should provide more assistance to ailing banks and other financial institutions .
Most of the 1,245 adult Americans who were questioned for the poll were surveyed before Thursday 's Senate vote to release the remaining $ 350 billion in the financial bailout program .
" One reason for the opposition to more money being spent may be that more than eight in 10 said that the first $ 350 billion of taxpayer money for the bailout did n't work , " said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
" Only 14 % say that the money accomplished what it was supposed to do . "
Regardless of the apparent public opposition to the bailout , the Senate voted 52 to 42 to release the remaining funds .
" Barack Obama may have something to do with the vote , " said Holland .
" Democratic leaders in the Senate may not have been eager for a showdown with the president - elect .
The public would have been squarely on Obama 's side .
Sixty - two percent in the poll say they trust Obama more than Democratic Congressional leaders . "
That compares to only 25 % of those questioned in the poll indicating they would be more likely to trust Democratic Congressional leaders over Obama when they disagree on an issue .
The poll also suggests that 50 % of those questioned believe Republicans are more responsible for the economic problems facing the country right now .
Less than a quarter of the respondents said Democrats are more to blame , and one in five said both parties are equally at fault .
" Democrats may also have recognized that the public still blames the GOP for the bad economy .
That suggests that the public may give the Democrats some leeway , at least for now , " Holland added .
The 61 % who oppose proving more taxpayer money for the financial bailout is up from 56 % who opposed the initial bailout in mid-October .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey was conducted Monday through Thursday by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for some questions and plus or minus 4.5 percentage points for others .
Washington D.C. buses are the front lines in a new kind of religious conflict : ad wars .
The American Humanist Association threw the first punch by running an ad on 200 city buses reading : “ Why believe in a God ?
Just be good for goodness ’ sake , ” On Faith 's Under God blog reports .
The ad is part of the group ’s “ godless holiday campaign , ” aimed at raising humanism ’s profile and connecting non-believers through whybelieveinagod.org .
“ Humanists have always understood that you do n’t need a god to be good , ” said AHA executive director Roy Speckhardt in a statement posted on the association ’s website .
“ Morality does n’t come from religion . ”
The D.C. Examiner reports that one woman is leading a grassroots effort to counter the AHA with an ad saying , “ Why believe ?
Because I created you and I love you , for goodness ’ sake .
– God . ”
While Under God calls the back - and - forth , “ a light - hearted joust , ” some are taking the campaign quite seriously .
The Dakota Voice reports that Christian groups calling the ads “ another attempt by those waging a war on Christmas to ban God from the public square . ”
In a more aggressive response , executive director of the Louisiana Baptist Convention , David Hankins , attacks humanism in the Baptist Press :
We do have some recent examples of societies that do not believe in God nor recognize a mandated divine value on human beings .
They are associated with names like Hitler , Stalin , Pol Pot , Mao Zedong , Idi Amin , and Saddam Hussein .
Devoid of any sense of God or godliness , they created a social order of mayhem and evil that destroyed millions of lives .
So much for the morality of godlessness .

How did I miss this ?
At PDC 2008 ( in the Parallel Symposium , apparently ) , Microsoft started talking about a new language that may be joining the .
Net family .
Continuing the musical theme of certain other languages , this one is called Maestro .
According to an article in Dr Dobbs Journal , Maestro is a special purpose language designed to simplify the writing of scalable parallel programs .
It will integrate with other .
Net components , and it seems that the intention is for the compute - intensive parts of applications to be written in Maestro , while the staple .
Net languages continue to power the rest .
It ’s based around the idea of agents in isolated domains passing messages to each other .
On the new Maestro blog there ’s an article giving some examples of the funky syntax they ’re introducing :
The forwarding operator , == > which is used to indicate that messages should be passed from a source to a target
== > which is used to indicate that messages should be passed from a source to a target
The broadcast operator , – << that broadcasts messages to a number of targets
– << that broadcasts messages to a number of targets
The multiplex operator , >>- which combines messages from several sources before passing them to a single target
Do n’t get too excited just yet : Maestro is being described as an “ incubation project ” .
That appears to mean that it ’s a bit more than a research project , but not one that anybody has yet committed to shipping .
I do n’t think they ’ve even released a version of this yet – I certainly can’t find a download .
Once you ’ve read the book , see the film on Channel 9 .
Update ( 16/4/2009 ) : Maestro has been renamed to Axum
As Mary - Jo reported , Maestro has now been given the less musical code name of “ Axum ” .
This is possibly due to a code - name clash with another Microsoft project , that one to do with business intelligence .
The parade ground was still sodden from overnight rain but their instructors were in no mind to cancel Monday morning 's drill .
So , from 7 am , Azhar Abbas and his fellow police cadets had been undergoing inspection , having their names checked off the roster , their uniforms scrutinised .
Twenty minutes later , chaos broke out .
" One grenade was thrown by the terrorists and then they were firing their guns indiscriminately across the parade ground , " recalled the shaken young man , sitting afterwards in his barracks hugging fellow cadets .
" That was when someone shouted ' Save your lives ' .
There was a wall , and we ran to it .
We tried to save ourselves . "
Mr Abbas was one of around 800 recruits inside the Manawan police training centre on the outskirts of Lahore when a group of gunmen , armed with automatic weapons and bags of grenades , stormed the lightly defended compound and launched an attack that has upped the stakes once again in Pakistan 's battle with the militants .
The bloodshed could have been much worse – eight police cadets are thought to have been killed and 90 injured – but the eight - hour siege at the police compound marked another disturbing development in the militants ' tactics .
Coming just three weeks after gunmen tried to hijack the Sri Lankan cricket team in the same city , yesterday 's brazen assault has left authorities struggling to know how to protect locations that , until now , have barely been considered targets .
Precisely how many gunmen were involved remains unclear .
Three or four are thought to have been killed , with at least two of them blowing themselves up as the Pakistani security forces closed in .
Another militant – said to be an Afghan national – who may have been coordinating the attack from outside the compound , was captured alive .
Two more possible suspects were being interrogated by the authorities .
Witnesses said that the group of men – most of them wearing traditional salwar kameez but at least one wearing a blue training academy tracksuit – had been dropped by a white van outside the academy at around 7.20 am .
The academy , located on the famous Grand Trunk road and just 10 miles from the Indian border , is not heavily defended ( the guards on the gates apparently had just four bullets each ) .
The gunmen simply leapt over the low perimeter wall , throwing grenades and firing their weapons .
Trainee Gozel Ansari , who started his induction just six weeks ago , was on the rear parade ground .
" Suddenly there was a loud bang and we heard a series of three blasts .
We asked the instructors what was happening , " he said .
" Suddenly the security guards appeared , saying that we were being attacked .
We ran into a corner near the toilets and hid .
The bullets were passing over our heads .
We felt that any moment we could die . "
As Mr Ansari and his colleagues huddled between two buses , the gunmen stepped over the bodies of the dead cadets sprawled on the parade ground , entered the academy and made their way upstairs .
From the rooftop they continued to fire .
An ambulance arrived and was swiftly targeted .
When the first 12 - strong group of police commandos turned up , six of their weapons jammed and they had to leave to re-arm , according to a police inspector at the scene .
Reinforcements arrived some time later from paramilitary troops , complete with armoured personnel carriers and a surveillance helicopter , and a sustained gun fight began with the militants , who by now had taken up positions on the second floor .
Yesterday afternoon , the intensity of that exchange was obvious .
The walls of the academy , both inside and out , were pock - marked with bullet holes while empty cartridge shells littered the parade ground , on which still lay the berets of half a dozen cadets .
The worst of the fighting was concentrated in a second - floor dormitory where three gunmen were making their last stand , holding up to 10 cadets hostage .
Video footage shot by local television channels showed police commandos gradually moving towards the dormitory , occasionally standing up to let off a volley of automatic fire .
Police said they were able to shoot one of the militants .
But surrounded and trapped , it appears the last two militants decided to take their own lives .
At around 3 pm two loud blasts were heard as the gunmen set off suicide bomb belts .
Police and forensics experts were last night working their way through the dormitory looking for clues .
The walls and roof of the dormitory were splattered with blood and human tissue , while more substantial remains of the gunmen , including a head and a severed arm , lay on the floor .
Police also recovered weapons , spare cartridges and a suicide belt , packed with ball - bearings , that had not been detonated .
The gunmen had also brought bars of chocolate and tubes of throat lozenges , but unlike the attackers in Mumbai , it appears these militants were not expecting their assault to stretch into days .
Pakistan 's interior ministry chief , Rehman Malik , said he believed the gunmen were linked to Baitullah Mehsud , a leader of the Pakistan Taliban in South Waziristan .
Mr Malik said all the planning was done in that area and that one of the three men being questioned was an Afghan who arrived in Lahore two weeks ago .
At the same time , some of the cadets said they heard gunmen speaking with accents from the southern Punjab , raising the prospect of a nexus between militants based in Pakistan 's tribal areas and those from the largest and wealthiest province .
Mr Malik also suggested the gunmen may have been members of Lashkar - e - Jhangvi , a Punjab - based group said to have links to al - Qa'ida .
Police and commandos celebrated the end of the siege by firing into the air , shouting ' God is great ' .
Their operation had been judged a success ; none of their officers killed , the hostages rescued unharmed .
But with the surging militancy again flexing its muscles – this time just days after President Asif Ali Zardari promised his country would not become a haven for terrorists –
Pakistan may have little reason to cheer .
Hour by hour :
How siege unfolded
0720 Attackers vault wall and begin firing indiscriminately on cadets , out on the parade ground doing their morning march .

The Obamas to eat what they grow
The Obama family plan to eat what they grow in the White House in the future
US First Lady Michelle Obama is set to break the ground for an organic garden on a patch of the south lawn to grow produce for the White House kitchen .
Local primary school pupils will help her with the planting and harvesting of the vegetables , herbs and salad crops .
Promoting healthy eating for American families has become a part of the first lady 's agenda .
She has promised her whole family will be getting involved , and even President Barack Obama will help with weeding .
Mrs Obama hopes that inspiring children will help spread the healthy eating message to others .
" My hope is that through children , they will begin to educate their families and that will , in turn , begin to educate our communities , " she said in an interview in her East Wing office .
The plot of land given over to the new kitchen garden , which will measure about 1,100 sq ft ( 102.2 sq m ) , will be visible from the street .
Exotic plants
Among the 55 varieties of vegetables the Obamas are planning to cultivate are spinach , chard , collards and black kale .
The more exotic plants in the new garden will be rocket , coriander , tomatilloes , hot peppers and anise hyssop herbs .
Most First Families have not planted a White House vegetable garden Several varieties of lettuces including red romaine , green oak leaf , butterhead , red leaf and galactic will be planted .
The selection was put together by the White House chefs who will use the the produce to feed the Obama family and for official events .
Toby Buckland , lead presenter on the BBC 's flagship gardening programme , Gardeners ' World , warmly welcomed the venture .
" I 'm delighted that the first family are leading the way in the USA by growing their own , " he told the BBC news website .
Whether you have a White House , a greenhouse or even just a grow bag or a window box , it 's easy to grow your own grub
Toby Buckland
Gardeners ' World
Gardeners ' World " Whether you have a White House , a greenhouse or even just a grow bag or a window box , it 's easy to grow your own grub . "
He recommended that in Washington , with its cold winters and humid , hot summers , the best vegetables to grow would be pumpkins , string beans and sweetcorn .
" I am chuffed to bits that the president and his first lady want to get their nation growing their own too , " said Mr Buckland .
" Together maybe we can help spread the grow - your - own message right around the world !
Can we grow it ?
Yes we can ! "
The initiative will be welcomed by advocates of the eat local movement such as Kitchen Gardeners International , a coalition of gardeners whose mission is to inspire and teach people to grow their own food .
More than 100,000 people signed the group 's online petition urging the Obamas to replant an edible garden at the White House .
In 1800 John Adams , the first president to live in the White House , planted a garden .
In the last century , Eleanor Roosevelt planted a Victory Garden during World War II , while the Clintons had a small rooftop garden that grew vegetables and herbs in the 1990s .

But the Central Intelligence Agency redacted the number of tapes destroyed when it provided an accounting for a federal lawsuit that seeks release of its interrogation records .
On Monday , the Justice Department said there were 92  a stunning amount of evidence - shredding that needs further scrutiny .
The released memos were written by the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , which is supposed to ensure policies comply with the Constitution and the law .
They make it chillingly clear how quickly that office was rededicated to finding ways for Mr. Bush to evade , twist or ignore both .
Some low points :
 In an Oct. 23 , 2001 , memo , John C. Yoo , then a Justice Department lawyer , explained how Mr. Bush could ignore the Fourth Amendment and the Posse Comitatus Act and deploy the military within the United States in “ anti- terrorist operations . ”
In the same memo , Mr. Yoo argued that Mr. Bush could also suspend First Amendment rights to free speech and a free press .
 On March 13 , 2002 , Jay Bybee , the head of the office at the time , wrote that Mr. Bush could ignore the Geneva Conventions and the anti-torture treaty .
Mr. Bybee , who now has a lifetime seat as a judge on a federal court , said Mr. Bush was free to send prisoners to countries known to employ torture  a practice known as extraordinary rendition  as long as there was no agreement to do the torturing .
 On Jan. 15 , 2009 , five days before Mr. Bush left office , Steven G. Bradbury , the head of the counsel ’s office in Mr. Bush ’s second term , repudiated the earlier memos and tried to excuse them by saying they were made “ in a time of great danger and under extraordinary time pressure . ”
They were , but that should have led honest lawyers to exercise extra prudence , not to rush into sweeping away this country ’s most cherished rights .
The Justice Department ’s internal ethics office is reviewing these and other memos and trying to decide whether political appointees knowingly twisted their interpretations of the law to provide legal cover for decisions made by the White House .
At least two Congressional committees are , quite rightly , also looking into these issues .
GAZA ( Reuters ) - Israel ’s top general said there was still “ work ahead ” in the 18 - day offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday , and Israeli tanks and troops edged closer to the heart of the city of Gaza .
The Palestinian death toll rose to 971 , Gaza ’s Hamas - run Health Ministry said , counting some 400 women and children among those killed .
Israel says 10 Israeli soldiers and three civilians hit by Hamas rockets have died .
The top U.N. aid official for Gaza appealed to the international community to protect Gaza ’s civilians , saying nowhere in the territory of 1.5 million people was safe any longer with the conflict becoming “ a test of our humanity . ”
“ All the people , the first thing they say to me and the last thing they say to me is ‘ Please , we need protection , nowhere is safe , ” John Ging , director of operations for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency , told reporters in Geneva by videolink .
Explosions and heavy machinegun fire echoed across Gaza , a city of 500,000 , after Israeli tanks moved nearer to its densely populated downtown area but did not enter , residents said .
The tanks appeared to be testing how the militants reacted .
Talat Jad , a 30 - year - old resident of the Gaza suburb of Tel al - Hawa , where tanks advanced overnight , said he and 15 members of his family had gathered in one room of their house , too frightened to look out of the window .
“ We even silenced our mobile phones because we were afraid the soldiers in the tanks could hear them , ” Jad said .
Medical workers said 23 Palestinian gunmen , most of them members of the Islamist Hamas group that rules the Gaza Strip , and seven civilians were killed in the latest fighting .
In Cairo , a Hamas delegation resumed talks with Egypt on a ceasefire plan proposed by the Arab country , which borders the Gaza Strip and Israel and has made peace with the Jewish state .
Israeli aircraft attacked 60 targets , including tunnels used by militants to smuggle arms across the border from Egypt .
Two rockets hit Beersheba in southern Israel , causing no casualties .
“ We have achieved a lot in hitting Hamas and its infrastructure , its rule and its armed wing , but there is still work ahead , ” Lieutenant - General Gabi Ashkenazi , chief of staff of Israel ’s armed forces , told a parliamentary committee .
Ashkenazi said Israeli aircraft had carried out more than 2,300 strikes since the offensive -- Israel ’s deadliest against Palestinians in decades -- was launched on December 27 .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon was heading to the region for a week of talks with leaders in Egypt , Israel , Jordan and Syria aimed at ending the bloodshed .

“ My message is simple , direct , and to the point : the fighting must stop .
To both sides , I say : Just stop now , ” Ban told reporters before his departure .
Human rights groups have reported shortages of vital supplies , including water , in the Gaza Strip .
A fuel shortage has brought frequent power blackouts .
Israel has permitted almost daily truck shipments of food and medicine .
But in a new report , Human Rights Watch said Israel ’s daily 3 - hour break in attacks to facilitate the supply of humanitarian aid to Gazans was “ woefully insufficient . ”

URBAN WARFARE
Political sources said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni decided late on Monday against ordering troops in the next two or three days to engage in all - out urban warfare .
Opening a “ Phase 3 ” of the offensive would likely complicate truce efforts , lead to intense street fighting and could cause heavy casualties on both sides , a politically risky move less than a month before Israel ’s parliamentary election .
Barak said in broadcast remarks that Israel had “ respectfully ” heard Ban ’s appeal and was monitoring Egypt ’s ceasefire mediation , but it would continue to hit Hamas while diplomatic efforts were under way .
Hamas says Israel must pull back all its troops under a ceasefire and end the blockade of the Gaza Strip that it tightened after the group seized the coastal enclave from forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007 .
Hamas official Moussa Abu Marzouq told Al Jazeera television it had “ substantial observations ” about the ceasefire plan .
Israel has rebuffed as “ unworkable ” a U.N. Security Council ceasefire resolution last week and said a truce must ensure Hamas cannot rearm through tunnels under the Gaza - Egypt border .
Ashkenazi said Israeli warplanes had bombed “ all of the known tunnels ” during the offensive , “ very seriously hurting Hamas ’s ability to smuggle in weapons . ”
The bloodshed has opened faultlines in the map of Middle East diplomacy , with the Bush administration in its final week standing behind Israel , Europe pressing Israel to call off its attacks and Arab leaders speaking out against the Jewish state .
Community Education Council member Salvatore Ballarino resigned his seat today at the insistence of Staten Island Borough President James Molinaro , in the wake of an inflammatory " joke " email that ignited a firestorm of outrage .
" I spoke to Mr. Ballarino this morning and asked him to resign , " Molinaro said .
" He agreed , and he has resigned effective today .
His conduct was inappropriate and unacceptable as my appointee .
Such comments about any race , people , or religion by anyone appointed by me will not be tolerated . "
Mayor Michael Bloomberg applauded Molinaro for acting to remove Ballarino .
" I am glad the borough president asked for Mr. Ballarino 's resignation this morning , " Bloomberg said .
" The e-mails he forwarded were deeply offensive , and there was no longer any role for him influencing policies that affect our children . "
The e-mail , a mock photo strip sent to about 30 people on Jan. 4 , shows a presidential debate between then - Sen.
Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain , with speech balloons inventing a dialogue rife with racist jokes about black people .
The strip starts with McCain saying , " I have black people in my family tree , " followed by Obama saying , " Really ?
That 's great , " and McCain responding with , " If I recall , they 're still hanging there . "
After each of the four jokes -- with punch lines that compare African American babies with excrement -- Obama is shown with a straight face .
Community leaders have expressed outrage over the e-mail .

With the Obama administration staking the nation 's energy future on clean sources , the U.S. nuclear power industry aims to make a comeback by building dozens of new reactors that supply plentiful , carbon - free electricity .
But 30 years after the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania led to moratoriums on new plants across the nation , concerns about the cost and safety of nuclear power remain , including what to do with the growing stockpiles of highly radioactive waste from the nation 's reactors .
President Obama 's campaign pledge to find an alternative to burying the deadly waste at Yucca Mountain , Nev. - and recent votes in Congress to slash funding for the proposed nuclear graveyard 1,000 feet underground - could hobble the industry 's hopes of providing a larger share of U.S. energy needs .
Still , industry leaders voice confidence about nuclear power as a clean source of electrical energy that can reduce the nation 's reliance on dirty , coal - fired power plants that emit greenhouse gases , cause acid rain and speed climate change .
Applications to build at least 31 nuclear reactors are before the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission , with more filings expected soon .
Many of the projects are in the Southeast , with the first expected to go on line as early as 2015 .
Nuclear advocates hope eventually to build additional reactors in California .
" I 'm aware of 33 or 34 projects in the hopper .
I think the prospects are reasonably good .
There 's demand , " said Bill Halsey , a leading expert on nuclear energy at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , where scientists have worked on solutions for permanent disposal of high - level radioactive waste .
New reactors
Nuclear power supporters predict that approval of pending construction licenses for new reactors in Florida , Alabama and Texas will raise demand for nuclear power in California , which has banned new reactors since the late 1970s because of concerns over waste disposal .
Obama has emphasized alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power , but also pledged to re-examine nuclear energy .
Officials at the Livermore lab hope to use a fresh infusion of federal funds to refine methods of disposing of or recycling nuclear reactors ' spent fuel , which can remain highly toxic for hundreds of thousands of years .
The lab is run by a consortium headed by San Francisco 's Bechtel Corp. , which also builds nuclear power plants overseas .
Nuclear power opponents include the Sierra Club , the nation 's oldest environmental group .
" Our view is that the nuclear industry has yet to demonstrate that they know what to do with the waste they generate , " said Carl Pope , the club 's executive director , " and they have yet to demonstrate that they can build and operate new reactors with their own money .
They have yet to meet the test of the market .
So we think it 's a very poor investment of public money . "
Meanwhile , global warming has prompted some conservationists , such as Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore , to conclude that nuclear power will be a crucial energy source in the future .
' Not - so - good options '
" Many people are gritting their teeth and beginning to look at nuclear energy because the problems appear to be more manageable , " said Per Peterson , a professor of nuclear engineering at UC Berkeley .
" Nuclear energy is the only source that we 've found that can directly displace coal for reliable , full - time electrical generation .
...
It 's the best of a set of not - so - good options . "
There are about 440 nuclear power plants operating worldwide , including 104 commercial reactors in the United States .
Four reactors are in California - two at Diablo Canyon near San Luis Obispo and two at San Onofre in Southern California .
Energy from those plants , plus nuclear power imported from Arizona , accounts for 15 percent of California 's electricity supply .
Nuclear reactors supply nearly 20 percent of U.S. electrical energy , and industry advocates say nuclear energy provides about three - quarters of the nation 's carbon - free electricity .
They also say reactor safety has improved significantly since Three Mile Island 's meltdown in 1979 .
Under California law , no new nuclear power plants can be built in the state until the industry finds a way to permanently dispose of its waste .
Spent fuel rods are currently stored on site at U.S. nuclear plants .
Meanwhile , other nations , including China , are building nuclear reactors at a rapid rate .
France , Britain and Japan rely heavily on nuclear power .
Building a reactor costs several billion dollars , which utilities and owner / operators hope to fund through bank loans , rate increases and federal loan guarantees .
In 1987 , Congress chose Yucca Mountain as the nation 's future repository for spent fuel rods from nuclear reactors .
The state of Nevada has opposed the project .
" Over the last 40 years , a very broad scientific consensus has emerged that nuclear waste can be managed safely by a combination of recycle and deep geologic disposal , " UC Berkeley 's Peterson said .
" There 's political controversy , but the technical consensus is that the level of isolation will be sufficient to protect long - term public health and the environment . "
The Department of Energy has applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build the repository at Yucca Mountain , but funding for the project has been severely cut .
Nuclear waste fee
A recent study by the Congressional Research Service says that it would cost about $ 100 billion to dispose of the waste from U.S. nuclear reactors and dismantled weapons at the site .
But nuclear advocates say these costs are nominal .
" The nuclear waste fee is only about a percent of the value of energy taken out , " said Jim Blink , a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .
" Nuclear has such a small amount of waste per unit of energy that we can afford to collect it and dispose of it in a way that 's isolated from the biosphere . "
Blink and other scientists spent two decades evaluating the suitability of Yucca Mountain as a permanent graveyard for nuclear waste , which currently includes about 60,000 metric tons from civilian reactors plus additional tonnage from the military .
They have done extensive studies of volcanic rock there , built a corrosion testing lab to simulate underground conditions , designed corrosion - resistant dry casks to hold spent fuel rods and used supercomputers to calculate the risks of permanent disposal .
Meanwhile , researchers and engineers are developing the next generation of nuclear reactors that will be capable of recycling spent nuclear fuel , leaving a residue of material whose high - level radioactivity is of shorter duration .
Those reactors are not expected to go on line for 20 to 30 years .

Telomere length shortening occurs with age in most cells types , and shorter telomeres are associated with increased risk of age - related diseases , including cardiovascular disease .
The majority of studies to - date analyze mean telomere length in peripheral leukocytes , as material is plentiful and circumvents the practical and ethical problems associated with obtaining vascular tissue .
Telomere length is strongly correlated between leukocytes and vascular tissues , validating the use of leukocyte telomere length as a proxy for length in vascular cells .
However , leukocytes comprise a number of cell types ; so do they all “ age ” at the same rate ?
In a step towards answering this question Hoffmann et al. examined telomere length in lymphocytes and granulocytes separately :
Telomere length - heterogeneity among myeloid cells is a predictor for chronological ageing .
We have previously shown that mean telomere length ( TL ) of granulocytes reflects TL of myeloid bone marrow cells extremely well .
Here we analysed the distribution of TL from peripheral blood granulocytes and lymphocytes in 61 female and 68 age - matched male healthy volunteers .
We show that the age - dependent decline in TL occurs more rapid in peripheral blood lymphocytes ( 53 bp / year ) than in granulocytes ( 39 bp / year ; p<0.001 ) , while women having longer telomeres than men .
We also observed the best correlation for age and telomere length to be present in lymphocytes .
The coefficient variation ( CV ) of TL distribution in granulocytes and monocytes was significantly higher in older compared to younger individuals , indicating an increase in telomere length heterogeneity of myeloid cells and their bone marrow residing precursors during ageing .
In a multivariate statistical model , CV and lymphocyte TL were able to explain 50 % of chronological ageing .
Telomere attrition is significantly faster in lymphocytes than in granulocytes , with lymphocyte telomere length correlating most strongly with age .
Furthermore , the coefficient of variation ( CV ; essentially an indication of the distribution of telomere lengths ) increased significantly with age in both cell types .
As the authors have previously reported that telomere length in granulocytes reflects that of myeloid bone marrow precursors , the present study implies that telomere length heterogeneity in bone marrow residing precursors also increases with age .
These findings imply that if two subjects have the same mean telomere length , the subject with increased heterogeneity ( i.e. , the older one ) is likely to have a greater proportion of shorter telomeres in the stem cell compartment .
The presence of just one critically shortened telomere may be sufficient to induce senescence ( though this hypothesis is controversial ; hence , telomere length heterogeneity may provide useful information that mean telomere length alone cannot .
The impact of sex on telomere length is the subject of some debate , with some studies reporting longer telomeres in women , while others show no difference .
The present study may shed a little light on the subject : women were found to have longer lymphocyte telomere lengths , while granulocyte length did not differ .
Thus , the relative number of each cell type in prior studies may skew interpretation of the data .
All subjects in this study were physically fit , walking or exercising “ at least 20 km / week ” ; the authors stress this point in the methods , but fail to mention it in the discussion .
This is disappointing in light of a recent high - impact study demonstrating that exercise improves the cardiovascular risk profile , increasing telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells .
The study may have aimed to examine the “ healthiest ” possible subjects , but as a consequence the results may not be representative of the general population .
Overall , this study highlights the importance of analyzing cell types individually to avoid the impact of differences in the ratios of cell type on interpreting telomere length data from peripheral blood .
Furthermore , it adds telomere length heterogeneity to the list of important factors requiring further study .

Dodd , chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , told CNN that Obama officials wanted the language added to an amendment limiting bonuses that could be paid by companies receiving federal bailout money .
He said they were afraid that without it , the government would face numerous lawsuits from employees who were promised bonuses .
On Tuesday , Dodd denied to CNN that he had anything to do with adding the language , which has been used by officials at AIG to justify paying millions of dollars in bonuses to executives after receiving federal money .
" I did not want to make any changes to my original Senate - passed amendment , but I did so at the request of administration officials , who gave us no indication that this was in any way related to AIG , " Dodd said in a statement released by his office .
The nearly $ 800 billion stimulus bill was approved by Congress in February .
The White House did not immediately respond to CNN 's request for comment
The admission comes amid a public furor over the $ 165 million in bonuses that were paid to AIG executives late last week after the struggling insurance company received nearly $ 180 billion in government bailout funds .
Both Congress and President Obama have expressed surprise over the bonuses and demanded that the money be paid back .
Democratic leaders said late Wednesday that the House will vote on legislation aimed at recovering the bonuses .
More about AIG on CNBC.com :
The final language of the Dodd amendment specifically excluded bonuses from contracts signed before the bill 's passage -- a broad category that included the AIG bonuses .
At the time , few objected to that move , which was designed to ensure the measure was constitutional .
Earlier on Wednesday , AIG CEO Edward Liddy told a House panel that decisions to pay the bonuses to AIG executives were made " in cooperation " with Federal Reserve officials .
" Everything we do we do in partnership with the Federal Reserve , " Liddy said .
" They have the ability to weigh in yea or nay on anything in discussion .
" We 've been talking about this within the board and with representatives of the Federal Reserve literally for three months . "
Fury over the bonuses threatens to undermine Obama 's efforts to solve the credit crisis and pull the economy out of a deep recession .
The president has said he might have to ask Congress for money beyond a $ 700 billion bailout fund approved in October .
AIG has argued that the payouts were necessary to retain top employees with the specialized knowledge to dispose of $ 2.7 trillion in complex securities that ended up dragging the company to the brink of collapse last year .
Meanwhile , Attorney General Eric Holder said the Justice Department was working with the Treasury Department to determine how it might go about recovering the bonuses .
" We 're working with the Treasury Department to make them aware of what legal abilities they have , " Holder told a news briefing .
An everyday occurrence turned into a 28 hour ordeal for a Queens man last month when he was arrested for using the emergency subway exit at DeKalb Avenue on the L line in Brooklyn .
32 - year - old Todd Zielinski says he used the exit to bypass a crowd of commuters pushing through the turnstiles , but plainclothes cops stopped him , checked his ID , and sent him through what 's commonly called " the system . "
In most cases , the NYPD issues summonses for minor offenses like this , but suspects without IDs or with outstanding warrants are sent on a long trip down to The Tombs before seeing a judge .
But Zielinski , a Verizon technician , insists his record is clean and tells the Daily News , " They took 28 hours of my life away from me .
People can't believe it .
This is what our city 's come to ?
I 've taken the subway and buses all my life ...
If I counted how much money I 've given to the MTA to be treated like this . "
( In 2006 , the MTA reported that unnecessary use of the emergency gates was causing the automatic alarms to malfunction . )
An NYPD spokesman confirmed the arrest , but it 's unclear why Zielinski was detained for so long .
Perhaps the inevitable lawsuit will shed more light on the incident .

CHARLOTTE , N.C. - Banks nationwide hold $ 41 billion in loans to directors , top executives and other insiders , a portfolio that experts say should be stripped of secrecy .
Insider lending to directors is particularly troublesome because it could cloud the judgment of people charged with protecting shareholders and overseeing bank management , the experts say .
At Charlotte - based Bank of America , those loans more than doubled last year , to $ 624.2 million - the biggest dollar jump in the country .
The largest of them likely went to three directors or their companies .
The surge came during the third quarter as credit markets froze , the government prepared to infuse banks with billions in tax dollars and the board approved the purchase of troubled Merrill Lynch .
Bank of America ranked fourth on the list of biggest insider lenders .
At the top was JPMorgan of New York , which held $ 1.48 billion in insider loans , mostly by directors or their companies .
At No. 2 , Charlotte - based Wachovia , which was sold to Wells Fargo of San Francisco at the end of 2008 , finished the year with $ 747 million in insider loans .
All of the loans were held by the bank 's directors or their companies , with just five holding the largest .
Ranking third on the list was M&I Marshall & Ilsley of Milwaukee , with $ 644.4 million , and Chicago 's Northern Trust was at No. 5 with $ 524.5 million .
Insider loans , ranging from home mortgages to multimillion - dollar lines of credit for big companies , are legal but are largely shrouded from public scrutiny .
Banks do n't have to explain increased insider lending .
They do n't have to disclose individual loan amounts or terms for any insiders , including executives .
Directors and their businesses , often the largest insider borrowers , are completely shielded .
Directors must approve insider loans greater than $ 500,000 , so they sometimes vote on loans for each other or the executives they oversee .
Insider favoritism is against the law .
Bankers and regulators say the loans are subject to greater scrutiny to ensure insiders are n't getting better terms and are creditworthy .
But top corporate governance experts contend that insider lending carries serious potential for conflict of interest among bank officials and must be stripped of secrecy .
They argue that lending to directors , the watchdogs of management , must be revealed so shareholders can gauge their independence .
And disclosure should be paramount for banks receiving government aid , said Ed Lawrence , a University of Missouri - St.
Louis finance professor and co-author of a 1989 study that was a rare look at insider lending .
Seven of the 10 banks with the largest insider loans received a total of more than $ 50 billion in the banking bailout late last year , according to a Charlotte Observer analysis of banks ' federal filings .
" It 's good for the public to know ... where the money is going , " Lawrence said .
" When you start taking public money , we hold them to a much higher standard . "
The majority of the nation 's 8,000 - plus banks make insider loans , some very small .
At the end of last year , banks had $ 41 billion of insider loans , up 5.7 percent from a year earlier , according to The Charlotte Observer 's analysis .
Insider loans accounted for less than 2 percent of the banks ' assets , amounts that are generally unlikely to seriously damage banks if the loans go sour .
The loans tend to make up a larger percentage of business for smaller banks .
Not all large banks are big insider lenders .
Wells Fargo , for example , was about the size of Wachovia before the San Francisco bank swooped up the wounded Charlotte institution late last year .
Wells ended last year with $ 20 million of insider loans , a fraction of Wachovia 's $ 747 million .
Neither bank would discuss the disparity .
Most publicly traded companies were banned from making insider loans in 2002 , part of the regulatory rush following the collapse of Enron and other accounting scandals .
But banks were excluded from the ban , partly because they 're in the business of lending and also because the loans have been subject to extensive regulation for more than 25 years .
The loans were blamed for bank problems during the nation 's S&L crisis .
Lawrence and others have linked insider lending to bank failures .
In December , the chairman of a large Irish bank resigned after revelations he had $ 109 million of secretive insider loans .
In January , the government seized the Dublin bank .
" Studies of bank failures have found that insider abuse , including excessive or poor quality loans made ... is often a contributing factor to the failure , " says the " Insider Activities " handbook from the Comptroller of the Currency , the lead regulator for big national banks .
Banks can be hurt by even the perception of insider favoritism , the guide says .
" We do n't have a difficulty with insider loans when they 're properly written and extended , " said Ray Grace , the North Carolina deputy banking commissioner who heads bank supervision for state - chartered firms .
" It makes a certain amount of sense that a director or bank officer take that business to their own bank rather than shop it to a competitor . "
A key requirement is that insider loans be on the same terms as those to similar outsiders .
" This is a highly scrutinized area , so usually any problems would be caught early , " said Mindy West , a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
chief whose job includes crafting instructions for bank examiners .
Large banks , such as Bank of America , have regulatory officials on site .
Smaller banks are typically examined every 12 to 18 months .
Regulatory officials request insider loan details for review prior to their regular bank examinations , West said .
The FDIC has regulatory authority over about 5,100 banks .
New loans and increases in existing loans are especially likely to be scrutinized , West said .
And a loan balance that doubled would probably trigger a second look .
Longtime governance expert Charles Elson does n't advocate banning insider loans , although he was startled the loans can run into hundreds of millions .
But , he said , banks need to make full disclosure , revealing names , amounts and terms .
He is especially concerned about disclosure for loans to directors and their interests .
" Management , who can dictate the terms of the loan , are being overseen by the director who is a beneficiary , " said Elson , who is director of the University of Delaware 's Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance .
" It compromises the director 's ability to be objective . "
As borrowers , directors might be less rigorous when evaluating the CEO or other executives , he said .
They might be unwilling to buck management when approving deals .
Wachovia 's board approved its 2006 acquisition of mortgage lender Golden West Financial , a vote that ultimately helped push the bank near collapse .
Shortly before that approval , the bank had $ 1.47 billion in insider lending .
Fifteen borrowers held the largest loans .
Banks are n't required to disclose details of past lending so there 's no way to identify those borrowers .
At the end of 2008 , all of the bank 's $ 747 million in insider loans were held by directors or their companies , said Julia Bernard , a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo , which bought Wachovia last year .
Five borrowers held the largest loans .
Bernard said most of the loans were made before 2008 .
Wachovia 's former chairman and longtime director , Lanty Smith , did not respond to two calls for comment .
Nel Minow , co-founder of The Corporate Library , said directors should take their business elsewhere if they are n't comfortable with disclosure .
" Do you want them as directors or do you want them as customers ? " she said .
" To the extent there 's even the perception of conflict of interest , it 's very important for them to be very transparent . "

THIS crisis has brought a burst of creativity in the development of indicators of pain , from the subprime implode - o - meter to the downgrade - o- meter for structured securities .
Perhaps it is time for the outrage - o- meter .
Its needle would have jumped off the scale this week as America 's public , politicians and media huffed and puffed over the $ 165 m in bonuses paid to members of the financial - products division that brought down American International Group ( AIG ) .
Troubles in that unit have forced the government to bail out the giant insurer , so far to the tune of $ 173 billion .
AIG 's wayward eggheads are not the only ones squirming .
The affair is a test of the Obama administration 's handling of financial excess — and so far it has been ham - fisted .
After flip - flopping over whether it had the authority to meddle with employment contracts , the Treasury eventually seized on a clause in the recently passed stimulus bill that may allow it to retrieve payments deemed contrary to the public interest .
Tim Geithner , the treasury secretary , promised to recoup the money by deducting some of it from the next $ 30 billion tranche of aid for the company .
This is unlikely to assuage critics .
The employees get to keep the bonuses while AIG is deprived of funds that were supposedly essential to keeping it afloat .
The government 's back and forth has also damaged the credibility of the Federal Reserve , which has lent heavily to AIG and was aware of the bonuses several weeks ago .
Mr Geithner 's hand was forced by an increasingly hysterical Congress .
Charles Grassley , a senior Republican , set the tone by suggesting that AIG executives apologise Japanese - style , first bowing and then perhaps committing suicide .
The language was no less salty at a congressional hearing on AIG on March 18th , at which the firm 's chief executive , Edward Liddy , faced a rough ride despite being in the job only a few months and working for a salary of $ 1 .
As the uproar grew , lawmakers began crafting bills that would impose taxes of up to 100 % on the bonuses .
Andrew Cuomo , New York 's hyperactive attorney - general , entered the fray , slapping subpoenas on the firm and muttering about possible fraud .
His office stoked public ire by revealing that 73 employees had received over $ 1 m , and that $ 57 m of its “ retention ” payments were earmarked for staff it planned to lay off .
At the hearing , Mr Liddy said he had asked all those who received more than $ 100,000 to give back at least half , and that some — no doubt motivated by death threats and the unwelcome attention of paparazzi — had offered to return the full amount .
But he also worried that they would leave AIG , making it harder to manage the toxic financial - products business .
Shocking though the bonuses have been , they pale in comparison with the $ 49.5 billion of payments that AIG has made to counterparties in its disastrous foray into credit - default swaps — many of them foreign banks ( see chart ) .
This was no accident : it was precisely bailing out these trading partners that the government viewed as necessary to avoid a systemic meltdown .
Still , the transfers — including almost $ 13 billion to Goldman Sachs , making it , as one newspaper put it , a “ charity case ” — are likely to receive more scrutiny as the bonus storm subsides .
The furore over AIG is awkward for the new administration in several ways .
First , it makes it harder to pin responsibility for botched financial rescues on the Bush team .
The new lot could have nipped the bonus fiasco in the bud .
It also leaves Mr Obama walking a fine line between convincing the public that he shares their sense of outrage while also possibly pressing for more rescue funds .
The government 's best guess is that another $ 750 billion could be needed .
Insurers are clamouring for funds too .
But bail - out fatigue is growing .
The hearing 's chairman , Paul Kanjorski , suggested that the AIG mess could force Congress to reconsider any future largesse .
It does not help that Mr Geithner 's star is falling .
His failure to get ahead of the problems at AIG follows his botched unveiling of a bank - rescue plan .
Regaining his credibility will depend on the success of two new schemes : one to boost consumer lending by reviving securitisation , and another to remove toxic assets from banks ( details of which are expected any day ) .
Here , too , the government faces a balancing act : it needs to make the terms attractive enough to bring in private buyers , but not so attractive that they invite more political fireworks .
Another risk is that restrictions placed on firms that receive public money backfire .
Banks are responding to new executive - bonus limits by increasing salaries .
This “ flies in the face of making pay more performance - related , ” says Pearl Meyer of Steven Hall & Partners , a consultancy .
Chafing under restrictions on their activities , recipients of funds from the previous government 's Troubled Asset Relief Programme are scrambling to repay them early .
This may cheer taxpayers , but the withdrawal of capital may also hurt lending .
No wonder Mr Obama is keen to move the debate on .
The focus now , he said on March 18th , should be on giving the government the tools to prevent a repeat : resolution authority over non-banks , similar to the power the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has to shake up sick banks .
Mr Liddy , meanwhile , will be urged to earn his dollar by disposing of AIG 's assets and cutting the group 's vast debt to the taxpayer .
Such deals have so far proved elusive .
This week 's brouhaha is unlikely to make the task easier .

Rodney Waller , a senior vice president at the oil and gas company Range Resources , called the expected surge in liquefied natural gas imports part of a “ pile on ” of problems including plummeting demand , prices and credit besetting companies that stretched their exploration and production budgets in recent years to meet expanding demand .
“ Any time you push the price down , you push down the ability of U.S. independents to add reserves and production domestically , ” he said .
He warned that some small and midsize oil and gas companies “ with debt that are in trouble now will simply get pushed over the brink . ”
Natural gas is becoming a world commodity like oil .
It is still loosely connected to world oil benchmark prices and its price , usually set by longer - term contracts everywhere except for the United States and Britain , can diverge widely from one continent to another .
Until the last few years , liquefied natural gas was a high - priced necessity for countries that did not produce their own gas supplies or have access to piped reserves ; but it now has become a cheap economic driver for countries like Japan with few energy resources .
But as more terminals have been built , the amount of gas that is shipped from one continent to another in giant tankers has climbed .
And now the emergence of the global market in gas is about to take a giant leap .
The global capacity for liquefied natural gas exports of 200 million tons a year will increase by 25 percent with the completion of six new plants in Qatar , Russia , Indonesia and Yemen , totaling $ 48 billion in investments , and the upgrading of a seventh plant in Malaysia .
National energy companies in those countries , assisted by ExxonMobil , Total , BP and Shell , rushed construction of those projects in recent years to satisfy the mushrooming appetite for energy around the world .
More large plants are due on line in 2010 and 2011 .
“ We had many years of ever increasing demand so the world geared up for that , but what the world did not prepare for was an economic recession that is global in scope and in impact , ” said Darcel L. Hulse , president and chief executive officer of Sempra LNG , a division of Sempra Energy that operates an import terminal in Mexico and is completing construction on a facility in Louisiana .
“ That is what has exacerbated the imbalance of supply and demand to such an excess . ”
It takes a lot in 2009 to drop your jaw upon looking at the front page of a newspaper — one now fairly shrugs at the laundry list of crippling economic news — but last Friday , a particular New York Times story leapt out as if it were headlined in neon : “ Bloomberg Campaigners Taste the High Life . ”
In a different set of circumstances — the financial world spinning on its axis since last summer instantly defined a new modern era and no one who ’s honest really knows how long it ’ll last — the report of Michael Bloomberg lavishing his aides and campaign workers with first - class hotel accommodations , private jet travel , dinner parties with celebrities and large bonuses would be a ho -hummer .
I happen to think Nanny - State Bloomberg is a priggish and sanctimonious mayor , but spending his own fortune on elections is a virtue , and gives a well - deserved poke in the eyes of myopic and now ( after President Obama ’s campaign ) anachronistic proponents of campaign finance “ reform . ”
Nevertheless , you have to marvel at Bloomberg ’s outlandish and arrogant demonstration of tone - deaf politics , considering that as he grapples with a $ 4 billion deficit by laying off cops and education employees , raising the city sales tax , trimming health care packages for NYC workers and imposing regressive taxes on items like bottles of soda , lottery tickets and cab rides , he ’s running for a third term as if the country and his city were in the midst of unparalleled prosperity .
When asked by a Times reporter whether his projected $ 80 million reelection campaign was excessive , Bloomberg grew testy , responding , “ I do n’t understand your question .
I am not going to talk about the campaign …
I think it ’s one of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard . ”
Add in that a lot of New Yorkers are ticked off that Bloomberg reversed the two - term limit to extend his tenure , and it ’ll make for an entertaining diversion this coming summer as “ let them eat sushi ” Mayor Mike squares off against a challenger whose campaign coffers will be slight in comparison .
An acquaintance , a professor in New York who requested anonymity , emailed this comment last weekend : “ Mayor Mike needs new glasses to read the new electoral charts .
This is a very dangerous high roll he ’s making .
There ’s already resentment here that he ’s running for a third term , and [ this story ] fails to dispel a sense of bottomless political narcissism .
It ’s fun being mayor , but not if you make your customers feel bad or poor or weaponless . ”
As the recession ( or depression , depending on whom you speak to ) continues unabated this year it ’s possible that Bloomberg , the self - made billionaire , will understand that a Culture of Austerity has overtaken the United States , mostly driven by necessity but also because of manners and fear of ostracism .
Coupon - clipping ( the 50 cents - off kind , not accumulation of old - money stock dividends ) is in fashion , with no stigma attached .
Granted , for families of limited means this sort of savings is nothing new — when I was a kid , my mother was ferocious clipper , and drove to five different supermarkets to redeem her discount offers — but it ’s transcended class lines .
A few weeks ago , after a temporary thaw caused an outside water pipe to burst at our home , resulting in a small flood in the basement , I made two calls .
The first was to 1 - 800 - GOT JUNK to clear out the impossible morass of boxes and other discards in the basement , which made mopping up the water nearly impossible , and I rummaged through my desk for a $ 10 coupon the company gives each time you use their service .
The second call was to Roto - Rooter , and when the fellow fixed the pipe , I gave him a $ 25 online rebate that was awarded from the last time the company came to the house .
I ’m somewhat embarrassed to admit that even a year ago I would n’t have bothered to look for the coupons .
Likewise , last weekend , I took my older son — growing out of his clothes way too fast — downtown to Brooks Bros .
where a 60 percent off sale was in progress .
Along with a $ 60 rebate I ’d earned by using the store ’s credit card , the three sweaters he chose came to less than $ 80 .
A longtime friend of mine , who owns several moderately - priced yet stylish cafes in Baltimore — it ’s a nightmare for all restaurants , he reminds me , save for the fast - food joints — says that almost no one orders filet mignon anymore .
When he asked a regular and quite affluent customer why she chose a simple pasta dish over the fresh fish of the day , she told him it was simply a matter of guilt , that it did n’t seem right to indulge in luxury items such as prime beef , tuna steak or foie gras .
The travel agent ( another line of work that ’s nearly extinct because of the Internet ) I use , out of habit and friendship , says that last summer clients had booked March vacations way in advance because traditionally it ’s impossible to secure reservations after the first of the year .
Unfortunately for many , rocked by the financial events of the fall , the airfare and hotel slots they secured in July are non-refundable ; in addition , they ’ll be taking a vacation at a half - filled resort .
I come armed with no excuses for the Wall Street mercenaries who gamed a lax system and crossed over from a “ gray line ” to unethical and sometimes criminal behavior , but let ’s be truthful and admit that the “ greed ” almost solely ascribed to the financial industry was widespread , including members of the lionized “ Main Street ” community .
A grifter is a grifter is a grifter : whether it ’s a celebrity con like Bernie Madoff or a small - time repairman asking for payment in cash so he does n’t have to report earnings to the I.R.S .
Which is why , of course , Barack Obama has felt the heat for the cabinet nominations of tax - skimmers Tom Daschle and Tim Geithner ( the Treasury Secretary ! ) .
In the case of Daschle , it was the veil of hubris and entitlement , probably yet unforgivably unconscious , that he enjoyed because he was “ protected , ” being near the top of the government food chain for so long .
Incredibly , the Times ’ Democratic apologist Frank Rich last Sunday excused Daschle ’s “ tax shortfall ” as an “ apparently honest mistake , ” although he agreed it was imperative , given the tenor of the crisis , that he be sacrificed .
Let ’s inject some reality here : Daschle ’s not a dumb man , and someone who ’s grown wealthy as a lobbyist obviously has a top accountant ( or three ) file his returns each year .
Michael Bloomberg is not a subtle man , and it ’s unlikely he ’ll deviate from his successful strategy of extraordinary spending in this fall ’s campaign .
The real question is whether New Yorkers , the vast majority of whom are worse off financially since the Mayor last ran in ‘ 05 , will punish him at the polls for being so incredibly out of touch .
I ’m sure I ’ve posted this before but I ’m too lazy to go look for it and besides , it still makes me laugh .
A lot .

In a recent survey , barely half of a self - selecting sample of UK teachers who use the webcast service Teachers ' TV disagreed with the idea that " creationism or intelligent design should be given the same status as evolution in the classroom " .
Some 87.9 per cent of respondents thought that it was appropriate to discuss religious matters in science classes if pupils brought them up .
Andrew Bethell , head of Teachers ' TV , commented :
“ The debate on whether there is a place for the teaching of creationism in the classroom is still fierce .
Although over half ( 50.4 per cent ) of teachers either disagreed or strongly disagreed with the idea that creationism should be given the same status as evolution , there is a significant minority who believe that it should be given equal weight .
“ Perhaps most telling is the fact that , almost 9 out of 10 teachers take the pragmatic view that they should be allowed to discuss creationism or intelligent design in science , if pupils raise the question . ”
The survey was carried out by emailing 10,600 people signed up to the Teachers ' TV website , of whom 1,210 responded .
The government - funded quango webcast channel ( which also broadcasts on satellite and cable , and has a two - hour Freeview slot ) believes that " 95 per cent of [ the respondents ] are teachers and the remaining 5 per cent work in the wider education workforce " .
Presumably this means that 1,149 - and - a- half of the respondents identified themselves as teachers .
Anyway .
UK government guidelines state that :
Creationism and intelligent design are not part of the science national curriculum programmes of study and should not be taught as science .
Fully 29 per cent of those responding to the email survey disagreed or strongly disagreed with this , says Teachers ' TV .
It 's worth noting that excluding theological discussion from science classes does n't exclude it from school .
Quite apart from science , schools are legally required to teach " religious education " .
Parents are permitted to withdraw their kids from RE , but few do .
These periods might easily be seen as the appropriate venue for kids to discuss theological matters .
" The debate on whether there is a place for the teaching of creationism in the classroom , " which Mr Bethell believes still to be firecely underway , was in fact settled long ago as a matter of law .
There is such a place - just not in the science classroom .
Nor the maths one , or the English one , or the gym , or wherever else some kid - or teacher - might want to bring up the subject of religion .
They should wait for the religion class .
It would appear , however , that of the one in ten possible teachers on the Teachers ' TV spam list who could be bothered to answer , around a third either do n't know about RE , think that there is n't enough of it in the timetable , or are genuine science - denying lunatics .
The Teachers ' TV release is headed " nearly a third of teachers agree that creationism or intelligent design should be given the same status as evolution in the classroom " .
All the webcasters actually know for sure , however , is that about 3 per cent of the people they spammed think that .
Much though we enjoy a witchhunt against silly corduroys as much as the next man , this is thin stuff .
Teachers are sometimes untrustworthy , but media quangocrats are a lot worse .
There 's more from the Guardian here , and from Teachers ' TV here . ®
( CNN ) --
Fate , police say , saved baby Grace from being tossed out with the trash .
Baby Grace was born aboard a Pacific Blue flight to New Zealand from Samoa .
Were it not for a cleaning lady who chanced upon the newborn waving a feeble arm from a blue trash bag in an airplane bathroom , Grace would have met the fate her mother apparently intended for her , authorities said .
On Wednesday , police in New Zealand charged the 29 - year - old woman with abandonment and assault -- for giving birth to the child on an international flight and then leaving her , without alerting anyone , in a toilet bin amid bloodied paper towels .
The woman , whose name was not released , faces up to seven years in prison if convicted .
The case has made headlines in the island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean .
The woman is a kiwi fruit picker who was returning from Samoa when she walked off a Pacific Blue flight in Auckland on Thursday , reported the New Zealand Press Association , a cooperative of the country 's newspapers .
Watch more on incident
About 20 minutes later , a cleaning lady discovered the baby in a restroom inside the Boeing 737 .
Her fellow custodians wrapped the baby in a blanket and handed her to authorities .
About the same time , police spotted the mother in the airport , " looking pale and bloodstained " after she said she had mislaid her passport , said TV New Zealand , a CNN affiliate .
Su'a William Sio , a Kiwi lawmaker of Samoan descent , said cultural stigma and the shame of bearing a child out of wedlock were two reasons why a mother might abandon her child .
" This is mostly derived firstly by fear , " he told the New Zealand Herald newspaper .
" Fear that they 've done something wrong and fear of shame of the ' unmarried ' mother bringing to the family . "
Grace did not suffer significant injuries or long - term damage , police told reporters .
She is in the care of government officials who are looking at long - term arrangements that would be best for her .

NEW YORK 
One of the most intriguing , and potentially important , interviews of the week will take place Thursday night without either a journalist or a newsmaker .
Fans of finance and entertainment are salivating to see how CNBC's Jim Cramer holds up when he appears on Comedy Central 's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart .
The host of Mad Money likely will have to provide the No. 1 business news network 's most pointed defense yet against criticisms that , during the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , it has been too hard on President Obama 's stimulus package and too soft on CEOs .
Cramer also will have to answer for misguided stock predictions — including some last year urging investors to buy and hold Bear Stearns just before the investment bank collapsed .
" Here 's a guy who may have his career on the line , " says Bob Gold of public relations firm Bob Gold & Associates .
" His credibility has been brought into question .
NBC Universal ( CNBC 's parent ) will have to draw a line .
Trust is at stake . "
CNBC , which celebrates its 20th anniversary on April 17 , says that its journalism has held up well .
" I do n't think we 've pitched a perfect game , " President Mark Hoffman says .
" But it 's a one - hitter or two - hitter . "
Cramer and Stewart declined to be interviewed for this story .
Stewart has used comedy to lead the charge against CNBC following a fiery Feb. 19 on - air attack on Obama 's stimulus package by On - Air Editor Rick Santelli .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs kicked things off by chiding Santelli , who referred to people who can't pay their mortgages as " losers . "
Santelli's performance surprised some business news veterans .
" An opinionated outburst by a presumably objective reporter is out of place in a news context , " says former CNN analyst Myron Kandel .
Hoffman , however , says , " That is Rick .
The only thing that 's new is that it was noticed in a more profound way . "
Stewart 's toughest attack came on March 4 , after Santelli canceled a scheduled appearance on the show .
An 8 ½ minute segment stitched together clips showing CNBC personalities , including Cramer , dismissing problems at AIG and the market , and listening to CEO assurances that things were just fine .
That included an interview with Allen Stanford , who federal officials allege ran a Ponzi scheme .
Cramer later dismissed Stewart on the Today show .
" Oh , oh , a comedian is attacking me ! " he said .
" Wow !
He runs a variety show ! "
But some media critics say that Stewart has earned the right to be taken seriously .
" Stewart is a comedian who does some press criticism and does it pretty well , " says Columbia Journalism Review Executive Editor Mike Hoyt .
Andrew Leckey , president of the National Center for Business Journalism at Arizona State University , says that while CNBC wants to be seen as serious , " The best ratings go to a wacky guy . "
Cramer often bellows and uses sound effects to highlight his stock picks .
The passion on CNBC also may reflect the discomfort some commentators feel as Obama 's policies challenge long - held beliefs .
" There 's something serious going on at CNBC , " says independent news analyst Andrew Tyndall .
" It 's not just show . "
The controversy comes at an uncomfortable moment for the channel .
Ad revenue , which leapt 24 % to $ 261 million in 2008 , will fall 9 % this year , SNL Kagan 's Derek Baine forecasts .
CNBC 's audience also likely will fall from its 2008 average of 229,000 homes — its best performance in years .
EXCLUSIVE :
Uzi Arad , who is expected to serve as national security adviser in the next Israeli government , has been barred from entering the United States for nearly two years on the grounds that he is an intelligence risk .
Mr. Arad , a former member and director of intelligence for the Mossad , Israel ’s spy service , is mentioned in the indictment of Lawrence Franklin , a former Pentagon analyst who pleaded guilty in 2005 to providing classified information about Iran in a conversation with two employees of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
Beyond Mr. Arad ’s status , Prime Minister - designate Benjamin Netanyahu is likely to face difficulties abroad because of his choice , announced Monday , of Avigdor Lieberman to serve as foreign minister in a narrow new rightist government .
Mr. Lieberman , head of the Israel Is Our Home party , has advocated requiring Israel ’s 1.46 million Arabs to take a loyalty test or risk expulsion .
The choice of Mr. Arad for national security adviser has been reported in the Israeli press and was confirmed by sources close to Mr. Netanyahu , who has been tasked with forming the next government .
Mr. Arad acknowledged to The Washington Times that he has not been able to obtain a visa to come to the United States but said the Israeli government is trying to change that .
“ The director general of the Israel Foreign Ministry did tell his American counterparts that there has been no cause to deny me a visa , ” Mr. Arad told The Times .
Israeli and U.S. officials said Mr. Arad has been denied a U.S. visa since June 2007 under section 212 3 ( a ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act .
This gives consular officers and the Justice Department authority to bar people who may seek “ to violate any law of the United States relating to espionage or sabotage ” from entering the country .
Mr. Arad was a member of the Mossad spy service from 1975 to 1997 .
After retiring , he became Mr. Netanyahu ’s foreign policy adviser .
While in the Mossad , Mr. Arad worked mainly on analysis , but he also served as a liaison for intelligence operations with allied services such as the CIA .
In the past 21 months , prominent Israelis and Americans have quietly but unsuccessfully pressed U.S. officials to grant Mr. Arad a visa .
“ Overtures were made , and , by and large , there was not a satisfactory answer , ” said Herb London , president of the Hudson Institute , where Mr. Arad worked from 1972 to 1975 after obtaining a doctorate from Princeton University .
“ He has invited luminaries from around the world to talk about foreign policy at the annual Herzliya conference , ” Mr. London said .
“ There are people from the left and the right who recognize that he has extraordinary insight into the foreign policy issues of our time . ”
In a June 18 , 2007 , letter to U.S. officials , the president of the Interdisciplinary Center at Herzliya , Uriel Reichman , wrote , “ I very much hope that such visa will indeed be granted as expeditiously as possible since professor Arad ’s travels to the United States are essential for his work at the Interdisciplinary Center . ”
One mystery about Mr. Arad ’s difficulties in obtaining a visa is that Mr. Franklin did not plead guilty to spying .
Indeed , the U.S. attorney handling the case against Mr. Franklin and two former AIPAC employees , Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman , charged all three men with mishandling national defense information , a count listed in the U.S. code under the Espionage Act but less serious than being an agent of a foreign power .
Mr. Rosen and Mr. Weissman are fighting the charges , which are controversial because they are the first private citizens to be accused of leaking classified information .
The indictment against Mr. Franklin makes two references to “ a person previously associated with an intelligence agency of [ foreign official ’s ] country . ”
Two former U.S. officials and a former Israeli official have confirmed that Mr. Arad is the “ person . ”
The passage refers to a meeting between Mr. Franklin and Mr. Arad on Feb. 20 , 2004 , at the Pentagon cafeteria and an earlier recommendation by an Israeli diplomat that Mr. Franklin meet with Mr. Arad .
In his letter , Mr. Reichman referenced the section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that deals with espionage issues , saying , “ it being absolutely certain to me and to all who know him , that none of the causes specified … apply to him . ”
A Washington immigration lawyer , Glen Wasserstein , said Mr. Arad was being barred under the section of law that “ allows the government to deny entry to those foreign nationals it deems as spies or saboteurs , and those who help or assist in such spying or sabotage . ”
Mr. Wasserstein said the president or attorney general could waive the restriction on the visa .
Buck Revell , a former associate director of the FBI who oversaw counterintelligence investigations at the bureau , added that as national security adviser , Mr. Arad would not be in a position to engage in espionage or intelligence activities .
Nonetheless , Mr. Revell said , the suspicion surrounding Mr. Arad could hamper U.S. - Israel relations .
“ The [ Israeli ] national security council chairman has access to all of Israel ’s intelligence and all the intelligence we share with them , normally , ” Mr. Revell said .
“ Whether or not our agencies would restrict any type of intelligence from going to him would be very problematic .
That is something they will have to deal with . ”
A senior official of the incoming Netanyahu administration , who spoke on the condition that he not be named because of the sensitivity of the issue , told The Times that he expects Mr. Arad to be able to travel to the United States for official business .
“ This is an issue that the new government of Israel trusts can be resolved , ” the official said .

Ground zero of the economic depression is the banking system — worldwide .
The system is collapsed , exploded , demolished , gone , ruined , kaput .
The global banking system was a house of cards , and it has fallen .
Governments and central banks everywhere do not yet realize this .
They are attempting to rebuild the house from the pieces and scraps scattered far and wide .
Better to salvage the pieces that still work and use them in an entirely new system than attempt to rebuild this one on the same cracked foundation and along the same flawed lines that produced this wreck .
It was a flimsy and jerry - rigged house that regulation built — it was built on the government regulation of money and banking .
This was the house built by central banks , forced currencies , inconvertible currencies , manipulated currencies , monopoly money , deposit insurance , the IMF , paper reserves , and inept regulation ; all linked into government control of economies , welfare states , and managed trade .
And now incredibly costly repairs are being attempted .
This was the house that neared collapse before but was always saved despite itself by the ability of businesses to bring back economies from their banking - produced wrecks .
This time matters are different .
Attempts are being made to energize the system into a new orbit .
We are seeing a quantum leap as governments , central banks , and major businesses all become intertwined at orbital levels that erase the distinction between private and public .
The new orbit is even less stable than the old one .
It promises a system in which the line between central banks and governments is blurred .
It is a system in which these two institutions directly influence and control bank managements and lending .
If they lacked the capabilities to regulate the system they created , they surely lack the capabilities to manage it .
The result will be inefficient fascism presiding over a system that bends to the political forces and whims of its masters .
If current trends persist , this is the system Americans will be living and suffering under .
It may take such severe knocks on the head before the pendulum swings back to the free market , as it will when people experience the deprivations of fascism .
Large social groups are slow learners with short memories .
Government after government , and this includes the federal government of the U.S. , has shown itself incapable of controlling bank lending while simultaneously mandating a single national currency and insuring bank deposits .
Banks are always one or more steps ahead of regulators , or else obtain concessions that allow them to take on inordinate risks .
Central banks and governments are always all too ready to encourage banks to make marginal and risky loans .
Banks are always all too ready to count on central banks to alleviate their risk - taking and errors .
They are all too ready to seek profit in ways that take on more risk .
They are all too ready to borrow far too much , receive short - term deposits and make long - term loans , and borrow in domestic currencies while lending in foreign currencies .
Banks are all too prone to lend on collateral that is inflated in price due to central - bank created speculative bubbles .
Banks are all too ready to take inordinate risks using insured deposits .
The government - regulated banks are all too ready to destabilize themselves and the entire economic system .
Regulators are all too slow to identify and control banking behavior .
This does not mean that they should control banks , or that they should bring in new controls and regulations to rebuild the house .
The very opposite is the case .
The failed government banking system rests on a basic false assumption .
The idea prevails that government regulators should control money and banking because the market cannot .
That idea is entirely false .
The notion of a free market in money and banking needs to be sharply distinguished from the government - regulated system that is now prevalent throughout the globe .
In a market system , individual banks that provide loans and create deposits and that issue their own bank notes , cannot long survive without prudent policies .
The market discipline operates continuously and mercilessly .
Individual banks in a free market system cannot issue bank notes that have value unless at the same time they have assets that back those notes .
The market will not accept pieces of paper that lack anything behind them .
The promise to redeem notes in something of undisputed value ( like silver and gold ) provides customers with the assurance that the bank actually has these assets .
In the existing government and central banking system , this discipline is absent .
Banks that are in a central bank system do not issue their own notes , so that there is no pricing of their currencies .
The notes of the central bank are forced on everyone at nominal par value .
A central bank and its associated member banks can multiply notes indefinitely .
In a market system , if a bank over - issues , or makes bad loans , or makes loans that endanger its ability to meet deposit withdrawals , its notes depreciate in the market place .
This induces people to present the notes for redemption .
If the bank is not to experience a bank run , it must heed the market price of its notes .
It can not allow them to depreciate in price .
It has to prevent over - issue , carefully make and monitor loans , and watch deposit withdrawals .
The solution to the central banking system is free markets in money and banking .
There is no quicker or more effective regulation than that of the market , which means the people who are using bank notes as currency and the banks that are competing to issue this currency .
The current U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate the gold content of the dollar .
This means that Congress has power to control what is called the unit of account .
In a true competitive system , there would be competing units of account .
However , a system in which the dollar is fixed at a certain weight in gold is workable .
It means that all prices that are in terms of dollars are actually in terms of a fixed weight of gold .
Insofar as gold has a value that remains relatively stable , prices will remain relatively stable .
In a free money and banking system , there need not be a single medium of exchange .
If individual banks issue their own notes , there can arise several media of exchange .
If individual companies and persons can issue their own notes , there can arise even more possible media of exchange .
Furthermore , there need not be a single medium of redemption .
Notes can be redeemed in a great many things that have value .
These are matters to be decided in free markets .
The path the U.S. is on is toward an ever - more centralized and government - controlled financial system in which capital is allocated by the government .
This system leads inevitably to suppressed inflation .
It leads to government attempts to control capital movements .
It is a deadly step backwards to the fascism of the 1930s and the Nazi methods of economic control .
Just as partial collapse encourages more authority being exercised at the center , complete collapse of the banking system and / or economy is likely to engender even more of such police state methods as long as people maintain their faith in government as savior and doer of all good .
Militarism becomes more likely in such situations too .
The only way to avoid these dire outcomes is to move toward a free market in money and banking .
Unfortunately , the Bush - Obama policies are doing the opposite , and in response to the financial problems of banks they ’ve been at it for two years now .
A large amount needs to be done by legislators to dismantle regulations that are preventing a new money and banking system from arising .
The immediate need is to encourage a rival and entirely deregulated system that lies outside federal and state control .
Given the chance , such a system would arise speedily .
There is plenty of existing case law to govern its activities without having the massive overlay of federal and state regulations and laws that are now in place .
Federal and state authorities should immediately encourage new banks to be chartered by any group or company that wants to establish them .
They should be allowed to issue their own bank notes and credit in order to form a new alternative banking system .
New banks can mobilize the immense amounts of money now locked up in money market accounts and Treasury bills .
New banks can take over consumer loans , auto loans , and mortgage loans from older banks .
Credit need not be interrupted .
Monetary freedom will produce an immediate alleviation of unemployment .
When any company or any group can easily form a bank and create credits as well as possible currencies , then new prices for goods and factors can come into existence .
Then it will be feasible and profitable to seek new ways to employ the currently unemployed people and resources .
The profit possibilities are very great when large numbers of people and resources go unemployed .
Unemployment would never happen on a widespread and continuing basis in a free market economy that has monetary freedom .
The economy would rapidly adjust to what shocks there were that did occur .
The existing hardships and misery are directly attributable to the lack of monetary freedom that we now have .
Existing banks that are failing should be allowed to fail .
The FED and Treasury should stop expanding their programs immediately .
They should immediately begin to contract them .
They can dispose of their loans to new banks and investors who may be willing to take them .
The FED should terminate the TALF program that it is just now starting up .
The TARP program should be repealed .
Basically , the actions of the last two years need to be reversed as soon as possible .
All bailouts should cease .
They encourage failing institutions to keep on operating , and they impose massive losses on taxpayers .
Troubled and failing banks can be restructured using the FDIC , so that credit interruptions are mitigated and insured depositors left whole .
The federal authorities should immediately encourage the FDIC to facilitate the merger of existing branches and good assets of failed banks into sound banks that are willing to take them over .
This will maintain intact the ability of insured depositors to access their accounts .
The regulatory authorities should encourage the restructuring of unsound banks in other ways , such as by spin - off , sale of divisions , sale of subsidiaries , sale of product lines , and sale of assets .
The bad loans should be auctioned off in the market as soon as possible for whatever they will bring .
There are many pools of investment money that will bid for these packages of loans .
The U.S. has established bankruptcy laws and procedures .
In some cases , banks may choose bankruptcy and maintain their operations while under court supervision .
This too will maintain the integrity of insured deposits .
Banks , insurers , and other firms that are near bankruptcy will choose that path when they realize that the bailouts are over .
Credit through the capital markets offers another alternative to credit from new banks , merged banks , and restructured banks .
Businesses can obtain credit and capital from investors directly without the intermediation of banks .
To facilitate robust capital markets , the Congress needs to revisit and repeal a number of acts passed during the New Deal and after and since amended .
In particular , the Securities and Exchange Act should be repealed .
These channels will work far better if business prospects stabilize .
The federal government should immediately freeze its new intrusions into the economy .
The Obama administration ’s announcements on tax policies , health policies , energy policies , and bailout policies are shocking the economy on a daily basis and de-stabilizing capital flows .
Naturally , these suggestions barely scratch the surface of what needs to be done to create a free market economy with a free market money and banking system that will not be subject to the kind of devastation we are now seeing .
Clearly , there is no national vision at present to accomplish measures like these .
Nevertheless , at some point in the future and in some ways that cannot now be envisaged , this political economy will go through changes that will reduce national and state control and increase the presence of free markets .
This will happen because the injustice , waste , and damage caused by government control and regulation will no longer be tolerated as a social consensus .
The profit opportunities from a free market system will become so large and attractive that society will move in that direction .
We will pass from one era to another .
The house that regulation built will become a relic .
It may even be seen as the barbarous relic that it is .
The Best of Michael S. Rozeff
A reader writes :
Someone should make the point that the theory on which Daschle did not pay taxes on an extraordinary non-salary benefit provided by his employer ( car and driver ) is exactly the theory on which Palin did not pay taxes on an extraordinary benefit ( free air travel for her children , and 60 dollar per day per diem payments for use of her own house ) .
Palin never paid back taxes but simply produced a squirrelly letter from her lawyers saying that someone could believe in good faith that taxes were not owed on the travel or per diems she received , so her failure to report those items as income was excusable .
A county district attorney in Pennsylvania has threatened to file felony child pornography charges against three teenage girls for pictures that they took of themselves , even though the girls ' lawyers say the pictures are clearly not sexually explicit and do not meet the legal definition of child porn .
The American Civil Liberties Union has countered by asking a federal judge to block District Attorney George Skumanick from filing charges .
Skumanick wo n't show the pictures to anyone , including the girls ' lawyers , but according to the reported descriptions , one picture shows two of the girls flashing the peace sign in their bras , and the other picture shows a girl wrapped in a towel with her breasts exposed after stepping out of the shower .
Unless there 's something very significant being deliberately left out of those descriptions , it sounds pretty obvious that the pictures do not meet the definition of child pornography , which requires sexual explicitness , not just nudity .
Skumanick may even sound like a buffoon for threatening to prosecute the girls over those pictures , but his overreaching is probably an example of the " context syndrome " that I referred to in writing about a Wikipedia article about a CD showing a naked underage girl on the cover .
In that article , I wrote :
Suppose you read a news article about a man who was arrested for possession of child pornography , and you happened to see a sample of the images ( never mind how ) that he was arrested for .
And suppose the Virgin Killer album cover photo had been mixed in with those images .
Would it have jumped out at you as an obvious case of over - reaching by the police ?
In other words , even an obviously legal photo might seem illegal when it 's mixed in with a group of photos that constitute actual child porn .
According to the AP , Skumanick 's office first found the photos in question after confiscating students ' cell phones and rounding up 20 students accused of making or distributing the images found on the phones .
Some of those other photos were presumably racy enough to meet the definition of child pornography , and Skumanick probably just lumped in the bra and towel pictures into that category without thinking too much about it .
Giving him credit , if someone had come to his office and shown him the picture of the towel girl by itself and asked him to prosecute the girl for creating child pornography , he might have said that it did n't meet the legal definition .
But the " context syndrome " only excuses the initial mistake , and only partly .
By now , he 's had time to think about those particular pictures , and he knows that non-sexually - explicit photos do not constitute child pornography , so what is he doing ?
He claims that the girls in their bras were posed " provocatively " , but that 's not the same as sexual explicitness , and he has n't even made that claim about the towel picture , so unless there 's some bombshell piece of information about the photos that he 's still keeping secret ( and why would he ? ) , there 's no excuse for him not to drop the threats of prosecution right away .
But could even the initial mistake have been avoided ?
I think it could have , if you designed a scientific procedure for deciding , objectively , whether an image meets the legal definition of " child pornography " , by borrowing some of the principles used in police lineups .
Now , obviously one big difference between deciding if the right suspect has been identified in a lineup , and deciding whether an image constitutes child pornography , is that the question of a suspect 's identity in a lineup is a question about objective reality , while the question of whether an image is " child pornography " is a matter of opinion and consensus about an imprecisely defined English phrase , so it may sound odd to try and find a " scientifically objective " answer .
But by " objective " , I mean that the procedure should eliminate the influence of factors that are not relevant to the legal definition of child pornography ( for example , if asking someone to decide if they think a picture meets the definition , do n't tell them whether the photo was found in a pedophile 's basement or in a parent 's photo album , because under the strict legal definition , that should n't matter ) .
And by " scientific " , I mean that the Yes / No answers returned by the procedure should be repeatable as far as possible , so that different defendants are n't being tried under wildly different standards , where Bob is convicted of possessing an innocuous photo while Alice is acquitted even though she possessed a racier one .
A naive solution , from a scientific point of view , would be to poll a random sample of lawyers or other professionals in a police go - to database , and ask them to evaluate whether the picture is child pornography , without any information about where the picture came from .
These results would be objective ( if the respondents did n't know the source of the picture ) , and would generally be repeatable , if the sample size is large enough .
The problem with this method is that while all defendants would be held to the same standard , all citizens would not be .
Suppose the lawyers in the go - to list start to decide , as many of them probably would , that anybody who is being prosecuted for possessing a picture of a topless underage girl is probably a pedophile creep anyway , and would start voting " child pornography " for all but the most obviously legal pictures .
The prosecutor would realize this , and would know that they could threaten to ruin people 's lives by charging them with possession of child pornography because of pictures found in their possession -- even while other members of society possessed similar pictures without ever being charged .
Here 's where the analogy to a police lineup comes in .
Police lineups are supposed to include " known innocent " candidates in order to test the credibility of the eyewitness ; if the eyewitness selects a candidate who could not have possibly committed the crime ( because , for example , they were in jail ) , then the police know the eyewitness is not reliable .
( This was one guideline notoriously violated by District Attorney Mike Nifong in the Duke lacrosse team rape trial ; he assembled a lineup consisting only of lacrosse team members from the party , so that whomever the eyewitness identified was guaranteed to fall under a cloud of suspicion . )
In the same vein , the lawyers or other experts being consulted by the police could be shown a " lineup " of photos , consisting of several photos that were determined in advance to be legal ( either because of a prior court ruling , or perhaps just because the D.A. had declined to prosecute the photos on previous occasions ) , along with the photo whose legality was in question .
Ask the experts to pick which photo they think is closest to the definition of child pornography .
Unless most of them pick the photo that 's on trial , then that photo can't be said to be worse than any of the other photos that had already been deemed legal .
This is closer to a fair solution , but there 's still a big loophole .
When police assemble candidates for a lineup , they are supposed to pick candidates who match the general physical description given by the eyewitness .
If the eyewitness said they were attacked by a redhead , the police can't fill out the lineup with one redheaded suspect that they want to railroad , and 10 blondes .
Because attributes like " Caucasian " and " redhead " are pretty straightforward , if the rules for lineups are being enforced properly , the police do n't have a lot of wiggle room to fill out the lineup with candidates who blatantly do n't match the description .
Unfortunately , it would be a lot easier to cheat when creating a " lineup " of photos to compare against a photo whose owner was on trial for possessing child pornography .
If the photo at issue is probably legal but still provocative , then the police could fill out the rest of the lineup with completely non-sexual but perhaps eyebrow - raising photos , like a naked teenage girl watering some houseplants .
Then when the police ask , " Which of these does not belong ? " , everybody would pick the provocative one , and the police would take that as " vindication " .
The only way I can think of to guard against this , would be to let the defense counsel pick the other photos in the lineup , and then they could pick the most " provocative " ones that were still legal !
For any photos that have been declared legal in the past , the defense ought to be able to argue that if an independent panel of experts does n't think their client 's pictures are any worse than those , then their client should not be prosecuted either .
( If the defense lawyer decided their client was a child molester and wanted to throw them to the wolves , they could deliberately pick non-sexual photos for the lineup , so that their client 's photo gets pegged as the odd one out -- but when the defense lawyer decides to railroad their own client , it 's almost impossible for the system to guard against that anyway .
Also , it 's probably not a good idea to make this an option for child pornography defendants who decide to represent themselves , so that they can rifle through thousands of photographs of naked children , even legal ones , to find the pictures that they think are the " sexiest " to use for their defense . )
Perhaps someone can think of a better method that is still roughly scientific , in the sense of trying everyone according to the same standard and giving repeatable results .
The irony is that despite the potential of child pornography charges to destroy a person 's life , it is in possible in principle to try child pornography cases more objectively than almost any other type of crime , because you can separate out the alleged criminal act from everything else about the defendant , and let people examine the evidence of criminality in isolation .
If someone shoots a person and claims it was self - defense , it 's hard to imagine how you could distill out only the relevant facts of the case , and pass along just those facts to some third - party observer who then renders a judgment without knowing anything else .
Half the courtroom battle is over what facts are " relevant " in the first place .
But in the case of a child pornography charge , you can give the photo -- and no other information -- to an expert , and ask them to make a judgment .
I know , I know .
The police and prosecutors are not actually doing to do this .
But that in itself says something .
Even if it 's not possible to try most crimes in a truly objective fashion , why do n't the courts and the police do this when it is possible ?
Many first - year psychology students that have an intuitive grasp of the principles of sound double - blind testing , could probably come up with a procedure better than the one I 've described .
When you 've spent long enough thinking about how to design experiments objectively , you can't even hear about lawyers arguing over whether a photo constitutes child pornography , without the thought popping into your head : " Have a group of experts look at the photo and rate it , independently of each other .
Compare the results to a ' control ' result where the experts look at a photo that is not child pornography . "
And so on .
Why do n't those suggestions ever come from within the legal profession itself ?
And on the flip side , what about using scientific methods to examine facts about the legal system ?
When considering that judges are tasked with evaluating parties ' claims in an objective and fair manner , one could ask :
Are they really being objective ?
What are different ways that we could test this ?
Perhaps by having two actors in different courtrooms on the same day , charged with exactly the same crime under the same circumstances , except one is black and the other is white , and repeat the experiment many times to see if they receive different average sentences .
For a scientist , the idea is the most natural thing in the world .
Forget the fact that the legal system does n't do this -- why is virtually nobody in the legal profession even suggesting it ?
Probably because most people who think in terms of objective experimental design are drawn towards the hard sciences , not toward law .
That 's probably a good thing ; such people can likely do more good as physicists and research psychologists than they could as lawyers and policemen .
But they can still speak out for the principles of science to be applied wherever possible , in any area where objectivity is important -- especially the law .
All true scientists at heart should keep telling the world that " science " is not just a label that encompasses nerd subjects like biology , physics , and chemistry , with other subjects like art and law being " outside the domain of science " .
While the statements made within the framework of those subjects are not scientific ( " This painting is pretty " , " The court finds the defendant not liable " , etc. ) , science can make statements about the people in those professions and the patterns in the conclusions that they reach .
If art experts are evaluating paintings differently depending on whether they think the paintings come from an art gallery or a 4 - year - old 's kitchen table , you could find that out through a scientific experiment .
If judges are giving an easier time to lawyers than they are to parties who represent themselves , even when they make exactly identical arguments , you could test that hypothesis with an experiment , too .
And scientific principles could be used to draw up procedures for trying cases more objectively , as in the procedure for deciding the legality of sexting photographs .
We just need to get over the idea that " scientists " should limit themselves to the forensic CSI stuff and then stay away from the legal arena because that 's a " separate domain " .
Science could tell us quite a lot about how fairly justice is dispensed in the courtroom , and sometimes even how to fix the problems .
Architect Paul McKean has sent us the Neal Creek residence he designed , which is a rural vacation home located near Hood River , Oregon .
From the architect :
The Neal Creek residence treads lightly upon its surroundings , maximizing valley and water views with minimal impact to the natural environment .
The owners – windsurfing and snowboarding enthusiasts – were interested in a modest weekend retreat that would be highly efficient and ecologically minded .
Their wooded two - acre parcel of land presented many unique challenges including wetlands , creek protection setbacks , and floodplain restrictions .
The design solution for the two - bedroom house addresses these issues by elevating the habitable space one full floor above grade .
Views to the creek are enhanced from this position and the living spaces float within the tree tops .
Lifting the main space protects the house from potential flooding and brush fire damage while making way for a covered outdoor patio and much needed gear storage below .
At the uppermost level , the roof has been sized and detailed to allow for a future planted roof that will replace the landscape lost to the building footprint and reduce heat gain to the interior spaces .
Visit Paul McKean ’s website – here .
More description from the architect :
Material selections have been made that include mostly local , renewable , recyclable and natural building products .
Renewable materials include west coast cedar siding and wood framing , cabinetry and an FSC certified wood floor with a vegetable wax finish .
Natural wool and rubber carpet tiles in the bedrooms can be easily replaced if damaged .
The TPO roof can be recycled after its long life , protected by the planted eco roof .
All interior finishes are no VOC applications .
A Solatube skylight provides natural daylight into bathroom .
High efficiency windows and wood screens are placed to maximize daylight and views , as well as protect against summer heat gains
System selections have been made that are energy efficient , durable and healthy to its occupants .
A rainscreen wall system will safeguard the wall assembly from moisture intrusion and subsequent mold problems , as well as guarantee a longer life for the cedar siding .
Dual flush toilets and low flow fixtures reduce domestic water consumption .
An Advantex , dual stage septic system protects creekside soil quality and provides digital , off site monitoring of waste water quality .
The project was completed after 11 months of construction , on budget .

Raul Castro officially took over from his brother a year ago Cuban leader Raul Castro has announced a major cabinet reshuffle that includes the removal of two of the country 's most prominent politicians .
State television said Cabinet Secretary Carlos Lage and Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque are among 10 officials who are stepping down .
It said the move was in line with the president 's plan to improve efficiency .
It is the first big reshuffle since Mr Castro took over as president from his ailing older brother , Fidel , last year .
Correspondents say Mr Castro is putting his personal stamp on a government that still bears the mark of his brother .
Many of those dismissed were Fidel loyalists - including Mr Lage and Mr Perez Roque , who had both been seen as possible future candidates for the presidency .
Mergers
It was announced at the end of the midday news bulletin , after the weather and sports , the Associated Press news agency reports .
The changes include : Gen Jose Amado Ricardo Guerra replaced Mr Lage , 57 , as cabinet secretary - although he kept his job as vice - president of the Council of State .
Gen Guerra worked under Raul Castro when he was defence minister
Mr Perez Roque , 43 , was replaced as foreign minister by his deputy Bruno Rodriguez
Otto Rivero Torres was removed as cabinet vice president and replaced by Ramiro Valdez Menendez , who fought alongside the Castros in the 1959 revolution
Economy minister Jose Luis Rodriguez was replaced by internal commerce minister Marino Murillo Jorge
Jacinto Angulo Pardo was promoted to internal commerce minister after being Mr Jorge 's deputy
External commerce minister Raul de la Nuez Ramirez was replaced by Rodrigo Malmierca Diaz
Georgina Barreiro Fajardo was replaced as finance minister by Lina Pedraza Rodriguez
Labour Minister Alfredo Morales Cartaya was replaced by his vice minister Margarita Marlene Gonzalez Fernandez
Jose Miguel Miyar Barruecos was moved from secretary of the Council of State to science and environment minister
Homero Acosto Alvarez was appointed secretary of the Council of State
Maria del Carmen Concepcion Gonzalez was made food and fishing minister , replacing Food Minister Alejandro Roca Iglesias and Fishing Minister Alfredo Lopez Valdes .
Four ministries were merged in the reshuffle including food and fishing , and external commerce and foreign investment .
The major shake - up comes at a time when Cuba and the US have been signalling for the first time in many years that they would welcome the possibility of moving towards improved ties , says the BBC's Americas editor Emilio San Pedro .

Whenever we review notebooks one of the questions that always needs to be answered is , what ’s the battery life like on this laptop ?
We all know manufacturers overstate the quoted battery life for a system , probably because they test for battery life under ideal conditions for getting a high number .
For example , wireless off , processor underclocked , system idle , LCD brightness set to low , no DVD and so on .
So when your notebook with a quoted 5 hour battery life actually gets three hours , you ’re left wondering what happened to those other two hours the manufacturer got ?
The reality is , a great number of things can affect the battery life of your notebook : what tasks you ’re performing , wireless throughput , processor speed , screen resolution , amount of file fragmentation on the disk , LCD brightness setting — the list goes on and on .
Over the next few weeks we ’re going to take a look at various laptop components , how they affect battery life , and what you can do to maximize or reduce the amount of power pull that component has on the system as a whole .
We ’ll keep it at a high level so the average mainstream user can understand and use this information , and not have your eyes glaze over when reading .
A majority of the data presented will be based on research and numbers compiled by Intel in their Power Optimization : Furthering the Mobile Vision series of articles , and presentations we ’ve attended given by Intel , but we ’ll extrapolate that data to give real world suggestions .
The Effect of Wireless on Notebook Power Drain
In case you wondered what a wireless card looks like — above is the Intel 4965 agn wireless card ( view large image )
It ’s now the year 2007 and 99.9 % of notebooks out there have built - in wireless allowing you to surf the web and transfer files over thin air in the form of radio waves ( 802.11 a /b/g/n ) .
Having built - in wireless means you ’ve got a little chip inside your notebook that ’s responsible for sending and receiving those wireless packets of data .
If you ’re viewing this web page and on a wireless internet connection , the wireless chip in your PC was required to work and exert a certain amount of power to download this page .
If you ’re plugged in , that power is drawn from your wall socket , if you ’re on battery , then a very small piece of your battery life was donated to downloading this page ( we hope it ’s worth it for you ) .
So , exactly how much does having a wireless radio on and surfing the web affect your battery life ?
And how much power can you save simply by turning it off ?
We ’ll investigate in this article .
Below is figure 1 that we ’ll refer to a lot .
It ’s a bar graph showing how much power is exerted by each component in a notebook .
There are five bars , each showing how much power is used based on what the notebook is doing .
It ’s important to note this benchmarking system was done on a reference system that did not include an LCD monitor .
We ’ll look at LCD power drain seperately in another article ( it is generally the largest drain on battery life ) .
Figure 1 : Amount of battery drain of a notebook in various usage states .
LCD power drain is not included , the reference system does not include a monitor .
Below is another graph that shows average power drain for four different states of wireless , which are documented below this graph :
Figure 2 : Power drain of idle notebook running Windows XP with various WLAN states .
Blue indicates power used by all othercomponents , except the LCD power drain which is not included , and purple represents WLAN power drain .
Power drain of idle notebook ( screen power drain not included ) with wireless radio Off = 0W wireless radio power consumption Power drain of idle notebook ( screen power drain not included ) with wireless radio
On , but not connected to an Access Point ( no data being sent or received ) = 0.30W wireless radio power consumption Power drain of idle notebook ( screen power drain not included ) with wireless radio On , connected to an Access Point ( data can be sent and received ) = 0.45W wireless radio power consumption Power drain of idle notebook ( display power drain not included ) with wireless radio On and Searching for an Access Point = 1.6W wireless radio power consumption
Notice that by far the most power drain from the wireless card comes when it is searching and trying to acquire an access point .
Let ’s calculate a worst case scenario for how much the wireless card could affect battery life of a notebook .
Meaning , let ’s assume the card is perpetually searching for a network and can never find one , so the increased power consumption is + 1.60W , therefore :
Assume average power consumption for notebook with no wireless is 20 W
Assume average power consumption for notebook with wireless , continually trying to acquire network is 21.6 W ( + 1.60 W )
The formula for battery life ( assuming a brand new battery with no wear on it ) is :
Battery Life = Battery Capacity / Laptop Power Consumption
So if we assume a battery capacity of 53 WHr ( fairly standard battery capacity ) the formula for battery life with no wireless is :
Battery Life No Wireless = 53 WHr / 20W = 2 hours 39 minutes
And the formula for wireless on and searching for a wireless network is :
Battery Life Wireless on and Searching for Access Point = 53 WHr / 21.6W = 2 hours 27 minutes
So the difference in battery life for this worst case scenario is 12 minutes , which amounts to about 7.5 % difference .
Now let ’s assume the 0.45W power drain for the case where wireless has a solid connection and we ’re just transferring a little bit of data :
Battery Life Wireless Connected = 53 WHr / 20.45W = 2 hours 35 minutes
Not bad , only 4 minutes , or 2.5 % overall difference !
But , can we always assume 0.45 W power drain from wireless ?
What if we ’re uploading and downloading a ton of data , does that affect power drain somewhat ?
Well , yes …
Wireless Power Consumption Based on Data Transfer Variance
We ’re going to look at a comparison of transferring compressed versus uncompressed files to demonstrate the effect the amount of data transferred has on power consumption .
You need to be aware that the more data you transfer , the more the wireless card has to work , meaning the more power it has to consume .
So if you ’re streaming several gigabyte video files from a media server in your house to your unplugged notebook , your wireless card will be sweating hard and doing a lot of work , thereby draining battery power faster .
If your notebook is on wireless , solidly connected , and all you ’re doing is checking email every 5 minutes , the wireless card will barely sip the power and have little effect on battery life .
Let ’s look at how amount of data transfer affects energy used with some charts and graph comparisons .
bbAssume we have 5 different files , each file can be compressed to varying degrees using GZIP :
Data Set Original Size ( KB ) Gzip Compress Rate ( version 1.2.4 ) Description Tulips.tif 1179 ( 1.15 MB ) 1.2x
Med size file , very low compress ratio Book1 751 ( 0.73 MB ) 2.45 x
Med size file , low compress ratio World95.txt 2935 ( 2.87 MB ) 5.06 x
Large size file , high compress ratio Pic 502 ( 0.49 MB ) 8.96 x
Small size file , high compress ratio Frymire .tif 3708 ( 3.62 MB ) 14.04 x
Large size file , very high compress ratio
Tulips.tif is almost incompressible , while Frymire .tif can be compressed to almost 14 x smaller than its original size .
Here ’s a chart showing how long it takes to download the uncompressed file versus downloading a compressed version of each file plus the amount of time it then takes to then uncompress that file once it is downloaded :
Notice that with Frymire .tif we save about 2.5 minutes by downloading the much smaller zipped up version of the file and then unzipping it .
Meanwhile , the Tulips .tif file is about the same size compressed as uncompressed , and then we have to spend time and processor power unzipping it , so it ends up taking more time and power overall !
The amount of time it takes to download a file and then uncompress a file has a very direct effect on power consumption .
Notice in the graph below how much less energy it takes to download the compressed version of Frymire .
tif :
Several times more energy is consumed to download the uncompressed original 3.62 MB size Frymire .tif , it took almost 3 minutes to download Frymire .
tif , so the wireless card is working all that time .
When you download a web page , most websites ( such as this one ) actually send a page in gzip format and your browser will unzip it on the fly .
So this type of thing is constantly going on behind the scenes as you browse the web .
The more web pages you download and browse , the more power it takes .
The moral of the story ?
The more you ’re downloading with your wireless card , the more power it consumes , so the effect your wireless card has on battery drain depends a lot on how much you ’re using it .
Conclusion
For those that saw a couple of formulas and graphs and skipped ahead to this part , I do n’t blame you , here are the take aways based on the data :
Simply turning on the wireless card does n’t drain much power , it might shorten battery life by 2 % , so if you want to remain connected to download email it ’s no big deal .
If you turn on wireless and are constantly trying to acquire a connection , such as if you ’re constantly dropping a connection and then trying to reconnect , your battery life could be 6 % – 7 % shorter than usual due to the wireless card having to work extra hard .
If you have wireless card on and are transferring lots of data , such as downloading large files or constantly browsing the web , battery life could be about 6 % shorter than simply no wireless on .
Consider downloading large files later when you ’re plugged in .
If you do n’t need to use the web , turn wireless off , it ’ll save you at least a few short ( but maybe precious ) minutes of battery life !
Overall I believe that power consumption due to wireless is a bit exaggerated as a culprit for notebook battery drain .
You can save a lot more power by dimming screen brightness , underclocking the processor , spinning a DVD less , or a variety of other power saving tactics we ’ll look at in future articles .
In most cases you ’re going to have a lot more fun or be more productive when connected to the web , so do n’t sweat it , turn the wireless card on and be more productive with that time you have on battery .
" Working for Opera Software 's QA department gives you in - depth perspectives on the web 's wild and varied coding practises , " writes Hallvord R. M. Steen .
" I still was n't prepared for the curious solutions that power the menu on the new Israel Railways website . "
" The coding is unbelievable , " Hallvord continues .
" Diving into the website 's source code shows that its coders must have fallen asleep during the what 's the point of XSLT lesson .
It 's more like an XML parser / serializer stress test than a production site . "
For those unaware ( wake up Railways developers ! ) , the XSLT markup / programming language is widely used to transform one sort of DOM into another - for example turning the DOM of a generic XML file into valid XHTML .
Much of the benefit is that you 're working on DOM trees , making it hard or impossible to create syntactically invalid pages .
Of course , like most tools , XSLT can be horribly abused , and the Railways website does a pretty impressive job of that :
< xsl :template name = " inner - text - tag - open " > < xsl : if test = " $is-mz-impl " > < xsl:comment>nwlt</xsl:comment > </ xsl : if > < xsl : text disable - output - escaping =" yes " ><</xsl:text > </ xsl:template > < xsl:template name = " inner - text - tag - close " > < xsl : text disable - output - escaping =" yes " >></xsl:text > < xsl : if test = " $is-mz-impl " > < xsl:comment>nwgt</xsl:comment > </xsl:if > </xsl:template > < xsl:template name= " inner- text- element - open " > < xsl: param name= " element- name " /> < xsl:call - template name= " inner- text - tag- open " /> < xsl:value - of select = " $element - name " /> < xsl:text disable - output - escaping =" yes " >
</xsl:text > </xsl:template > < xsl:template name= " inner- text- element - close " > < xsl: param name= " element- name " /> < xsl:call - template name= " inner- text- tag-open " /> / < xsl:value - of select = " $element-name " /> < xsl:call - template name= " inner- text- tag- close " /> </xsl:template >
The purpose of the preceding code was to concatenate bits of text ( < , / , > , etc ) into something like this :
< div></div >
Of course , to get the other useful parts of the string ( attributes , inner contents ) , the rest of the giant XSLT ( and perhaps the other giant XSLT ) is required .
Hallvord , who clearly spent much more time trying to understand the XSLT mess , explains further :
When they in their wisdom chose to generate markup inside text nodes with their XSLT they run into the familiar problem : when is < going to start a tag and when is it going to live in a text node ?
Hence , < is sometimes escaped as < to create proper text nodes with HTML source - as - text in them ( as for example the instance of < in the code above ) .
Now , of course when they set innerHTML they do not want this < to appear as a literal < so they do some pre-processing : all < and > they want to change into proper < and > before setting innerHTML have a comment node next to them ...
<!--nwlt--><TR class= " nw - 2r " ><!-- nwgt--> <!--nwlt--><TD class=" nw - 2c " ><!--nwgt--> ... and their pre-processing is a simple string replace ...
s Html = sHtml .replace (/\<!--nwlt--\></g , " < " ) .replace (/>\<!--nwgt--\>/g , " > " ) .replace ( /\<[\/]? tbody \>/gi , " " ) ;
And why they hate the poor TBODY so much they must strip it from the markup even though the browser will re-generate them in the DOM as soon as innerHTML is parsed I can't even begin to imagine .
Even More Fun
The good news for those with even more time on their hands is that this XSLT " cleverness " appears to be the tip of the iceberg .
Digging through some of the Railways site 's JavaScript , I noticed this function ...
function escapeProperly ( str )
... which calls ...
function escapeProperlyCore( str , bAsUrl )
... which finally calls ...
function escapeProperlyCoreCore(str , bAsUrl , bForFilterQuery , bForCallback )
And then there was this bizarre array :
var LegalUrlChars=new
Array ( false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , true , true , false , false , true , false , false , true , true , true , false , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , false , true , false , true , false , false , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , false , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , true , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false , false ) ;
And on its surface , while the data does seem strange , there is actually a good use for it :
for ( var i=0 ; i<strLeafName.length ; i++) { var ch=strLeafName.charCodeAt( i ) ; if( strLeafName.charAt( i)=='. ' && ( i==0 || i==( strLeafName.length -1 ) ) ) return i ; if ( ch < 160 && ( strLeafName.charAt(i)=='/' || !LegalUrlChars[ch ] ) ) return i ; } return - 1 ;
Err , something like that .
A region of Earth so barren and desolate that it's often compared to Mars is home to simple but thriving ecosystems , suggesting that life could indeed survive on the red planet .
" If you have just a few basic things , " said Steven Schmidt , a microbiologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder , " you can get a complex ecosystem going , even in one of the harshest places on the planet . "
Schmidt 's team studied soil from the upper flanks of the Socompa volcano , high in the Andes mountains .
Straddling Chile and Argentina , the volcano is surrounded by the Atacama desert , one of the few spots on Earth to contain regions devoid of any life form .
At 20,000 feet above sea level , the Socompa 's upper flanks are especially harsh :
There 's little oxygen , and ultraviolet radiation passes easily through the thin atmosphere .
But where steam from the volcano bursts through the ground , there 's methane and water .
Add that to atmospheric carbon dioxide , and conditions resemble what once existed — and may still exist — on Mars .
Scientists recently found that Mars still belches methane into its carbon - dioxide rich atmosphere .
And though NASA 's Mars Rover found water only in ice , rather than the liquid necessary for life as we know it , many geologists suspect water is present beneath the planet 's surface , warmed by the Mars ' still - hot core .
" The Socompa microbial ecosystem is an extremely exciting Earth analog for investing how life on Mars may survive in hydrothermal oases , where water , heat and nutrients are being provided from deep within , " said California Institute of Technology biochemist Adrian Ponce , who was not involved in the study .
Schmidt 's team sampled soil around volcanic vents , and from regional soils thought to be lifeless .
In the vent soil , they identified moss , algae and about 500 species of bacteria .
Apart from the discovery of a new species of mite , said
Schmidt , these findings are most significant for their level of genomic detail , since the organisms were already known to exist .
Far more surprising was the presence of roughly 100
species of bacteria in earth taken miles from volcano 's vents .
No life at all was thought to exist in that parched soil .
" That 's the more Mars - like soil , " said Schmidt .
" There 's definitely a microbial community there . "
According to study co-author Elizabeth Costello , a University of Colorado at
Boulder biologist , the bacteria " may stay in a dormant state until a snowfall occurs and water is provided to them . "
This , she said , might occur " fairly rarely " — an understatement for a region in which years can pass between rainstorms .
" We have no idea what they 're doing or how they 're living , " said Schmidt , who plans to further study the unlikely bugs .
Lisa Pratt , a NASA astrobiologist who was not involved in the study , mirrored Ponce 's excitement , saying the Socompa vents " may be the best example yet of an Earth analogue for habitable surface and near - surface environments on Mars . "
" If water , a carbon source and energy for metabolism are present , then life seems to manage daunting extremes , " said Pratt .
That is , if it can get started .
Some scientists question whether the chemistry on Mars has ever been conducive for life to begin , even if we know organisms can evolve to survive those same conditions .
But life did n't necessarily need to bootstrap itself on Mars : it could have arrived there on rocks knocked into space by an asteroid 's collision with some other , more temperate planet .
Bacteria are , after all , able to withstand the vacuum of space and simulated meteorite impacts .
Just as Earthly microbes likely drifted through the upper atmosphere onto the Socompa volcano , extraterrestrial microbes could have drifted to Mars .
" Certain microbes have spore forms that can survive in space , " said Schmidt .
" It 's conceivable . "

Fantasy and reality will collide Tuesday night at the United Nations , as writers and actors from the Sci Fi Channel ’s hit “ Battlestar Galactica ” meet UN representatives to discuss issues such as human rights , children and armed conflict , and terrorism .
Also on the agenda : dialogue among different civilizations and faiths .
The meeting happens just days before the two - hour final episode of the show airs Friday .
Actors Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell will appear at the United Nations Tuesday .
Commander William Adama and President Laura Roslin – at least , the actors who play them ( Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell ) – will meet with several UN representatives .
Two executive producers and writers will also participate .
Whoopi Goldberg , purportedly a big fan , will moderate this historic meeting of minds .
I briefly chatted Monday with Dave Howe , president of the Sci Fi Network , about the importance of the United Nations event .
“ Traditionally , sci- fi has always been an opportunity to look at the human condition , and then extrapolate out .
Science fiction has always held up a mirror to society and to humanity , and has asked tough questions about where are we going , and whether we ’re going in the right direction , and that ’s the nature of Battlestar Galactica , ” Howe said .
The new “ Battlestar Galactica , ” which re-imagined the original 1978 series by the same name , has developed a cult following of devoted fans since it debuted as a miniseries in 2003 .
Since the beginning , when the Cylons annihilated the human colonies and forced the only survivors into outer space , we have been diligently keeping track of who ’s a human and who ’s a Cylon , and pondering whether they can ever truly coexist in peace .
The final confrontation between factions on Friday will be the show ’s final word on the future of both races .
It will also be the final word on the identity of Kara “ Starbuck ” Thrace , who keeps hearing that she is the “ harbinger of death . ”
( Incidentally , am I the only one still rooting for her and Captain Lee “ Apollo ” Adama to get together for more than just a quickie ?
Given that Lee ’s father , the commander , already thinks of Kara as a daughter , their union would make family gatherings , like their equivalent of Thanksgiving , all the more pleasant . )
For the uninitiated , the whole concept of the show can be explained in the opening credits for the first season : “ The Cylons were created by man .
They rebelled .
They evolved .
They look and feel human .
Some are programmed to think they are human .
There are many copies .
And they have a plan . ”
So : Humans made robots , and they evolved , and some of them are virtually indistinguishable from humans , and conflict ensues .
We fans appreciate that this is not a “ good guys vs. bad guys ” space battle .
The show ’s four seasons have been jam - packed with difficult ethical questions .
From the torture of a pretty Number Six Cylon aboard the Pegasus to a suicide bombing campaign to the hiding of a child who represents the “ face of things to come , ” we viewers are constantly challenged to think outside the box and tackle issues that are just as pertinent in our own world .
The characters that may seem evil in one episode may suddenly look heroic in the next .
Even Dr. Gaius Baltar , the dreamy ladies ’ man who was told in the most recent episode that he had never done anything that was n’t selfish , and who is responsible for much violence and destruction , is still somehow lovable .
On Friday , he may finally redeem himself .
Incidentally , the Sci Fi Channel just announced that it ’s renaming itself “ SyFy ” on July 7 .

A postbox in Edinburgh has been completely covered in wrapping paper , topped off with a giant red ribbon .
A Royal Mail spokeswoman said the box on McDonald Road , near to the city 's Brunswick Street sorting office , may have been wrapped up as a prank .
She suggested it could have been a " romantic gesture " .
The wrapping has now been removed from the letter box and it is understood that none of the mail inside had been damaged .
Do you know who decorated the post box ?

5 Things You Didn't Know : Abraham Lincoln
Page 1 of 2
More has been written about Abraham Lincoln than any other U.S. president , which is n't all that surprising given his pivotal role in American history .
His death alone commands far more attention than is paid to the combined lives of countless forgettable presidents ( that would be you , William Henry Harrison ) .
Lincoln presided over the most devastating war in U.S. history , and the decisions he made in office forever altered the course of American politics .
So yes , he was a political beast , but how many people know he threw around huge guys as easily as he did habeas corpus , and survived as many broadsword duels as he did assassination attempts ?
Well , you will , once you 've read these five things you did n't know about Abraham Lincoln .
1- Lincoln was challenged to a sword duel at Bloody Island
In 1842 , Lincoln wrote a series of letters criticizing a Democrat named James Shields .
Unfortunately , this act became the 19th - century equivalent of an internet meme as other people started writing letters too , insulting Shields and hinting at his sexual inadequacies .
Shields responded in the most reasonable manner available in 1842 : He challenged Lincoln to a duel .
Lincoln accepted , but with an intentionally frightening stipulation : that the duel be fought on Bloody Island , a small island in the Mississippi River in Illinois .
Shields arrived to find he'd be fighting with broadswords , at the bottom of a pit .
His titanically huge opponent was chopping stuff apart and generally looking fearsome .
Faced with Abraham Lincoln 's death pit , Shields suddenly found himself open to compromise and accepted a pseudo - apology .
All was forgiven , and Shields even went on to serve under Lincoln as a brigadier general in the Civil War .
2- Lincoln was the " moderate " antislavery candidate
It 's a little shocking to quote Lincoln 's letter toeditor Horace Greeley wherein the president says : " If I could save the Union without freeing any slave , I would do it . "
But the rest of that sentence goes : " … and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it ; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that . "
So Lincoln 's " personal wish that all men everywhere could be free " never superseded his goal to preserve the Union , and when he was nominated for the 1860 election , that nomination came in part because he was less dramatically antislavery — and , therefore , more of a unifying figure — than his Republican opponents .
There 's more things you did n't know about Abraham Lincoln after the break ...
( Newser ) – Georgia ’s sex offender registry includes rapists , child molesters , and , in a controversial move , a growing number of people who never committed a sexual offense , the Atlanta Journal - Constitution reports .
Under the state 's broadly written law , anyone convicted of kidnapping or false imprisonment of a minor goes on the list , too , regardless of whether a sexual crime occurred .
The registry imposes a kind of life sentence , restricting where offenders can live and work .
About 90 people are on the list for kidnapping , another 90 for false imprisonment ; records indicate just 33 actually committed a sexual offense .
“ Does n’t it sound screwy what ’s going on here ? ” asked one judge .
Legislation is pending to amend the rules .

The peacetime activities of an armed force have a bearing on its wartime capabilities and its relations with the civil society .
Although it has been the stated government policy for at least a decade to use the defence forces as sparingly as possible the Indian army has been continually engaged in counter - insurgency operations in Jammu and Kashmir and the northeast .
“ Excessive and continuous involvement of the Army for internal security is not good , neither for the Army nor for the nation , ” former army chief Ved Prakash Malik said four years ago .
“ Most of the states have neglected their armed police , ” he said .
When the al Qaeda recently threatened India with more Mumbai - like attacks , the first response came from Defence Minister A.K. Antony .
“ Our army is ready to face any threat from anywhere , ” he said .
Internal security is the responsibility of the Home ministry and the police force .
“ There is an increasing trend to rely on the army for internal security , ” strategic affairs expert Jasjeet Singh told Reuters .
“ We have got into the habit that the moment there is the slightest disturbance the administrator picks up the phone and calls for the army . ”
Defence analyst Gurmeet Kanwal said “ such operations undoubtedly stretch the army ’s budget and affect its modernisation programme . ”
They also interfere with the training of the armed forces for conventional warfare , he said .
Was it then the defence minister ’s remit to respond to that threat ?
The army ’s apolitical stance makes it something of an exception in South Asia .
However , concerns had been raised after the Malegaon blasts case where a serving army officer has been charge sheeted .
Does the army ’s involvement in internal security duties make it vulnerable to politicisation ?
Singh thinks that Malegaon is an aberration but “ what is aberration today in twenty years will be regular . ”
He suggests reforming the training and recruitment of police so it can tackle internal security challenges on its own .
Police being a state subject under the Indian constitution , personnel are recruited locally and therefore are more sensitive to local sentiments .
This makes the police more conducive to handling internal security duties provided it has the capacity .
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah favours the strategy of letting the local police maintain law and order in the state .
Should that be a nationwide initiative ?
Human brains are about three times as large as those of our early australopithecines ancestors that lived 4 million to 2 million years ago , and for years , scientists have wondered how our brains got so big .
A new study suggests social competition could be behind the increase in brain size .
Canadian researchers say they can glean simple preferences from a person 's brain by shining near - infrared light into the noggin .
The study , reported in the Journal of Neural Engineering , demonstrated the ability to decode a person 's preference for one of two drinks with 80 percent accuracy by measuring the intensity of near - infrared light absorbed in brain tissue , the scientists said in a statement today .
" This is the first system that decodes preference naturally from spontaneous thoughts , " says Sheena Luu , a University of Toronto doctoral student in biomedical engineering who led the work under the supervision of Tom Chau , a specialist in pediatric rehab engineering at the university 's Bloorview Kids Rehab center .
Near - infrared light has a longer wavelength than visible light .
In the beginning of the study , nine adult volunteers rated eight drinks on a scale of one to five .
Then , wearing a headband fitted with fiber optics that emit light into the pre-frontal cortex of the brain , the subjects were shown two drinks on a computer monitor , one after the other , and asked to make a mental decision about which they liked more .
" When your brain is active , the oxygen in your blood increases and depending on the concentration , it absorbs more or less light , " Luu said .
" In some people , their brains are more active when they do n't like something , and in some people they 're more active when they do like something . "
After teaching the computer to recognize the unique pattern of brain activity associated with preference for each subject , the researchers accurately predicted which drink the participants liked best 80 percent of the time .
Other research has suggested brain activity could be monitored before decisions are made , perhaps with a mind - reading hat that would predict what we 'll do .
The goal of the new research is ultimately to open the world of choice to children who can't speak or move .
The writer wishes to remain anonymous
On the eve of the CoML , writer Philip Pullman wrote an article for The Times newspaper .
It was abruptly it was pulled from their website soon after and you can see this discussion on the CoML website asking why .
Then , I was passed an email sent by Mr Pullman himself worrying about what happened and wondering why it had been pulled .
If you search The Times website , the reference to Mr Pullman ’s article still comes up
But the page itself gives an error .
Update – the article is now back up .
Why did The Times pull the article without explanation ?
In an email sent to a friend on the eve of the Convention on Modern Liberty , Mr Pullman said this to a colleague .
My article has disappeared from the Times Online website with no word of why or where it ’s gone .
I ’m just letting you know so that when I fail to turn up tomorrow you ’ll be able to tell people that the secret police have got me .
Here is the full text of the article that was pulled :
Malevolent voices that despise our freedoms
Are such things done on Albion ’s shore ?
The image of this nation that haunts me most powerfully is that of the sleeping giant Albion in William Blake ’s prophetic books .
Sleep , profound and inveterate slumber : that is the condition of Britain today .
We do not know what is happening to us .
In the world outside , great events take place , great figures move and act , great matters unfold , and this nation of Albion murmurs and stirs while malevolent voices whisper in the darkness – the voices of the new laws that are silently strangling the old freedoms the nation still dreams it enjoys .
We are so fast asleep that we do n’t know who we are any more .
Are we English ?
Scottish ?
Welsh ?
British ?
More than one of them ?
One but not another ?
Are we a Christian nation – after all we have an Established Church – or are we something post - Christian ?
Are we a secular state ?
Are we a multifaith state ?
Are we anything we can all agree on and feel proud of ?
The new laws whisper :
You do n’t know who you are
You ’re mistaken about yourself
We know better than you do what you consist of , what labels apply to you , which facts about you are important and which are worthless
We do not believe you can be trusted to know these things , so we shall know them for you
And if we take against you , we shall remove from your possession the only proof we shall allow to be recognised
The sleeping nation dreams it has the freedom to speak its mind .
It fantasises about making tyrants cringe with the bluff bold vigour of its ancient right to express its opinions in the street .
This is what the new laws say about that :
Expressing an opinion is a dangerous activity
Whatever your opinions are , we do n’t want to hear them
So if you threaten us or our friends with your opinions we shall treat you like the rabble you are
And we do not want to hear you arguing about it
So hold your tongue and forget about protesting
What we want from you is acquiescence
The nation dreams it is a democratic state where the laws were made by freely elected representatives who were answerable to the people .
It used to be such a nation once , it dreams , so it must be that nation still .
It is a sweet dream .
You are not to be trusted with laws
So we shall put ourselves out of your reach
We shall put ourselves beyond your amendment or abolition
You do not need to argue about any changes we make , or to debate them , or to send your representatives to vote against them
You do not need to hold us to account
You think you will get what you want from an inquiry ?
Who do you think you are ?
What sort of fools do you think we are ?
The nation ’s dreams are troubled , sometimes ; dim rumours reach our sleeping ears , rumours that all is not well in the administration of justice ; but an ancient spell murmurs through our somnolence , and we remember that the courts are bound to seek the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , and we turn over and sleep soundly again .
And the new laws whisper :
We do not want to hear you talking about truth
Truth is a friend of yours , not a friend of ours
We have a better friend called hearsay , who is a witness we can always rely on
We do not want to hear you talking about innocence
Innocent means guilty of things not yet done
We do not want to hear you talking about the right to silence
You need to be told what silence means : it means guilt
We do not want to hear you talking about justice
Justice is whatever we want to do to you
And nothing else
Are we conscious of being watched , as we sleep ?
Are we aware of an ever - open eye at the corner of every street , of a watching presence in the very keyboards we type our messages on ?
The new laws do n’t mind if we are .
They do n’t think we care about it .
We want to watch you day and night
We think you are abject enough to feel safe when we watch you
We can see you have lost all sense of what is proper to a free people
We can see you have abandoned modesty
Some of our friends have seen to that
They have arranged for you to find modesty contemptible
In a thousand ways they have led you to think that whoever does not want to be watched must have something shameful to hide
We want you to feel that solitude is frightening and unnatural
We want you to feel that being watched is the natural state of things
One of the pleasant fantasies that consoles us in our sleep is that we are a sovereign nation , and safe within our borders .
This is what the new laws say about that :
We know who our friends are
And when our friends want to have words with one of you
We shall make it easy for them to take you away to a country where you will learn that you have more fingernails than you need
It will be no use bleating that you know of no offence you have committed under British law
It is for us to know what your offence is
Angering our friends is an offence
It is inconceivable to me that a waking nation in the full consciousness of its freedom would have allowed its government to pass such laws as the Protection from Harassment Act ( 1997 ) , the Crime and Disorder Act ( 1998 ) , the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act ( 2000 ) , the Terrorism Act ( 2000 ) , the Criminal Justice and Police Act ( 2001 ) , the Anti-Terrorism , Crime and Security Act ( 2001 ) , the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Extension Act ( 2002 ) , the Criminal Justice Act ( 2003 ) , the Extradition Act ( 2003 ) , the Anti-Social Behaviour Act ( 2003 ) , the Domestic Violence , Crime and Victims Act ( 2004 ) , the Civil Contingencies Act ( 2004 ) , the Prevention of Terrorism Act ( 2005 ) , the Inquiries Act ( 2005 ) , the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act ( 2005 ) , not to mention a host of pending legislation such as the Identity Cards Bill , the Coroners and Justice Bill , and the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill .
Inconceivable .
And those laws say :
Sleep , you stinking cowards
Sweating as you dream of rights and freedoms
Freedom is too hard for you
We shall decide what freedom is
Sleep , you vermin
Sleep , you scum .
Philip Pullman will deliver a keynote speech at the Convention on Modern Liberty at the Institute of Education in London tomorrow
There was an interesting exchange today on the concurrency - interest mailing list about LinkedBlocking Queue , one of the most important and commonly used queue implementations in java.util.concurrent .
LBQ is an optionally - bounded thread - safe queue based on a linked list .
The key method in question is the extract ( ) method used to remove the head of the queue :
[ source : java ]
private E extract ( ) {
Node first = head .
next ;
head = first ;
E x = first.item ;
first.item = null ;
return x ;
}
[ / source ]
This method is going to release the first item ( head ) out into the world and head .
next will become the new head .
The issue here is that head will be pulled off , used , and probably become garbage but the head Node retains its head .
next link to the next Node .
This is bad because it means that there will be a chain of references back through all the old Node references even after they ’ve been removed from the queue and thrown away .
GC will of course take care of all those references since the Nodes are garbage .
But the garbage collectors we use are generational – they periodically sweep through young objects and kill the vast numbers of them that have been short - lived .
The ones that survive live to the next generation and eventually if objects are old enough they move to the old generation where they are collected less frequently by a full GC .
The problem in the queue nodes is that if they live in the queue long enough ( if the queue is big ) , then one of them will enter the old gen and at that point the reference from old gen into young gen prevents the whole chain of dead nodes from being reclaimed by young generational collection .
This is highly inefficient for the GC .
This problem can of course be solved simply by nulling the Node next reference :
[ source : java ]
private E extract ( ) {
Node first = head .
next ;
head .
next = null ; //
Kill this reference
head = first ;
E x = first.item ;
first.item = null ;
return x ;
}
[ / source ]
This breaks the chain and prevents the reference from old gen into young gen .
This makes a huge difference in GC and performance .
You can see some results from a test demonstrating the problems :
Test 1 took : 1595 ms
Test 2 took : 2639 ms Exception in thread " main " java.lang.AssertionError : Full GC has occured during the test : 47 times at TestLBQ.main( TestLBQ.java:72 )
My workaround of null 'ing head .
next before moving the head works perfectly and displays ( as expected ) : Test 1 took : 1629 ms
Test 2 took : 1592ms
On the original version ( the one in the JDK ) , the second pass through the test is significantly slower and full gc occurred 47 times as opposed to the fixed version which shows a faster second pass and no full gc .
Even worse was a test with the new G1 garbage collector in Java 7 .
This new collector takes the generational idea and pushes it even further .
Unfortunately , that means it ’s even more affected by this problem ( while in general it is better for many apps ) :
JDK7 version : Test 1 took : 5456 ms
Test 2 took : 5575 ms
With null assignment : Test 1 took : 1698 ms
Test 2 took : 1602ms
It seems this was not the first discovery of this issue as a couple of people were already using modified LBQs with this change .
Hopefully this issue will be fixed in Java 7 at least .
