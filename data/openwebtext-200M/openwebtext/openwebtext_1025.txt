Principal EcuadorGuinea pig , is called Cuy , and it is an Ecuadorian delicacy .
It would be a sin to leave your vacation in Ecuador without trying it and I had the privilege of helping prepare it from start to finish .
Read on for all the details ...
WARNING : not for people who are grosed out easily !
üòä It was a huge , white guinea pig .
First , Mama broke its neck and then hung it upside down in her hands to let the blood drip out of its mouth and onto the dirt floor .
It was a slow death , as it squirmed silently .
When the blood had been reduced to a very slow dripping , she laid it in a big bowl and dumped a pot of boiling water onto its squirming body .
This made it easier for her to rip the fur off of its body .
After a few moments , it stopped squirming and I hope his soul made it to guinea pig heaven .
When all the fur was off , the next step was to cut the guinea pig open and remove the insides .
Mama was afraid to cut it because there was a big of a bulge in the belly , andshe feared it may have babies inside !
She had Papa cut it open , because she had a fear of baby animals .
We hoped and prayed it did not have a baby , and luckily , it did not .
She continued , to remove the intestines , and all the organs except for the liver and the brain .
The organs went into a bucket for the pigs to eat .
Next , she rubbed the guinea pig with salt and garlic that she mashed with a rock .
She let it marinate for a few hours in a dish covered with a dish towel .
When it was time to cook the guinea pig , Mama borrowed a grill from the neighbors and lit the charcoal with a bit of gasoline .
Miggy and I took turns fanning the fire with the " ventador " , made of straw .
When the coals were red hot , and there was a nice flame .
Mama slid a stick into the body of the guinea pig .
We each took turns roasting , fanning the fire , and rubbing orange - colored lard onto the body .
You have to keep rotating the cuy so that it will not burn .
The skin became golden brown , crispy , and bubbly .
Most everyone in Ecuador LOVES cuy , and they will say their favorite food .
It is mostly served on special occasions , and this occasion was St. Josephs Day , but we did n't cook it on St. Josephs day because we did n't have power at that time and it was a very busy time for us .
The cuy is * always * served with potatoes and rice , according to Mama .
They enjoyed eating the feet the best , crunching on the bone .
It is very delicious , very similar to grilled chicken , except crunchier .
Jose says cuy is his favorite and his second favorite is FOX !
I thought it was a joke until Mama raved about the fox also , and said it makes a delicioius fox soup that is " Que Rico " .
The fox is cooked in the same way nad has a similar taste .
Money may have a bigger psychological impact on us than we realize .
A new study in the journal Psychological Science finds that merely thinking about money can affect how we perceive physical pain and feelings of social rejection .
The researchers , Xinyue Zhou at Sun Yat - Sen University in southern China , Kathleen D. Vohs at the University of Minnesota and Roy F. Baumeister at Florida State University , conducted a series of six studies designed to test how thoughts or reminders of money affect feelings about social and physical experiences .
They found that feeling rejected stirred a greater desire for money and that thoughts about losing money made social rejection sting more .
They also found that thinking about having money made physical pain feel less acute , thoughts of losing money made physical pain worse , and being in physical pain made people want money more .
The subjects were undergraduate students at Sun Yat - Sen University .
In one test , four women or four men were introduced to each other and allowed to get acquainted for five minutes before each was asked separately which person he or she would like to pair up with for a study .
Later , each was told participation was n‚Äôt possible because either everyone in the group wanted to work with that person or nobody did .
After that , each participant was instructed to draw a coin from memory , asked which of several pleasant things , like chocolate or sunshine , they would give up for $ 10 million , and solicited for donations to an orphanage .
Those told that other group members rejected them drew larger coins , would trade more things for $ 10 million , and donated less money .
In another experiment , participants given lists of words that referred to physical pain chose larger coin sizes and were willing to give up more things that they valued in life for money .
Other experiments started with money and measured its effects on pain or rejection .
Participants asked to count out 80 $ 100 bills reported less social distress after playing a computer game in which they experienced social rejection than participants assigned to count 80 worthless pieces of paper .
People who counted the real money also reported feeling less pain when their fingers were immersed in hot water for 30 seconds than those who counted the paper .
Other groups were asked either to list what they had spent money on in the past 30 days or list weather conditions during that time .
Those who itemized their finances reported higher social distress from the computer game and greater pain from the hot water .
In these experiments , people ‚Äôs mood or emotional state , as measured by psychological assessments , did not change based on whether they counted money or paper .
But their perceptions of social or physical discomfort did .
The authors conclude that ‚Äú even the mere idea of money can have benefits . ‚Äù
Money , they write , ‚Äú operates as a social resource that confers a broad , strong feeling of being able to cope with problems and satisfy one ‚Äôs needs .
Resources are valued more in times of threat and adversity than at other times , presumably because resources improve one ‚Äôs overall ability to cope .
Getting or having resources reduces pain and suffering ; conversely , losing resources makes one more vulnerable , which intensifies suffering . ‚Äù
So what are the potential practical implications of all this :
Would people suffering from a painful disease or treatment find it easier to handle the pain if they were given $ 100 bills to count ?
Would socially excluded kids be less likely to feel rejection if their teacher had them participate in , say , a math lesson in which they counted money ?
Those are ‚Äú two good ways the manipulation could be used , ‚Äù Professor Vohs said in an e-mail .
‚Äú Other ideas are to have men count money before they go out hitting on women ‚Äî because they are going to be rejected a lot .
Or since money elicits feelings of strength , football players could count it before heading out onto the field ( or maybe especially at halftime ) . ‚Äù
Responses have been overwhelmingly negative to the news that The Pirate Bay will soon be sold to Global Gaming Factory .
But what if there is a method to the apparent Pirate Bay madness -- one that , as Peter Sunde has hinted , could actually be good for the P2P community ?
Like everyone else I ‚Äôve been reading , talking to friends and thinking about this for the last couple of days .
What I ‚Äôm about to say is the result of that ‚Äî my own opinion and nothing more .
Let ‚Äôs start with a great fact : that , as Rasmus Fleischer of Piratbyran points out , the entire Pirate Bay could fit on a single USB stick .
This got me thinking : what if someone was to simply scrape and copy all The Pirate Bay ‚Äôs torrents over to a new tracker and Mininova and all the other indexes currently using the TPB tracker were to change their listings to point to that ?
OpenBitTorrent.com for example , an independent open tracker which started recently .
What if someone else ‚Äî it could be anyone ; it could be you ! ‚Äî decided to make a new index of these torrents .
Call it ‚Äò The Pirate Ship ‚Äô , ‚Äò Brand New Pirate ‚Äô , whatever .
I ‚Äôm sure someone has already got a domain ready and waiting for this .
This new index would be functionally equivalent to The Pirate Bay .
By the magic of copy - and - paste , TPB would have transplanted itself somewhere new .
The corporate ‚Äò buyers ‚Äô are free to run the old site into the ground with whatever specious business models they care to waste their shareholders ‚Äô money on , while The Pirate Bay ‚Äôs new foundation uses it to fund interesting , new projects .
Think about it for a moment .
What would be the downside of the sale here ?
Privacy , possibly ‚Äî a serious concern .
Had The Pirate Bay been keeping logs of seeders and leechers , the acquiring company could ‚Äî after flailing about for a few months trying to sell bits and bandwidth ‚Äî auction this to the highest bidder .
But TPB have been scrupulously failing to keep such logs .
So provided people switch at the right time ‚Äî as I ‚Äôm sure they ‚Äôll have the intelligence to ‚Äî there will simply be nothing to sell .
Let ‚Äôs not be glib about it : after the shenanigans with insider trading , who knows if the deal goes through .
But if it does , those behind TPB may have managed to square the circle , sliding out from behind the old , compromised identity while handing - off everything of value ( tracker , torrents , users ) to the community .
The very fact that this is possible should give those backing business models based on copy - restriction something serious to think about .
Not only is this not a blow for P2P , it ‚Äôs a signal of something very worrying for the MPAA and Co .
Spend years going after the world ‚Äôs most prominent pirate site , only to find that when you get it , it dematerializes and by the magic of copy - and - paste , reappears elsewhere in a different guise .
It ‚Äôs like Whack - A - Mole with infinite holes , infinite moles , and just one hammer .
Your odds : not good .
The feelings of betrayal and being ‚Äò sold out ‚Äô by the TPB founders are natural .
We believe (d ) in The Pirate Bay ; The Pirate Bay was ‚Äò forever ‚Äô .
But in one way , an important way , this belief was right : what made The Pirate Bay possible is forever .
Even if I ‚Äôm wrong , and a service like OpenBittorrent does n‚Äôt immediately get populated with all the torrents from the old database , the ‚Äò community ‚Äô should learn some lessons from this :
(1) Big !=
Good
Let ‚Äôs face it :
The Pirate Bay itself had become a huge focus of attention for those trying to preserve the old copy - restriction model of the culture industries .
By some accounts TPB ‚Äôs tracker has been responsible for 50 % of all Internet traffic , and its founders have been looming larger and larger , waving their pirate flags more and more visibly , for quite a few years .
They are international celebrities and , love them as we might , that made them and TPB targets .
It ‚Äôs not a secret that quite a few peers on the TPB trackers today are ‚Äò spies ‚Äô , there to gather data on legitimate peers ‚Äî a real danger to Bittorrent users .
And as well being feted , Brokep , Anakata and Tiamo have been followed , spied on , raided , arrested , maligned , sentenced and , now live under a real threat of imprisonment .
The bigger we get , the more of a target we are .
Mininova , isoHunt and TPB have all been under siege these last years .
We need to stop thinking about ‚Äò one stop shops ‚Äô for our media .
Distribution and aggregation point the way : think ‚Äò separation of powers ‚Äô .
Clients like Miro can aggregate feeds from a variety of sources according to the needs of the user .
TPB may have represented the needs of the community for half a decade or more , but we do n‚Äôt need them .
We are our own media infrastructure !
(2) We are all The Pirate Bay now ‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ and this is why we have to amend our idea about what being a ‚Äò pirate ‚Äô is .
In the P2P world , as in that of Web 2.0 , it ‚Äôs us and our sharing that makes the value .
Hopefully some of the indignation leveled at The Pirate Bay in the last few days will cause us to think not only about the weirdness of entrusting all this value to TPB , but about all those corporate behemoths ‚Äî
Facebook , say , or Twitter or YouTube ‚Äî who play fast and loose with the value that we create for them every day .
Make no mistake , we ‚Äôll wait a thousand years for the Mark Zuckerbergs of this world to start a foundation with the billions they have made from us and our interactions .
We ‚Äôre all The Pirate Bay now because we all make media ; we all copy media , we all redistribute media and because the ‚Äò war against piracy ‚Äô has criminalized us .
Young or old , middle or working class , any of us could expect that letter from the RIAA or MPAA at any moment .
Our online activities are routinely surveilled in the attempt to preserve a paradigm that is manifestly outdated .
That fits well with the totalitarian mentality of many of our governments and it is n‚Äôt to be accepted casually .
So is it really enough to throw a little bit of bandwidth into the cloud , vote Pirate Party , and then wax indignant about betrayal of a ‚Äò community ‚Äô when its end ( however temporarily ) comes ?
Is that a sufficient resistance to the erosion of our liberties , to which the ‚Äò war against piracy ‚Äô contributes ?
What about grabbing one of the many , free ready made trackers out there and starting up our own Bays ?
By letting a thousand Pirate Bays bloom , we can demonstrate the futility of trying to prop up the old system , speeding the adoption of new models to help artists and ourselves make and distribute culture .
(3) Copy +
Paste will never die .
Actually , as I ‚Äôve said , I suspect that none of TPB ‚Äôs functionality , not a single torrent , will have been lost in this ‚Äò sell out ‚Äô .
I say this partly because of what I know of its founders , and partly because of my conviction that we live in a world in which the copy predominates , evading all attempts to outlaw it and rendering attempts to ‚Äò buy it off ‚Äô futile .
Let ‚Äôs just remind ourselves again : the entire code and all the torrents for TPB ‚Äî information which accounts for half the traffic on the internet ‚Äî fits on a single USB key .
Perhaps someone will find a way to make a torrent of THAT .
And then we can all sit around and wonder what it is , precisely , Global Gaming Factory have bought for all their millions .

Mubarak warns of ' 100 bin Ladens '
CAIRO , Egypt ( Reuters ) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak says the U.S. - led war on Iraq would produce " one hundred new bin Ladens , " driving more Muslims to anti-Western militancy .
" When it is over , if it is over , this war will have horrible consequences , " Mubarak told Egyptian soldiers in the city of Suez on Monday .
" Instead of having one ( Osama ) bin Laden , we will have 100 bin Ladens , " he said .
Osama bin Laden is the Saudi - born fugitive Islamic militant leader blamed by the United States for the September 11 , 2001 attacks on New York and Washington .
Egypt , a key regional U.S. ally which has cracked down hard on Islamic militants , publicly opposes the war launched by Washington to overthrow Iraq 's President Saddam Hussein .
European opponents of the war , led by French President Jacques Chirac , have also argued that military action against Iraq would fuel terrorism and split the international coalition assembled by Washington to fight bin Laden 's al Qaeda network .
Mubarak said Iraqi forces fighting U.S. and British troops were " guarding Iraq 's lands and defending its national honour and nobility " in the conflict .
Reflecting widespread public anger at what many Arabs see as Western aggression against an Arab country , he said the war would cause a " great tragedy ( and ) destroy a deep - rooted culture and people . "
' Double standard '
" Egypt 's position has been and still is clear in rejecting .. . the military option and rejecting participation in military action of the coalition forces against brotherly Iraq , " he said .
Mubarak said the war had raised many questions , especially among the Arab and Muslim peoples of the Middle East , about the " credibility of the international system of collective security represented in the United Nations . "
Many Arabs think Washington has employed double standards in enforcing U.N. resolutions on Iraq while not making Israel comply with resolutions demanding withdrawal from Palestinian territories and an end to Jewish settlements .
( Arab views )
Mubarak read out the highlights of an international plan for Israeli - Palestinian peace called the " roadmap , " saying that while the Palestinian Authority had accepted it , the government of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had asked for 100 changes .
" This means the roadmap has been rendered meaningless .
Unless the big powers agree and put forward a mechanism to implement it without any alterations ...
I believe the roadmap will not move on the right road and it might lead to complications , " he said .

Legal loopholes and insufficient law enforcement mean that Thailand continues to harbour the largest illegal ivory market in Asia , says a new report from the wildlife trade monitoring network TRAFFIC .
The report also raises concerns that legal provisions governing trade in domesticated elephants are providing cover for illegal trade in wild - caught , highly - endangered Asian elephants from both Thailand and neighbouring Myanmar .
TRAFFIC 's survey documented over 26,000 worked ivory products for sale in local markets , with many more retail outlets dealing in ivory products than were observed during market surveys carried out in 2001 .
Market surveys found 50 more retail outlets offering ivory items in Bangkok and Chiang Mai in 2008 than the previous year .
However , overall there was less worked ivory openly on sale than in 2001 .
" Thailand has consistently been identified as one of the world 's top five countries most heavily implicated in the illicit ivory trade , but shows little sign of addressing outstanding issues , " said Tom Milliken , of TRAFFIC , which oversees a global monitoring programme , the Elephant Trade Information System ( ETIS ) , for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) .
" Thailand needs to reassess its policy for controlling its local ivory markets as currently it is not implementing international requirements to the ongoing detriment of both African and Asian Elephant populations , " said Milliken .

" Since 2004 , the Thai government has only reported two ivory seizure cases totaling 1.2 tonnes of raw ivory . "
Thailand 's capital , Bangkok , a major tourist destination , has emerged as the main hub for illegal ivory activities , accounting for over 70 percent of the retail outlets in Thailand offering ivory items for sale .
The report includes new information on ivory workshops ‚Äî eight in Uthai Thani , one each in Chai Nat and Payuha Kiri , and three in Bangkok ‚Äî between them employing dozens of carvers in the production of ivory jewelry , belt buckles and knife - handles .
Much of the ivory being worked is illegally imported from Africa .
Some workshop owners boasted close ties with European knife makers , while others reported sending ivory , steel and silver items to the US for sale in gun shops .
" The Thai Government needs to crack down on this serious illegal activity and stop allowing people to abuse the law , " said Dr Colman O'Criodain , WWF International 's analyst on wildlife trade issues .

" A good first step would be to put in place a comprehensive registration system for all ivory in trade and for live elephants " .
The study also uncovered reports of traders buying wild - caught elephant calves for use in Bangkok as " beggars " on the streets in major tourist centres , or selling them to elephant camps and entertainment parks .
Hundreds of live elephants are known to have been illegally imported from Myanmar in recent years , to be sold to elephant trekking companies catering to adventure tourism in Thailand .
The capture of wild elephants has been banned in Thailand since the 1970s , but such trade usually goes undetected because domesticated elephants do not have to be registered legally until they are eight years of age .
The study also found that over a quarter of all live elephant exports from Thailand between 1980 and 2005 could have been illegal due to incomplete and inaccurate declarations made on the documentation required under CITES .
" There must be greater scrutiny of the live elephant trade if enforcement efforts are to have any impact at all , " said Chris R. Shepherd , TRAFFIC Southeast Asia 's Acting Director .
" Thailand and Myanmar should work together , and with urgency , to address cross - border trade problems , " he added .

The human population started booming in the 19th century with the improvement of common hygiene and medicine techniques .
In the 20th century , the rate of population growth was exponential , meaning that it was frequently doubling .
With the increasing consumption of resources and expansion into new territories , a bigger population inevitably means a bigger impact on the environment .
Many problems like extinction , depletion of drinkable water and general pollution are related to this problem .
At a certain point , the planet will no longer be big enough to absorb all the impacts .
Overpopulation doesn¬ít only apply to humans ; it also concerns other animals , which are part of a food chain .
When the population of a certain species becomes too high , the one under it on the food chain ( their food ) becomes rarer .
It works the same way for humans , but since they consume all type of resources , the impact is practically on the entire planet .
Not only that , because humans have no natural predators , there is nothing to balance the numbers .
Painting by Dave Todaro , http://nuvango.com/davetodaro
How do you manage overpopulation ?
We have to look further then just using condoms and contraception pills .
Some countries like China and India are able to establish laws to contain the population growth .
They call it family planning and it gives an advantage to a family having only one child .
However , what we observe in the world is that countries that are well developed tend to have a stable or declining population .
Education to both sexes ( especially women ) , birth control and increasing wealth would be three elements that help containing the population growth .
Until those elements are spread on a larger scale , the population growth in the world will keep accelerating , resources will become rarer and pollution will keep increasing .

Courtesy Jon and Lu via FlickrWhat is it with Preeminent Thinkers and intensely bleak public lectures ?
Two weeks ago Earth Institute economist Jeffrey Sachs , in an address at the Asia Society in New York , argued that climate change cannot be averted without massive use of unproven carbon - capture and sequestration technology and that China will provide little to no political help in curbing emissions .
On Monday night at Seattle ‚Äôs Town Hall , British scientist James Lovelock gave a prediction of the effects of climate change that was even more dire .
Efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions are just fine , he said .
They just wo n‚Äôt amount to much .
‚Äú Our main task , should the earth continue to heat , is to adapt and learn how to survive , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú We ‚Äôre unlikely to become extinct by global heating , but we may be cut back to one billion people or less . ‚Äù
That ‚Äôs approximately a seventh the world ‚Äôs current population .
Lovelock , who turns 90 next month , made his name in the early 1970s by putting forth the Gaia Hypothesis that the Earth ‚Äôs physical and biological processes are self - regulating and sustaining , not sentient but in some sense a cohesive ‚Äú being . ‚Äù
I ‚Äôm not up - to - speed on Gaia ‚Äôs complex influence on the scientific establishment , but it ‚Äôs been ridiculed and dismissed as more metaphysics than science , yet also influential among biologists and ecologists .
In more recent books ‚Äî The Revenge of Gaia and The Vanishing Face of Gaia ‚Äî Lovelock has turned his attention to ‚Äú global heating , ‚Äù his preferred term because ‚Äú warming ‚Äù sounds too benign .
He alluded to what Gaia has to say about global heating , though he never really spelled it out .
‚Äú The Earth does not just accept climate change passively , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú It responds to what we ‚Äôre doing to it , and that response is far more frightening than what we ‚Äôre doing . ‚Äù
Despite the futility of trying to avoid all of the effects of global heating , Lovelock recommended a few measures .
He said nuclear and solar thermal power were the only sensible clean energy responses , and that the U.S. might learn from France about safe handling and disposal of nuclear waste .
That rankled a number of audience members who pointed out the problem - riddled waste handling project at the Hanford Nuclear Site in eastern Washington .
Lovelock also seemed open to trying a number of geoengineering climate fixes .
One man asked him about injecting aerosols into the upper atmosphere to reflect solar heat away from the Earth .
Lovelock compared such approaches to dialysis for failing kidneys .
‚Äú It will buy you time , but it ‚Äôs not a cure , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú Then again , if your kidneys fail , you never refuse dialysis . ‚Äù
* Connecticut plan could be in place by 2012
* Critics say it ‚Äôs too expensive at $ 1 billion a year
HARTFORD , Conn. , July 22 ( Reuters ) - Lawmakers in Connecticut are moving ahead with plans for universal healthcare in the absence of federal legislation , following the lead of a pioneering law in neighboring Massachusetts .
As the Obama administration and Democratic leaders in the U.S. Congress struggle to find support for a plan to extend healthcare to millions of Americans , Connecticut is one of a handful of states seeking to go it alone and reverse a trend that has left more than 47 million Americans uninsured .
The Democratic - controlled legislature overrode a veto by Republican Governor Jodi Rell on Monday to create a nine - member board to craft a universal healthcare system .
The board will make recommendations to lawmakers by Jan. 1 , 2011 , on a healthcare plan called SustiNet that will cover nearly all of Connecticut ‚Äôs 3.5 million people , including an estimated 350,000 in the state without coverage .
Democrats hold veto - proof , two - thirds majorities in the state ‚Äôs House of Representatives and Senate and voted along strict party lines to pass the SustiNet bill .
Massachusetts passed a first - in - the - nation law in 2006 that makes health coverage mandatory , bringing it within reach of poorer people through subsidies and industry reforms .
Other states are also moving ahead with reforms , including Vermont and Maine , as Massachusetts struggles to pay for its law .
Connecticut ‚Äôs system will be built around a large health insurance pool in which state employees are pooled together with participants in Medicaid , the joint federal - state health insurance program for the poor and elderly .
That pool would then be expanded to include private employers and people without health insurance who would be offered the same health benefits available to state government workers .
Any state resident can join , regardless of health .
Specific details , including how it will be funded , are to be determined .
It is scheduled to begin on July 1 , 2012 .
COST CONCERNS
Backers contend it would drive down costs by covering primary care treatment for patients , reducing the need for expensive emergency room care .
Critics say it ‚Äôs too costly , would sink the state deeper into debt and shatter the state health insurance industry , a mainstay of the state economy .
The bill itself does not mandate health insurance for all citizens , as Massachusetts does , but instead directs those designing the law to explore whether such a mandate is needed .
The panel would also create task forces addressing obesity , tobacco use and the number of healthcare workers .
Governor Rell said she vetoed it because of concerns over cost , estimating it will require $ 1 billion a year .
The state has been without a budget since July 1 and projects a $ 8.9 billion deficit over the next two fiscal years .
‚Äú The Democrats in the legislature have not passed a biennial budget yet they have approved a new , $ 1 billion spending program without providing a way to pay for it , ‚Äù said Rell .
‚Äú The simple fact is that the families and employers of Connecticut cannot afford the new taxes that will be required by this new program , ‚Äù she added .
Universal Health Care Foundation , a Connecticut non-profit group , said at least 325,000 people in the state lack health insurance coverage .
‚Äú Under SustiNet , we do anticipate affordable public health insurance options starting in 2012 , ‚Äù said its president , Juan Figueroa .
He said a goal is to cover 98 percent of the state ‚Äôs population by 2014 .

What will happen to the people who have been arrested in the protest rallies in Iran ?
I can tell you .
I was arrested during the 1999 student demonstrations in Tehran , exactly 10 years ago .
What I did was as trivial in terms of real crime as what the protesters in Iran have done now by expressing rage over the presidential election results .
But the punishment I received was so out of proportion to my actions ‚Äì and so truly criminal ‚Äì that I had to flee my homeland and seek political asylum in Europe .
In 1999 , Mohammad Khatami was president and reformist hopes were high that the Islamic republic ‚Äôs oppressive ideological atmosphere was lifting slightly .
I was a university student and we were enjoying an unprecedented amount of freedom to speak our minds in class .
That included the compulsory class all students have to take in the roots of the Islamic Revolution .
At that time , even the presence of the Basij among the students ‚Äì 50 percent of all university places are reserved for the members of the militia ‚Äì did not have its usual chilling effect .
Change was in the air .
Then came the sparks that ignited the demonstrations that swept campuses across Tehran and spread to other cities in the summer of 1999 .
Some students at Tehran University protested the closure of one of the most popular reformist newspapers .
Their small demonstration was attacked by vigilantes armed with clubs who beat at least one student to death as police did nothing .
Our rage boiled over .
Tens of thousands of students took to the streets demanding the dismissal of police officials .
We also called on Khatami to speed up reforms and give us a more open society .
I was with a group of about 50 students on my campus which tore down a poster of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that hung in one of the buildings .
Someone set fire to the picture .
The riot police took the simplest course .
They locked the campus gates and arrested everyone found inside .
But they did not take us to a police station .
Instead , we were blindfolded and taken outside of the legal system to a place where our parents could never find us .
The place was one of the semi- abandoned military camps outside Tehran that date back to the Iran - Iraq war of the 1980s .
There we were shoved into metal freight containers ‚Äì the kind used for shipping .
They stripped us naked and gave us two blankets each .
Inside there was nothing to sleep on and no electric light .
There was no way to tell the time except by the daylight when it shone through the watchman ‚Äôs peephole at one end and a ventilation vent at the other .
I was in the container with four other boys .
We were all barely 20 .
And we were inside for two weeks -- naked , powerless , and face - to - face with the fear of being totally at the mercy of our captors .
Food was thrown in once a day .
From time to time , we were taken out for questioning .
And both those processes helped to destroy whatever shreds of our dignity remained .
The first interrogation sessions were simply beatings .
Men who were clearly convinced that we had violated all laws of God and man kicked us until we fell down .
Then they kicked our faces .
As they did , they shouted ‚Äú Allahu Akbar , ‚Äù calling on God to be pleased with them .
They were skinheads , but with hair and beards .
Then the real questioning began , and it , too , was to show there was no way out .
The interrogators wanted to know who pulled down the picture of the Supreme Leader , to what organizations I belonged , and to what organizations my friends and classmates belonged .
It did not matter what I said .
There were no correct answers .
‚Äú Do you know Masud Rajavi ( the spiritual leader of the armed resistance group , the People ‚Äôs Mujahedin of Iran ) ? ‚Äù ‚Äú No . ‚Äù ‚Äú You are lying .
Everyone knows that bastard .
You are lying about everything .
‚Äù Sometimes they seemed to want to understand my problem .
‚Äú You were one of those who shouted , ‚Äù the interrogator said .
‚Äú No , I was n‚Äôt .
‚Äù ‚Äú You were !
Go ahead and shout now .
Shout as much as you want .
‚Äù And they offered treatment .
‚Äú You have extreme tendencies .
You just need some balancing .
‚Äù And then , turning to one of the strongmen , ‚Äú Brother X , take him for balancing . ‚Äù
The balancing was more beating .
The interrogations were conducted with a hood over my head .
Looking down , I could see only the floor .
Once I saw the hands of one of the interrogators after he cuffed my head .
His hands were twice the size of mine .
After two weeks , I was transferred to a succession of other prison cells , with no idea where I was .
Sometimes , the cells were pitch dark .
Sometimes , they had four brilliant light bulbs shining 24 hours a day .
I was lucky I had nothing to confess .
And I was lucky that made me of no real interest to my captors .
After eight months , as inexplicably as the way they had treated me , they let me go .
But now I was a criminal with a history of imprisonment .
And that meant all of Iran would be my lifetime prison .
With a prison record , I could not return to university .
I could not get a job .
My only course was to leave Tehran and return to my small provincial city .
And there , where everyone knows everyone , I was an outcast .
My parents had all but given me up for dead .
For months they had gone around every prison in Tehran trying to locate me .
At every place , they were told there was no record of me being detained .
But one official said it was likely I had been made to ‚Äú disappear .
‚Äù The police sent my prison file to an old man in my home town who had lost three sons in the Iran - Iraq war .
He owned a men ‚Äôs shoe store next to the local bank that no one shopped in because the fashions were 10 years old .
But he was powerful because he was strongly linked to the Revolutionary Guards .
This man was my parole officer .
I had to appear before him each week to show I was still in town .
If I wanted to visit friends in another city , I needed his permission .
His only demand of me was to pray .
Not just in the mosque but in private prayer meetings as well .
And eventually , I complied .
That was how I began my journey out of Iran .
As he gained trust in me , I could more easily get permission for longer absences .
And on one of these absences , I slipped out of the country .
The escape route that people take -- across the Iranian border , across Turkey , by ship to Greece , and overland to France -- is well known .
Some of those who are now in jail for protesting the presidential election results ‚Äì if they are released -- will undoubtedly take it , too .
It is horrible , full of dangers , and as dehumanizing as being in prison .
I was tricked by traffickers as one group handed me off to another that claimed it had not been paid .
So , I soon ran out of money .
I rode in freight containers .
And I rode hanging onto the bottom of a speeding truck .
That means sitting on a small metal bar a half - meter above the asphalt and hanging on with arms that become so paralyzed the muscles no longer contract .
I was numb with fear .
Was it worth this to escape my home country and to leave my parents and dearest friends ?
Of course not .
But for me it was a question I never had to ask .
The government of my country took my country away from me .
And my crime was nothing more than taking part in a political demonstration .

In a direct challenge to Microsoft , Google announced late Tuesday that it is developing an operating system for PCs that is tied to its Chrome Web browser .
The software , called the Google Chrome Operating System , is initially intended for use in the tiny , low - cost portable computers known as netbooks , which have been selling quickly even as demand for other PCs has plummeted .
Google said it believed the software would also be able to power full - size PCs .
The move is likely to sharpen the already intense competition between Google and Microsoft , whose Windows operating system controls the basic functions of the vast majority of personal computers .
‚Äú Speed , simplicity and security are the key aspects of Google Chrome OS , ‚Äù said Sundar Pichai , vice president of product management , and Linus Upson , engineering director , in a post on a company blog .
‚Äú We ‚Äôre designing the OS to be fast and lightweight , to start up and get you onto the Web in a few seconds . ‚Äù

The Alleged Fallacies of Evolutionary Theory
In Issue 44 , Peter Williams claimed to have found numerous logical fallacies in the writings of Richard Dawkins .
His article has provoked this blow - by - blow response from Massimo Pigliucci , Joshua Banta , Christen Bossu , Paula Crouse , Troy Dexter , Kerry Hansknecht and Norris Muth .
The neo -Darwinian theory of evolution is the currently accepted paradigm to explain the history and diversity of life on earth .
Yet , ever since the publication of Darwin ‚Äôs Origin of Species it has been under attack on a variety of grounds .
Some of these criticisms have been put forth in the philosophical arena , where evolutionary theory has often been accused of being incoherent or logically fallacious .
Perhaps the best - known philosophical criticism of evolution has been put forth by Karl Popper , who once claimed that ‚Äú Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory , but a metaphysical research program ‚Äù ( Unended Quest , 1976 ) .
Famously , Popper retracted his comments , once it was explained to him that there was quite a bit more to the theory of evolution than he had understood from a cursory examination of the subject : ‚Äú I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection ; and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation ‚Äù ( Dialectica 32:344-346 ) .
In Issue 44 of Philosophy Now , Peter Williams listed a bewildering array of eleven logical fallacies allegedly committed by evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in a variety of his writings .
In what follows we reexamine each of the fallacies and comment on the extent to which Dawkins actually commits them .
This article is not meant as a defense of Dawkins ( who can surely take care of himself ) , but rather as a stimulating exercise tackling the logical framework of modern evolutionary theory and its real or perceived philosophical implications .
The Alleged Fallacies
1. Self - Contradiction ‚Äì a statement that refers to and falsifies itself .
Williams quotes an open letter of Dawkins to his daughter , in which he advises her to think for herself , determine if a claim is being made on the basis of evidence or authority , and ask for evidence whenever somebody claims to know the truth .
The problem allegedly is that Dawkins is conflating evidence with empirical evidence , from which it apparently derives that Dawkins also equates knowledge with scientific knowledge .
Since the latter position is not itself based on empirical evidence , it follows that Dawkins contradicts himself by suggesting a course of action to his daughter that cannot actually be backed up by the very methods proposed by Dawkins .
We feel Williams is reading too much into Dawkins ‚Äô advice .
Dawkins starts out by simply suggesting a sensible course of action to his daughter whenever faced with evaluating somebody ‚Äôs claim to truth ; he is not saying that his advice is scientific , nor is he equating knowledge with scientific knowledge .
As for what counts as evidence , the American Heritage Dictionary defines the latter as : ‚Äú the available facts , circumstances , etc. , indicating whether or not a thing is true or valid . ‚Äù
From this perspective , most evidence is in fact empirical .
The only exception would be mathematical or logical reasoning , although most people would n‚Äôt think of this as ‚Äò evidence ‚Äô so much as a ‚Äò reason ‚Äô in favor of a certain conclusion .
Finally , empirical ( but not necessarily scientific ) evidence for Dawkins ‚Äô statement could be brought in : one only needs to compare the number of successful decisions that people make about , say , their finances based on reading their horoscopes vs. following the advice of a financial expert ( if the latter is backed by empirical evidence on the performance of various portfolios ) .
2. Begging the Question - the fallacy of using the conclusion of an argument as one of the premises employed to establish that conclusion .
The problem here is that Dawkins seems to assume a naturalistic and gradualistic explanation for the diversification of life on earth .
He claims that one can see that this must be true without stirring from one ‚Äôs chair , as any other explanation can be ruled out on first principles .
Williams concludes that Dawkins must take this philosophical ( not scientific ) position because he wants to exclude intelligent design a priori .
Indeed , Dawkins should not have said that one can see the truth of Darwinian evolution without stirring from one ‚Äôs chair .
Evolutionary biology is an empirical science , and it is only because of more than a century and a half of investigation that we have concluded that it is the best available explanation for the history of life on this planet .
But there are two crucial distinctions that Williams fails to make : a ) Darwinian gradualism is only one of a panoply of naturalistic explanations of evolution ( others include Lamarckism , orthogenesis , and saltationism ) ; while it is indeed the one currently most widely accepted by scientists , it is false to charge that it is the only game in town and is therefore accepted by default .
b)
Both Dawkins and Williams should make the all - important distinction between philosophical and methodological naturalism .
Philosophical naturalism , the position that all there is to the world is natural phenomena , is indeed outside of science proper .
But what all scientists espouse is methodological naturalism , the operational position that the best way to find a testable explanation for a phenomenon is to assume that only natural laws are at work .
While creationists make a big deal of this alleged ‚Äò bias ‚Äô , in fact all of us behave as methodological naturalists most of the time .
We are willing to bet ( and this is an empirically verifiable prediction ) that the next time that Williams ‚Äô car breaks down he will not go to church and ask his preacher to fix it ; he will instead bring it to a mechanic , seeking a natural solution to the problem .
Moreover , even if the mechanic should not find any remedy , Williams will not therefore turn to God , but will ditch the car assuming ( reasonably ) that the facts are simply insufficient to find the correct natural fix , and that he is better served by another means of transportation .
3 . The False Dilemma -
Two choices are given when in actuality there are more choices possible .
Williams quotes Dawkins saying that William Paley ‚Äôs supernatural explanation for the complexity of life and Charles Darwin ‚Äôs natural alternative are mutually exclusive .
Williams cites Michael Poole as clarifying the difference between explanations in terms of agency and those in terms of mechanisms .
The two do not have to be in contradiction , since a particular agent ( say , God ) could use a given mechanism ( say , natural selection ) to achieve whatever goal the agent sets forth .
We see two problems with Williams ‚Äô position : first , he equivocates on Paley .
Paley was not talking about God just being the agent determining biological complexity , he thought of God as also being the mechanism : in other words , it is anachronistic to see Paley as a theistic evolutionist , since he was defending the classical Christian doctrine that God created humans and everything else directly , not through the action of natural laws .
Second , while at a more general level Poole is correct that agency and mechanism are not necessarily mutually exclusive , ‚Äò God did it ‚Äô simply does not qualify as a scientific explanation ( or , in fact , as any sort of explanation ) , because it does n‚Äôt add anything to the explanatory schema .
4 . The Fallacy of Equivocation - a word is used in two different contexts and is assumed to have the same meaning in both contexts , when distinct meanings ought to be preferred .
Williams here takes Dawkins to task for shifting the meaning of the word ‚Äò designoid ‚Äô , coined to explain why the appearance of design in biological organisms is just that , an appearance .
Dawkins says that there are natural objects that superficially look like the result of design , for example a rock looking a bit like the face of an American President .
He claims that this is the same sort of phenomenon that induces people to think that , say , the vertebrate eye is designed .
The problem is that the first type of ‚Äò designoid ‚Äô is obvious ( i.e. , people immediately realize that the face was not actually carved ) , while the second is much more subtle and ‚Äì Williams claims ‚Äì therefore belongs to a different category .
We think Williams is partially right here : Dawkins did choose a bad example , and for fundamentally wrong reasons .
The resemblance of a cliff outcropping to a human face is the result of entirely random causes ( wind patterns , the consistency of the rock , etc. ) , while biological organisms are the outcome of two processes : mutation ( which is indeed random ) and natural selection ( which is anything but random ) .
That is why Dawkins ‚Äô designoids do n‚Äôt cut it .
However , Dawkins ‚Äô fundamental point can be rescued by simply using a better analogy .
There are natural , non-biological , processes that convey the impression of intelligent design and provide us with a more closer parallel to evolution .
For example , on many rocky beaches , pebbles are sorted by size going from the waterline towards the interior , in a distinctly nonrandom pattern .
This is not because somebody got all the pebbles out of the ocean , carefully weighed them , and then constructed the beach .
Rather , the pattern was created by the joint action of two processes : the ( random ) action of waves and the ( nonrandom ) effects of gravity .
5 . The Non Sequitur ‚Äì Comments or claims that do not logically follow from what has gone before , but that are presented as if they do .
Williams here leaves the field entirely to a quote from Stephen Barr , who accuses Dawkins of attempting to defend science from allegations of being ‚Äò joyless ‚Äô and ‚Äò arid ‚Äô , while not recognizing that ‚Äò the public ‚Äô raises those objections to atheism , not to science itself .
Apparently , Dawkins does not seem to see the difference between science and atheism .
It is a bit difficult to make sense of what exactly the charge is here , and especially of why this would be an example of non sequitur .
We take it that Williams ‚Äô intended target of criticism is the move from modern science ‚Äôs discoveries to the philosophical position of atheism .
Dawkins does indeed often state that his atheism is reinforced by the scientific understanding of the world : the more science finds out about nature , the less room there is for a direct intervention by supernatural entities .
Now , if what Dawkins means is that atheism is logically implied by evolution , then he is surely wrong .
On the other hand , to deduce philosophical ( moral , existential , etc. ) conclusions from the best available knowledge of the world is certainly not illogical , and seems to be the rational thing to do .
The important distinction , therefore , is between an atheism that is informed by science ( which is plausible ) , and one that is made logically necessary by science ( which is illogical ) .
6. Special Pleading ( double standard ) - the fallacy in which one criticises others for falling short of particular standards and rules , while taking oneself to be exempt , without adequately justifying that exemption .
The alleged fallacy here lies in the fact that Dawkins on the one hand rejects ‚Äò God ‚Äô as an explanation , on the ground that there is no way to tell where God himself came from , while at the same time accepts natural selection as a valid explanation of the diversity of life on earth , even though natural selection itself cannot explain where life comes from .
We see three problems in William ‚Äôs position : First , natural selection was never meant as a theory of life ‚Äôs origins , while ‚Äò God did it ‚Äô clearly is .
Second , Dawkins would be engaging in special pleading if he had not provided an account of how natural selection ( not life ) began , since the explanatory principle parallel to ‚Äò God ‚Äô here is selection , not life ( life is what needs to be explained by either ‚Äò hypothesis ‚Äô ) .
But evolutionary biology does have an explanation for how natural selection comes into being : it happens as soon as there is a population of self - replicating , variable , molecules .
No such explanation is available for God .
Third ‚Äì once again ‚Äì ‚Äò God did it ‚Äô is not an explanation , but a fancy way of admitting ignorance : an explanation is an account of mechanisms ( such as natural selection ) , not a label to put on the facts .
7. Wishful Thinking - a fallacy that posits a belief because it or its consequence is desired to be true .
Williams comes really close to catching Dawkins ( but not science in general ) in flagrante delicto .
Dawkins is cited by Williams writing that nobody knows how life on earth originated , but it must have been by natural causes .
If Dawkins is reaching that conclusion ‚Äì as Williams alleges ‚Äì because of his philosophical position of naturalism ( i.e. , atheism ) , then he is in fact engaging in wishful thinking ( though no more than the other side when they say that life must have originated from an act of special creation ) .
However , there is a more moderate interpretation of Dawkins ‚Äô statement : he is just being a good scientist in accepting as a matter of methodology that the only way to find a scientific explanation for the origin of life is to tentatively assume that there is one that does n‚Äôt include supernatural intervention .
One may not like the idea that science is limited to natural explanations , but it is hard to see what sort of experiments or testable hypotheses could possibly emerge from introducing a supernatural fiat into these matters .
As an aside , we also point out that Williams ‚Äô statement that there is ‚Äú a large body of scientific evidence against ‚Äù a naturalistic theory of the origin of life is simply false ( see , for example , The Emergence of Life on Earth : a Historical and Scientific Overview by I. Fry , Rutgers University Press , 2000 . )
8 . The Red Herring - A Red Herring is an irrelevant topic or premise brought into a discussion to divert attention from the topic at hand .
Usually , the irrelevancy is subtle , so that it appears relevant to those not paying close attention .
This is really another version of the objection raised under fallacy # 6 , but with a different twist .
Williams claims that the real problem of evolutionary theory is to explain the origin of catalytic proteins ( enzymes ) , and accuses Dawkins of distracting his readers from it by introducing natural selection as an explanation of how enzymes became more complex beginning from a simple molecule .
Once again , evolution by natural selection is not , and was never meant to be , a theory of life ‚Äôs origins .
Ironically , it is the creationists who make a red herring out of this issue , since they keep misinterpreting the scope of evolutionary theory .
Natural selection is ( demonstrably ) perfectly capable of changing and improving the catalytic actions of proteins , which is all the theory claims .
On the other hand , it is true that we still do n‚Äôt know how the first replicators originated ; however , what is needed for a naturalistic theory of origins is that the first replicators were simple enough to originate randomly .
This does not seem an inordinately unlikely supposition .
Lastly , it is interesting that Williams introduces the concept of ‚Äò irreducible complexity ‚Äô of proteins as if it were widely accepted in science .
It is not .
9. Straw Man Argument - a type of Red Herring that attacks a misrepresentation of an opponent ‚Äôs position .
That is called to burn a straw man .
It is a surprisingly common fallacy , because it is easy to misunderstand another person ‚Äôs position .
The incriminating passage here is one in which Dawkins states that the difference between science and religion is that the former is based on evidence and ‚Äò gets results ‚Äô , while neither apply to the latter .
Williams , curiously , takes this to be an attack on Christianity in particular , and responds that there has been a strong Christian tradition of valuing rationality .
First , Dawkins was taking aim at religion in general , not especially at Christianity .
Second , the criticism was that religion is not based on evidence , which is not the same as accusing religious people of not valuing rationality .
One can construe rational arguments in favor of the existence of God , but one cannot provide any evidence to back up such constructs .
Science is an inextricable combination of rationality and evidence : without the latter , it would not be different from logic or philosophy .
Lastly , while it is certainly true that there are great traditions of rational inquiry within Christianity , do we need to remind Williams that the Church always put very strict limits on such ‚Äò free inquiry ‚Äô ?
Just think of Bruno , Copernicus and Galileo .
The scholarly tradition of the Catholic Church is surely well represented by the Jesuits ( for example , they run the Vatican astronomical observatory in Italy ) , and yet it was the Jesuits who opposed Galileo and famously refused to acknowledge the observational evidence he was providing through his telescopes .
It is hard to think of a better example of how differently science and religion approach the relationship between rationality and faith .
10 . Ad Hominem ‚Äì the fallacy of attacking the individual instead of the argument .
Dawkins , in his characteristic bluntness , likens people who believe in God to children who believe in Santa Claus .
Williams takes this to be an ad hominem attack , and hence a logical fallacy .
Williams then goes on , somewhat curiously , to state that even children are sometimes right , and that therefore one cannot dismiss childish beliefs altogether .
We chastise Dawkins for his language , which is sure to inflame and certain not to gain him much sympathy .
On the other hand , this hardly qualifies as a fallacy because Dawkins is not using the ‚Äò belief in God = childish thinking ‚Äô equation as an argument against the existence of God .
On the contrary , he begins with the premise that God is a fairy tale and then deduces ( in a perfectly logical manner , if one accepts the premise ) that believing in God is as childish as believing in fairy tales .
Of course children ( or childish adults ) can be right about certain things , but Socrates ( in Plato ‚Äôs Meno ) convincingly argued that true belief without cause is nothing to brag about .
11 . Poisoning the well - a form of ad hominem attack that occurs before the meat of an argument , biasing the audience against the opponent ‚Äôs side before he can present his case .
Dawkins is once again taken to task for his language .
In some of his writings , he alleges that no qualified scientist doubts the reality of evolution , the implication being that one should not pay attention to arguments advanced from people who do not believe in evolution , because they are not qualified on such matters .
As in other cases , we agree with the criticism of Dawkins ‚Äô language , which is clearly hyperbolic ( heck , if one searches hard enough one can find qualified scientists who doubt quantum mechanics , by most accounts the best scientific theory of all time ! ) .
Dawkins can indeed reasonably be taken to be ‚Äò poisoning the well ‚Äô here .
However , we find Williams in turn to be rather disingenuous ( and relying on an appeal to authority , a fallacy in itself ) when he quotes three allegedly qualified and unbiased authors on his behalf : William Dembski , Jonathan Wells , and Thomas Woodward .
All three are open Christian apologists , and therefore cannot seriously be considered to be ideologically unbiased ( note that while Dawkins is an open atheist , there is a large number of religious people from many denominations among evolutionary scientists ) .
Moreover , Dembski has degrees in mathematics and philosophy , Woodward teaches theology at a fundamentalist Christian school for ministers , and Wells has a degree in biochemistry and molecular biology .
None of them are qualified to comment on evolution for the simple reason that their degrees are not in any of the organismal biological sciences .
One of us ( Massimo Pigliucci ) has a Ph.D. in Botany , which is an organismal biological science , but he would hardly feel qualified to comment about the reasonableness of , say , quantum mechanics .
Just because one has a Ph.D. one is not automatically qualified to pontificate on all topics , as much as one ‚Äôs ego might incline one to think so .
Science , Philosophy , and the Limits of Logic
This entire discussion is based on the concept of logical fallacies .
But reasoning can be logical , and even correct , at the same time that it is strictly speaking fallacious .
For example , one of the classical fallacies is the post hoc ergo propter hoc ( after that , therefore because of that ) , where one infers that the cause of a certain effect is a particular event on the basis of the fact that the alleged cause preceded the effect in short time ( e.g. , I woke up with a headache this morning ; I drunk red wine last night ; ergo the wine caused the headache ) .
It is important to realize in what ( very strict ) sense post hoc ergo propter hoc is a fallacy : if one wishes to say that it necessarily follows that if two events are temporally close to each other , then the first one causes the second one , this is obviously not true .
We have plenty of examples of temporal sequences the elements of which are not causally connected ( e.g. , last night it also happened to be full moon , but that very likely had nothing to do with my headache this morning ) .
However , it is perfectly rational to begin the investigation into causes based on correlations , which is exactly what science does .
If I know that certain kinds of red wine ( e.g. , high in sulfites ) are prone to cause headaches in certain individuals , and if I repeatedly observe that when I drink those kinds of wine I often develop a headache the following morning , then I am logically justified in tentatively concluding ( pending further evidence ) that my headaches really are caused by high sulfites levels in red wine ( and I ought to stop drinking such concoctions ) .
It follows from all of this that science is inherently an approach that can lead only to tentative conclusions , while if one wishes Truth one is limited to the realm of logic and mathematics .
Philosophy occupies an interesting middle ground between these two approaches : while a philosopher attempts to build bullet - proof logical arguments ( i.e. , she aims at logical truth of the formal kind ) , the premises of her reasoning can only be of two types ( Hume ‚Äôs famous ‚Äò fork ‚Äô ) .
Either one starts with arbitrary or unfounded statements , in which case even logically tight reasoning leads nowhere ; or one begins with empirical observations about the world , and philosophy therefore shares some of the limitations of science .
A lot of ink and bad feelings would be avoided if people realized that human beings ( with the exception of logicians ) cannot attain Truth , but only more or less likely maybes .

There ‚Äôs something thrilling going on in Iran .
You would n‚Äôt know it from the coverage on many mainstream media news outlets this weekend ( Fox , CNN and ABC , I ‚Äôm looking in your direction ) , but there ‚Äôs a revolution going on in Iran !
It ‚Äôs a good kind of revolution ; pro-freedom , pro-democracy and mostly peaceful ( though many protestors are being beaten by police and Hezbollah thugs ) .
The people of Iran are standing up for truth and justice and they are not being intimidated by theocratic thugs and government lies .
It makes me wonder why our U.S. media is n‚Äôt really standing with the people of Iran .
Maybe it ‚Äôs because I ‚Äôm getting cynical in my ( heh ) old age , but I think it has something to do with the loss of their favorite boogey - man .
It ‚Äôs getting harder and harder to portray Iranians as fanatical terrorists bent on the destruction of the West :
Perhaps the most moving scene involved a group of young demonstrators , displaying the green colours of Mir-Hossein Mousavi , the defeated challenger , breaking into English and chanting : ‚Äú We want freedom .
‚Äù In an instant , these television pictures from Tehran delivered a stark reminder that Iran is not a backward country of medieval fanatics , but a modern nation with 70 million people , two thirds of whom are under 30 and have the same interests and aspirations as their Western counterparts .
These are my peers .
My fellow - Twitterers .
My friends .
My brothers and sisters .
This is the real Iran :
No more distortions .
No more hate .
No more fear - mongering , Fox News !
No more !
We are the same , the Iranian People and those of us in the United States who still value and cherish freedom .
There is no difference between us beyond geography .
Many of the Iranians even speak English and they are young and internet - savvy : they have been using Twitter to organize on the fly and there was a collective moan when Facebook was blocked .
This is a youth movement that is cracking the edifice of lies that have served the hardliners on both sides for far too long .
Just do n‚Äôt watch television if you want the real scoop :
Today , as global geopolitics is shaken to its core by events in Iran , I turned on cable news this morning , and saw endless ads for a Larry King Jonas Brothers ‚Äú interview ‚Äù , Morning Joe yukking it up discussing Kuwaiti massage therapists , a video of a tomato throwing contest on CNN , talk radio blowhard Bill Bennett ‚Ä¶ and occasionally a phone call from Christiane Amanpour in Tehran .
I ca n‚Äôt even bring myself to turn on the network morning programs , I might vomit .
The mainstream media is rapidly smothering itself into a coma of irrelevance .
Do they think we ‚Äôre too stupid to get the news from somewhere else ?
Heck , I do n‚Äôt even need the media at this point ; I can get info directly from the participants in the struggle via Twitter .
Bloggers like Andrew Sullivan are covering the protests virtually nonstop .
With the Huffington Post on the case , who needs the MSM ?
At this point , Big Media is just playing catch - up .
They were asleep at the switch for several days , but now seem to be paying attention again ‚Ä¶ but they are definitely not leading ; they are following .
I should note that I ‚Äôm taking it for granted that the election was stolen .
They apparently did not even do a good job of it .
From the numbers I ‚Äôve seen , Ahmadinejad did n‚Äôt even finish second !
He finished 3rd , behind another reform candidate !
Mousavi , the challenger and probable winner , was actually told by the Interior Ministry that he had won and to prepare his victory speech ( which they insisted must be gracious and not boastful ) before turning around and declaring Ahmadinejad the winner by a landslide .
The numbers belie this laughable claim .
The official results have Mousavi losing his home turf ( preposterous ) and big urban areas where he has polled higher than Ahmadinejad .
Let ‚Äôs face it :
This election was straight - up rigged .
The Iranians know it and they ‚Äôre not standing for it , which is more than I can say for Americans ( * cough - 2000 - cough * ) .
Now is our chance to repent for our laziness and apathy and support the democracy - loving Iranians with all our hearts !
I stand with the Iranian People in solidarity .
We stand for Democracy , Freedom and Justice !
May the winds of change bring peace and prosperity to Iran .
Peace be upon you !
Midwest Airlines Inc.'s name will remain , some of its jets will still have wide seats , and the carrier promises more nonstop routes from Milwaukee under the ownership of Republic Airways Holdings Inc. of Indianapolis .
Announced Tuesday , Republic 's purchase of Midwest from TPG Capital , a Texas investment firm , would end 25 years of local control for the largest airline to fly out of Mitchell International Airport .
The scope of the changes is underscored by the decision of longtime Midwest Chief Executive Officer Timothy Hoeksema to retire once the sale becomes final in four to six weeks .
Several Midwest passengers at Mitchell International Airport said the news did not surprise them .
" In its heyday , it was quite a treat to fly them , " said Dick Tollefsen of Fox Point .
" They 're more like an ordinary airline now . "
Although the vast majority of Midwest 's 1,640 employees are expected to keep their jobs , there will be cuts , said Bryan Bedford , Republic CEO and future CEO of Midwest .
Those will occur mainly among administrative and back - office employees who are doing work similar to that of their Republic counterparts , he said .
Midwest 's 112 union pilots and 120 union flight attendants will likely face pay cuts as they are integrated into Republic 's labor contract , which pays lower salaries to its union flight crews .
Bryan Jandorf , spokesman for the Midwest pilots union , said the group was encouraged by Bedford 's plans to expand Midwest and looked forward to working with the new management team .
Bedford said Republic wanted to hire Midwest flight crews .
Other Midwest employees , including ground employees at Mitchell and other airports , marketing and sales employees , mechanics and customer service representatives , also are needed , he said .
Restoring routes
Republic plans to restore some destinations that Midwest cut last year , when the Oak Creek carrier reduced service 40 % after jet fuel prices spiked .
That was among the steepest service reductions by a U.S. carrier in 2008 .
It included the elimination of nonstop service from Milwaukee to around 15 cities , such as Los Angeles , San Diego , Seattle , Baltimore and St. Louis .
Bedford declined to say which routes Republic plans to restore .
" Look at what was Midwest 's network 12 months ago , and you get a good gauge of where we 're headed , " Bedford said .
Midwest 's biggest competitive distinction will be its offering of more nonstop flights from Milwaukee than other airlines , including low - fare carriers Southwest Airlines and AirTran Airways , he said .
The largest Republic aircraft is the 94 - seat Embraer 190 jet , which Midwest is to begin flying nonstop to Los Angeles on Aug .
1 . Bedford said those jets would each include 10 seats that are the wide " signature " seats .
Bedford said the signature seats would be another selling point for Midwest , which has built a reputation for good customer service .
The Embraer jets are to be phased in over nine to 12 months to replace Midwest 's nine remaining 99 - seat Boeing 717 jets , which each provide 40 signature seats .
Speculation about Republic 's buying Midwest had been building among airline industry observers in recent months .
Republic 's role at Midwest has been growing since last fall , when Republic lent financially troubled Midwest $ 25 million .
That loan helped Midwest avoid Chapter 11 bankruptcy .
It was tied to the first Midwest - Republic contract , with 12 Embraer 170 jets , smaller planes that replaced 16 Boeing 717s .
That led to a layoff of 240 Midwest employees .
The announcement Tuesday came just two weeks after Midwest said it was getting additional financing and jet service from Republic , including the Embraer 190s and Embraer regional jets .
As part of that transaction , Republic said it was lending Midwest another $ 6 million .
Under terms of the acquisition , Republic will pay $ 31 million : $ 6 million in cash and a $ 25 million , five - year note convertible to Republic stock .
TPG Capital of Fort Worth , Texas , and Northwest Airlines Corp. paid $ 452 million for Midwest in January 2008 , with TPG taking a 53 % stake and Northwest owning 47 % of the company .
Republic 's purchase of Midwest will " solidify the future of Midwest Airlines , " Hoeksema said .
Hoeksema and Bedford said Midwest faced very difficult financial conditions the past 18 months as record - high jet fuel prices ate up revenue and a recession dampened demand for air travel .
In 2008 , Midwest lost a record $ 477 million , although much of that stemmed from accounting adjustments .
The airline lost more than $ 25 million during the first three months of 2009 , and Bedford said the tide of red ink made it difficult for Midwest to invest in technology , marketing and other areas needed to help the airline grow .
Republic , he said , will bring badly needed capital to Midwest .
In 2008 , Republic reported revenue of $ 1.48 billion and posted net income of $ 84.6 million .
It mainly flies regional routes for larger carriers , such as United Express for United Airlines Inc.
Midwest accounts for about 5 % of Republic 's regional airline services revenue .
Republic 's revenue and profits have grown steadily since it became a publicly traded company in 2004 .
Republic carries a lower cost structure than larger airlines in part because its pilots receive less money , and because Republic is n't burdened with a heavy pension liability , industry consultant Vaughan Cordle said .
Hoeksema said that because Republic is a larger airline , it can operate Midwest more efficiently , owing to economies of scale .
AirTran also cited economies of scale during its hostile takeover attempt of Midwest two years ago .
That campaign failed when TPG / Northwest outbid AirTran , which has since beefed up its operations at Mitchell .
Hoeksema said AirTran 's takeover attempt was much different from the Republic sale - mainly because AirTran would have eliminated the Midwest brand .
AirTran executives said they would have greatly expanded Midwest if they had acquired the carrier .
' I'm very comfortable '
Hoeksema , 63 , who has led Midwest since it began offering regularly scheduled passenger service , said his decision to retire was long planned and not difficult .
" I 'm very comfortable with transitioning out and letting the new leadership transition in , " he said .
With the Midwest acquisition , and Republic 's disclosure Monday of its plans to buy Denver - based Frontier Airlines for just under $ 109 million , Republic could end up owning two carriers , along with its business of flying regional routes for large airlines .
The proposal to buy Frontier , which would help that carrier emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy , requires a court - supervised auction , at which another buyer could outbid Republic .
Bedford said buying and operating Midwest and Frontier carried higher risk but provided ways for Republic to diversify its revenue .
Joe Taschler of the Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says he 's distressed that Greens leader Bob Brown could be booted out of the Senate over an unpaid legal debt .
Senator Brown owes Forestry Tasmania $ 240,000 after a failed legal bid to stop logging in the Wielangta forest in Tasmania 's south - east .
If he fails to pay the bill by the end of the month and is declared bankrupt , he would be disqualified from the Senate .
Mr Rudd said he was upset for Senator Brown .
" I 've actually got a lot of time for Bob , just as a person , ( he 's ) a bloke I 've got to know over the years , " he told Sky News .

The two million dollar fine handed out to Jammie Thomas by a Minnesota jury this week has n't done the music industry 's image much good .
While lawyers and high level managers at the major labels cracked open the Champagne , artists such as Moby and Radiohead shook their heads in shame at what the music world has become .
Earlier this week the case of Jammie Thomas versus the RIAA went up for re-trial before a new jury .
She was found guilty of sharing 24 songs using Kazaa and ordered to pay $ 80,000 per infringement , which all mounted to a total of $ 1.92 million in fines .
High ranking people at the record labels soon declared victory claiming that justice had been served .
However , many of the artists to which the record label executives owe their well paid salaries are disgusted by the outcome of the case and the witch - hunt on their fans .
One of the artists that has shared his disappointment at the disproportionate fines is the American musician Moby .
‚Äú Argh . what utter nonsense , ‚Äù he writes on his website .
‚Äú This is how the record companies want to protect themselves ?
Suing suburban moms for listening to music ?
Charging $ 80,000 per song ? ‚Äù he questions .
Moby : The RIAA Needs to be Disbanded
‚Äú I do n‚Äôt know , but ‚Äò it ‚Äôs better to be feared than respected ‚Äô does n‚Äôt seem like such a sustainable business model when it comes to consumer choice .
How about a new model of ‚Äò it ‚Äôs better to be loved for helping artists make good records and giving consumers great records at reasonable prices ‚Äô ? ‚Äù
Moby is right that the sue and scare tactics of the RIAA are not the ideal business model in the long run .
However , thus far they have made millions from all the settled cases alone .
In recent years over 30,000 people have allegedly settled with the RIAA for an average of $ 3500 dollars .
This means that the RIAA have raked in more than 100 million dollars without even having to go to court .
In the UK , a coalition of top artists have spoken out against the actions of a music industry that chooses to criminalize their fans , and expressed their growing discomfort with record labels abusing copyrights for their own benefit .
Radiohead , who are also part of the coalition , even showed interest in testifying against the RIAA in the case of a Boston University student also accused of sharing several music recordings .
Tenenbaum ‚Äôs troubles started in 2003 when the RIAA rejected an offer to settle for $ 500 .
After a few more settlement attempts and legal quibbles , the case eventually went to court .
Moby , a proponent of Net Neutrality ‚Äì another topic dear to most file - sharers ‚Äì is equally dissatisfied with the RIAA ‚Äôs tactics .
In his view , it would be better for both artists and fans to end all the legal quibbles and focus on the art of music instead .
‚Äú I ‚Äôm so sorry that any music fan anywhere is ever made to feel bad for making the effort to listen to music , ‚Äù Moby writes , ending his blog post with some solid advice for the record labels that pump millions of dollars into the non-profit organization .
‚Äú The RIAA needs to be disbanded , ‚Äù he writes .
AT&T blocks 4chan
UPDATED : Please view and digg the following :
Reports are spreading that AT&T is now blocking 4 chan.org ‚Äôs ¬´/b/¬ª-section .
Firing one of the first shots in the net neutrality war , AT&T has blocked 4 chan ‚Äôs /b/ image board .
AT&T subscribers are unable to connect to /b/ and /r9 k / ( both of which are hosted on img.4chan.org ) .
However , subscribers can get on any of the so - called ¬´ worksafe ¬ª boards that 4 chan.org offers .
The problem seems to be present only for wired connections only ( AT&T Mobility customers are not affected ) .
The problem is not caused by an DNS - error , as traceroutes indicates that AT&T is dropping img.4 chan.org requests in the AT&T network .
Slashdot , Digg & Reddit are now running stories that are rapidly being upvoted about the topic .
http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/94pf2/att_is_now_blocking_all_access_to_img4chanorg/
As citizens of a free internet , what do we think about this kind of censorship ?
UPDATED 1 : Confirmation comes from several Reddit users that the website has indeed been blocked in a number of areas in the US and that it is not a technical issue .
UPDATED 2 : A mere 5 hours after the problems were first reported on Reddit , sources on /b/ say that members of Anonymous has already started planning retaliation towards AT&T ‚Äì amongst other things posting personal information about AT&T executives .
One might quietly wonder if the AT&T megacorp .
knows what ‚Äôs it up against ‚Äì with 4 chan often being referred to as ‚Äú The Internet Hate Machine ‚Äù .
UPDATED 3 : It turns out 15.5 % of all US internet users use AT&T DSL , so this is quite a big problem .
It will severly affect 4 chan , both in regards of traffic and advertising volumes .
UPDATED 4 : moot , the founder of 4 chan , officially acknowledges the ban ‚Äì calling for disconcerned users to ¬´ call or write customer support and corporate immediately ¬ª : http://status.4chan.org ‚Ä¶
Somehow , I get a feeling they ‚Äôre gonna do a lot more than that , moot .
UPDATED 5 : From rumors on /b/ , it seems 4 chan ‚Äôs first retaliatory strike will be towards Randall Stephenson , CEO of AT&T .
The Consumerist has more .
There are also murmurs about the AT&T block being put into place because of supposed mass DDoS - attacks to and from img.4 chan.org , but so far there has been no official , verifiable response from AT&T .
UPDATED 6 : 4 chan ‚Äôs current gameplan evolving over at Encyclopedia Dramatica ( Great stuff ! ) .
Also , from reports gathered on Reddit , it seems this block allegedly is because of massive DDoS - attacks against img.4chan.org .
The reports does n‚Äôt say anything about why AT&T would block 15.5 % of all US internet users from using a specific website without any warning , though .
UPDATED 7 : This article is now no .
1 on Digg.com ‚Äì and has received more than 120.000 visitors in less than 10 hours .
For now , I guess 4 chan and Anon is showing AT&T its strength in pure numbers .
Help spread the word , we need to raise awareness of this issue and Net neutrality .
UPDATED 8 : According to CentralGadget , 4 chan is now UNBLOCKED by AT&T .
AT&T says they were ¬´ following the practices of their policy department ¬ª , but that they have restored network - wide access to all areas of 4 chan .
Shitstorm averted ?
Also , according to CentralGadget , 4 chan is currently down ¬´ due to a large DDOS attack , affecting most of 4 chan ‚Äôs servers . ¬ª
This appears unrelated to the AT&T blockade , but may have been triggered by the high - profile attention that 4 chan has received during the past 24 hours .
PARIS ¬ó The Air France Airbus A330 that crashed into the Atlantic on June 1 , killing all 228 people aboard , did not break up in the air but rather hit the water intact , French investigators said Thursday .
But at a news conference at their headquarters at Le Bourget airport near Paris , officials from the French Office of Investigations and Analyses acknowledged that they still had no clear understanding of the reason for the crash of Air France Flight 447 .
The plane was flying through an area of strong thunderstorms when it went down 600 miles off northern Brazil en route to Paris .
Analysis of autopsies and debris patterns in the weeks after the crash had seemed to bolster speculation that the plane had broken up in flight .
But the investigators said their examination of floating debris indicated that the plane plummeted on its belly onto the ocean surface , facing in the direction of its intended route .
Alain Bouillard , who is leading the French investigation , said that ‚Äú visual examination of the debris shows that the plane hit with the bottom of its fuselage with very strong vertical acceleration . ‚Äù
Among the evidence was that shelves in the galley had compressed to the bottom , he said .
Now , more than ever , a lot of people are faced with financial pressure .
This is what a crisis should be about , anyway .
Companies are cutting jobs , people are losing houses and the global economy seems to be falling down .
I ‚Äôm not going to talk about the reasons for this crisis , as I will try to better focus a little about the immediate reality and how I faced similar situations .
Being an entrepreneur is something that , among other interesting stuff , is giving you a lot of financial pressure .
Getting from a monthly pay check ( in exchange of some time spent in an office ) to a complete reverse of the situation , when you have to take your money from the clients ( if you do your job well and on time ) , huh , that ‚Äôs quite a roller - coaster .
It ‚Äôs a serious comfort shake and it requires a lot of extra energy spent on the financial side .
And it is not only your money that ‚Äôs on the plate , you ‚Äôll need money for office rent , for utilities like electricity , internet access , for advertising and promotion and so on .
Not to mention your employees or partners .
You will have to manage a whole new level of cashing and spending .
And believe me , this is a tremendous financial pressure .
When I started my own business , 10 years ago , I faced this like a train hitting a wall .
Although I managed to do pretty well , in the first three years I barely knew where my pockets were .
They were most of the time empty .
Money did n‚Äôt have a chance to settle there .
Even if I managed to do a decent living per month , there were increasing expenses that I had to face the next month .
It was really tough .
That was a time when I really had to learn a lot about handling financial pressure .
I understand that some of you would say that this is different .
Losing your job out of the blue is something that should n‚Äôt happen , you ‚Äôll object .
Nobody forced you to go from the employee status to the entrepreneur status , you just had a decent job and now it ‚Äôs gone .
Tough .
But real .
On some level , I guess we ‚Äôre all entrepreneurs .
And the business we ‚Äôre running is our life .
We have clients all the time , people who chose to give us something in exchange of the value we create for them .
And if the business we ‚Äôre running with them is no longer profitable , well , do what an entrepreneur would do : switch to something else .
But keep all the qualities of a successful entrepreneur : courage , endurance , intelligence , risk - taking willingness and skills .
So , what an entrepreneurship approach to the world financial crisis could put on your plate ?
What you should do in order to avoid a financial crash , if you were to consider your life your brand new business ?
Here are three simple actions you can do right now :
Financial Precaution
Keep your money out of your reach .
Do n‚Äôt spend it on your first occasion .
In my early years of my business I was deeply convinced that negotiation is something you read about in books , it ‚Äôs not happening in the real world .
I was spending money instantly .
And I mean literally .
By the end of the third year of my entrepreneurship I had three different offices and around 25 employees , even if my real business needed only one office and no more than 10 employees .
But I thought I was doing development .
Growing the business .
Well , not quite .
It turned out that I was literally spending money for nothing and without thinking .
I ‚Äôm not talking about not spending at all , I ‚Äôm talking about much more caution on your spending habits .
Keep an eye on your opportunities but do n‚Äôt think everything that comes out to your attention is a winning deal .
Especially during crisis situations , it ‚Äôs quite the opposite .
So , whenever you think you have to spend money , think twice .
If it ‚Äôs still in your pocket it could n‚Äôt be in somebody else ‚Äôs , right ?
And if you ‚Äôre the compulsive type , make sure you keep your money out of your reach .
It will save some guilt feelings and maybe make for some wealth later .
Frugality
That ‚Äôs a thing I learned so well , that I even apply it now , when I really do n‚Äôt need to .
Frugality means to limit your expenses to the shortest level you can afford , without getting yourself out of the track , and still keeping you on the functional side also .
After the first three years of my business I started to pay more attention to everything that was in my monthly expense sheet .
And then started to look for better .
Not cheaper , but better .
I managed to keep the team in only one office , I started to think about increasing productivity instead of hiring more people , I started to buy normal furniture and electronic equipment instead of state of the art .
I had to fight a little with the feeling of getting cheap , but after a few months during which I managed to keep the expenses at a normal level , I started to feel better .
And I mean really better .
So , it is nothing wrong in being frugal .
Keep an eye on your expenses and see where you can cut a buck or two , without feeling you are depriving yourself of something .
Frugality has another , very subtle advantage : it shift your focus from money ( spending or making , whatever ) to just being .
And that ‚Äôs such a precious step ahead .
Move Faster
During crisis situations , you have to move fast .
Especially during financial crisis there are huge effects that a single hour difference can have .
Yes , I know , I ‚Äôve just talked about caution and thinking twice .
Right , it ‚Äôs about thinking twice , not acting slow .
In fact , after your thoughts are clear , you should act with the speed of light .
No hesitations , no second guess , no nothing : just do it .
I remember that most of my domain names were bought on tight financial surroundings .
Every time I had a clear idea about what I have to do , I never looked back .
I started around 25 - 30 different projects and tried to manage all .
Out of 30 , I only remained with 2 portals , both leaders in their niche .
And that was on a 10 years span .
But I have no regrets for the rest of projects .
The decisions to start them was good , if only for the learning I had managing those projects .
So , if you truly think ‚Äì and feel ‚Äì that you should invest in something , do it faster than usual .
You really do n‚Äôt have time for hesitations , not now .
The two faces of the coin
I could n‚Äôt finish this post without a metaphor related to finances : the two faces of a coin .
You know , applying those three simple pieces of advice : precaution , frugality and rapidity could help you face a hostile financial environment .
But there are good sides and bad sides of flipping this coin .
The good side will be that you will get through it with a little more decency and maybe with greater results than others .
You will develop some emotional muscles , a sense of equilibrium and a suite of habits that will make you somehow immune to the most of the financial flu .
You will learn patience , a spartan living and you will learn how to detect viable opportunities .
But there ‚Äôs a downside too : when the crisis will be gone , you ‚Äôll still remain on the same track .
And that ‚Äôs a little cumbersome , you know .
As I told you , I even surprise myself , after 10 years of entrepreneurship , and on a stable financial situation , getting frugal or giving double thinking to crystal clear situations .
So , do n‚Äôt get used to those practices too much .
Allow some secret escapes now and then .
Understand what financial freedom is and start feeling how it is to have a lot of money available at any given time .
And you ‚Äôll have it .
A longtime South Dakota supporter of legalized marijuana has been sentenced to serve 45 days in jail for possessing the illegal drug .
Authorities say Bob Newland of Hermosa was found with four bags of marijuana , a scale and $ 385 in cash when he was stopped for speeding in March .
He pleaded guilty in May to a possession charge under a plea agreement in which prosecutors agreed to drop a more serious charge of possession with intent to distribute .
Newland will be on probation for the rest of the year following his jail term .
During his probation , he is barred from publicly advocating the legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes .
Location :
South Dakota 's most well - known marijuana legalization advocate , Bob Newland , was sentenced yesterday to a year in the Pennington County Jail with all but 45 days suspended for felony marijuana possession - - a little less than four ounces .
Once he does his time , he 'll be on probation for a year .
Newland can , I suppose , consider himself fortunate .
According to the South Dakota Department of Corrections , there are currently six people imprisoned for possession of less than half a pound and seven for more than half but less than one pound , as well as 14 doing time for distribution of less than an ounce and another 25 doing time for distribution of less than a pound .
But in another respect , Newland is not so lucky .
He has basically been stripped of his First Amendment right to advocate for marijuana legalization while he is on probation .
As the Associated Press reported : Newland , understandably , is not inclined to challenge the probation condition .
There 's something about staring at the walls of a jail cell that does that to a guy .
But that does n't mean others should n't raise a stink about this arguably unconstititional sentence .
I 'll be looking into this and will have a Chronicle story about it on Friday .
Fear on Wall St. Falling
Volatility is at its lowest level on Wall Street since the market meltdown last September .
Fritz Meyer , of Invesco Aim ; Frederic Dickson , of D.A. Davidson & Co. ; and Fast Money 's Jeff Macke discuss whether this lack of anxiety is good news or worrisome .
Given how much I loved Watchmen the End is Nigh , I could n‚Äôt wait to get my hands on Part 2 at this year ‚Äôs E3 .
Many complaints about the first one was that it was too short for the price , which was $ 19.99 .
I asked our booth guide what the price would be for Part II and she told me that it is 3 chapters long , and would cost $ 15 via PSN .
Essentially , it ‚Äôs a continuation of the first game .
The controls , mechanics , graphics all look similar and feel similar to the first title .
They really did n‚Äôt deviate much at all from that .
So if you loved the first then you should definitely give it a shot .
If you hated it then stay away , because it is more of the same .
For those that do n‚Äôt know that much about the title , it plays a lot like an old school beat - em - up .
In other words , it ‚Äôs a button masher with various combos / finishers that your character can execute on enemies .
The two games take place before the movie , and there is a demo for gamers to check out if you have n‚Äôt yet .
This will give you a chance to see if you like the title .
Below is my hands on experience with the title .
Enjoy !

Key / Keyring combo is all too easy
July 9 , 2009 By Paul Wagorn
This is to be filed in the ‚Äú why did n‚Äôt I think of that ? ‚Äù folder .
Sometimes an idea does n‚Äôt have to be complicated , expensive or difficult understand to be creative and useful .
The picture says it all :
The beauty is in it ‚Äôs simplicity : combine the key and keyring into one object ‚Äì Designed an patented by Scott Amron , the Split Key Ring both opens your doors and holds your other keys .
It comes as a key blank that fits standard KW1 and SC1 keyways and can be cut in any key cutter .
The key blanks sells for $ 7 for a pack of two .
No offence Scott , but why did it take so long for someone to come up with this ?

Well I always lose my keys , any change that is does n't happen with this one ?
I love the simplicity , but it makes me wonder if it would be as practical to use - for many of the reasons people have already mentioned .
Interesting idea , though .
LOL , you people are obviously just jealous you did n't come up with the idea firstGood idea !
Life made simple .
No markings ?!
It should be at least color coded .
Put several of those keys together in a bunch and you'd go crazy looking for the right key to your door .
This would be a great present to put in a homemade Christmas cracker .
The drunken discussion that would ensue would probably not be as coherent as the comments on this page but might be quite amusing .
It would at least be a talking point .
Provocative and elegant even if pretty useless ...
I NEED A KEY LIKE THAT !!
It would make life easier !!:)
Awesome site , had a fun time reading it :D
Share us some more stories mannnGreat invention .
I wish I would of thought of this !!
This is a brilliant idea !
This key looks good .
I have several keys so this would solve my problem of holding them together .
Simplicity is really beautiful !
I will try this out now ... I 've been using this key as my house key for a while now - works great .
Other keys can be slipped on and off the ring with ease .
Admittedly I use it without any other keys attached ( I slip it into my wallet as I use no other keys regularly ) .
The slightly wider diameter of the ring offers greater leverage when turning , the loop is perfect for slipping your finger into and pulling the door shut ; it feels very strong , as if it 's been milled out of a single slab of metal ( it is n't - the ring has been bonded to the key part ) .
It just feels so good using it - An excellent design the looks unique and operates flawlessly .
http://www.designgauge.com/2011/01/fellowship-of-ring.html@Johnny, Doctor
Who carries only one key .
Now this one is spankin ' !
" How come no - one did it before " ??
Just like glow - in - the - dark - keyholes .
But wait , should i patent it before i click " Submit Comment " ?..
But it seems someone did that already - http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=KdclAAAAEBAJ&dq=keyhole+glowYou have done well , I think u should setup a busseness to look into it .
becouse this this key with ring is a new invention and need to be congratulated for the good effort .
You folks are missing the point : no other key will be inserted because of the midway obstruction in the ring .
The only reason why we are able to insert a 2nd key in a regular ring is because the fist key slides .
This ring has a " first key " that is stuck in the middle preventing everything else from being inserted .
So , even if you overcome the manufacturing challenges , the material resistance issue , even if you do n't mind about the discomfort of eventual other keys in perpendicular position , it 's geometrical impossibility precedes and overcomes everything .
However , it 's very amusing .
I do n't think that the problems stated above would be something the designer would overlook .
However flimsy a typical keyring is , it looks like the one in the picture is thicker and sturdier .
And besides , a typical keyring is n't as pliable as you might think when lateral pressure is applied , they way it is when turning the handle of a key .
There is the possibility of having a larger clump of keys due to the design , but I do n't think it'd be much of a problem , since this keyring would replace one of the keys ( and proabably a ring ) in your pocket anyway .
I hate having all my keys on one ring anyway , so I have two or three attached to one main ring ; each ring organizes my keys for a specific place .
I could use this key as my main ring , and keep the other smaller keyrings attached to it with their corresponding keys .
This seems to be a great product , at least for my key - entry needs .
also , what 's with TheEgo claiming that it the design would inhibit the addition of other keys ?
That would completely defeat the purpose of this product ; can you not look at the picture and see how the designer could get around this problem ?
I think there 's an online tendency towards immediate skepticism for the sake of appearing discerning , but you must be skeptical only to the point that it makes sense to criticize .
Do n't be a naysayer just to be a naysayer.hmm ..... nice idea , how would you tell the keys apart ?
It 's a brilliant idea !
I read some of the posts and thought about it : I took out the bunch of keys , I have in my pocket , and tried to bend the keyring ...
Well you can try it yourself to see how strong it is .
Secondly the keyring , if attached to other keyrings wo n't necessarily stay 90¬∞ out of line .
It has quite a lot of play .
Also the key and keyring can still be of the same material .
The shape of the ring makes the material more flexible .
Manufacturing it is a simple task of moulds and then cutting the necessary shape in the steel ring to allow for attaching other rings / keyrings .
The only complaint that I have , of this concept , is how stupid it makes the rest of us look .
Love / hate all the people calling bullshit on this idea .
It would make a cool powerpoint clipart .
What exactly is the problem that this solves ?
I love how everyone above just * knows * that the ring will bend , that it will be uncomfortable , too hard to turn , etc.
Just how much force does it take to turn a typical key - lock ?
Not nearly as much as everyone is presuming .
Seriously , get off ur ass , go to your front door , and try it .
This is an insightful idea , and definitely warrants more open - mindedness .
Empiricism is when you actually hold stuff in your hand and try it .
Remember that .
Dumb .
Brutally dumb .
It stops the rest of your keys from lying flat .
It 's going to get twisted because it 's structurally weak .
And how do you take this one key off to give to someone else ?
Should work great .
With the addition of a key ring .
i sorta kinda maybe like the idea .
but then like others have said , it 'll be harder to determine what key is for what unless the key itself is entirely a different color .. plus when you go to actually use the key you 'll have to make sure your thumb is on the border of the key and doesnt go right through it which could be annoying .
so after a few minutes of thinking .. ill pass on this idea .
Try bending a normal keyring , it 's harder than you think .
Look at the picture it's not thin and flat , so it is strong .
Are you guys who think the keyring will break in a lock serious ?
When was the last time you snapped a keyring in half ?
If your locks are so crappy that it requires enough turning force to snap a keyring , then you 're already bending and breaking keys in those locks .
The only thing this key will do is snap .
this is the dumb idea .... its not that no one thought of it ...... todays design are to make key more strong ... in this what u 'd do if the ring breaks ?
the key is uselessSo instead of my keys lying parallel to each other in my pocket , exactly one will be stuck perpendicular to the others ?
I really do n't think the " need a keyring " problem outweighs the obvious drawback .
That 's why I never thought of it : it solves a non-problem by creating a new problem . :-)
It would also be un-comfortable to use without the large surface area to apply pressure to while turning the keyYou did n't think of this because it 's an awful idea .
Aside from the fact that , if you need to detach that one key from the ring it 's going to cause issues , there is the problem of applying torque in a sticky lock possibly breaking the key because there is no flat surface to twist .
There is no market need for this item .
It does n't really solve any problems .
The fact that it is a key ring means that you can only have one , then your other keys will go on to it .
So now you still have a bunch of keys on a key ring , except now one of them does n't lie in plane with the others .
So having this key does n't really change anything .
If this gets marketed , anyone who buys it will soon discover that it's not really as great of an idea as it orginally may seem .
The best thing you can do with it is show it to your friends and hope they do n't realize how useless it is and they will think its cool .
It 's a flimsy key and cramped keyring .
It would be very dysfunctional as a key if you actually used it as a keyring because the other attached keys would get in the way .
And the ring would probably snap off the first time the key was used in a lock that was a little hard to turn .
I do n't see it as being all that useful .
It 's just another novelty that would be discarded quickly .
It does n't solve or improve a situation .
The design forces your keys to be at right angles to one another .
It 's novel , but NOT a good design idea for anyone who has more than ONE key .
And who carries ONE key ?
Even if it does n't work I think it would be a great valentines day novelty item .
Maybe ringbox or some cheesey card that says " will you move in with me " Fun design concept , but not actually useful .
1 . All ' regular ' keys on this keyring would be perpendicular to the ring - key , so they would n't lie flat against each other .
The ring - key would always be jutting out at a weird angle .
2 .
As keys shift around , the ring - key would impede their movement .
They would n't be able to shift around and settle , they 'd get all jammed up and awkward .
3 .
If you had multiple ring - keys , you 'd have a daisy - chain of rings rather than multiple keys on one ring .
Sorry guys ... this is a useless impulse - buy at its best .
This was never invented before because of the fact that the key ring will bend when you turn the key .
I actually do n't like the current design , but simple mod could make it work .
The problem is that added keys will lie perpendicular to the ring key such that the " pack " of keys is oddly shaped .
The fix should be obviousI would respect it more ( sort of ) as an artistic statement than a useful object .
I mean , have we really been plagued by keyring usability / ergonomics ?
Great idea , love it ...... but the ring and key are typically made of differing metal alloys , does n't the ring need more " spring " to be able to bend to open / close properly ?
Maybe the key could be made of the same alloy ?
What problem does it solve exactly ?
I 've always wondered why they do n't make key blanks for swiss army knives .
The most curious thing about this widget { INO} is the almost instantaneous voice in your head that says " Man that 's a good idea " followed by a rapid decline in enthusiasm as your brain works out the failed utility of it .
Fascinating study in the perceptual value of intellectual property .
Not including the obvious subfunction of there being a vast consumer base that would not see the fail until after purchase and even those stubborn consumers who would buy it BECAUSE their immediate reaction told them to despite the obvious flaws .
Either way you could still tap it for money ...... IP is analogous to catching a lighting bolt and slowly drawing off the energy in a controlled way .
There is no doubt that this product has a substantial difference of potential .
If you attach other keys to that ring it will feel lumpy and irritating in your pocket .
Cute though .
great idea until you look at it from a manufacturing point of view .
Now you 're putting the key ring industry out of business .
Good one .
Anyone else notice that the ring looks photoshopped ?
I 'll wait till there is a ring I can fit on my finger to hold my key .
It has a bigger hole in the center than most keys .
Do n't you get it ?
You 're stupid , this is the most bestest thing I 've ever seen .
yup I think it 's a bad idea as well
You guys are missing the point : if the key did n't work , and broke when you used it , the guy would n't have gone through the patenting process .
And yes , I 'm sure it has been tested , and works fine .
Also , the key will be 90 degrees out of line from the other keys that are on the ring , so they wo n't nest and it will take up more space in your pocket !
This is a dumb idea .
How will you turn the key without a sturdy place to hold it ?
That ring will bend the very instant somebody tries that in a lock .
Actually , that is a terrible idea .
It would be incredibly weak , thus very likely to break off in your lock , and the key part would interfere with items goind on and off the ring part .
The general idea of " key + ring " is a wonderful concept , but I think it could be done much better than the example given .
It 's been a while since I heard of a well deserved patent .
To all software patent holders , this is what a real patent looks like .meh ... cool idea but i could n't imagine having 5 of these .
how would you tell the keys apart ?
Powder and color coded ones maybe ?
Brilliant , simple and pure genius , if you 're already a member .
fields are required .
Researchers at TU Delft have succeeded in measuring the influence of a single electron on a vibrating carbon nanotube .
That can be a real milestone on the road to ultra-small measuring instruments .
Researchers in the Kavli Institute for Nanoscience at TU Delft basically suspended a carbon nanotube , comparable in size to an ultra-small violin string , and then applied an alternating electric field to the nanotube using an antenna .
As a result of the alternating electric field , the suspended nanotube begins to vibrate at a certain frequency .
The nanotechnologists were then able to vary the number of electrons on the nanotube .
The number of electrons ‚Äò allowed ‚Äô on the nanotube causes very slight changes in the vibration behaviour of the tube .
Thus the frequency at which the nanotube vibrates shifts very slightly each time an electron is added .
The scientists have succeeded in charting the influence of the presence of just a single electron .
The entire process took place in a measurement environment that was cooled to almost absolute zero .
Suspended nanotubes vibrate at an extremely high frequency and thus exhibit new quantum effects .
These suspended nanotubes thus form an interesting field of research ; moreover , it has recently become possible to manufacture these items to a high quality .
The researchers of the Kavli Institute for Nanoscience in Delft managed for the first time to capture a single electron in a carbon nanotube and this success was made possible by a new method of making ultra-clean nanotubes .
Look close .
See that string ?
What you see in this electron microscope image is 800 nanometer long - 800 millionths of a millimeter .

The research being conducted at TU Delft is , apart from the acquired theoretical knowledge , also important for work such as the development of NEMS ( Nano Electro Mechanical Systems ) .
These are extremely small electromechanical systems such as tiny switches and measuring instruments .
NEMS are regarded as the logical successors to the slightly larger MEMS ( Micro Electro Mechanical Systems ) that already constitute a sector of industry that is worth billions .
These MEMS are already found , for example , in the acceleration sensors of airbags in cars .
In the course of time , a breakthrough to the nano - level can be expected .
When an electron is added to the nanotube , the motion of the electron hopping onto it creates a ' dip ' in the measured vibration frequency .
The nanotube vibrates at a rate of 140 milion times per second ( Hz ) .
For illustrative purposes that frequency is lowered here to a detectable range around 1000 Hz.

Swine flu :
Up to 160 Britons held in quarantine overseas
At least 160 Britons are in quarantine worldwide because of swine flu , the Foreign Office said today .
A spokeswoman said assistance was being given to people in China , Singapore , India and Egypt .
Not all will be suffering from the virus .
Some will have been quarantined after being in contact with people who are .
The spokeswoman said there were likely to be other people abroad being kept in quarantine who had not sought help from the Foreign Office .
It comes as experts said children under the age of 14 have become ' super - spreaders ' of the virus , leaving England battling a raging epidemic .
Prepared : Masked Italian students arrive at Stansted as news breaks that swine flu cases in England doubles in a week to 100,000
The number of swine flu cases has doubled in a week to 100,000 with most of the new cases among children below 14 years old , according to officials .
A third of those who have died from the virus have been under 15 and 20 per cent of those who have ended up in hospital were under the age of five .
The NHS is now planning for up to 65,000 deaths from swine flu , with 30 per cent of the population - and 50 per cent of children - catching the infection .
Meanwhile , a British family on holiday in Bodrum , Turkey , have been put in quarantine in hospital after a six - year - old boy was diagnosed with the virus .
The child , who has not been named , was spotted after thermal cameras showed he was extraordinarily hot and tests later found he had swine flu .
Head doctor at the 75th State Hospital Dr Levent Ozbek said : ' After further investigations and treatment , the family will be our guests in the hospital where all necessary treatment is given to the patients . '
The Health Protection Agency yesterday said for the first time that the disease was probably at epidemic levels - or one in 500 people reporting flu - like illness .
It makes it the most virulent flu outbreak since the winter of 1999/ 2000 , when 21,000 lost their lives .
Officials have also warned that a third of those who have died so far had no serious underlying health problems .
Such is the level of concern that the new National Flu Pandemic Service website crashed within minutes of going live after receiving 2,600 hits a second , or 9.3 million an hour .
The dramatic news emerged as :
Universities warned campuses may have to close in the autumn if the epidemic gets worse ;
GPs started to cancel summer holidays to deal with extra cases and call in temporary staff to cover for sick colleagues ;
Small businesses appealed for extra help over fears they would be driven to the wall through absences and swine flu sickies .
Alarm : Workers at one of the 19 National Pandemic Flu Service call centres answer calls from people concerned about swine flu
Emergency website : The National Pandemic Flu Service website crashed within minutes of going live after receiving 2,600 hits a second
Chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson coined the phrase ' super - spreaders ' to describe children under 14 .
He said yesterday that 26 people in England and four in Scotland are believed to have died .
The figure is no different from last week because further investigations have revealed that some who were listed at that time had not actually died from the virus .
But for the first time , Sir Liam was able to announce that around 16 per cent of those who had swine flu on their death certificates were perfectly healthy and were on no medication .
A further 17 per cent had only mild and moderate conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes .
The rest had serious health problems undermining their immune systems , such as leukaemia .
Cause for concern : Chief medical officer Sir Liam Donaldson said around 16 per cent of those who died of swine flu were perfectly healthy
In an attempt to reassure the public , Sir Liam said : ' The bad thing would be if 100 per cent of the deaths were healthy people .
The vast majority of people , even with an underlying condition , will get the flu and recover well . '
The Health Protection Agency said that , to all intents and purposes , England is in the grip of a swine flu epidemic .
Justin McCracken , chief executive of the HPA , said : ' The view is that we are there or thereabouts .
On the evidence of people going to their GPs , it is on the border of what we would expect in an epidemic . '
Professor Hugh Pennington , a bacteriologist at Aberdeen University , said : ' I have seen cases myself of people dying from flu who are healthy .
' The fact that younger people are being hit is similar to previous pandemics .
Social factors obviously play a part - young people hang around each other more - but the reasons are not known . '
The HPA estimates that 100,000 came down with swine flu last week - compared with 55,000 the previous week .
It said the number could even be as high as 140,000 .
Some 840 are in hospital , including 63 in intensive care .

The National Pandemic Flu Service website went down only three minutes after being launched at 3 pm .
A message said : ' The service is currently very busy and cannot deal with your request at this time .
Please try again in a little while .'
The site was down for at least two hours , but later appeared to be working normally .
The Tories claimed the problems were because it had been set up too late and that it should have been launched as a global pandemic was declared weeks ago .
Health spokesman Mark Simmonds said : ' People could n't access the information .
They could n't discover themselves whether they had the appropriate symptoms that would give them the opportunity to get Tamiflu . '
But Sir Liam Donaldson blamed the crash on people 's curiosity rather than desperation of those fearing they had the virus .
' We would estimate around the very , very most that there were 20,000 out there when the flu line was switched on who might have had genuine flu .
' Nine million people decided to visit the site because there was such intense media interest in this story and many , many more people were aware of it than if it had moved into use in a routine way . '
Those who suspect they have swine flu log on to the site - www.direct.gov.uk/pandemic flu - and go through an online checklist ticking the boxes that correspond with their symptoms .
If the system diagnoses them with the virus they are given a special ' voucher number ' that enables them to go along to their nearest pharmacy or surgery to collect their Tamiflu .
Universities yesterday revealed they could be forced to remain closed in the autumn to limit the spread of swine flu .
Almost two million students will be converging on universities from September when the epidemic is expected to peak .
Departments could be closed , freshers ' activities cancelled , or students could even be quarantined .
Meanwhile , the Archbishops of Canterbury and York have recommended the suspension of the sharing of the chalice at communion .
They have written to bishops in the Church of England setting out the measures following official advice not to share ' common vessels ' for food or drink .
Italy , which has had no deaths from swine flu , yesterday added Britain to a list of travel trouble spots - which also includes Iran and Ethiopia .
Asked why the UK seemed to be particularly badly affected compared with the rest of Europe , Sir Liam said it could be that Britain had better surveillance systems .
But in a sign that the NHS is under strain , companies which provide cover when GPs and practice nurses go off sick have reported a massive surge in demand .
Steve Field , chairman of the Royal College of GPs , said : ' Swine flu is getting very busy all over the country .
It is going up in all parts of England .
' GPs are at full stretch - both answering phones but also seeing patients in surgery , all at a time when historically people are going on holiday .
We are hearing that doctors are cancelling their holidays to do clinical work . '
Some 22,000 died in Britain 's last flu epidemic in 1999 - 2000 - a death rate ten times higher than the average for a normal winter .
The strain , believed to have originated in Australia , crippled the NHS .
At the epidemic 's peak there were as few as 11 intensive care beds available across the country .
Yesterday , a pregnant Scottish woman critically ill with swine flu was transferred to Sweden for a rare treatment after suffering lung problems .
The procedure involved circulating the patient 's blood outside the body and adding oxygen to it artificially .
The UK has a unit for such treatment but all five beds are being used .
The number for the National Pandemic Flu Service for England is 0800 1513 100 and the website address www.direct.gov.uk/pandemicflu

New Definition Could Further Limit Habitable Zones Around Distant Suns
by Staff Writers
Seattle WA ( SPX ) Jun 11 , 2009
Scientists believe liquid water is essential for life .
But a planet also must have plate tectonics to pull excess carbon from its atmosphere and confine it in rocks to prevent runaway greenhouse warming .
Tectonics , or the movement of the plates that make up a planet 's surface , typically is driven by radioactive decay in the planet 's core , but a star 's gravity can cause tides in the planet , which creates more energy to drive plate tectonics .
As astronomers gaze toward nearby planetary systems in search of life , they are focusing their attention on each system 's habitable zone , where heat radiated from the star is just right to keep a planet 's water in liquid form .
A number of planets have been discovered orbiting red dwarf stars , which make up about three - quarters of the stars close to our solar system .
Potentially habitable planets must orbit close to those stars - perhaps one - fiftieth the distance of Earth to the sun - since those stars are smaller and generate less heat than our sun .
But new calculations indicate that , with planets so close , tidal forces exerted on planets by the parent star 's gravity could limit what is regarded as a star 's habitable zone and change the criteria for planets where life could potentially take root .
Scientists believe liquid water is essential for life .
But a planet also must have plate tectonics to pull excess carbon from its atmosphere and confine it in rocks to prevent runaway greenhouse warming .
Tectonics , or the movement of the plates that make up a planet 's surface , typically is driven by radioactive decay in the planet 's core , but a star 's gravity can cause tides in the planet , which creates more energy to drive plate tectonics .
" If you have plate tectonics , then you can have long - term climate stability , which we think is a prerequisite for life , " said Rory Barnes , a University of Washington postdoctoral researcher in astronomy .
However , tectonic forces cannot be so severe that geologic events quickly repave a planet 's surface and destroy life that might have gotten a foothold , he said .
The planet must be at a distance where tugging from the star 's gravitational field generates tectonics without setting off extreme volcanic activity that resurfaces the planet in too short a time for life to prosper .
Barnes is lead author of a paper to be published by The Astrophysical Journal Letters that uses new calculations from computer modeling to define a " tidal habitable zone . "
Co-authors are Brian Jackson and Richard Greenberg from the University of Arizona and Sean Raymond from the University of Colorado .
The research was funded by NASA .
" Overall , the effect of this work is to reduce the number of habitable environments in the universe , or at least what we have thought of as habitable environments , " Barnes said .
" The best places to look for habitability are where this new definition and the old definition overlap . "
The new calculations have implications for planets previously considered too small for habitability .
An example is Mars , which used to experience tectonics but that activity ceased as heat from the planet 's decaying inner core dissipated .
But as planets get closer to their suns , the gravitational pull gets stronger , tidal forces increase and more energy is released .
If Mars were to move closer to the sun , the sun 's tidal tugs could possibly restart the tectonics , releasing gases from the core to provide more atmosphere .
If Mars harbors liquid water , at that point it could be habitable for life as we know it .
Various moons of Jupiter have long been considered as potentially harboring life .
But one of them , Io , has so much volcanic activity , the result of tidal forces from Jupiter , that it is not regarded as a good candidate .
Tectonic activity remakes
Io 's surface in less than 1 million years .
" If that were to happen on Earth , it would be hard to imagine how life would develop , " Barnes said .
A potential Earth - like planet , but eight times more massive , called Gliese 581d was discovered in 2007 about 20 light years away in the constellation Libra .
At first it was thought the planet was too far from its sun , Gliese 581 , to have liquid water , but recent observations have determined the orbit is within the habitable zone for liquid water .
However , the planet is outside the habitable zone for its sun 's tidal forces , which the authors believe drastically limits the possibility of life .
" Our model predicts that tides may contribute only one - quarter of the heating required to make the planet habitable , so a lot of heat from decay of radioactive isotopes may be required to make up the difference , " Jackson said .
Barnes added , " The bottom line is that tidal forcing is an important factor that we are going to have to consider when looking for habitable planets . "
In a major step toward an overhaul of the nation ‚Äôs food safety system , the House of Representatives passed legislation on Thursday to require more frequent inspections of processing plants and give the government the authority to order the recall of tainted foods .
‚Äú No legislation like this has moved forward this far in decades to overhaul the food safety laws , ‚Äù said Erik D. Olson , director of food and consumer product safety issues at the Pew Charitable Trusts .
‚Äú It ‚Äôs a pretty historic moment . ‚Äù
House passage sets the stage for the Senate to take up the issue , though probably not until the fall .
The Obama administration has voiced strong support for a comprehensive food safety revamping .
The bill passed the House on a vote of 283 to 142 .
Democratic support was overwhelming , but Republicans were split , with 54 voting in favor and 122 against ‚Ä¶
The measure would also give the agency the power to order recalls of tainted food .
Under its current authority , it can only ask companies to recall their food products .
Among the bill ‚Äôs other provisions are heightened inspection requirements on imported foods , a mandate that records of processing plants be made available to inspectors and investigators , and a requirement that processing plants develop elaborate safety plans meant to head off problems before they arise .
In addition , the bill would direct the F.D.A. to create a system that would better trace food products and ingredients , as a way of quickly getting to the source of future outbreaks of food - borne illness .
Food - borne illness , sickness and disease resulting from contaminated food is one of those topics that gets a response from our readers every time we post on the topic .
Americans are sick and tired of being told that we have the best food - production and distribution system in the world ‚Äì which is true BTW ‚Äì but , there ‚Äôs ‚Äú just been some little slip - up ‚Äù that ‚Äôs causing a problem .
Hogwash !
Just about every bad food story we ‚Äôve covered in recent years has carelessness and cover-ups rooted in maximizing profit .
When the latter becomes more important than the health of consumers , families ‚Äì and attempts to remedy the situation are opposed by politicians in the name of whatever they choose as window - dressing ‚Äì the smell is still one of corruption .

A pet python broke out of its holding tank and strangled a two - year - old girl in the bedroom of her home in Florida , local authorities said .
The 8ft ( 2.5 m ) albino Burmese python had also bitten Shaiunna Hare on her forehead several times .
Charles Darnell , the snake 's owner and boyfriend of Shaiunna 's mother , stabbed the python and prised the child away , but she died before paramedics arrived .
Authorities removed the snake from the home after obtaining a search warrant .
Officials said Mr Darnell did not have a permit for the snake .
He could face child endangerment or other charges .
Everglades breeding
According to police , Mr Darnell said he had put the snake in a bag in an aquarium container on Tuesday night , but awoke the next morning to find it missing .
Bobby Caruthers , from the sheriff 's office in Sumter County , central Florida , said Mr Darnell " ran immediately to the infant 's room " and discovered " the snake on the child " .
" He also said he observed bite marks on the forehead of the child , " Mr Caruthers said .
Wildlife officials say they are growing increasingly concerned by the proliferation of pythons in the Florida wilderness .
It is believed that some have been released by pet owners who can no longer care for them .
The snakes are breeding in the Everglades , where they have no natural predators .
Burmese pythons can reach a length of 16ft ( 5 m ) and live for 30 years .
The US Humane Society told Associated Press news agency that at least 12 people have been killed in the US by pet pythons since 1980 , including five children .
AFTER ebbing steadily since the start of the year America 's monthly job losses figure abruptly jumped from 322,000 in May to 467,000 in June , deflating talk of an imminent exit from recession .
Hand - wringing in Washington quickly followed .
On July 5th the vice - president , Joe Biden , admitted that the White House had ‚Äú misread how bad the economy was ‚Äù .
In January it had predicted that unemployment would peak at 9 % without a fiscal stimulus and 8 % with one .
The $ 787 billion two - year stimulus is now law but unemployment stands at 9.5 % and Barack Obama admits it will probably top 10 % .
At one level , the hand - wringing is overdone .
The economy is doing a bit better than June 's employment report suggests .
Jim O'Sullivan of UBS argues that the early date on which the job - market survey was done , combined with fewer than usual summer jobs for students , exaggerated the weakness .
He notes that stockmarkets , home sales and consumer confidence are all showing the gradual improvement typical of turning - points .
The deep freeze in the financial markets is thawing : issuance of stocks and corporate bonds hit $ 338 billion in the second quarter , according to Thomson Reuters , the highest for a year .
The odds are that the economy will begin to grow again in the current quarter for two reasons : the dramatic inventory liquidation , which led manufacturers to slash output and payrolls starting in late 2008 , seems to be ending ; and the impact of the fiscal stimulus is growing .
Other countries , who bore much of the brunt of the inventory liquidation because they provide such a large share of what Americans consume , are already benefiting .
Global manufacturing expanded in June for the first time since May 2008 , according to a global purchasing - managers index compiled by JPMorgan ( see chart ) .
But caution is still justified .
A self - sustaining recovery needs more than just replenishing inventory and government stimulus ; it requires a virtuous circle of increasing consumer spending and incomes , and there is still no evidence of that .
Sales of cars remain disappointingly meagre .
Consumer income is in a vice : not only are jobs and hours shrinking , but hourly pay grew at only an annualised rate of 0.7 % during the past three months , the lowest since the data begin in 1964 .
Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs predicts wages will actually start falling next year .
If later this year the recovery still looks likely to remain feeble as the maximum impact of the stimulus is felt , pressure for more stimulus will grow .
But it will be harder to deliver than last time .
The Federal Reserve cut short - term interest rates in effect to zero in December , then embarked on ‚Äú quantitative easing ‚Äù in March by buying bonds with newly printed money .
Treasury yields dipped at first , then more than rebounded , because some investors worried that the Fed 's radical actions would eventually fuel inflation .
As for fiscal policy , on July 7th Laura Tyson , an adviser to Mr Obama , called for a second stimulus , saying the first is ‚Äú a bit too small . ‚Äù
Mr Obama has demurred , arguing the first needs time to work .
Polls also show the deficit is now a bigger priority with voters than more stimulus .
Mr Obama himself has proposed a budget - balancing rule that he would have to break to inject more stimulus ‚Äî a formality , perhaps , but one that would further erode his fiscal credibility given the gargantuan deficits his policies will produce even beyond 2010 .
‚Äú We could afford to borrow a bit more over the next year if we had a plausible plan to get the deficit under control thereafter , ‚Äù says Len Burman of the Urban Institute , a think - tank .
‚Äú But nobody has articulated such a plan . ‚Äù
Moments ago , I posted about how Erika Lauren Wasilewski of the Real World DC had faked cancer on her ex-boyfriend after they broke up , for attention .
Erika is from Chicago , and I have just received a message from a Billy in Chicago ( I checked the Chicago I /P address ) , claiming to be her ex-boyfriend , and that this story is in fact true .
Here ‚Äôs what he said :
Billy says :
07/29/2009 at 3:48 PM
Hahaha .
Wow .
This is amazing .
I was that boyfriend .
Yes , she did indeed fake cancer after I broke up with her .
Not only did she fake cancer for close to 9 months , but her family was also in on the lie and covered for her .
So fucked up !
UPDATE EMAIL FROM BILLY :
A friend of mine linked me your write - up of Erika Wasilewski of next seasons Real World .
In the comments somebody mentioned that she faked cancer when her boyfriend broke up with her .
Just wanted to confirm that it is true .
I was the boyfriend that broke up with her .
She actually faked some sort of skin cancer for close to 9 months .
Everybody in our hometown believed her except for me and a select few people .
Everybody hated me because I was ‚Äú the guy who made fun of the girl with cancer ‚Äù .
Her family actually covered for her lies and went along with it .
So fucked up .
Once the truth came out and she finally admitted it she basically lost all her friends and went MIA for a while .
Billy
There you have it folks .
Shabooty exclusives all over the place .
Thank you Billy for shedding light on this Erika Lauren Wasilewski character .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The number of jobs created or saved by infrastructure projects funded by the U.S. economic stimulus plan more than doubled in June from May , according to a report released Tuesday by a House of Representatives committee .
At the end of June , 49,377 jobs had been ‚Äú created or sustained ‚Äù by water , highway and public transportation projects , compared to slightly more than 21,000 jobs at the end of May .
The Pacific Northwestern state of Washington accounted for the most jobs of any state or territory at 3,481 , with the bulk of those concentrated in highway repairs .
According to the Transportation Department , Washington has also been obligated some $ 627.8 million out of the $ 22.7 billion the states have requested from the federal government under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
President Barack Obama pushed to dedicate $ 48 billion in the two - year , $ 787 billion recovery act to transportation projects , in the hopes of allaying painfully high unemployment levels in construction and related work .
A few states and territories , such as Georgia and Guam , have not reported any jobs created or saved by the increased infrastructure spending .
Capital works projects have begun everywhere except the territories .
Only 142 capital works have been completed , however , the committee said .
The House committee regularly tracks how stimulus money is distributed to clean water revolving funds , highway infrastructure projects and transit capital assistance and will have a hearing on spending on Friday .
Most states have used most of the stimulus money for highway repairs , according to the committee .
A total of 5,079 highway and transit projects have been put out to bid in all 50 states , four territories and the District of Columbia , totaling $ 16.7 billion , the committee said .
A job counts as created if it did not exist before a stimulus grant was given to a project .
A sustained or saved job would have been eliminated if not for stimulus money .
The committee does not distinguish between jobs created and saved in its report .
Astronomers have discovered a young binary system where both stars are surrounded by thick disks of material that are in the process of forming planets !
And it 's a near thing , too -- this system almost did n't exist at all .
First , the cool image :
On the right is a Hubble Space Telescope image of the two stars ( collectively called , weirdly , 253- 1536 ) .
In the optical , the disk enveloping the star on the left ( called 253 - 53 a , so I 'll just call it Star A ) is obvious .
It 's dark because it blocks most of the light from the star , which is deeply embedded in the disk and can barely be seen .
The star on the right ( Star B ) has a disk as well , but it 's far smaller than the other star 's disk , and swamped by the light of the star .
So the components of this binary are like Jekyll and Hyde : one star is blocked by the dark disk , and in the other the disk is outglared by the bright star .
The image on the left was made using the Submillimeter Array , or SMA .
At this wavelength ( almost out in the radio part of the spectrum ) the warm dust in the disks is bright , and the stars are almost completely dark .
The disk on the right becomes obvious .
Using some relatively simple math , the mass of the disks can be calculated ( basically by measuring the size and brightness of the disks ) : Star A's disk on the left has a mass of about 70 times that of Jupiter , and Star B 's disk is about 20 times Jupiter 's mass .
Our entire solar system of planets ( that is , everything except the Sun ) has roughly twice the mass of Jupiter .
So what we 're seeing here is easily enough material to make a fully - fledged system of planets !
In fact , this is the very first time a binary star , where both stars are detected in visible light , has been seen where each has a disk capable of making planets .
Very cool .
And , actually , rather lucky for these stars .
They are located inside the vast Orion Nebula , a star - making factory about 1300 light years from Earth .
In the heart of the nebula is a cluster of stars containing extremely massive , hot , and bright stars .
The starlight from those beacons is so fierce that it actually disrupts disks around nearby young stars ; the ultraviolet light boils away the dust in a process called photoevaporation .
As you can see in this image ( which I took from the scientific journal paper about these observations ) 253-1536 is located about a parsec away ( more than 3 light years ) from the center of the nebula , sparing it from the harshest effects of those bright stars .
Had it been much closer , the disks around the two stars would have boiled away by now .
In a few million years , both these stars may have actual planets orbiting them .
Star B is a red dwarf , cool and dim , and it's not clear what type of star A is .
Probably not terribly massive , and I 'm guessing somewhat less massive than the Sun .
Imagine what the sky would look like from such a planet !
From Star
A's planets , for example , Star B would be an intense red glare in the sky , far far brighter than Venus appears from Earth .
The position of the other star in the sky would change slowly as the two stars complete their 4500 year long orbit .
And if you look away from the other star , you'd be looking deep into the heart of the nebula , where a dozen or more stars would shine almost as brightly as the Moon does from Earth !
And , of course , you 'd see the nebula itself stretched across half your sky , glowing red , green , and white .
I would sorely love to see such a thing .
Wow .
Whatever life that eventually evolves there would be very lucky to get such a view ... and they'd have another advantage over us .
The two stars of 253-1563 are separated by only about 400 times the Earth - Sun distance , about ten times the distance of Pluto from the Earth .
If they really had the will , life there could visit the other system !
It would be a technical achievement and difficult to be sure , but we 're almost there ourselves .
Hmph .
I do believe I 'm jealous of a hypothetical life form that wo n't even exist for billions of years , if it ever does !
Come to think of it , though , by the time any life there has the tech savvy to build rockets , all those bright stars in the nebula will have long since exploded as supernovae ... and worse , at a distance of only a few light years , those titanic explosions will do serious damage to any planets , and in fact could blow away those disks long before planets could form .
So maybe planets never will get a chance to exist there .
Wow , again : I went from jealous to sad awfully quickly .
But such is life in the Universe .
I suppose I should just be glad that we here on Earth are clever enough to create telescopes to give us a view of such a remarkable system , and that allows us to appreciate what we see ... and what we 've got already .
The cop is finishing his second tater tot when a call comes over the radio .
Officer Spearmint has just caught a girl and her pimp .
They 're across the street at the Pilot truck stop .
Terry Peters looks out into the darkness .
" The animals are out , " he says .
Then he turns to me and grins .
" You wanna go meet some hookers ? "
Peters finishes his Coke , smashes the paper cup and shifts the squad car into reverse .
They always give him the worst car in the lot , and tonight is no different .
We already fixed a flat .
We cross Lancaster Road and drive down a dark lane where a long row of 18 - wheelers are parked , engines rumbling loudly .
Peters guides the cruiser over a curb into an empty field next to the truck stop off Interstate 20 .
We speed across the bumpy terrain , headlights bouncing up and down over the weeds , and pull up next to Spearmint , a broad - shouldered young cop who punctuates every other sentence with a stream of spit .
The hooker and the pimp are standing in front of his car , caught in the glare of its headlights .
The whore is named Cookie Monster .
She 's 4 - foot - 11 , 200 pounds , with a pretty face , that -- come to think of it -- reminds Officer Spearmint of his sister - in - law .
He pulls out his cell phone to take a picture .
" My brother wo n't believe this , " he says , chuckling .
Cookie Monster does n't mind .
" You can tell by the number of teeth they have how long they 've been out here , " Peters says as we get out of the car .
Cookie Monster smiles to reveal a full set .
Her skin is dirty , with brown bruises here and there and scabs on her legs .
She wears a tight but fading skirt and a pair of dirty white Keds .
Big , sagging breasts .
Peterson points at them with the butt of his flashlight .
" That 's what gets you in trouble , " he says .
She smiles as if he 's embarrassed her .
" Do n't worry , " he says .
" We 're not buying . "
He hands her a cigarette .
" How you doin , ' Country ? " he asks the pimp .
Country 's good .
Country 's high .
Country 's got a bit of drool coming out of his mouth .
A filthy crack pipe lies in the dirt beside him .
Spearmint took it from him .
Man , Country would sure like that back .
" So how long you been doin ' this ? "
Peters asks the girl for my benefit , not his .
He knows the Cookie Monster story well enough to write it himself .
" Since I was 16 .
My baby daddy got me into it . "
" What are those tattoos on your arms ? " Spearmint asks .
" One is for my baby daddy .
The other is for my three kids . "
They 're in CPS now , and no , she does n't get to see them , and yes , she 's tried to change that , but no lawyer will take her case , and how do you think it feels to never see them ?
But Spearmint does n't let up , keeps asking her about her kids , when 's the last time she saw them and how old are they and on and on until she can't take it anymore .
Then the hard shell cracks , and she covers her face and starts crying .
Once she regains her composure , I ask her the question I came here for .
" How many girls do you know that have been killed ? "
She rolls her eyes .
" Shoot , I lost count . "
Country nods and mumbles something in agreement .
Cookie Monster herself has been beat up , raped , thrown out of speeding cars , left for dead .
It 's a wonder she 's still got all her teeth .
She 's 28 now .
" Strawberry got killed last year , got shot to death at the Southern Comfort Motel , " she begins .
Peters remembers that one .
Then there 's Stormy , Sweet Pea and Paper Chase .
Stormy , that was a weird one .
Her pimp , 24 - 7 , stole a van .
The police were chasing him and he ran into a pole .
Stormy got her head torn right off .
There 's other girls that just disappeared .
What about Cookie Monster - - does she ever think about getting killed ?
She takes another drag , looks back at the long line of truckers waiting for Peters and Spearmint to get the hell out of here .
The animals , as Peters calls them .
She rubs her arm , where the names of her three children are written in green ink .
Country looks down at her , waiting .
No , she finally says , stomping out her cigarette , she does n't think about it .
They call Peters the whore cop .
But even in his uniform , his skinny frame dwarfed by his bulletproof vest , he does n't look like a cop .
He is 55 , with the ashen , sunken cheeks of a lifelong smoker , a pockmarked chin and what he describes as a big nose .
His glasses seem to take up half his face .
If it were n't for his uniform , he could pass for a math teacher .
Perhaps philosophy would suit him better .
He 's full of one - liners .
One of his favorites : " There 's one thing you can be certain of .
Men and women will copulate . "
Peters is an expert on copulation , especially the illegal kind .
He knows pretty much every hooker in town .
And they know him .
They call him on his cell phone .
They call out to him when he drives by .
For some reason , they think his name is Peterson .
" Peterson ! " they yell , smiling , gap - toothed , cheeks covered in garish pink rouge .
" PETE - UH-SON ! "
He 's got a leather - bound book in his shirt pocket , under the bulletproof vest , full of their names .
Baby Doll .
Strawberry .
Angel .
He knows them all .
The dead and the still alive .
And they love him back .
Because he keeps them alive .
Peters has seen some sick stuff .
Girls in dumpsters , hands and legs bound , duct tape over the mouth and nose .
Death by suffocation .
Girls thrown off overpasses .
Girls shot , stabbed , strangled , raped .
They all worked truck stops such as this one .
Out here , a lot of ugly things happen .
If you 're a trucker , you 're aware of it -- the crack dealing , the robbing , the prostitution and , sometimes , the murders .
Maybe you keep your nose clean , like most truckers do , and only hear stories .
And maybe you indulge .
Maybe you 're one of the 300 or so truckers in Peters ' book of pimps , dealers and users -- maybe he 's arrested you .
If you 're not a trucker , the things that happen out here would surprise , even shock you .
This is another world , as Peters likes to say .
Take the truckers parked here on Peterbilt Avenue , which runs north - south behind the field .
Chances are they 're up to no good .
Maybe they 're smoking crack or doing a girl or both .
Sometimes , they 'll sit here for days , getting high , having sex .
Eventually they 'll run out of money .
So they sell their gas , usually to another trucker .
They might sell 100 gallons at a buck a gallon , which will buy enough crack to keep the trucker and the girl high for a couple more days .
If it comes to it , they 'll sell their wheels and then their cargo , until finally the truck is sitting on the side of a road somewhere , stripped down and empty , reported stolen .
This happens more than you would ever guess .
A couple months ago , Peters recovered a half - million - dollar load of M&Ms .
The other day , it was watermelons .
The dope dealers out here , they prey on truckers .
But it works both ways .
A driver might beat a girl instead of paying her .
The girl and her pimp might turn around and rob the driver .
Sooner or later somebody bigger and meaner will come along and pistol - whip the both of them , just for sport .
That 's how it works .
Everybody preys on each other .
Take the case of Bucket , a classic example .
A " little dirt - bag dope dealer " is how Peters remembers him .
He more or less lived out here , sometimes under an overpass , sometimes in the woods near the truck stop .
He was part dealer , part pimp , part crook .
He 'd use girls to get in trucks .
Once the girl was inside and the trucker had his pants down , the girl would kick open the door and in comes Bucket .
Together , he and the girl would beat up the trucker , if they had to , then rob the son of a bitch .
Well , Bucket had it coming .
He beat up girls , robbed them ; he even robbed other dealers .
He used to rob a dealer named Youngster , who in turn did the same to Bucket .
It was almost a game between the two .
So Youngster started hiding his dope up his ass .
Well , one night Bucket decided he wanted more than Youngster 's money ; he wanted his dope .
So he reached up Youngster 's ass and took it .
There was n't a much more demeaning thing he could do to Youngster , him being a young black male and all , so Youngster shot Bucket , and that was one less dope dealer Peters had to worry about .
Not that Peters does n't worry about the dope dealers .
It 's his job to worry about everybody .
But his main concern is the girls .
They get beat up by the drivers , the dealers , the pimps , even by each other .
They get raped and cut up and left for dead , and the security guards do n't even call the cops to report it .
" I'm not out here to save them or nothin ' like that .
I do n't care .
They made a choice .
I 'll throw them in jail like anybody else .
But they do not deserve to be beaten to death .
They do not deserve to be slaughtered . "
He runs through the names of dead hookers who once worked this stop .
Rachel Garcia , aka Strawberry , killed two years ago at the Southern Comfort Motel .
A pimp known as Little Leonard shot her a bunch of times in the face then pulled all the gold out of her mouth .
Janet Tina Hendrix , aka Stormy .
She 's the girl that got her head chopped off riding in a stolen car .
" Hell of a way to give head , " Peters cracks .
That book in the back , that three - ring binder that 's thick with pictures of hookers , pimps , users and dealers ?
The hook book ?
She 's in there .
You should see all the mug shots Peters took over the years .
In the first one she looks like the girl next door : chestnut - colored hair , a little button nose , bright red lipstick .
Not bad - looking for a hooker .
Not bad - looking period .
Then drugs begin taking their toll .
The last picture Peters took does n't even look like the same person .
Her face is bloated , her hair dyed blond , black roots showing .
Her eyes are ringed with dark circles .
Her stare is vacant , like nobody 's home .
She looks half - dead .
The list continues .
Tracy Figures , aka Paper Chase , found in a dumpster in Bienville Parish , Louisiana , duct tape over her mouth and nose .
Josie Lee Scott , aka Sweet Pea , found in a dumpster in Colorado Springs .
Maybe the trucker 's story -- that they got high together and her death was an accident -- is true .
" You know what the worst part of her death was ?
Nobody gave a shit , " he says , looking into the black night .
" No family , no friends , no nothing .
That 's the thing , these girls out here , nobody cares .
It 's like they 're disposable . "
Most every night , Peters comes out here .
It 's more or less his beat .
He 'll talk to the crackheads and the wheel polishers and the girls .
He might ask about a stolen rig , he might write some tickets , he might haul someone to jail .
Not much surprises him anymore .
He was born in Chicago , raised in Phoenix , and that 's where he wanted to go when he decided to become a cop after 20 years in the Army .
Instead , he got a call from Dallas .
That was 16 years ago .
He 's still low man on the totem pole at DPD , but he does n't mind .
His job is interesting , to say the least .
We continue on Peterbilt , slowly cruising past a row of trucks parked illegally .
For the most part , the rigs are exceptionally clean .
Their hoods , their chrome grills and their spit - shined wheels all gleam under the streetlights .
A few truckers are sitting in their cabs , filling out their logbooks .
Others are outside , checking their load .
Some of the rigs appear empty , the velvet curtains between the cab and the sleeper pulled shut .
" None of these trucks should be parked here , " Peters says .
He points to a row of smashed " No Parking " signs lying in the field .
" Who do you think ran those over ? "
He points to a trucker sitting in the cab of his truck , acting busy .
Peters reaches back and turns up the CB radio he keeps in the backseat .
He 's on the same channel most of the truckers use .
This is how he gathers intelligence .
It 's a mess of static and beeps and clicks and 10 - 4s and fuck yous and what you say nigger and one driver talking over another in a string of code words only truckers understand .
Peters is hoping to hear a driver making a date .
Instead , the first thing he hears is this : " Hide all the women -- the po-lice are riding through . "
Countersurveillance is what this is , and Peters considers it a huge pain in the rear .
He reaches back and takes the CB receiver in his hand , holds it close to his mouth .
" Yeah , I 'm the po-lice , " he says in his best trucker voice , a convincing Southern drawl .
" I 'm truck stop po-lice .
See me over here in this white bobtail parked on the corner , I be truuuck stop po-lice . "
Peters loves messing with truckers .
He knows their lingo , and he thinks it 's pretty funny , carrying on like this , hassling them about their logbooks or whatever .
Often , he poses as a trucker on the radio , and it usually takes at least a few minutes for the trucker on the other end to realize he 's been had .
Peters once had everyone convinced that a big black officer was his illegitimate son .
That one still cracks him up .
" I bet you ain't got your last seven days done , " he 's saying on the radio in his best Boss Hog voice .
" You want to see my logbook ? " a trucker asks incredulously .
" Yeah , I want to see it , but who 's going to write it for you ?
You 're too dumb to write it .
Maybe you can get a hooker to write it for you , " he says with a grin .
Then he turns the radio off .
" I 'm not saying all truckers are bad .
Most of them are just blue - collar guys , working hard .
But these ones just sitting here ?
It 's real simple .
Professional drivers drive .
They know the distances , they know the routes , they plan it all out .
They do n't hide out where crack whores are . "
We pull onto another street , where not a single truck is parked .
In the darkness , I make out the figure of a man at the edge of the field , sitting on a concrete block .
We slow to a crawl for a better look .
It 's Hillbilly , Peters says .
He washes wheels .
He might charge between $ 3 and $ 5 a wheel , which takes him between half an hour and an hour per wheel .
" Peterson ? "
Hillbilly calls out , unsure .
Peters waves .
Hillbilly relaxes and ambles over to the cruiser .
He 's tall and lanky , dressed in a a grease - stained T - shirt and jeans .
He 's letting his graying Afro grow out , sort of Rasta - style , with one small braid down below his right ear .
He has smiling , glassy eyes and an oddly serene look on his face .
He may be high .
Peters introduces us , and Hillbilly shakes my hand .
He 's the guardian angel of the truck stop , he says .
He used to be in the Navy , he tells me proudly , which is why he and " Peterson " respect each other , both of them being vets .
Now most of the money he makes , washing wheels and whatnot , he spends on his mother , who is in a nursing home .
" What goes on out here ? " I ask .
" Shoot , what do n't go on ? "
Being guardian angel of the place , Hillbilly has seen a lot .
He 's had to break windows to get girls out of dangerous situations .
He points to a " No Parking " sign lying in the dirt .
Once , he says , he had to pick one of those up and smash a driver 's window to get his attention .
Only then did he let the girl out .
A call comes over the radio .
Spearmint 's got a driver .
" Gotta go , " Peters says .
As we pull away , Hillbilly is still talking , telling me that Peters is one of the good ones , a man to be trusted .
" You take care of yourself , you hear ? "
Hillbilly calls out .
We find Spearmint down on the other end of Peterbilt , in the middle of a long row of trucks .
He spits when he sees us .
He 's got the girl next to his car .
The trucker is still in his rig .
" Now you asked me earlier what kind of guy would buy these girls ? "
Peters asks .
" You 're about to find out . "
Spearmint tells the trucker to step out of the cab .
" See what I mean ? " Peters asks .
" He must weigh 400 pounds . "
The man , I will soon learn , goes by Mojo , and he's on his way to Ohio .
Originally from New York , he 's been a trucker for 14 years .
If he 's like most of the truckers Peters arrests , he 's got a wife at home .
As he steps down from the chrome steps of his rig , he hitches up his sweatpants , up over his hairy crack .
Besides loneliness , he suffers from a severe stuttering problem .
Every other question , he gets stuck on a word .
" She was wa - wa - wa - wa - wa - wa - wa - wa - walking by , I called her over , she jumped in , we hid in the back . "
Hearing this , the hooker in question , who Peters does n't recognize , smiles as if this is a lie .
" How often do you get a hooker ? " I ask .
" Whenever I get a chance . "
" How much do you spend ? "
" It de - de - de - de - de - de - depends on how hot they are .
High dollar ?
I might spend 100 bucks .
A cheap one 's like $ 20 . "
The girl tells a different story .
They were just talking .
Men pay her for that .
She 's a great conversationalist .
Peters looks up at me .
" Can you believe the shit I hear every day ? "
Spend any time with Peters and there 's one murder he 's sure to bring up .
Of all the truck stop hookers ever killed , none generated the attention Casey Jo Pipestem did .
She was found January 31 , 2004 , in a ditch in Grapevine .
The crime scene photos are the sort that stick in your mind .
The first one was taken from the highway bridge , 32 feet and 7 inches above her body , through the gray branches of a tree covered in frost .
In the black of the night , the flash illuminated the naked body , the twisted legs , the dark silky hair fanned out around her head .
The way investigators figured it , she was thrown from the bridge , probably by a trucker who killed her .
Eventually , through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribal police in Seminole , Oklahoma , Grapevine police located her family .
They looked at the photos , saw the tattoos and told the police they had seen enough .
Yes , that 's her , they said , but please , take those pictures away .
They wanted to remember her differently .
They wanted to remember the girl who taught Sunday School at the Methodist church , who danced in the traditional ceremonies .
They used to call her " Bonez " because she was so skinny .
They did n't want to remember her facedown on a creek bed , one foot in the black water .
When did things start going wrong ?
Maybe when her grandmother died .
Maybe when her stepfather was killed in a knife fight .
Maybe when she met Kelvin Scott at a party .
That was probably it , more than anything else .
First he was her boyfriend , then her pimp .
She started using cocaine with him .
She started working truck stops .
She started calling herself " thugarific " and writing bleak , foreboding lines of poetry .
On one occasion , she told her uncle , a trucker picked her up and held her against her will for three days , sexually assaulting her along the way from Oklahoma to Los Angeles .
She found her way home , and her family tried to help her , but it was too late .
Barry McLead was one of the last people to see her alive .
He ran a truck stop ministry near Oklahoma City .
A few days after her body was found , he discovered two notes stuffed in the door of his horse trailer , which he 'd converted into a chapel .
One read : " Hey Minister , you need to get busy for Jesus and clear the whores out of here . "
It was signed , " Warning . "
From the beginning , investigators thought Pipestem 's death could be the work of a serial killer .
Other truck stop prostitutes had been found in other states , killed the same way -- strangled , beaten , discarded .
None of their murders had garnered much attention .
Pipestem 's death was different .
Maybe because it happened so close to a big city , maybe because the media loves stories of serial killers -- for whatever reason , the press latched on to the story .
Throughout that spring and summer , the killing continued .
Buffie Rae Brawley , a 27 - year - old out of Toledo , was found March 24 in the parking lot of a former truck stop about 35 miles out of Indianapolis .
Her mouth and nose had been taped shut .
" It appears the guy pulled up in a semi -- you can tell by the tracks -- and tossed her out , " the local sheriff told the Fort Worth Star - Telegram .
" She was dead before she hit the ground . "
She was wearing a shirt and bra when they found her , the sheriff said , and had injuries from bindings around her wrists and ankles .
" This guy in my opinion tortured her , " he said .
" He beat her over the head .
There were four distinct trauma injuries to the head that caused 3 - inch gaps .
This guy did n't care if she was found or not .
He ran over her right foot with one of his rear tires .
This may have been out of contempt . "
In August , two more hookers were found dead ; one in Mississippi , the other in Oklahoma .
Cops throughout the South began working on the case , meeting once that summer in Oklahoma City and once in Grapevine to discuss the unsolved murders of 15 truck stop prostitutes .
The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigations , which ran lead in the investigation , estimated that at least 10 of the killings were linked .
The big break came in the summer of 2005 when America 's Most Wanted aired a program on Pipestem 's murder .
Shortly after , Grapevine police got a tip that the murderer was already in jail in Mississippi .
The caller on the other end was a relative of the man in question , 29 - year - old John Robert Williams .
Grapevine police detectives traveled to Mississippi to interview Williams .
For two days they questioned him .
" He was pleasant to talk to , " Grapevine Corporal Larry Hallmark remembers .
" If you met him at the truck stop , you 'd think , ' Oh , there 's just a likable old truck driver . '
But after you sit and start talking about some of these murders and talk about some of the specific things that occurred and you see the lack of emotion , then you realize that you 're dealing with someone that 's different than you and I .
" I 'm absolutely convinced that he is the one that killed Casey .
Even the first day he admitted some knowledge in the murder and gave us some information that only the killer would have known . "
Hallmark thinks Williams has killed at least eight truck stop prostitutes .
Williams has already agreed to plea bargains in the deaths of two of them .
To avoid interfering with any open investigations , Grapevine police have held off on arresting him for Pipestem 's murder , but it 's only a matter of time .
If there is any good to come out of Pipestem 's murder it is this :
It created a network for cops pursuing truck stop killers .
There are now regional meetings , such as the one held in Grapevine , every couple of months , and at least weekly , Hallmark talks to cops such as Peters , who are on the front lines , so to speak .
Without a doubt , Hallmark says , there are other killers out there .
" I 'm not saying that most truck drivers are serial killers or that if you 're a truck driver there 's a good likelihood that you 're a serial killer .
But if you 're a serial killer , truck driving would be a good profession . "
Terry Peters likes to say that he does n't care about the girls .
But ride with him for a while , and you 'll see different .
Girls will call him .
Girls that are sober , girls that have cleaned up their lives .
One is a drug counselor now ; another works at the mall behind a cosmetics counter .
Which cosmetics counter and which mall , Peters wo n't say .
Well , he 'll say , but you better not print it .
The last thing these girls need is some newspaper reporter putting them on the front page as former crack whores .
They 're trying to move on , and they 're fragile .
When they call , his voice softens .
It 's like he 's talking to his grown children .
" Oh , she 's fine , " he 'll say , when they ask about his wife , to whom he 's been married for 33 years .
She has health problems and this worries the girls , because they care about Peters .
When he hangs up he 'll start worrying himself -- how this one 's been struggling , how this one 's been sober for three years now , how this one 's having dreams about smoking dope .
" But I do n't ever smoke it in my dreams , " says one of the former prostitutes , who calls me at Peters ' request .
" Either the lighter wo n't light , or there 'll be a breeze , or the dope will fall off the pipe and when I pick it up it 's a peanut or something . "
She can laugh at it all now .
She went by Baby Doll back when she worked the truck stops .
She got started in Corpus Christi , and one night she fell asleep in a driver 's truck , and that 's how she ended up in Dallas .
The money was so good she never left .
For seven years she worked the truck stops near I - 20 and Lancaster Road , which is where she met Peters .
Hers was a $ 300 a day habit , but she made more than $ 1,000 a day , easy .
Most of it came from dealing , not prostitution .
After she 'd smoked her crack , she spent what was left on a hotel room and food .
Tried to take care of herself , unlike some of the other girls , who did n't even bathe .
She got hurt like everybody else .
Once , a guy who claimed to be a cop picked her up in a little red pickup .
He had a badge on and a radio and everything .
He raped her .
Another time , another guy claiming to be a cop took her to a hotel room and made her strip .
Told her if she did what he asked he would n't take her in , so she did what he asked .
Maybe he was a cop , but she does n't think so .
Worst thing that ever happened to her ?
Maybe the time two truckers robbed her and cut her up .
She rubbed blood all over their cab so the police could catch them .
Then she ran over to the Flying J truck stop and found a security guard .
" He would n't even call the police for me , just because I was a prostitute .
That 's how we were looked upon . "
In that kind of situation , it 's easy to get frustrated , which is why the girls will rob the drivers or collude with pimps to rob them .
Sometimes , truckers get killed too .
She knows a girl that got put in jail for 10 years , another for 35 years on an armed robbery charge .
She was put in jail many times , often by Peters .
Finally , she looked around at all the women getting old and dying in prison and decided she did n't want that for herself .
" Then I started reading the Bible , and I realized , this is not me and the way I want to live my life . "
When she got out of prison , she got a job at Golden Corral .
One night , Peters came in with his wife .
He did n't even recognize Baby Doll at first .
For as many times as he arrested her , he should have .
Now she 's a drug counselor and trying to get into Bible college .
She goes to church in Balch Springs , and you could say that 's her life .
She talks to Peters every month or so .
He just calls to see how she 's doing , which makes her laugh , because she 's doing fine .
It 's a hot Wednesday afternoon in August .
This evening , when it gets dark , Peters and I are going back out to the truck stop .
It will be my last visit .
We meet at the Southeast Patrol Substation , a squat brick building off Jim Miller Road , hidden from view by some raggedy trees that look like they need water .
Peters buzzes me in and leads me into a messy conference room .
There 's some kind of diagram on the dry - erase board -- stick figures and boxy cars and crisscrossing streets -- the remains of a briefing on a robbery , or a murder , I can't tell .
Peters pulls up a chair in front of a computer .
This is where he spends a good portion of his time .
With every new hooker he meets , he has to enter all her information into the database .
It 's a tedious job -- one hooker might take four hours , checking out all her aliases and stuff -- but it 's important .
Say there 's a robbery at one of the truck stops and all someone has is a nickname , such as Sweet Pea .
With a database of more than 1,100 prostitutes , chances are Peters can identify her if she came from one of the truck stops he works .
When he finishes , we hit the highway .
Tonight , Peters promises , we wo n't get a flat .
On the way , he talks about different things that have happened since my last visit -- stolen cargo recovered , different girls that have shown up , that kind of thing .
A big 18 - wheeler rumbles by .
I think of something the spokesman at the American Trucking Association told me : " Trucking keeps America running . "
And it 's true .
Eighty - seven percent of the stuff you and I buy is at one point hauled by truckers .
Maybe some truckers are ex-cons and maybe some smoke crack , but they account for a very small percentage of the trucking industry .
Think of it this way : Every day , 5,000 trucks pass through the five truck stops Peters works .
Over the last three years , he 's arrested maybe 300 truckers .
A tiny fraction .
Still , the way Peters sees it , some of these stops could do a bit more in terms of safety .
Like the Pilot , the stop that gives him the most trouble .
They could start by patrolling their lot .
( I will later learn that they do patrol it .
A spokesman for Pilot says they have two security guards on the lot at all times .
As far as what goes on in the field next to the truck stop or on the surrounding side streets , the spokesman said that is the responsibity of the police or whoever owns the property . )
We exit the highway and drive down Lancaster , past the fast - food restaurants , toward the field where I first met Cookie Monster .
It 's kind of dead .
There are few trucks and not a girl in sight .
Through the crackle of the radio , through all the talk about niggers and crack whores and screwing , we hear a small , quavering voice trying to make a date .
" That 's Twinkie , " Peters says .
" She 's new . "
More than any other girl out here , she 's in danger , Peters says .
" She does n't have her street smarts yet . "
We see a man walking along the field .
He 's wearing a dirty backpack and a dirty Cowboys hat and has a white towel thrown over his shoulder .
" Nationwide , " Peters says with a grin .
Peters pulls up next to him .
" Nationwide , how you doing ? "
Nationwide squints , suspicious , keeping his distance .
Once he sees it 's Peters behind the wheel , he smiles and approaches the car .
He leans down to Peters ' level , his hands on his knees .
He 's got two bottom teeth , that 's it .
His face is tanned and weather - beaten .
He looks like a dirty elf .
" What are you hearing ? " Peters asks .
" Gas prices are up . "
" Violence increases , " Peters says , as if he 's finished the riddle .
Nationwide nods .
" How 's business ? "
Peters asks , pointing with his chin at Nationwide 's dirty white towel .
Nationwide 's a wheel polisher .
" They 're paying less , " Nationwide says .
" They want pussy .
I say man , you 're looking for pussy out here ?
You'd be better off with Henrietta and her five sisters . "
He grins and lifts his hand , makes the motion of jerking off .
Peters chuckles .
" Yeah , you 're probably right . "
Nationwide uses the towel to wipe the sweat from his brow .
" They just spend their money on crack and whores . "
Peters reaches into the back seat , where he keeps his semi-automatic rifle and his CB radio , and grabs a pack of cigarettes .
He throws them to Nationwide , who catches them with both hands .
" Thanks , " Nationwide says .
When darkness falls , we drive around , looking for Twinkie .
We see a fat hooker in a see - through black dress , hiding in the shadows behind one of the trucks .
" Betty Boop , " Peters says .
" She comes from big money up in Plano . "
She scowls as we drive by and Peters laughs .
" Peterson ! " she calls out when she recognizes him .
" Come back ! "
We 're at a gas station , finishing up with a hooker who can barely keep her sagging boobs in her tank top when Peters ' cell phone rings .
It 's Spearmint .
He tells Peters to come to the field .
We cross the street and drive past a long row of trucks and pull into the field .
The girl is squatted down in front of a chain - link fence , shielding her eyes from Spearmint 's headlights .
She 's skinny , with knobby knees , dressed in a denim skirt and a lingerie - like top trimmed in black lace .
She has fine features .
Thin lips , thin eyebrows , big eyes .
It 's Twinkie , the girl we heard earlier on the radio .
Peters calls her over to his car and gets her story .
She was a dancer in Austin .
She met a guy , thought she could trust him .
He dropped her off out here .
Three weeks ago she met another trucker .
They went to Chicago together .
Thought she could trust him too .
Found out he was married , so she hitchhiked to Shreveport .
I ask Peters if I can talk to her alone .
He nods .
We step back , next to the chain - link fence .
There is trash all around us .
An empty whiskey bottle , a black shoe , a smashed Burger King cup .
This girl is different from the other hookers :
There is n't a bruise on her .
No visible scars .
Talking to her is different too .
She fidgets as she answers my questions , biting her nails .
She 'll look me in the eye only in passing , darting glances .
She can't even bring herself to admit what she does out here .
Tears are in her eyes .
" You know , I heard them talking on the radio , they were talking about killing us for 20 cents . "
" Who ? "
" The drivers .
Talking about killing us and cutting our throats . "
She shakes her head and looks out toward the highway .
" They were talking about us like we 're just meat . "
She says it as if she 's surprised .
She 's 32 , but she looks like she could be in college .
" I 've seen the good side of them too .
But last night , I was with this guy and the look I saw in his eyes , I was scared .
I had to think the worst for my own protection .
I hear them talking on their radios , ' I 'm going to slit that bitch 's throat and stab her in her heart . ' "
For the first time , she looks me dead in the eye and shakes her head slowly , as if to say , is n't that the worst thing you 've ever heard ?
" I used to do this sometimes when I was a dancer , " she says .
" But I never thought I 'd stoop this low . "
Peters calls her over to his car .
He gives her two numbers .
One is for a homeless shelter , another is for a rehab center .
He urges her to call both .
She takes his card , and as we drive off , she disappears into the night .
" Could you detect a smell ? " Peters asks .
" She 's starting to use the perfume instead of washing .
Because she can't find a tub , and she 's got nowhere to go , and she did n't score enough money last night or the night before for a hotel room . "
We drive behind the truck stop and turn left on Cedardale Road , which leads to a slum neighborhood .
At the end of the road , Peters shines his spotlight on an abandoned house .
The white paint is chipping , the windows have been busted out .
Inside , broken furniture 's scattered about , a stained mattress is leaned against one dirty wall .
" This is where Twinkie hopes to stay tonight , but she 's not sure if she can .
It 's up to the pimp who runs it .
She 's still going through the breaking - in process , so to speak .
You know , the guys have to quote - unquote use her . "
We sit there for a minute or two looking at the empty house .
The CB radio in the back is crackling with trucker talk .
A call is coming over the police radio .
Peters ignores it all , staring hard at the house .
Maybe Twinkie will call those numbers he gave her .
Maybe she 'll be calling him in a couple years , asking him how his wife is .
But probably not .
If you ask a gas station attendant to top off your tank , as of today you 're asking them to break the law .
A statewide ban on topping off gas tanks goes into effect today .
Oregon environmental regulators approved the rule last year that forbids a station attendant from pumping more fuel into a car after the pump 's automatic nozzle clicks off .
( Though the law does make allowances for so - called " false clicks " that occur before a tank is filled . )
Now the state is in the process of educating gas stations about the new regulation and distributing " Do n't Top Off ! " posters , which could soon be ubiquitous .
When it comes to enforcing the new rule , the state would first send warnings to gas stations that are repeat offenders .
Only in the most extreme cases would they issue a minor penalty , said William Knight , a spokesman for the Department of Environmental Quality .
" We would n't be talking thousands of dollars or attendants jailed or anything like that , " Knight said .
The department warns that topping off can spill excess gasoline and release benzene and other toxins into the air .
And the agency said modern pumps do n't allow extra fuel to feed into the tank anyway , which can lead to customers getting charged for fuel they do n't get .
" Topping off the tank helps no one , resulting in a high level of benzene exposure for anyone in the immediate area and increased costs to consumers , " said Environmental Quality Commission Chair Bill Blosser .
" It is clear that through a simple change in procedure at Oregon gas stations we can better protect public health and the environment . "

Docherty was accused of killing three cats and torturing others
A man accused of torturing and killing cats has pleaded guilty to charges of cruelty against several animals .
Anthony John Docherty , 23 , killed three of the cats .
All were decapitated , two were scalped , and one had its tail pulled off .
Docherty , who is from Clarkston , East Renfrewshire , committed the offences in January .
He was spat on and pushed as he left Paisley Sheriff Court .
Sentencing was deferred until Tuesday 2 June for psychiatric reports .
Docherty caused the animals unnecessary suffering by screaming at them , pinching them and taping their paws together .
One of them was shouted at , pinched , and bound before Docherty inserted a foreign object into its body , causing internal damage and bleeding .
He was originally charged with decapitating one cat and binding the paws of two others with tape , but denied the charges at a court appearance in February .
Fresh charges were then brought by the Crown , replacing the previous complaint with seven charges of animal cruelty against several cats .
He was charged under the Animal Health and Welfare Act of 2006 .
Docherty was previously alleged to have stolen the animals , before detaining them in a bedroom in his house , but he denied stealing them .
The charges refer to events which took place between 1 and 25 January in Clarkston .
Sheriff George Kavanagh described Docherty 's actions as " contemptible " and " utterly distasteful " .
Defence lawyer Jonathan Manson said his client had " various difficulties " which needed to be taken into account .
After pleading guilty , Docherty was granted bail with special conditions which prevent him from having any contact with animals .
His sentencing was deferred for psychiatric and full background reports .
Apparently , the people at FoxNation did n‚Äôt realize the blog , Elective Decisions , posted a satirical statement from former Governor Tom Ridge ( R ) about Rush Limbaugh :
So this morning , Ridge went back on Washington Journal , responding to Limbaugh ‚Äôs rhetoric .
‚Äú I ‚Äôm so sick of Rush Limbaugh .
He ‚Äôs the reason we lose elections .
He needs to get the hell out of the Republican Party .
As far as I ‚Äôm concerned , he is n‚Äôt a Republican anymore .
The man ‚Äôs running .
The man ‚Äôs hiding .
He ‚Äôs too scared to face me ! ‚Äù
Ridge continued his rant , threatening Limbaugh .
‚Äú Meanwhile , he sits there in his ‚Äò Southern Command Post , ‚Äô and destroys the Republican Party !
I ‚Äôd like to just have three rounds in a boxing ring with that guy so I could shut him up !
I ‚Äôm caling ( sic ) you out , Limbaugh .
Let ‚Äôs see if you have a big enough set of marbles to back up your crap ! ‚Äù

Equalities Minister Harriet Harman has been accused of over - stating the plight of women in the workplace : using misleading statistics to make it look as though female workers are having a tougher time than they really are .
After the debacle over the use of knife crime statistics last year , one would have thought that ministers might have learned their lesson .
But I am reliably informed that when the National Statistician Karen Dunnell went to the Government Equalities Office last November and told them that their way of calculating gender pay differences might be confusing and potentially damaging , the GEO ignored her and published anyway .
So instead of the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) pay - gap figure of 12.8 % ( hardly something to crow about ) , the department put out a press release in April this year which stated that women are paid , on average , 23 % less per hour than men .
Now a letter has been sent to Harriet Harman by Sir Michael Scholar , the chair of the UK Statistics Authority ( the official watchdog on the use of government stats ) , saying that her use of the 23 % figure " may undermine public trust in official statistics " and " risks giving a misleading quantification of the gender pay gap " .
The GEO 's version of events is rather different to that of my source .
They claim that they " ran the 23 % past the ONS and they approved the calculation " .
They may have ticked the maths , I pressed , but did they approve the use of the figure ?
" As far as I am aware , " said a spokesperson , " no - one from the ONS has ever suggested we should not use the figure . "
However , the official promised to check .
What the GEO and ONS agree is that the UK 's official statisticians are currently reviewing how they can best present the gender pay gap - a review which is ongoing .
Both the ONS and the GEO number come from the same data source , but the equalities department and Britain 's top statisticians interpreted them very differently .
The 2008 Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings ( ASHE ) attempts to provide the detail needed to get a true picture of how men and women fare in the workplace .
For me , this is a key table :
Comparing men and women who work full - time , the gender pay gap is 12.8 % , the ONS preferred measure .
Looking at part - time workers , women actually do better than men : their hourly rate is 3.4 % higher than their male counterparts .
But when you add the two together , because part - timers get paid less than full - timers and because there are nearly four times as many part - time female workers as there are male , the gap appears to jump to 22.6 % , which the GEO rounds up to 23 % .
The GEO justifies its approach to me in a short statement :
" The 23 % gender pay gap figure used by the Government Equalities Office includes both full and part - time employees .
With women representing over three - quarters of the UK 's part - time workforce , we believe this figure gives the fullest picture of the country 's gender pay gap . "
Nowhere in the press release , though , is the point made that those part - time workers are actually outstripping men who work part - time .
There is clearly some quiet fury at the ONS that Harriet Harman should have apparently rebuffed the country 's foremost statistician .
My source tells me : " The most important point is that the GEO has no statisticians inside it . "
The question , then , is : who did approve the 23 % figure ?
One of Ms Harman 's officials promised to find out for me , but did say that the decision was made " across government " .
If one accepts my ONS source 's version of events , this was not a professional difference of opinion between two statistical experts .
Harriet Harman 's officials preferred their in - house interpretation of the data to the independent and professional one because , one might assume , it made the case for their controversial Equalities Bill look a little stronger .
Attached to the letter from Sir Michael Scholar are the notes from the Monitoring and Assessment team at the authority which investigated the case .
This suggests that it is not just the GEO which may occasionally get political with the numbers .
The Equalities and Human Rights Commission refers to a gender pay gap of 35.6 % for women working part - time .
It comes to this conclusion by comparing the mean hourly earnings of female part - time workers with those of male full - time workers .
As the Statistics Authority document so delicately puts it :
" While we see value in providing a range of measures to present the differences between the earnings of women compared with men , a gender pay gap that compares the hourly earnings of women part - time employees with men full - time employees needs particularly careful explanation and justification if it is not to mislead . "
That there is an issue about the pay gap between men and women is not disputed .
But there must be a danger , as Sir Michael Scholar says in his letter , that throwing around unofficial and misleading numbers is " likely to confuse the general public " and to " undermine public trust " .
It also makes it more difficult for people to understand what is really happening in the workplace .
The ' Searaser ' uses the power of the ocean to pump water inland for electricity generation .
Mark Anslow reports on the simple invention that could soon be making waves in renewables .
From the Ecologist , part of the Guardian Environment Network
Alvin Smith had his eureka moment not in the bath , but in the swimming pool .
' I was swimming round the pool , making little waves , and it struck me how much power there was in the displacement of the water , ' he remembers .
' You think of a 500 - tonne boat : a wave comes along , lifts that whole boat , and then drops it down again .
You must be able to harness some of that , I thought . '
His subsequent invention would have made Archimedes proud , and should be making the renewables industry very excited .
Dubbed ' Searaser ' , it consists of what looks like a navigation buoy , but is in fact a simple arrangement of ballast and floats connected by a piston .
As a wave passes the device , the float is lifted , raising the piston and compressing water .
The float sinks back down on the tail of the wave on to a second float , compressing water again on the downstroke .
What is particularly clever about Searaser , however , is its simplicity .
Where most marine energy devices have sealed , lubricated innards and complex electronics , Searaser is lubricated entirely by seawater , has no electronic components and is even self - cleaning .
Smith describes it as ' Third - World mechanics ' , but this belies the sophistication of the concept .
' The beauty of it is that we 're only making a pump , and bringing water ashore , ' he explains .
' All the other technology needed to generate the electricity already exists . '
Searaser is designed to pump water either straight through a sea - level turbine to generate electricity , or up to a clifftop reservoir , where the water could be stored until needed , then allowed to flow back down to the sea through turbines , generating electricity on demand .
The second option is the one about which Smith is most passionate .
By effectively storing the energy generated by Searaser to be used on demand , his system would solve a problem that dogs almost all renewable technologies ‚Äì their variability .
Energy that can be summoned at will is not only more valuable , but also allows the grid to compensate for other , less easily controlled renewables such as wind and solar .
Early trials of the prototype Searaser , one of which was completed in April , have proved encouraging .
Despite being less than a tenth of the size of the version he hopes will eventually be supplying power to our homes , Smith 's homemade machine managed to pump some 112,000 litres of water a day during the trial , at times operating from waves a mere 6 in high .
The eventual machine will be capable of generating 1 megawatt of electricity ‚Äì enough to supply some 1,700 homes ‚Äì at prices that the team behind Searaser believe will be lower than most other renewable technologies .
As an intermediate step , a trial of two midsize machines should go ahead towards the end of this year , with a university invited to monitor the trial and provide independent accreditation of the results .
Although these machines wo n't generate electricity ( they will simply pump water through a flow meter to determine their potential ) they will demonstrate whether the technology can work for prolonged periods and in rough conditions .
For Smith , however ‚Äì a man who could use a welder by the age of eight ‚Äì the incremental steps between prototype and commercial deployment seem almost an irritation .
His vision is already far advanced , and includes using the pressurised saltwater generated by Searaser to produce drinking water , using the same reverse osmosis process used in conventional , energy - hungry desalination plants .
' All you 'd have to do is reduce the size of the piston and increase the size of the floats to increase the pressure , ' he explains .
He has also put plenty of thought into how he would persuade planners and landowners to allow him to build reservoirs on top of cliffs to provide the energy storage for Searaser .
' The planning will frighten everyone , ' he says , ' but if you were trying to produce as much energy from wind turbines , they'd be very visible ; a reservoir you 'd only see from above . '
Smith has also put thought into how the reservoir could be made as water - tight as possible ‚Äì vital to avoid saltwater leaching into soils .
By double - lining the reservoirs and including an outlet pipe in between the two linings , you would instantly be able to see if the uppermost lining had a puncture by watching the end of the outlet pipe .
' If you saw any water coming out , you 'd know you had a leak and you could drain down the reservoir and sort it out , ' he says .
Beyond being simply functional , however , Smith believes the reservoirs could be beautiful , providing recreational spaces for watersports or sites for shellfish farmers .
' I bet the birds would love it , too , ' he adds .
Although Searaser is clearly a commercial project and Smith hopes to see a return on his patents , he is also keen to see the technology deployed abroad , given that its simplicity lends itself to installation and maintenance in the less - industrialised world .
' It 's a modular system : a community could start off with two or three machines , and expand as necessary .
It can go round the globe , it really can , ' he says .

This article appeared in the June issue of the Ecologist , part of the Guardian Environment Network
Yestermorning I presented an ad hoc compression method known as RLE , or run-length encoding and I got quite more reactions than I thought I would .
Many suggested doing plenty of other stuff despite the fact that the post was about RLE , not about < insert your favorite compression method > .
But something very nice happened : people got interested and many suggestions came forth .
I decided to implement the median - based prediction method as suggested by Dark Shikari here .
Let us see the results !
The median prediction , as used in the FFV1 lossless video codec that uses only intra-frame coding , uses the following context :
The prediction is given by :
Which means that if color images are considered , the predicted color of the pixel ‚Äò?‚Äô is given by the median of the colors .
In RGB ( or more like some other YUV - like color space ) , that means that the prediction is applied on each color plane separately .
The difference with the actual color and the predicted color is then encoded .
Using ‚Äú continuous ‚Äù colors , the residual ( the difference ) is likely to be smaller in magnitude than the original range of the colors ; using an efficient code yields compression .
What happens when you have a palette image ?
As Dark Shikari suggested , let us use the color in the palette that is the closest to the prediction as the predicted color .
But that leaves the problem of encoding the error .
Palette images have a problem in this regard : colors are not necessarily sorted in any smart way !
Encoding the error pretty much means encoding the correct palette index .
To circumvent this problem , I use the same technique as I used with the simpler context prediction of yesterday ; I compute the ranking for each color in the palette at each pixel .
The closest to the prediction gets rank 0 , the furthest , rank 3 .
To measure the difference with the palette colors and the predicted color , I tried two approaches .
One is based on the approximate perceived brightness difference , where the difference is given by the formula .
The second is to count the number of components that differ , something like .
I labeled the first ‚Äú median - luma ‚Äù and the second ‚Äú median - diff ‚Äù .
The ‚Äú media - luma ‚Äù method yields an average compression ratio of 1.77:1 , and the ‚Äú median - diff ‚Äù method 1.82:1 , just wee short of the context - prediction that yields 1.9:1 .
The median prediction is followed by the same steps as the context predictor ; so results compare directly the quality of prediction .
Why median - diff does a bit better than the median - luma method , I am not sure ; intuitively I would say that the bitmaps exhibit some color structure that makes some color components ( not palette entries , but separate components such as R , G , B ) more likely to be the same as they are pretty much primary - colored .
What ‚Äôs your take on this ?
*
* *
So the important point here is not that RLE is state - of - the - art ( because it certainly is not ) but that compression algorithms perform better when there are multiple stages of analysis , prediction , and encoding .
A good prediction or transform helps the following stages exploit redundancy .
In our case , we have median or context prediction that transforms the original pixel stream into a ranking stream , which , it turns out , has more repetitions than the original stream .
The repetitions are then exploited by an auto - trigger RLE encoder , whose output is further encoded by a code reminescent of Huffman codes .
And most codecs are structured like that , at the global scale ‚Äî although a lot more complex .

EUGENE --
During closing arguments in the trial of a man convicted of torturing his pregnant girlfriend , prosecutor Steve Morgan asked jurors to listen to the suspect 's words .
The Lane County deputy district attorney played two recordings Kevin Shannon Jones made of himself using a digital camera .
In the first segment , Jones says , " If my mama 's watching , I 'm sorry , " then sings as the victim , eight months pregnant , cries in pain .
In a second segment , Jones looks into the lens and says , " I done wrong .
I have hit her , beat her ... she does n't deserve to be treated like this . "
He adds : " I love her and I 'm jealous . "
The jury swiftly convicted Jones on Tuesday of almost 20 charges related to the violence delivered in a Eugene motor home .
The convictions included felony assault charges for burning the woman with a lighter ; hitting her with barbecue tongs and a crescent wrench ; cutting her with a knife ; putting hot sauce in her eyes ; pulling her tooth ; holding a machete to her throat ; and shaving her hair and eyebrows to make her unattractive to other men .
Jones , 26 , is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday .
During his closing argument , defense attorney Chris Hansen urged the jurors to acquit his client , saying the woman was injured by someone else .
Hansen cited testimony by workers at a local center for homeless people who did not remember seeing injuries on the woman and who described Jones treating the victim lovingly after she went into labor in March .
Hansen also said the victim engaged in " risky , reckless behavior , " such as methamphetamine use and sexual activity with other men .
" Is it possible that she met with another man , and took a risk that backfired in the worst way possible ? " he asked .
Morgan , however , reminded jurors that investigators found items allegedly used in the assault inside the motor home .
" Somebody else did this ? " he asked .
" No way . "

Introduction
When one thinks of lobsters , usually it's in a romantic setting : at a candlelit table with the creatures piled on top of a plate ready for consumption .
It 's a dish fit for queens , emperors , and the like and has a rich history of use .
Some cultures even considered the lobster an aphrodisaic , enhancing the power and charms of men , while for women it enhanced conception .
Lobsters appear in the art or folklore of many cultures .
For example , the Romans portrayed lobsters , along with other edible sea creatures , on mosaic floors that formed part of domestic and public decoration .
The mosaic dramas even depicted battles to - the - death between lobsters and wily octopuses .
Helmets worn by warriors immortalized the strength of the lobster .
Around 1630 , a new Turkish helmet , the Zisch√§gge , or " lobster tail " , was being used in Eastern Europe .
It had overlapping steel plates over the neck guard , providing both protection and ventilation for the neck .
The bowl ( head cover ) was fluted and had a single adjustable nasal bar , similar to the rostrum ( most frontal part ) of the lobster .
Lobsters were not only valuable food items , but had medicinal value during the Middle Ages and Renaissance .
Roasted , pulverized , and dissolved in wine , the lobster 's rostrum served as a general remedy for a variety of urinary diseases , as well as for purging kidney stones .
Lobster meat was valued as a diuretic , as was the broth made from boiling lobsters .
Their gastrolith , a calcareous " rock " found in the stomachs of lobsters preparing to shed their shell , was used for eye inflammations and as a remedy for stomach aches and epilepsy .
While ancient , Middle Age , and Rennaisance people appreciated many aspects of the lobster , they did not retain their popularity with the more modern Europeans and Americans .
Along the northeastern coast of the U.S. , the lobster was once so common in the 17th and 18th centuries that it was considered a " junk " food .
When caught in great quantities or stranded on shore after severe storms , lobsters served as garden fertilizer and as a food staple given to widows , orphans , servants , and prisoners .
It was so commonly used as a food for servants and prisoners that Massachusetts passed a law forbidding its use more than twice a week - - a daily lobster dinner was considered cruel and unusual punishment !
The American revolutionaries hurled the insult " lobsterback " at the red-coated British .
It was n't until the 19th century that lobsters regained their status as a luxury food item , mostly as a result of their popularity with royalty .

Cat owners may have suspected as much , but it seems our feline friends have found a way to manipulate us humans .
Researchers at the University of Sussex have discovered that cats use a " soliciting purr " to overpower their owners and garner attention and food .
Unlike regular purring , this sound incorporates a " cry " , with a similar frequency to a human baby 's .
The team said cats have " tapped into " a human bias - producing a sound that humans find very difficult to ignore .
Dr Karen McComb , the lead author of the study that was published in the journal Current Biology , said the research was inspired by her own cat , Pepo .
" He would wake me up in the morning with this insistent purr that was really rather annoying , " Dr McComb told BBC News .

More from Today programme " After a little bit of investigation , I discovered that there are other cat owners who are similarly bombarded early in the morning . "
While miaowing might get a cat expelled from the bedroom , Dr McComb said that this pestering purr often convinced beleaguered pet lovers to get up and fill their cat 's bowl .
To find out why , her team had to train cat owners to make recordings of their own cats ' vocal tactics - recording both their " soliciting purrs " and regular , " non-soliciting " purrs .
" When we played the recordings to human volunteers , even those people with no experience of cats found the soliciting purrs more urgent and less pleasant , " said Dr McComb .
How annoying ?
She and her team also asked the volunteers to rate the different purrs - giving them a score based on how urgent and pleasant they perceived them to be .
" We could then relate the scores back to the specific purrs , " explained Dr McComb .
" The key thing ( that made the purrs more unpleasant and difficult to ignore ) was the relative level of this embedded high - frequency sound . "
" When an animal vocalises , the vocal folds ( or cords ) held across the stream of air snap shut at a particular frequency , " explained Dr McComb .
The perceived pitch of that sound depends on the size , length and tension of the vocal folds .
Impossible to resist : Cats use sounds that humans are " highly sensitive " to " But cats are able to produce a low frequency purr by activating the muscles of their vocal folds - stimulating them to vibrate , " explained Dr McComb .
Since each of these sounds is produced by a different mechanism , cats are able to embed a high - pitched cry in an otherwise relaxing purr .
" How urgent and unpleasant the purr is seems to depend on how much energy the cat puts into producing that cry , " said Dr McComb .
Previous studies have found similarities between a domestic cat 's cry and the cry of a human baby - a sound that humans are highly sensitive to .
Dr McComb said that the cry occurs at a low level in cats ' normal purring .
" But we think that ( they ) learn to dramatically exaggerate it when it proves effective in generating a response from humans . "
She added that the trait seemed to most often develop in cats that have a one - on - one relationship with their owners .
" Obviously we do n't know what 's going on inside their minds , " said Dr McComb .
" But they learn how to do this , and then they do it quite deliberately . "
So how does Dr McComb feel about Pepo now she knows he has been manipulating her all these years ?
" He 's been the inspiration for this whole study , so I 'll forgive him - credit where credit 's due . "

Bacon , thought red meat , is the tastiest one could have for breakfast and is loaded with proteins and other nutrients .
However , its yummy texture and look has inspired many designers and manufacturers to create tasty and delicious looking products .
With that in mind here is a simple but delicious looking bacon skateboard that you could use to whiz around while people not only gawk at your skateboarding skills but also unconsciously start salivating like Pavlov ‚Äôs dog in the famous classical conditioning experiment .
These skateboards measure 7 3/4 ‚Äù , have been designed to suit all terrains , and are enabled with the perfect competition shape .
Using the best quality hard maple , the manufacturers have created a saga of skateboards that begin to pump adrenalin the moment you cast your sight on them .
There are different styles of bacon skateboards and they cost between $ 60 and $ 68 .
They are not too expensive , look quite funny , and could be great attention grabbers .
Like mentioned earlier , bacon certainly is one of those food products that continue to inspire product designers to create stuff that have an element of this delicious piece of red meat in them .
The Bacon Wallet and the Bacon iPhone Case we had featured are examples of the huge range of products available .

Happy Friday , all !
I may just designate this day Michele Bachmann Hilarity day every week , but ‚Ä¶she ‚Äôs really too much gift for only one day .

It ‚Äôs actually quite famous .
Really , it ‚Äôs one of the cornerstones of conservative thinking from that era , and is a frequent example in any Economics 101 class ( although I ‚Äôm betting Olbermann joins me in first hearing about it from Ben Stein in Ferris Bueller ‚Äôs Day Off ) .

Some 3.2 million Somalis need life - saving food aid , says the UN
Somalia is facing its worst drought for at least a decade , says the UN .
Satellite surveys of rainfall and ground research show the drought 's severity , said UN humanitarian co-ordinator for Somalia , Mark Bowden .
He said many cattle were dying from the lack of water , and that this was contributing to nearly half the population suffering from malnutrition .
Mr Bowden said humanitarian assistance to Somalia needed to start " increasing dramatically " .
He said that Somalis were not currently dying of starvation but some 3.2 million of the population needed life - saving food assistance .
" We 're now facing a drought in Somalia that is worse than people have seen for at least a decade , " Mr Bowden said .
" Roughly 45 % of the [ Somali ] population is suffering from moderate malnutrition . "
In parts of central and southern Somalia , 24 % of children under five suffer from acute malnutrition , he told a news briefing in Geneva .
Some 1.1 million people in Somalia have been driven from their homes because of conflict in recent years .
Since the weekend thousands of civilians have fled fierce fighting in the capital Mogadishu between Islamist militants and the government .
Humanity on an Island
An excerpt from Chapter 17 of ‚Äú The Little Prince ‚Äù By Antoine de Saint - Exup√©ry reads :
‚Äú Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth .
If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together , as they do for some big public assembly , they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide .
All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet . ‚Äù
I ‚Äôve had this little bit of fictional trivia in my head since I first read it .
It seems reasonable , and presents a compelling sort of image I think .
Here , I ‚Äôll analyze exactly how sensible it may or may not be .
So , let ‚Äôs start with some figures .
The World population is 6,787,432,641 ( IPC / US Census Bureau Dec 15th 2009 ) .
Cool .
Now , how much space can I expect a person to take up ?
I ‚Äôm glad I checked just now , because my first estimate was ‚Äú one square foot ‚Äù .
I ‚Äôm more or less average male stature , and the span of a doorway seems more reasonable to contain my breadth .
I could calculate a sensible depth dimension , but nah .
Just make it an even square : 29‚Ä≥x29 ‚Ä≥ = a 5.8 square foot ‚Äú footprint ‚Äù per person .
That should be ample even for larger people , and there are plenty of smaller people that should help average things out .
So , 5.83 square feet , times 6.7 Billion .
= 39,367,109,317.8 square feet , equals 1,412.10 square miles to contain humanity .
Hmmm .
Math ‚Ä¶
Ok , the square root of that works out to 37.577 , so a space 38 x 38 miles could technically handle it .
According to the internet , that ‚Äôs about the size of Rhode Island ( 1,545 sq miles ) - or Delaware to be safe ( 1,954 sq miles ) .
( Compare that to the quoted 2 Billion per 20 √ó 20 sq miles .
That would work out to 5.575 square feet per person .
That ‚Äôs pretty close to my own estimate .
Looks like the figures are pretty sensible to begin with . )
But , Antoine de Saint - Exup√©ry did n‚Äôt say ‚Äú Delaware ‚Äù , he said small Pacific Islet .
Let ‚Äôs see if I can make good on that one .
As far as small Pacific Islands go , two thousand square miles is more of a ‚Äú medium ‚Äù sized island .
I found a few that looked good on paper , but were too mountainous for the human gathering to be practical .
Finally though , behold my nomination : Isla Isabella : [ satellite photo ] .
At 1790 square miles it ‚Äôs the largest member of the Galapagos group .
I figure there ‚Äôs ample room for people on the level terrain , and the moderately steep terrain is enough to contain a good number of more agile humans if need be .
And certainly , it would be enough to fit the 2 billion at the time of the original quote .
Of course , there ‚Äôd need to be a massive hospital area for all the women giving birth - and likewise another hospital for all those about to die .
My calculations do n‚Äôt cover this contingency , but there are two or three surrounding islands on which facilities could be built .
So , that ‚Äôs that .
Humanity on an island .
Take a look at that Google Maps link , and slowly zoom out as the island becomes a smaller point .
Watch as it fades to nothing , a pale green dot .
- As the rest of the continents come into view .
Humanity on an island .
George Bush , Barack Obama , that creepy guy from the bus stop , the Red Sox , your ex-girlfriend , Palestinians and Israelis , Blacks and Whites , terrorists , strippers , and Hugh Laurie .
It could really work .
‚Äú The grown - ups , to be sure , will not believe you when you tell them that .
They imagine that they fill a great deal of space . ‚Ä¶
You should advise them , then , to make their own calculations .
They adore figures , and that will please them .
But do not waste your time on this extra task .
It is unnecessary .
You have , I know , confidence in me . ‚Äù

Google.com is today highlighting some advanced ways of using their search functionality , in what 's obviously a bid to compete the less - linear kids on the search playground like Wolfram Alpha and Microsoft 's Bing .
But what 's worth noting here is that two of the neat search gizmos Google is promoting , searches for earthquakes and population numbers , do n't return the sort of from - the - web results we expect from Google .
Instead , here Google is actually building its results from original government data sources -- the former earthquake.usgs.gov from the U.S. Geological Survey and the latter from the U.S. Census Bureau .
( Demo'd in the videos above . )
These data - driven Google results are part of a little - noticed Google Public Data project , announced in a blog post in April .
( Google.com / publicdata , a URL tagged in some search results , resolves to Google.com -- for now . )
What makes this particularly intriguing is what might happen with a Google interface on the 100,000 government data feeds that U.S. CIO Vivek Kundra has pledged to bring to Data.gov .
An extra cherry on top : the project lead on the Google Public Data project seems to be Ola Rosling , who is the son of data master Hans Rosling , with whom ( and others ) Ola co-founded the Gapminder Foundation .
Gapminder is know for putting together some rather breathtaking visualizations of government data , such as this recent one showing the epic changes that characterize the last 200 years of human development .
So , what 's next ?
Potentially , it 's Data.gov 's structured , verified , and clean data from tens of thousands of U.S. government sources + the power of Google search + the currency and impact of Gapminder visualizations .
The result : instant , trusted , and powerful displays of the true nature of the United States , available with a few clicks of a mouse to anyone with an Internet connection .
Stay tuned .
* Three New Jersey mayors arrested in corruption case
* Several rabbis , local politicians also among 44 arrested
* Case found bribery , money laundering , human kidney sales
( Adds court appearances , bail )
By Edith Honan
NEWARK , July 23 ( Reuters ) - Dozens of New Jersey politicians , officials and prominent rabbis were arrested on Thursday in a sweeping federal probe that uncovered political corruption , human organ sales and money laundering from New York to Israel , officials said .
The 10 - year investigation , dubbed ‚Äú Operation Bid Rig , ‚Äù exposed influence - peddling and bribe - taking among a network of public officials and a separate multimillion dollar money - laundering ring that funneled funds through charities operated by local rabbis , said the U.S. Attorney ‚Äôs office in Newark , New Jersey .
The cast of the 44 arrested featured Hoboken , New Jersey , Mayor Peter Cammarano , who took office three weeks ago in the industrial city visible across the Hudson River from New York .
Others accused were mayors of nearby Secaucus and Ridgefield , state Assemblymen , a deputy mayor , city council members , housing , planning and zoning officials , building inspectors and political candidates .
‚Äú New Jersey ‚Äôs corruption problem is one of the worst , if not the worst , in the nation , ‚Äù said Ed Kahrer , assistant special agent in charge of the FBI ‚Äôs white collar crime and public corruption program in New Jersey , who has worked on the investigation since it began in July 1999 .
‚Äú It has become ingrained in New Jersey ‚Äôs political culture , ‚Äù he said , calling corruption ‚Äú a cancer . ‚Äù
Central to the investigation was an informant who was charged with bank fraud in 2006 and posed undercover as a real estate developer and owner of a tile business who paid off officials to win project approval and public contracts in northern New Jersey , according to documents in the case .
The public officials stand accused of taking bribes for pledging their help getting permits and projects prioritized and approved or steering contracts to the witness .
‚Äú CULTURE OF CORRUPTION ‚Äù
In scenes that could have been lifted from the hit TV series ‚Äú The Sopranos , ‚Äù about New Jersey organized crime , they met in diners , parking lots , even bathrooms , officials said .
‚Äú The politicians willingly put themselves up for sale , ‚Äù said Acting U.S. Attorney Ralph Marra .
‚Äú The victims are the average citizens and the honest business people in this state .
They do n‚Äôt have a chance in this culture of corruption . ‚Äù
The public corruption uncovered by the informant led him to the separate money - laundering network by rabbis who operated between Brooklyn , Deal , New Jersey , and Israel , authorities said .
They laundered some $ 3 million for the undercover witness between June 2007 and July 2009 , authorities said .
‚Äú These complaints paint a disgraceful picture of religious leaders heading money laundering crews acting as crime bosses , ‚Äù Marra said .
‚Äú They used purported charities , entities supposed set up to do good works as vehicles for laundering millions of dollars in illicit funds . ‚Äù
HUMAN KIDNEY SALES
Rabbis accused of money - laundering were Saul Kassin , chief rabbi of a large Syrian Jewish synagogue in Brooklyn ; Eliahu Ben Haim , principal rabbi of a synagogue in Deal ; Edmund Nahum , principal rabbi of another synagogue in Deal ; and Mordchai Fish , a rabbi at a synagogue in Brooklyn .
The probe also uncovered Levy Izhak Rosenbaum of Brooklyn , who is accused of conspiring to broker the sale of a human kidney for a transplant .
According to the complaint , Rosenbaum said he had been brokering sale of kidneys for 10 years .
‚Äú His business was to entice vulnerable people to give up a kidney for $ 10,000 which he would turn around and sell for $ 160,000 , ‚Äù said Marra .
Several of the public officials were accused of taking bribes of just $ 10,000 , authorities said .
Cammarano , at 31 the youngest ever mayor of Hoboken , was charged with taking $ 25,000 in bribes , including $ 10,000 last Thursday .
Most of those accused were arrested in a sweep across New Jersey by more than 300 federal agents early on Thursday and were slated to appear in court in Newark throughout the day .
The first 12 of the defendants , including Cammarano , appeared shackled before U.S. Magistrate Judge Madeline Cox Arleo .
Cammarano rocked back and forth in his chair but betrayed no emotion .
They were granted bail ranging from $ 100,000 to $ 500,000 .

Way back when , I mentioned there was a surprise coming S&P ‚Äôs way .
Since it is now out there officially , I can discuss it publicly .
After the brouhaha with McGraw Hill began , I was contacted by numerous people ‚Äî mostly readers emailing words of support .
But a few West Coast lawyer types seemed to be asking lots of questions , and revealing little .
I poked around with some law firms in California , and started to pick up the rumor that California Public Employees ‚Äô Retirement System ( CALPERS ) was going to drop the bomb on S&P , Moody ‚Äôs and Fitch .
No one would say anything on the record , but it was clear that litigation was being considered as an option against the Ratings Agencies .
Here is the money quote :
The AAA ratings given by the agencies ‚Äú proved to be wildly inaccurate and unreasonably high , ‚Äù according to the suit , which also said that the methods used by the rating agencies to assess these packages of securities ‚Äú were seriously flawed in conception and incompetently applied ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù
‚Äú The ratings agencies no longer played a passive role but would help the arrangers structure their deals so that they could rate them as highly as possible , ‚Äù according to the Calpers suit .
Now , here comes the fun part : Calpers does n‚Äôt give a rat ‚Äôs ass about the money .
Sure , the financial instruments at hand ( Cheyne Finance , Stanfield Victoria Funding and Sigma Finance ) have defaulted on their payment obligations .
The losses to Calpers are ~!$ 1 billion .
But that ‚Äôs not what ‚Äôs going on here :
These Left Coasters want their pound of flesh .
They do n‚Äôt care for the Ratings Agency folks , and consider them a blight on the investment landscape .
The goal of the litigation ( as I see it ) is n‚Äôt to make the rating agencies pay a financial penalty ; rather , it is to publicly try them just as the regulatory rules are being rewritten .
I also predict that CALPERS is going to attempt to not just win , but humiliate these agencies , call them out in the most embarrassing way possible , trash the senior executives , and make things very uncomfortable in general for these firms .
They do n‚Äôt want them to merely suffer ‚Äî they want to destroy their unique position as an Oligopoly , to remove them from having a special status under the SEC rules .
In these sorts of litigations , plaintiff can be very often bought off cheaply .
In this case , that wo n‚Äôt happen .
An offer a few million dollars ‚Äî or a few 100 million ‚Äî wo n‚Äôt tempt them into taking the money and going away .
They have as much money as they need to finance this litigation to the long , drawn out , bitter end .
If I was a Rating Agency lawyer , I would be very , very nervous . . .
Some of the additional details :
‚Äì Conflicts of interest by the rating agencies are rife .
They are paid by the companies issuing the securities ‚Äî an arrangement that prevents the agencies from issuing negative ratings ; ‚Äì Structured investment vehicles generated lucrative fees for rating agencies , above and beyond normal fees .
They were paid as consultants who helped structure the deals ‚Äî not as neutral 3rd parties .
The fees ranged from $ 300,000 to $ 500,000 and up to $ 1 million for each deal ; - These fees were in addition to revenue generated by the agencies for their more traditional work of issuing credit ratings ;
- By actively creating these instruments , CALPERS owed a different duty of care as an underwriter , not merely a 3rd party firm protected by 1st Amendment Free Speech ; - By then rating them AAA , what the Ratings Agencies did amounted to Fraud .

Buchanan :
Well , first , with regard to Levi , I think First Dude up there in Alaska , Todd Palin , ought to take Levi down to the creek and hold his head underwater until the thrashing stops .
Mika made sure the audience knew that MSNBC does not advocate any violence against Levi Johnston before the segment was over .

If you wanted to push yourself to the outermost chalk line of human endurance , you might consider an ultramarathon , or a solo row across the Atlantic Ocean , or being nominated to the United States Supreme Court .
Or you could try studying the long - beaked echidna , one of the oldest , rarest , shyest , silliest - looking yet potentially most illuminating mammals on earth .
Muse Opiang was working as a field research officer when he became seized by a passion for the long - beaked echidna , or Zaglossus bartoni , which are found only in the tropical rain forests of New Guinea and a scattering of adjacent islands .
He had seen them once or twice in captivity and in photographs ¬ó plump , terrier - size creatures abristle with so many competing notes of crane , mole , pig , turtle , tribble , Babar and boot scrubber that if they did n‚Äôt exist , nobody would think to Photoshop them .
He knew that the mosaic effect was no mere sight gag : as one of just three surviving types of the group of primitive egg - laying mammals called monotremes , the long - beaked echidna is a genuine living link between reptiles and birds on one branch , and more familiar placental mammals like ourselves on the next .
Mr. Opiang also knew that , whereas members of the two other monotreme genera , the duck - billed platypus and short - beaked echidna , had been studied for years ¬ó last May , the entire genetic code of the platypus was published to great fanfare ¬ó the life of the long - beaked echidna remained obscure and unsung .

The government should not be creating new laws to enforce provisions written in the reactionary 1930s , says Michael Nugent
This Wednesday the Irish parliament will vote on a new law making blasphemy an offence punishable by a fine of ‚Ç¨ 25,000 .
If this law is passed , Atheist Ireland will respond by publishing a blasphemous statement in order to test the law and highlight its absurdity .
We believe that people need protection from harm , but ideas and beliefs should always be open to challenge .
Why is this happening ?
The Irish Constitution says that blasphemy is an offence that shall be punishable by law .
That law currently resides in the 1961 Defamation Act .
The D√°il is now repealing and updating this Act , and Justice Minister Dermot Ahern says he must pass a new blasphemy law to avoid leaving a ‚Äú void ‚Äù .
But this ‚Äú void ‚Äù is already there .
In 1999 , the Supreme Court found that the 1961 law was unenforceable because it did not define blasphemy .
So , in effect , Ireland has never had an enforceable blasphemy law under the 1937 Constitution .
But we will if this bill is passed through the D√°il and the Seanad ( the upper house ) , and the government has the working majority needed to pass it .
Here are three reasons why this law is both silly and dangerous :
Reason One :
The proposed law does not protect religious belief ; it incentivises outrage and it criminalises free speech .
Under this proposed law , if a person expresses one belief about gods , and other people think that this insults a different belief about gods , then these people can become outraged , and this outrage can make it illegal for the first person to express his or her beliefs .
The problematic behaviour here is the outrage , not the expression of different beliefs .
Instead of incentivising outrage , we should be educating people to respond in a healthier manner when somebody expresses a belief that they find insulting .
More worryingly , this law would encourage , reinforce and protect the type of orchestrated outrage that Islamic fundamentalists have directed against cartoonists and novelists .
Reason
Two :
The proposed law treats religious beliefs as more valuable than secular beliefs and scientific thinking .
Personally , I find it abusive and insulting that the Christian Bible suggests that a woman should be stoned to death for not being a virgin on her wedding night , or that it is okay to kill your slave if he dies slowly , or that effeminate people are unrighteous , or that women must not teach and must learn in silence .
If enough atheists are outraged by these passages , should the Christian Bible be banned ?
I do not believe that the Bible should be banned , and neither should discussion of the Bible in terms that cause Christians to be outraged .
Reason
Three :
We should be removing 1930s religious references from the Irish constitution , not legislating to enforce them .
Today , under the Irish constitution , you cannot become president or be appointed as a judge unless you take a religious oath asking God to direct and sustain you in your work .
This means that up to a quarter of a million Irish people could not take up these offices without swearing a lie .
These religious declarations are contrary to Ireland ‚Äôs obligations under the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
The preamble to the Irish constitution states that all authority of the state comes from , and all actions of the state must be referred to , a specific god called the Most Holy Trinity .
It also humbly acknowledges the obligations of every person in the state to a specific god called Our Lord Jesus Christ .
The constitution acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God .
This is not an assertion of the right of citizens to worship this god .
It is an assertion of the right of this god to be worshipped by citizens .
Our national parliament recognises the rights of this god by starting each day ‚Äôs business with a prayer asking this god to direct the actions of our parliamentarians .
There are also other references in the constitution to religion , as opposed to gods .
We should be amending our constitution to remove these theistic references , not creating new crimes to enforce provisions written in the 1930s .
This Saturday , 11 July , Atheist Ireland will hold our AGM between 2 pm and 5 pm in Wynn ‚Äôs Hotel in Dublin .
Members of the public are welcome to attend .
Please come along , or advise any friends living in Dublin to do so , if you want to help build an ethical and secular Ireland .

202 Star Wars T - Shirts [ Lists ]
I think that you ‚Äôd be pretty hard pressed to find a series of movies that have gained as much of a following as Star Wars , and as you ‚Äôd expect that has resulted in a huge amount of t- shirts being produced that reference the films in one way or another .
So , being HYA , I thought that I ‚Äôd better make an unnecessarily large list of them .
As always , the t- shirts are not ranked , the numbers are merely there as an illustration so that we all know which is which , so being # 1 or # 202 means nothing .
Some of these tees will be pretty recognisable as they ‚Äôve been featured on HYA before , and some were also in the 101 Robots List from last month , but if you know of any I have n‚Äôt featured then please let me know in the comments .
The list has also been split up into pages to ensure swift loading times ( my server may probably would n‚Äôt like people loading 202 pictures at a time ) .
As you would expect these lists take quite a long time ( this one took about 30 hours , seriously ) , so if you deem it worthy , it would be fantastic if you could promote this article in any way .

TEHRAN , Iran ( CNN ) --
Security forces in Iran on Thursday confronted thousands of protesting Iranians across the city , first at a cemetery and later at a prayer venue and near a government building , witnesses and news reports said .
Mourners gather around the grave of Neda Agh - Soltan in Beheshte Zahra Cemetery .
more photos ¬ª
Clashes erupted at the cemetery as two of Iran 's main opposition leaders tried to join the several thousand people at a memorial for the slain woman who became the symbol of Iran 's post- election violence , witnesses said .
The gathering was banned , but participants ignored the government strictures .
However , security forces barred opposition leaders Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi from the gravesite of Neda Agha - Soltan , the 26 - year - old woman shot in election protests on June 20 , witnesses and news reports said .
More than 3,000 people were gathered at Agha - Soltan 's grave , a witness said .
Mourners arrived on the religiously significant 40th day after the fatal shooting in Tehran .
For Iranians , a predominantly Shiite Muslim population , the 40th day after a death marks the last official day of mourning .
At the cemetery , security forces used tear gas to clear the area of demonstrators and mourners .
A witness said riot police and Basij militia were at the scene , but the confrontations with people in the crowd involved the militia .
Watch a report on the memorial clashes ¬ª
The witness spotted instances of the baton - wielding militia charging the gathering , and said as many as nine beatings were seen .
Other people appeared to have been beaten as they ran from police , the witness said .
One of the mourners had a bloody head and one woman said she was struck on the back of the neck .
One security force member sustained some sort of injury to the head and was bloodied .
It is unclear exactly how that person was injured .
A confrontation between women protesters and police also was seen .
The women shouted , " Do n't beat up our young people .
You , our Muslim brothers .
It is a shame to beat up our young people . "
The crowd chanted " Ya Hossein , Mir Hossein , " the first a reference to the revered Shiite imam and the second a reference to Moussavi .
Then there were more chants of " Allah wa Akbar , " or God is great .

Despite reports of arrests , none were seen on the mourning day .
U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said using force to " break up a group of people who were trying to exercise an important ritual in Islam , the mourning after 40 days , " was " particularly disturbing . "
" We stand by the Iranian people who are exercising their universal right to self - expression and demonstrating peacefully , " Kelly said .
Iran 's state - run news agency , IRNA , reported that the mourners " disrupted the order " in the city and damaged public and private property and that security forces were merely trying to control the " illegal activity " of the group .
IRNA also reported that Tehran residents in the area were angry with the constant protests and wanted a stronger response from the security forces .
Another witness told CNN that police directing traffic at the cemetery were helpful and friendly , in stark contrast to the riot police and Revolutionary Guard members who were at the gravesites .
From the cemetery , the mourners arrived at the Mossalla , a building under construction that is expected to be the main venue of Tehran 's Friday prayers , witnesses said .
A couple thousand people demonstrated and police worked to disperse the crowd -- which also was defying a ban on such a gathering .
" The police tried to discourage drivers from driving the main highway that would lead to central Tehran , but very few listened , " one witness said .
" Soldiers standing along the streets flashed the peace sign back at the honking cars with large smiles on their faces .
It was obvious the soldiers and police forces were with the people . "
Thousands also marched and chanted along a prominent thoroughfare called Vali Asr Street , chanting slogans such as " Death to the dictator " amid the honking of car horns , a witness said .
Amateur video posted Thursday on several Web sites and submitted to CNN's iReport showed a security officer swinging a baton at a demonstrator .
CNN cannot confirm the circumstances of the images .
Protesters gathered near the Interior Ministry building and trash cans were set ablaze , another witness said .
Police on motorcycles attempted to break up the gathering , and one security officer was seen wielding a gun .
Moussavi was the chief challenger of incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the June presidential elections , which the government said Ahmadinejad won in a landslide but many Iranians think was rigged .
Moussavi had said on his Web site that he and fellow reform candidate Karrubi would commemorate Agha - Soltan 's death with her mother at the Behesht - e - Zahra cemetery .
At the cemetery , a witness said a car identical to a vehicle belonging to Moussavi drove through the area .
It was not clear if Moussavi was in the vehicle , but people were sitting atop and around the car as if to protect it .
The car left the scene .
In the days after the June vote , thousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest the results .
The government cracked down .
Hundreds were detained in prison , among them 50 " political figures " accused of playing key roles in the street demonstrations that turned violent , Iranian media reported Wednesday .
Among those still reportedly detained is Shahpour Kazemi , Moussavi 's brother - in - law , according to Moussavi 's wife .
Others include Behzad Nabavi , a Moussavi ally , and Mostafa Tajzadeh , who served under Iranian President Mohammad Khatami -- a Moussavi supporter -- the Iranian Labor News Agency reported Tuesday .
All About Neda Agha-Soltan ‚Ä¢ Iran
At a speech today in Chicago , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates lashed out at members of Congress , at the " defense and aerospace industry , " and at the " institutional military itself " for trying to keep ultra-expensive , often - useless weapons programs in the Pentagon budget .
It 's just not right , he said , while the country is fighting two wars in which such gear is clearly not required .
" The grim reality is that with regard to the budget we have entered a zero - sum game .
Every defense dollar diverted to fund excess or unneeded capacity ... is a dollar that will be unavailable to take care of our people , to win the wars we are in , to deter potential adversaries , and to improve capabilities in areas where America is underinvested and potentially vulnerable .
That is a risk that I will not take and one that I cannot accept , " he said .
Gates took particular aim at proponents of the futuristic , $ 250 million - a - pop F - 22 stealth dogfighter .
Senior military leaders all say they have plenty of the planes , to ward off any potential foe .
Congress keeps trying to force the Pentagon to pay for more ‚Äì despite the threat of a Presidential veto of any defense bill which contains more F - 22 cash .
It 's typical , he observed , of a Beltway process that keeps defense programs going forever , regardless of their military value .
It 's exactly why Gates ' largely common sense overhaul of the Pentagon 's arsenal is , in its own way , so radical .
" If we ca n‚Äôt bring ourselves to make this tough but straightforward decision ‚Äì reflecting the judgment of two very different presidents , two different secretaries of defense , two chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff , and the current Air Force Secretary and Chief of Staff , where do we draw the line ?
And if not now , when ?
If we ca n‚Äôt get this right ‚Äì what on earth can we get right ?
It is time to draw the line on doing Defense business as usual .
The President has drawn that line .
And that red line with regard to a veto is real . "
" On a personal note , " Gates continued , " I joined CIA more than 40 years ago to help protect my country .
For just about my entire professional career in government I have generally been known as a hawk on national security .
One criticism of me when I was at CIA was that I overestimated threats to the security of the United States .
" Well , I have n‚Äôt changed .
I did not molt from a hawk into a dove on January 20 , 2009 .
I continue to believe , as I always have , that the world is , and always will be , a dangerous and hostile place for my country with many who would do America harm and who hate everything we are and stand for .
But , the nature of the threats to us has changed .
And so too should the way our military is organized and equipped to meet them . "
The full text of the speech , as prepared , after the jump .
* Thank you , Secretary Daley , for that kind introduction . *
It ‚Äôs an honor to be at the Economic Club of Chicago .
I certainly appreciate the special arrangements you made to have me here this afternoon . *
I thank all the distinguished citizens of this great city who came here today ‚Äì especially Mayor Daley and Secretary Daley .
I am mindful I am speaking in the adopted hometown of my boss .
President Obama sends his greetings , as do Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod and the rest of the Chicago crew .
They are no doubt discovering that Washington is the true ‚Äú Windy City ‚Äù ‚Äì and I am not referring to Mid-Atlantic weather patterns . *
The issue that brings me here today is central to the security of all Americans : the future of the United States military :
How it should be organized , equipped ‚Äì and funded ‚Äì in the years ahead , to win the wars we are in while being prepared for threats on or beyond the horizon .
Earlier this year , I recommended to President Obama ‚Äì and he enthusiastically agreed ‚Äì that we needed to fundamentally reshape the priorities of America ‚Äôs defense establishment and reform the way the Pentagon does business ‚Äì in particular , the weapons we buy , and how we buy them .
Above all , to prepare to wage future wars , rather than continuing the habit of rearming for previous ones . *
I am here on relatively short notice to speak publicly about these matters because the Congress is , as we speak , debating the president ‚Äôs defense budget request for the next fiscal year , a budget request that implements many needed reforms and changes .
Most of the proposals ‚Äì especially those that increase support for the troops , their families , and the war effort ‚Äì have been widely embraced .
However , some of the crucial reforms that deal with major weapons programs have met with a less than enthusiastic reaction in the Congress , among defense contractors , and within some quarters of the Pentagon itself .
And so I thought it appropriate to address some of these controversial issues here ‚Äì in a place that is , appropriately enough not only the home of our Commander - in - Chief , but also a symbol of America ‚Äôs industrial might and economic power . *
First , some context on how we got to this point .
President Obama ‚Äôs budget proposal is , I believe , the nation ‚Äôs first truly 21st century defense budget .
It explicitly recognizes that over the last two decades the nature of conflict has fundamentally changed ‚Äì and that much of America ‚Äôs defense establishment has yet to fully adapt to the security realities of the post - Cold War era and this complex and dangerous new century .*
During the 1990s , the United States celebrated the demise of the Soviet Union and the so - called ‚Äú end of history ‚Äù by making deep cuts in the funding for , and above all , the size of the U.S. military , including a 40 percent drop in the size of the Active Army .
This took place even as a post - Cold War world grew less stable , less predictable , and more turbulent .
The U.S. military , with some advances in areas such as precision weaponry , essentially became a smaller version of the force that held off the Soviets in Germany for decades and expelled Iraq from Kuwait in 1991 .
There was little appetite for , or interest in , preparing for what we call ‚Äú irregular warfare ‚Äù ‚Äì campaigns against insurgents , terrorists , militias , and other non-state groups .
This was the bipartisan reality both in the White House and in Congress . *
Of course , after September 11th , some things did change .
The base defense budget ‚Äì not counting spending for the wars ‚Äì increased by some 70 percent over the next eight years .
During this period there were important changes in the way U.S. forces were organized , based and deployed , and investments were made in new technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles .
However , when all was said and done , the way the Pentagon selected , evaluated , developed , and paid for major new weapons systems and equipment did not fundamentally change ‚Äì even after September 11th . *
Indeed , the kinds of equipment , programs , and capabilities needed to protect our troops and defeat the insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan were not the highest priority of much of the Defense Department , even after several years of war . *
I learned about this lack of bureaucratic priority for the wars we are in the hard way ‚Äì during my first few months on the job as the Iraq surge was getting underway .
The challenges I faced in getting what our troops needed in the field stood in stark contrast to the support provided conventional modernization programs ‚Äì weapons designed to fight other modern armies , navies , and air forces ‚Äì that had been in the pipeline for many years and had acquired a loyal and enthusiastic following in the Pentagon , in the Congress , and in industry .
The most pressing needs of today ‚Äôs warfighter ‚Äì on the battlefield , in the hospital , or at home ‚Äì simply lacked place and power at the table when priorities were being set and long - term budget decisions were being made . *
So the most important shift in President Obama ‚Äôs first defense budget was to increase and institutionalize funding for programs that directly support those fighting America ‚Äôs wars and their families .
Those initiatives included more helicopter support , air lift , armored vehicles , personnel protection equipment , and intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance assets for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In addition , we also increased funding for programs that provide long - term support to military families and treatment for the signature wounds of this conflict ‚Äì such as traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress .*
But , while the world of terrorists and other violent extremists ‚Äì of insurgents and IEDs ‚Äì is with us for the long haul , we also recognize that another world has emerged .
Growing numbers of countries and groups are employing the latest and increasingly accessible technologies to put the United States at risk in disruptive and unpredictable ways . *
Other large nations ‚Äì known in Pentagon lingo as ‚Äú near - peer ‚Äù competitors ‚Äì are modernizing their militaries in ways that could , over time , pose a challenge to the United States .
In some cases , their programs take the form of traditional weapons systems such as more advanced fighter jets , missiles , and submarines . *
But other nations have learned from the experience of Saddam Hussein ‚Äôs military in the first and second Iraq wars ‚Äì that it is ill - advised , if not suicidal , to fight a conventional war head - to - head against the United States : fighter - to - fighter , ship - to - ship , tank - to - tank .
They also learned from a bankrupted Soviet Union not to try to outspend us or match our overall capabilities .
Instead , they are developing asymmetric means that take advantage of new technologies ‚Äì and our vulnerabilities ‚Äì to disrupt our lines of communication and our freedom of movement , to deny us access , and to narrow our military options and strategic choices . *
At the same time , insurgents or militias are acquiring or seeking precision weapons , sophisticated communications , cyber capabilities , and even weapons of mass destruction .
The Lebanese extremist group Hezbollah currently has more rockets and high - end munitions ‚Äì many quite sophisticated and accurate ‚Äì than all but a handful of countries . *
In sum , the security challenges we now face , and will in the future , have changed , and our thinking must likewise change .
The old paradigm of looking at potential conflict as either regular or irregular war , conventional or unconventional , high end or low ‚Äì is no longer relevant .
And as a result , the Defense Department needs to think about and prepare for war in a profoundly different way than what we have been accustomed to throughout the better part of the last century .*
What is needed is a portfolio of military capabilities with maximum versatility across the widest possible spectrum of conflict .
As a result , we must change the way we think and the way we plan ‚Äì and fundamentally reform ‚Äì the way the Pentagon does business and buys weapons .
It simply will not do to base our strategy solely on continuing to design and buy ‚Äì as we have for the last 60 years ‚Äì only the most technologically advanced versions of weapons to keep up with or stay ahead of another superpower adversary ‚Äì especially one that imploded nearly a generation ago . *
To get there we must break the old habit of adding layer upon layer of cost , complexity , and delay to systems that are so expensive and so elaborate that only a small number can be built , and that are then usable only in a narrow range of low - probability scenarios .*
We must also get control of what is called ‚Äú requirements creep ‚Äù ‚Äì where more features and capabilities are added to a given piece of equipment , often to the point of absurdity .
The most flamboyant example of this phenomenon is the new presidential helicopter ‚Äì what President Obama referred to as defense procurement ‚Äú run amok . ‚Äù
Once the analysis and requirements were done , we ended up with choppers that cost nearly half a billion dollars each and enabled the president to , among other things , cook dinner while in flight under nuclear attack . *
We also had to take a hard look at a number of weapons programs that were grotesquely over budget , were having major performance problems , were reliant on unproven technology , or were becoming increasingly detached from real world scenarios ‚Äì as if September 11th and the wars that followed had never happened . *
Those of you with experience in the technology or manufacturing sectors have at some point probably faced some combination of these challenges in your own businesses .
But in the defense arena , we faced an additional , usually insurmountable obstacle to bring rationality to budget and acquisition decisions .
Major weapons programs , irrespective of their problems or performance , have a habit of continuing long after they are wanted or needed , recalling Ronald Reagan ‚Äôs old joke that a government program represents the closest thing we ‚Äôll ever see to eternal life on this earth . *
First , there is the Congress , which is understandably concerned , especially in these tough economic times , about protecting jobs in certain states and congressional districts . *
There is the defense and aerospace industry , which has an obvious financial stake in the survival and growth of these programs .*
And there is the institutional military itself ‚Äì within the Pentagon , and as expressed through an influential network of retired generals and admirals , some of whom are paid consultants to the defense industry , and some who often are quoted as experts in the news media . *
As a result , plenty of past attempts by my predecessors to end failing or unnecessary programs went by the wayside .
Nonetheless I determined , and the president agreed , that given the urgency of the wars we are in , the daunting global security environment we will inhabit for decades to come , and our country ‚Äôs economic problems , we simply cannot afford to move ahead with business as usual .*
To this end , the president ‚Äôs budget request cut , curtailed , or ended a number of conventional modernization programs ‚Äì satellites , ground vehicles , helicopters , fighters ‚Äì that were either performing poorly or in excess to real - world needs .
Conversely , future - oriented programs where the U.S. was relatively underinvested were accelerated or received more funding . *
For example , we must sustain and continually improve our specialized strategic deterrent to ensure that our ‚Äì and our allies ‚Äô ‚Äì security is always protected against nuclear - armed adversaries .
In an initiative little noticed , the President ‚Äôs program includes money to begin a new generation of ballistic missile submarines and nearly $ 700 million in additional funds to secure and assure America ‚Äôs nuclear deterrent .*
Some of our proposed reforms are meeting real resistance .
They are called risky .
Or not meeting a certain military requirement .
Or lacking in study and analysis .
Those three words ‚Äì requirements , risk , and , analysis ‚Äì are commonly invoked in defense matters .
If applied correctly , they help us make sound decisions .
I ‚Äôve found , however , that more often they have become the holy trinity of business as usual .*
In truth , preparing for conflict in the 21st century means investing in truly new concepts and new technologies .
It means taking into account all the assets and capabilities we can bring to the fight .
It means measuring those capabilities against the real threats posed by real world adversaries with real limitations , not threats conjured up from enemies with unlimited time , resources , and technological acumen . *
Air superiority and missile defense ‚Äì two areas where the budget has attracted the most criticism ‚Äì provide case studies .
Let me start with the controversy over the F - 22 fighter jet .
We had to consider , when preparing for a future potential conventional state - on - state conflict , what is the right mix of the most advanced fighter aircraft and other weapons to deal with the known and projected threats to U.S. air supremacy ?
For example , we now have unmanned aerial vehicles that can simultaneously perform intelligence , reconnaissance , and surveillance missions as well as deliver precision - guided bombs and missiles .
The president ‚Äôs budget request would buy 48 of the most advanced UAVs ‚Äì aircraft that have a greater range than some of our manned fighters , in addition to the ability to loiter for hours over a target . *
We also took into consideration the capabilities of the newest manned combat aircraft program , the stealth F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter .
The F - 35 is 10 to 15 years newer than the F - 22 , carries a much larger suite of weapons , and is superior in a number of areas ‚Äì most importantly , air - to - ground missions such as destroying sophisticated enemy air defenses .
It is a versatile aircraft , less than half the total cost of the F - 22 , and can be produced in quantity with all the advantages produced by economies of scale ‚Äì some 500 will be bought over the next five years , more than 2,400 over the life of the program .
It has had development problems to be sure , as has every advanced military aircraft ever fielded .
But if properly supported , the F - 35 will be the backbone of America ‚Äôs tactical aviation fleet for decades to come if ‚Äì and it is a big if ‚Äì money is not drained away to spend on other aircraft that our military leadership considers of lower priority or excess to our needs . *
Having said that , the F - 22 is clearly a capability we do need ‚Äì a niche , silver - bullet solution for one or two potential scenarios ‚Äì specifically the defeat of a highly advanced enemy fighter fleet .
The F - 22 , to be blunt , does not make much sense anyplace else in the spectrum of conflict .
Nonetheless , supporters of the F - 22 lately have promoted its use for an ever expanding list of potential missions .
These range from protecting the homeland from seaborne cruise missiles to , as one retired general recommended on TV , using F - 22s to go after Somali pirates who in many cases are teenagers with AK - 47s ‚Äì a job we know is better done by three Navy SEALs .
These are examples of how far - fetched some of the arguments have become for a program that has cost $ 65 billion ‚Äì and counting ‚Äì to produce 187 aircraft , not to mention the thousands of uniformed Air Force positions that were sacrificed to help pay for it .*
In light of all these factors , and with the support of the Air Force leadership , I concluded that 187 ‚Äì the program of record since 2005 , plus four more added in the FY 09 supplemental ‚Äì was a sufficient number of F - 22s and recommended as such to the president .*
The reaction from parts of the Washington establishment has been predictable for many of the reasons I described before .
The most substantive criticism is that completing the F - 22 program means we are risking the future of U.S. air supremacy .
To assess this risk , it is worth looking at real - world potential threats and assessing the capabilities that other countries have now or in the pipeline .*
Consider that by 2020 , the United States is projected to have nearly 2,500 manned combat aircraft of all kinds .
Of those , nearly 1,100 will be the most advanced fifth generation F - 35s and F - 22s .
China , by contrast , is projected to have no fifth generation aircraft by 2020 .
And by 2025 , the gap only widens .
The U.S. will have approximately 1,700 of the most advanced fifth generation fighters versus a handful of comparable aircraft for the Chinese .
Nonetheless , some have portrayed this scenario as a dire threat to America 's national security .*
Correspondingly , the recent tests of a possible nuclear device and ballistic missiles by North Korea brought scrutiny to the changes in this budget that relate to missile defense .
The risk to national security has again been invoked , mainly because the total missile defense budget was reduced from last year . *
In fact , where the threat is real or growing ‚Äì from rogue states or from short - to - medium range missiles that can hit our deployed troops ‚Äì this budget sustains or increases funding .
Most of the cuts in this area come from two programs that are designed to shoot down enemy missiles immediately after launch .
This was a great idea , but the aspiration was overwhelmed by the escalating costs , operational problems , and technological challenges . *
Consider the example of one of those programs ‚Äì the Airborne Laser .
This was supposed to put high - powered lasers on a fleet of 747s .
After more than a decade of research and development , we have yet to achieve a laser with enough power to knock down a missile in boost phase more than 50 miles from the launch pad ‚Äì thus requiring these huge planes to loiter deep in enemy air space to have a feasible chance at a direct hit .
The 10 to 20 aircraft needed would cost about $ 1.5 billion apiece plus tens of millions of dollars each in annual operating costs .
The program and operating concept were fatally flawed and it was time to face reality .
So we curtailed the existing program while keeping the prototype aircraft for research and development .*
Many of these decisions ‚Äì like the one I just described ‚Äì were more clear - cut than others .
But all of them , insofar as they involved hundreds of billions of dollars and the security of the American people , were treated with the utmost seriousness by the senior civilian and military leadership of the Pentagon .
An enormous amount of thought , study , assessment , and analysis underpins these budget recommendations ‚Äì including the National Defense Strategy issued last summer .*
Some have called for yet more analysis before making any of the decisions in this budget .
But when dealing with programs that were clearly out of control , performing poorly , and excess to the military ‚Äôs real requirements , we did not need more study , more debate , or more delay ‚Äì in effect , paralysis through analysis .
What was needed were three things ‚Äì common sense , political will , and tough decisions .
Qualities too often in short supply in Washington , D.C. *
All of these decisions involved considering trade - offs , balancing risks , and setting priorities ‚Äì separating nice - to - haves from have - to - haves , requirements from appetites .
We cannot expect to eliminate risk and danger by simply spending more ‚Äì especially if we ‚Äôre spending on the wrong things .
But more to the point , we all ‚Äì the military , the Congress , and industry ‚Äì have to face some iron fiscal realities .
Here , some recent history is important . *
Consider that the last defense budget submitted by President George W. Bush for Fiscal Year 2009 was $ 515 billion .
In that budget the Bush administration proposed ‚Äì at my recommendation ‚Äì a Fiscal Year 2010 defense budget of $ 524 billion .
The budget just submitted by President Obama for FY 2010 was $ 534 billion .
Even after factoring inflation , and some of the war costs that were moved from supplemental appropriations , this defense request represents a modest but real increase over the last Bush budget .
I know .
I submitted both of them .
In total , by one estimate , our budget adds up to about what the entire rest of the world combined ‚Äì friend and foe alike ‚Äì spends on defense .
Only in the parallel universe that is Washington , D.C. , would that be considered ‚Äú gutting ‚Äù defense . *
The fact is that if the defense budget had been even higher , my recommendations to the president with respect to troubled programs would have been the same ‚Äì for all the reasons I described earlier .
There is a more fundamental point :
If the Department of Defense ca n‚Äôt figure out a way to defend the United States on a budget of more than half a trillion dollars a year , then our problems are much bigger than anything that can be cured by a few more ships and planes . *
What is important is to have a budget baseline with a steady , sustainable , and predictable rate of growth that avoids extreme peaks and valleys that are enormously harmful to sound budgeting and planning .
From the very first defense budget I submitted for President Bush in January 2007 , I have warned against doing what America has done multiple times over the last 90 years by slashing defense spending after a major conflict .
The war in Iraq is winding down , and one day so too will the conflict in Afghanistan ‚Äì whether in this administration , the next , or the next .
When that day comes , the nation will again face pressure to cut back on defense spending , as we always have .
It is simply the nature of the beast .
And the higher our base budget is now , the harder it will be to sustain these necessary programs , and the more drastic and dangerous the drop - off will be later . *
So where do we go from here ?
Authorization for more F - 22s is in both versions of the defense bill working its way through the Congress .
The president has indicated that he has real red lines in this budget , including the F - 22 .
Some might ask :
Why threaten a veto and risk a confrontation over a couple billion dollars for a dozen or so planes ? *
The grim reality is that with regard to the budget we have entered a zero - sum game .
Every defense dollar diverted to fund excess or unneeded capacity ‚Äì whether for more F - 22s or anything else ‚Äì is a dollar that will be unavailable to take care of our people , to win the wars we are in , to deter potential adversaries , and to improve capabilities in areas where America is underinvested and potentially vulnerable .
That is a risk that I will not take and one that I cannot accept .*
And , with regard to something like the F - 22 , irrespective of whether the number of aircraft at issue is 12 planes or 200 , if we ca n‚Äôt bring ourselves to make this tough but straightforward decision ‚Äì reflecting the judgment of two very different presidents , two different secretaries of defense , two chairmen of the joint chiefs of staff , and the current Air Force Secretary and Chief of Staff , where do we draw the line ?
And if not now , when ?
If we ca n‚Äôt get this right ‚Äì what on earth can we get right ?
It is time to draw the line on doing Defense business as usual .
The President has drawn that line .
And that red line with regard to a veto is real .*
On a personal note , I joined CIA more than 40 years ago to help protect my country .
For just about my entire professional career in government I have generally been known as a hawk on national security .
One criticism of me when I was at CIA was that I overestimated threats to the security of the United States . *
Well , I have n‚Äôt changed .
I did not molt from a hawk into a dove on January 20 , 2009 .
I continue to believe , as I always have , that the world is , and always will be , a dangerous and hostile place for my country with many who would do America harm and who hate everything we are and stand for .
But , the nature of the threats to us has changed .
And so too should the way our military is organized and equipped to meet them . *
I believe ‚Äì along with the senior military leadership of this nation ‚Äì that the defense budget we proposed to President Obama and that he sent to Congress is the best we could design to protect the United States now and in the future .
The best we could do to protect our men and women in uniform , to give them the tools they need to deter our enemies , and to win our wars today and tomorrow .
We stand by this reform budget , and we are prepared to fight for it .*
A final thought .
I arrived in Washington 43 years ago this summer .
Of all people , I am well aware of the realities of Washington and know that things do not change overnight .
After all , the influence of politics and parochial interests in defense matters is as old as the Republic itself .
Henry Knox , the first secretary of war , was charged with building the first American fleet .
To get the support of Congress , Knox eventually ended up with six frigates being built in six different shipyards in six different states .*
But the stakes today are very high ‚Äì with the nation at war , and a security landscape steadily growing more dangerous and unpredictable .
I am deeply concerned about the long - term challenges facing our defense establishment ‚Äì and just as concerned that the political state of play does not reflect the reality that major reforms are needed , or that tough choices are necessary .*
Dell became the first major electronics manufacturer this morning to ban the export of electronic waste to developing countries .
It ‚Äôs a practice that often leads to supposedly recycled e- waste being smashed , burned , and taken apart by hand ‚Äìexposing workers to toxins in the process .
The company also expanded its definition of e-waste to include all non-working parts and devices regardless of composition .
As a result of its new stance , Dell ‚Äôs e-waste policy exceeds the requirements of the Basel Convention , which bans e-waste exports based on material or chemical composition .
That ‚Äôs a big deal for e-waste recycling advocates .
According to Barbara Kyle , the National Coordinator of the Electronic Takeback Coalition , ‚Äú Dell ‚Äôs policy on e-waste export is now the strongest in the industry ‚Äù .
But the company can still improve .
Dell has no timeline for removing toxic materials like polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) and brominated flame retardant ( BFR ) from its products ‚Äìsubstances recognized by Greenpeace as a threat to both human health and the environment .
The company ‚Äôs new policy should , however , raise its ranking in the next Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics .

On June 6 nearly 300 zombies will stagger through the Short North in the third annual Zombie Walk Columbus .
Founded by Columbus resident Kurt Chaney , the walk aims to raise half a ton of nonperishable food items for the Mid-Ohio Foodbank .
Alex :
Why did you create Zombie Walk Columbus ?
Kurt :
In early 2007 I discovered zombiewalk.com , which helps people organize and spread the word about these types of events .
I worked for a local haunted house and was a huge fan of horror themes but had never heard of a zombie walk .
I did some research and learned that many zombie walks benefit various charities .
We did n‚Äôt have such an event in Columbus and I wanted to give it a try .
Alex :
What makes the Columbus zombie walk unique from all other zombie walks ?
Kurt :
We ‚Äôre truly a sight to behold .
Members of S.T.A.R.S. Columbus ( inspired by the Resident Evil video game ) end our zombie threat by ‚Äú shooting ‚Äù us down and containing the infection , so to speak .
They come out dressed in black carrying their replica weapons and end our shenanigans when we return to Goodale Park .
To innocent bystanders it looks like the undead are made dead .
As far as I know , we ‚Äôre the only zombie walk that ends in this kind of showdown .
Alex :
What ‚Äôs the biggest misconception about zombie walks ?
Kurt :
That you have to pre-register , sign up , or somehow join our group before the walk .
No one has to jump through any hoops .
If you show up at the park on June 6 at five o‚Äôclock in some form of zombie attire , you ‚Äôre in the walk .
It ‚Äôs that simple .
Alex :
What tips do you have for first time zombie walkers ?
Kurt : Theatrical blood will , I repeat , WILL stain your clothes .
Alex :
What do you hope to see out of future Columbus zombie walks ?
Kurt : I ‚Äôd like to have more local organizations promote themselves at our event ‚Äî in zombie form , of course .
Alex :
What are your thoughts on Michael Jackson ‚Äôs Thriller video ?
Kurt : I love it !
One of my most vivid childhood memories is watching Thriller from underneath the loosely woven safety of an afghan blanket and hearing my mom say ‚Äú It ‚Äôs only makeup , honey . ‚Äù
As jaded as I am when it comes to scary movies , that one still gives me the creeps .
The walk will begin and end in Goodale Park .
Zombies and non-zombies are encouraged to donate nonperishable food items at the park ‚Äôs southeast entrance on June 6 .

If the Book of Revelation is n‚Äôt a blueprint that tells us what is coming in the End Times , what the heck is it ?
Like any book in the Bible , Revelation was written from the perspective of faith for the purpose of giving faith .
It was written in the early days of the Jesus movement to a persecuted minority that was fearing worse persecution .
As the Jesus movement started in Jerusalem and Jesus was crucified , and there was this experience of resurrection , at the same time , there was a simultaneous political movement within Judaism of rebellion against the Roman Empire .
It peaked in the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs .
It culminated finally ‚Äî horrifically -- in the Roman legions marching into the country , destroying Jerusalem and burning down the temple .
These two factors ‚Äì the young Jesus movement and the brutally crushed rebellion ‚Äìintersect in the writings we now call Revelation
But Revelation does n‚Äôt talk about Jerusalem being destroyed .
It talks about a beast with many heads and a dragon and the four horsemen . . .
That poetic language which sounds so strange to us was actually familiar to ancient readers .
The author was writing a dramatic script in a form of popular media .
Today we all recognize different modes or " genres " of writing ‚Äî the detective novel , the love sonnet , manga . .
Each has its own familiar structure and images .
The same was true in the past .
The book of Revelation belongs to a then popular genre of literature called apocalyptic .
The term apocalypse means " unveiling . "
There were lots of apocalypses , each a graphic poetic vision of some radically transformed future in which the good guys win .
This genre began around 200 BC and went out of style around 150 AD .
The book of Revelation is also called the Apocalypse of John , and it is one of several explicitly Christian apocalypses that still exist today .
In each , metaphoric language was used to communicate something that , experientially , felt too big for words .
It was a way of trying to speak the unspeakable ‚Äî and to inspire endurance and hope .
So what was the author of Revelation unveiling ?
Revelation was written about twenty years after the fall of Jerusalem .
The author , who we know only as John , had lived during the horrors that accompanied fall of the city .
Imagine : the Roman Empire is surrounding Jerusalem .
At the same time , civil war is raging within the walls .
People are literally starving to death .
As the siege continues , the Romans capture 20,000 Jews and crucify them on the walls of the city ‚Äî while the city still is under siege .
20,000 !
We think of the crucifixion being unique .
No .
Crucifixions happened all the time .
There were thousands and thousands of crucifixions .
The Jews wanted freedom .
To them it was a blasphemy to have the Romans in their land .
Many of them rebelled , and they lost .
Eventually , the city fell , and the people were slaughtered .
Many remaining were expelled from the land .
This is part of the Diaspora ‚Äî the scattering of the Jews , who became dispersed around the Mediterranean ‚Äî Asia Minor , Greece , Northern Africa and Europe .
But the author , John , is a Christian .
Remember , the earliest members of the Jesus movement were Jews , and so early Christians scattered with the rest of the Jewish people .
Over time , thanks to this scattering and missionary activity , Christianity began to be adopted more widely by gentiles and at that point it began to grow rapidly throughout the Mediterranean .
John is writing to Pauline ( gentile ) churches , but they are very rooted in Judaism and the Hebrew scriptures .
At the time Revelation is written , about twenty years after the devastating events of The Great Revolt , the young scattered Christian movement is being persecuted .
They are treated like Blacks in the South during the ‚Äò 30s and ‚Äò 40s .
A Christian carpenter might not be able to get work .
Some are lynched .
John , himself , is writing from exile , so whatever he was preaching was viewed by the Roman Empire as a threat to law and order .
Why was the message so threatening ?
Clearly , part of his message was " Stop participating in the imperial cult .
Stop participating in the patriotic way of life of the Roman Empire which requires paying homage to the gods of the Empire and in particular the emperor as an incarnation of God . "
The Early Christian movement was an alternative to the way of empire .
You know , Jesus is called " Lord and Savior " .
If you ask where did that language came from , that language came from Caesar .
Caesar was " Lord and Savior . "
Christians celebrate the birthday of Jesus on December 25 , which was when Roman celebrated the birthday of the Unconquered Sun .
The pagans believed that if they did n‚Äôt take care of the gods , the gods would n‚Äôt take care of them .
By forbidding the cult of the gods , the Christians threatened this balance .
One thing confuses me .
Is John writing about events in his past or events in his future ?
First of all , he is writing from a lived experience of what Empire can do .
That is the key to understanding his perspective .
He is writing a book that combines familiar political images .
The dragons , for example , are much like our political cartoons .
When you see an eagle and a bear you know it means the United States and the Soviet Union .
For him , he is using images largely out of Hebrew scripture to convey what the Roman Empire is , and what he believes will happen to the early Christian movement .
John ‚Äôs primary message comes in Chapter 18 : Empire will fall .
Rome can not last .
This power structure that seems so big and is so crushing of the people will crumble , and God will re-create out of the ruins a new Jerusalem .
John continually counsels the movement to hold fast :
Those who endure to the end will be saved .
This is a book of hope :
The empire is going to fall .
God is going to make a way where there is no way .
But had he ‚Äî lost it ?
With all of the bizarre images , I ‚Äôve heard Revelation called " John on Acid . "
No .
Almost all the imagery in the book of Revelation is rooted in the Hebrew scriptures , and some comes from Greek myths .
In Chapter 12 , you have the woman clothed in the sun and Satan falls out of the sky and there is this dragon that chases the woman .
Well , that is the birth of Apollo .
Domitian , who is the emperor at that time , he likens himself to Apollo .
He is the sun god .
So John is taking this known story and writing a counter - myth .
He is saying that Domitian is not so important as he thinks .
The birth of the child , Jesus , that ‚Äôs the real big story .
The images of Jesus himself are rooted in Hebrew stories .
They simply cannot be understood unless you know that they are coming from the book of Daniel and Ezekiel and Zachariah .
The narrative , the story line is rooted in the Exodus story in which God liberates the Jews from Pharaoh ‚Äôs empire ‚Äì walks them through the Red Sea and the wilderness and sends them to a promised land .
Revelation is a recapitulation , a re-telling of the same story .
God is the god who frees us from empire , whether Pharaoh or Dominion .
We will come out of this into a land flowing with milk and honey .
One of the big exhortations of the book is : " Come out of her . " ‚Äî Come out of Roman Empire ( as the Jews came out of Egypt ) .
What you are saying helps me to understand why people who are immersed in this theology are so fearful of empire ‚Äì the League of Nations , the Soviet Union , the United Nations ‚Äî any form of internationalism .
Among the " Left Behind " crowd , people who are bridge builders or peacemakers are seen as evil and to be mistrusted .
That is what John was talking about , that was his experience , even if people take it out of context .
From the very beginnings , part of the Christian message was the notion of an end time .
God is going to clean up the world ‚Äì which is a messy awful a place with a lot of violence and evil .
After all , the central hero of the Christian story is tortured and crucified -- put to death by an empire !
How is God going to clean up the world ?
Jesus is going to come back and rule the world and shepherd the nations .
The Hebrew understanding of history is that it is going somewhere .
It is linear , not cyclical , which is a break with the agriculture - based earth religions .
Christianity , which is a child of Judaism , picks up the Hebrew storyline : History is linear .
But ‚Äìand this is really important -- in the Bible the end is never the end of the physical world .
It is the end of an age .
It ‚Äôs the end , for example , of the Roman empire , and then what happens is not that everyone is whisked off to heaven but that on earth there is a renewal , a renewal of the earth itself , of culture , of the nations , peace and justice , everyone has their own vineyard and fig tree .
So , where did the notion of everyone being lifted out of their clothes and cars and cockpits come from ?
That comes from the 19th Century .
An Anglo - Irish theologian called John Darby created a new interpretive lens for the Bible .
It ‚Äôs called Dispensationalism , because in this system , history is divided into seven " dispensations " or ages within an age .
In this system , the Rapture leads to the Millennium when Jesus reigns on Earth for 1000 years but before the Millennium is the reign of the antichrist .
At different historical junctures different bad buys are picked as the antichrist .
In the 1970 ‚Äôs , thanks to Hal Lindsey ‚Äôs book , The Late Great Planet Earth , it was all about Russia .
And the ten nations , the European Union would become part of the Beast .
Today dire warnings about Barack Obama being the antichrist are scattered about the internet .
Or Osama Bin Ladin .
Believe me ‚Äî I ‚Äôve seen plenty of both ‚Äî even Chavez and Bono .
But come back , for a moment , to the Rapture itself .
What about that verse in Thessalonians ( 1 Thess . 4:16 ) .
There ‚Äôs the Lord descending with a trumpet , and the dead in Christ rising and then " we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air . "
That is wonderful graphical mythical language which , when written , had very little to do with the plot of Left Behind .
Thessalonians is Paul talking with an early church in southern Europe , and he faces a specific challenge : Christians have died .
We had expected Jesus to come back before that happened .
Now what do we do ?
Paul thought he was living at the end of an age .
He thought he would see the day that God would come back , clean up the earth and restore Paradise .
But it has n‚Äôt happened within the timeframe he expected , so he offers an explanation that integrates the existing facts ‚Äî instead of Christ returning before any Christians have died , the dead and the living are united with Jesus together .
Flash forward a little bit .
When you study very early church history , if you study the art of the early church you do n‚Äôt see a lot of images of the crucifix or scenes of the crucifixion ; you see images of paradise .
And there was a proclamation of the early church that had an optimistic view ‚Äì that where we were headed -- on earth as in heaven , was a paradise .
This was the expectation of many in the early Jesus movement .
There was a historical process , and over time this expectation changed for some .
This process , which I do n‚Äôt have time to go into , was wrapped around when Constantine became emperor and absorbed Christianity as the state religion .
Rather than being a minority faith it became the dominant faith ..
Once it became the dominant faith Christianity radically changed because it became about politics and power and control of the nations .
You have this book that is all about how evil empires can be because he has this horrifying experience and now all of a sudden Christianity is in power ; empire is on the side of Christianity .
That ‚Äôs a little awkward .
Yes .
And , the book of Revelation was dormant for many many years because of this .
In our time the book of Revelation has come back with a vengeance because the imagery is made to order for wild interpretation .
You ‚Äôve got an entire generation of children being raised in these fundamentalist end - times churches , being told they are the last generation .
You obviously think this is a bad thing .
Well , thankfully these families do n‚Äôt live as if what they say is true is really true .
They are still stashing away money to send their kids to college and for their own retirement .
If they really believed you would see a hardening of the faith .
There is a far right segment of Christian in which you do see this hardening ‚Äî churches focused on " spiritual warfare " building walls rather than bridges , organizing services to celebrate gun rights , praying public prayers for the death of abortion providers or Barack Obama or judges .
This kind of far right hardening comes out of the misuse of apocalyptic literature .
Christianity gets translated into a quest for purity and righteousness that will bring these prophesies to fruition .
You said earlier that there were lots of apocalypses .
It was a popular medium .
How did this particular book get into the Bible ?
Well , there was controversy about that .
Many Christians did n‚Äôt want it in the Bible , and even Martin Luther questioned the decision of the Catholic councils to include it .
Revelation got into the Bible because the church fathers chose to believe that the same John who knew Jesus in person was the author of this and several other texts .
Their primary criterion was " apostolic authority . "
What we now know ‚Äì this is just the evolution of our own knowledge ‚Äî is that the authors who wrote the Gospel of John , the 1st , 2nd and 3rd Letters of John , and the Apocalypse of John , were not the same person .
The script is very different .
The same phrases are not used .
One is written by a highly educated Greek author , the other written by a person whose primary language is Semitic .
These books that the counsels thought were written by John , the companion of Jesus , they were written by two or three people ?
The people who actually knew Jesus , the twelve , none of them left writings for us .
All of these writings are written well after the death of Jesus .
The Church was looking for authority , and so they tried to choose writings that fit a hierarchical form of Christianity and that traced their lineage through the apostles back to Jesus .
The Bible is the book for the church and it was compiled by the Church for the purpose of helping the Church advance faith .
The books did n‚Äôt become finalized as scripture till 300 years after Jesus lived and died .
I was taught as a child that the Bible was essentially dictated by God to the authors .
I was never taught about which books were chosen and how .
But I would assume that Catholics believe God gave perfect insight to the councils that made the decisions ?
I would assume so .
And that is a wonderful mask for authority .
When religion becomes a pursuit of power ‚Äî a system to keep people in control , you are always going to have those games that are being played .
Against religion , you have the message of Jesus , which is a spiritual message ‚Äì a message of freedom .
Part of what this comes down to is :
What is the Bible ?
When you are dealing with an end times fundamentalist Christian , you are dealing with a person who believes that the Bible was written by God‚Äì God writes it and there is a secret code and if you are in the know you will know the code and the elect will know the code .
The Bible itself becomes a magical book , a secret script .
If you just know how to read the script , you ‚Äôll know where the world is going .
And so people begin to live this script as if they live in the end times .
We ‚Äôre so into that secret knowledge thing , are n‚Äôt we ?
You see it many places : Gnosticism , the Knights Templar , Freemasonry , the Mormon temple , childhood clubs , Skull and Bones . . . .
Yes , and I think you see it in all religions .
I think that part of the religious impulse easily gets perverted into a quest for secret knowledge because it makes me more than you .
I am special , I am elect , I am closer to God , I know the truth .
The reality is that we are all schmucks trying to muddle through as best we can .
Mr and Mrs Keen say the home had ' been very special ' to them Married Labour MPs Ann and Alan Keen have come under fire for claiming thousands of pounds on a second home near Parliament , while their designated main home is only 10 miles away .
Now a group of people has taken direct action by squatting in the main home they say has been left unoccupied .
The BBC's Lisa Hampele paid them a visit .
The remnants of last night 's barbecue with the neighbours are in the front garden - some cold sausages and decorations on the pot plant .
The squatters have a legal notice on the front door which says they have rights .
They can stay .
The six men and four women moved into the west London property over the weekend and now they are adamant they will not budge .
" We 've paid for their home with our taxes - so we 're going to use it , " Bob says as he opens the front door to let me in .
" You can see the Keens are n't using it . "
' Reclaiming your taxes '
The house is in Mrs Keen 's Brentford and Isleworth constituency .
There are missing floors , pipes poking through half - built walls and sacks of cement dotted about .
The couple have not lived here for many months , some say almost a year , but Mrs Keen describes it as her main home .
The Keens claimed almost ¬£ 140,000 over four years in expenses for their second home close to Parliament .
A bed sheet is hanging out of the window of their main home .
In big , black writing the banner says : " Reclaiming Your Taxes . "
We find it extremely upsetting to know that our house is occupied by squatters who appear to believe that they are entitled to do what they wish in our property
Ann and Alan Keen Another reads : " 500,000 homeless - One million empty homes . "
Serg , Joe , Andy and Bob were at the house when I visited .
They are all local and moved in after an angry resident told them the house was empty .
" It 's wrong for taxpayers to be paying for MPs to have two homes , when there are so many people who need somewhere to live , " Serg says , making sure I do not fall down the hole by the stairs as we edge past into the half - finished kitchen area .
Pieces of plasterboard rest against the door .
Joe 's back now - he had just popped into a neighbour 's house to use the internet and download details of Ann Keen 's expenses .
He is not impressed .
Another neighbour knocks on the door with some milk .
" Good on you , " he shouts .
It is all very friendly .
' Urgent action '
Bob tells me constituents have complained that letters posted here do not get to the MP .
A man in a smart white hat and an accent to match stops his bike .
He stood against Ann Keen as the Green candidate back in the 1990s .
He is another one who is all for the squatters .
They sit on the front wall and have a chat , agreeing that taxpayers should not be footing the bill like this .
A council source told the BBC that the property , which is 10 miles from Westminster , had remained empty for seven months .
And in a letter obtained by the BBC , the local council has told the Labour couple that " urgent action " is required from them to explain why their main home is unoccupied .
The Keens say they have lived in the house for 22 years and insist it is being renovated .
In a statement on Monday they said : " It is our home and has been very special to us for a long time .
We find it extremely upsetting to know that our house is occupied by squatters who appear to believe that they are entitled to do what they wish in our property . "

While the penalty shoot out victory over Uruguay which took the Socceroos to the 2006 World Cup will live forever as one of the great Australian sporting moments , this was an altogether much lower - key affair concluded on foreign soil in front of a small but vocal band of Australian supporters in a corner behind the goal they attacked in the second half .
But nonetheless it is a huge achievement , one that will further boost the development of the sport in this country and give a fillip to the upcoming A - League campaign , in which a handful of current Socceroos - including first - teamer Jason Culina - will be playing .
The Socceroos now head home to take on Bahrain in Sydney next Wednesday and Japan , in what should be a celebratory party for both teams , at the MCG on June 17 .
Pim Verbeek 's team gets on a charter flight to Sydney with an imposing record in this final qualifying phase having won four and drawn two of their six matches , scoring eight goals and conceding none .
Australia , which fielded the strongest side it could for this game , showed initiative right from the start , winning a first minute free kick which was flighted into the danger zone by Scott Chipperfied , forcing goalkeeper Burhan had to come out to claim .
The Socceroos retained posession comfortably in the opening exchanges before a lapse , when the ball was turned over in midfield , offered Qatar 's most dangerous striker Sebastian Soria the chance to shoot .
But the Uruguayan born naturalised Qatari drove his eighth minute effort wide .
Five minutes later Australia 's giant frontman , Josh Kennedy , offered his first aerial threat when he got on the end of a Harry Kewell cross but his header was off target .
Australia looked comfortable but still needed to be wary of the powerful Soria , and Lucas Neill had to nip in smartly to snuff out his threat from a cross .
Soria then shot wide after a lofted ball from Ali put him in a threatening position .
The Socceroos shuffled their attack after 20 minutes with Kewell and Bresciano switching flanks , from left to right , and it presaged Australia 's best period of the game so far .
The hosts were not going to be intimidated by the Australians and put in a number of clumsy challenges ; Singaporean referee Abdul Malik 's patience ran out midway through the first half when he booked Hamed Shami for a foul on Bresciano .
From the resultant Bresciano free kick Australia went agonisingly close to taking a spectacular lead when Tim Cahill fastened on to Kennedy 's headed flick on .
The Everton midfielder chested the ball up and then drove an overhead kick against the post with Qasem beaten , but Qatar was able to scrambed the rebound to safety .
A driving Kewell run past Hamed Shami on the half hour took the Galatasaray man down Qatar 's left flank and into the penalty area but the Qataris were able to clear before any Australian boot could connect .
Cahill made a similar run down the left a minute later before Kewell , giving the Qatar defence a torrid time , repeated his earlier run .
This time goalkeeper Qasem was able to scoop his low cross to safety with his foot and Carl Valeri 's shot from outside the penalty area was deflected over for a corner .
Having lived dangerously and survived Qatar was emboldened to try its luck at the other end , Soria connecting with a cross from Ali which rebounded to the head of Bilal Mohammed , whose effort was deflected over .
From the corner Australian keeper Mark Schwarzer had to push away a shot from Ahmed Faris .
Australia looked the most threatening team , but Qatar was dangerous on the break , almost all of its forward thrusts being aimed at Soria .
Kennedy was causing Qatar plenty of concern as the first half ended , again making himself a threatening target as a free kick was floated into the Qatar danger zone in the shadows of half time .
The hosts had an opportunity to get the second half off to a positive start in the 50th minute when Kewell upended Ahmed Faris close to the Australian penalty area , but Ali 's free kick drifted harmlessly over Schwarzer 's bar .
Australia then went close at the other end when Chris Coyne almost turned in a Cahill header as the game began to open up with the Qataris simply having to push forward to grab the three points that would keep them alive in this World Cup section .
Cahill again almost made the breakthrough in the 56th minute when his fierce drive looked goalbound only for Qasem to produce a full length diving save to deny a man who has long been Australia 's goalscoring talisman .
Qasem then had to dive and stretch to push Kennedy 's shot wide for a corner as Australia went in search of the goal that could have killed this game off .
The Qatari keeper was once more the hero for his country when he got across well to push to safety a Kewell drive after the winger , set up by Vince Grella 's cross field ball , jinked past his marker and into the area before letting fly with a right foot shot .
With 17 minutes to go Verbeek made his first tactical switch , bringing off the hard working Grella and shifting Jason Culina , who started at right back , into his customary midfield role and introducing Jade North to play in Culina 's vacated position .
The busy Kewell could have broken the deadlock with eleven minutes to go when he dispossed an opponent in the penalty area but his shot was wide of Qasem 's left hand post .
Lucas Neill was shown a late yellow card after an altercation with Soria , but that could not mar Australia 's joy .
Qasem , not surprisingly was named as man of the match .
As Zelaya accepts amnesty for coup leaders
Human Rights report reveals brutal repression in Honduras
By Rafael Azul
20 July 2009
In negotiations held over the weekend , deposed Honduran President Manuel Zelaya agreed to a proposal by Costa Rican President √ìscar Arias that , as a price for his returning to office , he accept a government of ‚Äú unity and national reconciliation ‚Äù that would essentially make him a powerless puppet of the very forces that overthrew him and sent him into exile .
Representatives of the coup regime in Tegucigalpa , however , rejected the proposal Sunday , insisting that they would not allow Zelaya to return .
July 5 Honduran security forces closed down the Toncontin Airport in Tegucigalpa to prevent Zelaya from returning after his expulsion from the country ‚Äì Photos : James Rodr√≠guez / www.mimundo.org
The mediation by Arias is designed to legitimize the coup and consolidate its main aims .
Before talks broke down , Zelaya reportedly agreed to abandon his call for a referendum on a constitutional convention , the main pretext for his ouster .
In accepting Arias ‚Äôs terms , Zelaya was also reported to have agreed to a total amnesty for the military and political figures who carried out the June 28 coup and to the repressive forces that assaulted , arrested , beat and in some cases murdered workers and peasants protesting Zelaya ‚Äôs removal .
While the Obama administration formally condemned the coup , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton commissioned the mediation effort by Costa Rican President √ìscar Arias ‚Äî one observer compared it to the police demanding that a rape victim sit down and compromise with her rapist ‚Äî to achieve precisely these aims .
Hand in hand with this process , figures close to the administration and to Clinton have conducted a media and lobbying campaign to whitewash the June 28 coup as a ‚Äú defense of democracy . ‚Äù
Lanny Davis , who served as counsel to President Bill Clinton and is one of Hillary Clinton ‚Äôs closest political supporters , emerged as a lobbyist for right - wing Honduran businessmen .
Appearing before Congress , he declared that ‚Äú democracy and civil liberties are flourishing in Honduras . ‚Äù
A preliminary report issued by the Committee of the Families of the Disappeared and Detained in Honduras ( COFADEH ) , the country ‚Äôs leading human rights group , exposes the criminality of the Obama administration ‚Äôs policy and of the Democratic apologists for the coup like Davis .
Issued in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa July 15 , the report , entitled Violations of Human Rights in the context of the Honduran coup d‚Äôetat , provides a devastating exposure of the actions carried out by the coup ‚Äôs organizers against the Honduran people .

The 45 - page preliminary report carefully details the treatment meted out to those who opposed the coup .
So far , COFADEH has documented 1055 human rights violations in the first two weeks since Zelaya ‚Äôs overthrow .
These include 1046 illegal detentions , 59 beatings , 16 threats , 27 assaults on reporters and attacks on the independent press , six serious injuries , and four executions .
In each case , the victims of the attacks have been workers , peasant farmers and the press .
In what amounts to naked state terror reminiscent of the 1972 - 1981 dictatorship , workers and peasants have been detained and kidnapped by military and security personnel .
‚Äú Of particular concern , ‚Äù says the preliminary report , ‚Äú is the repression in the Department of Col√≥n , ‚Äù which is on the Caribbean coast in northeast Honduras .
Among the human rights violations described in the COFADEH document is the herding of peasant families into a soccer field , ‚Äú in the style of Nazi concentration camps . ‚Äù
The operation was carried out by military and security police .
The town of Guadalupe Carney , in the vicinity of the city of Trujillo , also in Col√≥n , was occupied on July 13 by police and army personnel , who terrorized the 600 peasant households , threatening to execute the town ‚Äôs mayor and impose military rule .
Municipal authorities across Honduras have been threatened with execution , the expropriation of their property and exile .
Among the cases discussed in detail in the report is that of Isy Obed Murillo , who was killed by the armed forces at a protest in the Tegucigalpa airport on July 5 .
The case of Obed Murillo , 19 , exemplifies the courage and determination of the Honduran working class , as well as the immense dangers it confronts .
The young man was killed by the Honduran army when soldiers fired on a mass protest that demanded that an airplane carrying Zelaya back from exile be allowed to land at Toncont√≠n Airport in Tegucigalpa .
Obed Murillo had come to Tegucigalpa five years earlier from Santa Cruz de Guayape in the Department of Olancho , a town of 4000 inhabitants in eastern Honduras .
This journey is typical of the many thousands who have migrated to the cities and make up the country ‚Äôs young proletariat .
In Tegucigalpa he had held various jobs ; at the time of his death he worked at a supermarket .

On the day of the airport demonstration , when the troops attacked the protest with tear gas , Obed Murillo became separated from his father , sister and two brothers .
He was killed after the troops fired several volleys into the crowd .
At the youth ‚Äôs funeral , Obed Murillo ‚Äôs father , David Murillo , described his son as a person who was ‚Äú self - educated in the principles of social rights , he knew that the powerful have exploited us and have trampled on our labor rights .
‚Äú He never compromised his principles , ‚Äù said the father .
‚Äú His death , his leaving us , hurts me deeply , but I am proud that he did not die while committing a crime or out of drunkenness , but because he fought against repression . ‚Äù
Just days after the shooting death of his son , COFADEH took David Murillo ‚Äôs testimony .
The 57 - year old man , who had done nothing wrong , was immediately arrested outside the COFADEH office .
Obed Murillo was one of three killed on that day by troops using live ammunition .
Many hundreds of peasants and workers were victimized by the Honduran Army and police in the airport protest .
The COFADEH report charges that the Honduran coup was the result of a conspiracy by the ruling elite to do away with the constitution drafted in 1982 at the end of a nine - year military dictatorship .
The dispute over Zelaya ‚Äôs attempt to hold a non-binding plebiscite on June 28 on possible changes to the constitution merely provided the pretext .
Under this constitution , the military ‚Äú continued to hold power behind the scenes throughout the decade of the 1980s , counting on a guarantee of absolute immunity ‚Äù for the dictatorship ‚Äôs generals , who had been trained in the US military ‚Äôs School of the Americas and also in Chile , under the Pinochet regime , COFADEH reports .
During this period , the military strengthened its ties with industrial and financial enterprises and ‚Äú kept control over key government institutions . ‚Äù
According to the report , ‚Äú That part of the armed forces that had been carefully held in check made their appearance on June 23 - 26 in the manner of the 1980s . ‚Äù
This included the reconstitution of death squads .
‚Äú We think it is important to point to the militarization of public entities , ‚Äù the report continues .
‚Äú This includes the reactivation and placing in public posts of members of the [ Battalion ] 3 - 16 death squads , responsible for the forced disappearances that took place during the decade of the 1980s .
The result is violations of the sacred principles enshrined in the Declaration of Universal Human Rights . ‚Äù
The COFADEH report documents the harassment and repression of reporters , both Honduran and foreign .
Reporters have been victims of extra-legal home invasions , detentions , expulsions from Honduras and executions .
Independent media outlets have been closed by the regime .
In each of these cases , due process as provided for in the 1982 constitution , was swept aside .
The assassination of Gabriel Fino Noriega , a reporter employed by several radio and cable TV stations , including Radio Estelar , Radio el Patio , and Radio Am√©rica was the work of a death squad , the report states .
Noriega was shot seven times by two men as he left Radio Stelar in the city of San Juan Pueblo , in the eastern Department of Atl√°ntida .
Fino Noriega and the radio stations that employed him had been producing news reports about massacres that had been taking place along the Caribbean coast , even before the military coup .
He has also reported on recent mass protests against the dictatorship .
The report also disputes the attempt of the coup ‚Äôs organizers to invoke the 1982 Constitution to justify their action .
The constitution , approved at the conclusion of a long and brutal US - backed dictatorship , acknowledged the principle of participatory democracy through initiatives and referendums , COFADEH said .
In practice , however , amendments to the constitution , including those that made it possible for the government to permit foreign corporations to operate with little or no regulations in special industrial zones , were carried out by the ruling elite with no popular consultation .
Two presidential decrees , issued in 2003 and 2004 , severely limited the scope of popular initiatives and referendums , turning this right into a dead letter .
In recent years , COFADEH has itself been repeatedly victimized by the Honduran government for its work to expose the detention and kidnapping of union activists and human rights defenders .
In a radio podcast created before the coup , COFADEH warned that the 3 - 16 death squad , which operated in Honduras in the early 1980s , was being reconstituted .
It has also insisted that those arrested on charges of participating in criminal gangs be given due process .
In July 2008 , the organization ‚Äôs offices were ransacked and video equipment stolen .
A few days later , COFADEH Coordinator Bertha Oliva de Nativ√≠ and her daughter were followed home by unknown individuals in an attempt to instill fear and interfere with the work of the organization .
The danger has escalated ; in the words of Bertha Oliva , ‚Äú Each morning I kiss my daughter when I go to work , not knowing whether it will be the last time I see her . ‚Äù
Even before the coup , death threats against COFADEH and other human rights activists had been on the rise .
On June 19 , following the killing of several prisoners by their fellow inmates , Bertha Oliva and several other activists received death threats .
Shortly afterwards , President Zelaya gloated over the murders declaring them ‚Äú a moral lesson for those who want to commit crimes such as rape of minors . ‚Äù
This declaration was followed by a wave of violent murders in the country .
Zelaya was elected on a right - wing law and order platform , from which he has not broken .
That he took some tactical steps to the ‚Äú left , ‚Äù including organizing the plebiscite , granting a minimum wage increase and other populist measures , does not change the bourgeois character of his regime .
This is confirmed by Zelaya ‚Äôs decision to accept Arias ‚Äôs compromise proposals , and make his peace with the Honduran military .
Die deutschen Verleger haben einen √ºberraschenden Durchbruch im Kampf ums √úberleben erzielt .
Ihre Forderung , im Internet besser behandelt zu werden , ist offenbar auf europ√§ischer Ebene erf√ºllt worden .
In einem ‚Äû internationalen Abkommen ‚Äú wurde festgelegt , ‚Äû geistiges Eigentum ‚Äú k√ºnftig besser zu sch√ºtzen .
Das berichtet bereits seit vorvergangenem Donnerstag das gro√üe deutsche Online - Portal Bild.de :
Das ist‚Ä¶ √∂hm , wie sag ich‚Äôs ?
Unsinn .
Es hat eine fast beruhigende Konsequenz , dass die Deppen von Bild .de es nicht einmal bei einer Pressemitteilung ihres eigenen Verlages und einem Thema , das der Axel Springer AG augenblicklich am Herzen liegt wie kein zweites , schaffen , korrekt zu berichten .
Sie haben das Unterschreiben einer Forderung mit einem ‚Äû Abkommen ‚Äú verwechselt und die √úbergabe dieser Forderung mit ihrer Erf√ºllung ‚Äî Gott , das ist aber auch schwer auseinander zu halten .
Helmut Heinen , der Pr√§sident des Zeitungsverlegerverbandes BDZV , und sein Hauptgesch√§ftsf√ºhrer Dietmar Wolff werden also wohl noch eine Weile Zeit haben , ihre Leistungen im Synchronsprechen zu perfektionieren .
( Heinen : ‚Äû Wir werden es nicht l√§nger hinnehmen , dass aufw√§ndig produzierte Qualit√§tsinhalte der Verlage von Dritten kommerziell genutzt werden , ohne dass daf√ºr auch nur ein Cent an die Verlage zur√ºckflie√üt . ‚Äú
Wolff : ‚Äû Wir k√∂nnen nicht l√§nger hinnehmen , dass unsere teuer produzierten Qualit√§tsinhalte von Dritten be¬≠denkenlos kommerziell genutzt werden , ohne dass daf√ºr auch nur ein Cent an die Verlage gezahlt wird . ‚Äú )
Es ist davon auszugehen , dass die Verleger mit ‚Äû Qualit√§tsinhalten ‚Äú auch das meinen , was die Produktion bei Bild .de t√§glich so ausst√∂√üt .
Weniger klar ist , wer eigentlich die Leute sind , die ihnen diese Inhalte so ‚Äû kommerziell ‚Äú oder gar ‚Äû bedenkenlos kommerziell ‚Äú wegnehmen .
Die Firma Google , die sich ‚Äî wohl nicht zu unrecht ‚Äî angesprochen gef√ºhlt hat , hat schon lapidar darauf hingewiesen , dass kein Autor oder Verleger es hinnehmen muss , dass seine Inhalte mithilfe von Suchmaschinen f√ºr die √ñffentlichkeit auffindbar gemacht werden .
Ein einfacher Befehl verwehrt Google den Zugriff und damit die kommerzielle Vermarktung dieser Suchergebnisse durch Google ( reduziert allerdings auch die Zahl der Leser dramatisch ) .
Die blo√üe M√∂glichkeit der Verweigerung ist nat√ºrlich angesichts der marktbeherrschenden Stellung des Unternehmens und seiner beunruhigenden Intransparenz keine befriedigende Antwort .
Aber sie zeigt , dass die Behauptung eines unzul√§ssigen , ungewollten Zugriffs auf Verlagsinhalte abwegig ist .
Die Verlage st√∂ren sich nicht am Zugriff , im Gegenteil , sie sind abh√§ngig davon .
Sie sind nur nicht mehr zufrieden damit , dass sie von Google nur Leser bekommen .
Sie wollen auch Geld .

Die ‚Äû Hamburger Erkl√§rung ‚Äú ( Foto : internationale Version ) , auf die sich die eingangs erw√§hnte Falschmeldung von Bild.de bezieht , ist am 8 .
Juni 2009 von den sechs Hamburger Verlagen Bauer ( ‚Äû Coup√© ‚Äú ) , Springer ( ‚Äû Bild ‚Äú ) , Ganske ( ‚Äû F√ºr Sie ‚Äú ) , Gruner + Jahr ( ‚Äû Stern ‚Äú ) , ‚Äû Spiegel ‚Äú und ‚Äû Zeit ‚Äú unterschrieben worden .
Seitdem gibt es eine Art Wettlauf , m√∂glichst viele weitere Unterzeichner zu versammeln .
In der Erkl√§rung hei√üt es :
Zahlreiche Anbieter verwenden die Arbeit von Autoren , Verlagen und Sendern , ohne daf√ºr zu bezahlen .
Ich habe bis heute nicht verstanden , wer sich hinter diesen ‚Äû zahlreichen Anbietern ‚Äú verbirgt .
Aber die vielen Unterzeichner k√∂nnen mir das ja bestimmt erkl√§ren .
Und bei der Gelegenheit gleich mit , wen sie meinen , wenn sie schreiben :
‚Äû Wir widersprechen all jenen , die behaupten , dass Informationsfreiheit erst hergestellt sei , wenn alles kostenlos zu haben ist . ‚Äú
Also mal bei ein paar Unternehmen nachgefragt :
Beim ‚Äû Spiegel ‚Äú sind leider gerade alle Leute , die mir meine Fragen offiziell beantworten k√∂nnten , im Urlaub .
Bei der Nachrichtenagentur dpa betont man , die Erkl√§rung nicht unterzeichnet zu haben , sondern sie nur zu ‚Äû unterst√ºtzen ‚Äú , weshalb man man auch nicht f√ºr jede Formulierung einstehen k√∂nne .
Auch konkrete Beispiele f√ºr die ‚Äû zahlreichen Anbieter ‚Äú , die die Arbeit anderer im Internet verwenden , m√∂chte Sprecher Justus Demmer nicht nennen .
‚Äû Aber dass es das gibt , ist unstrittig . ‚Äú
Ist es ?
Die Sprecherin des ‚Äû Zeit ‚Äú - Verlages ist erst im Urlaub .
Ihre Vertretung empfiehlt , falls die Zeit dr√§ngt , sich mit den Fragen ‚Äû an einen der Hauptinitiatoren der ‚Äö Hamburger Erkl√§rung ‚Äò , beispielsweise Axel Springer AG , zu wenden ‚Äú .
Als die Sprecherin selbst wieder zur√ºck ist , bittet sie , sich mit den Fragen ‚Äû direkt an die Verb√§nde ‚Äú zu wenden , die Auskunft geben , ‚Äû also EPC bzw . WAN - IFRA oder VDZ ‚Äú .
Der Verlag Axel Springer bedankt sich bei mir f√ºr das ‚Äû Interesse an Axel Springer ‚Äú , m√∂chte aber die Fragen nicht beantworten : Man solle sich mit ihnen ‚Äû direkt an die Verb√§nde : VDZ / BDZV f√ºr Deutschland oder EPC / WAN - IFRA auf internationaler Ebene ‚Äú wenden .
Die Verlagsgruppe Handelsblatt m√∂chte zwar ebenfalls keine Beispiele f√ºr die angeblich ‚Äû zahlreichen Anbieter ‚Äú nennen .
Sprecher Georg Wallraf erkl√§rt aber :
Wie beispielsweise dpa mit einer speziellen Software Attributor durchforsten auch wir ‚Äî derzeit noch anhand von Suchworten ‚Äî systematisch das Internet , um die Nutzung unserer Artikel zu verfolgen .
Dabei stellen wir einerseits h√§ufig Verst√∂√üe gegen das Urheberrecht fest , die heute schon aufgrund der Rechtslage verfolgt werden k√∂nnen .
Dar√ºber hinaus gibt es aber auch eine Vielzahl von Adaptionen unserer Inhalte , die wir nicht mit urheberrechtlichen Mitteln bek√§mpfen k√∂nnen .
Es handelt sich dabei z.B. um solche Seiten , die z.B. durch eine Inhaltsbeschreibung unserer Artikel und unter Ausnutzung unseres Logos unsere Stellung als Verlagshaus nutzen , um die Informationen auf ihren Seiten aufzuwerten und dem Leser entsprechende Orientierung zu vermitteln .
Konkrete Beispielsf√§lle will ich hierzu nicht nennen , weil sie nicht Thema einer gr√∂√üeren √∂ffentlichen Auseinanderseztung sein sollen .
Auf die Frage , wer denn behaupte , dass ‚Äû alles kostenlos zu haben ‚Äú sein muss , verweist er ‚Äû auf eine auch im Rahmen des Urheberrechtes gef√ºhrten Diskussion , die eine noch deutlichere Entsprechung auf europ√§ischer Ebene hat ‚Äú und nennt als einziges Beispiel den Heise - Artikel √ºber den Vortrag des M√ºnsteraner Urheberrechts - Experten Thomas Hoeren mit der √úberschrift : ‚Äû Informationsfreiheit hat Priorit√§t vor dem Urheberrecht ‚Äú .
Der Artikel ist siebeneinhalb Jahre alt .
Er stammt vom 29 .
Januar 2002 .
Ich bezweifle auch , dass man der Position von Professor Hoeren gerecht wird , wenn man ihm die Forderung unterstellt , alles m√ºsse kostenlos sein .
Gegen√ºber der ‚Äû Welt ‚Äú hat er erst vor wenigen Tagen unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen f√ºr ein Leistungsschutzrecht f√ºr Buch - Verleger pl√§diert ‚Äî genau das , was die Presseverlage auch fordern .
Der Burda - Verlag tut sich schwer , meine Fragen spontan zu beantworten , bietet aber nach eineinhalb Tagen Bedenkzeit folgende Zitate :
In der Erkl√§rung hei√üt es : ‚Äû Zahlreiche Anbieter verwenden die Arbeit von Autoren , Verlagen und Sendern , ohne daf√ºr zu bezahlen . ‚Äú
K√∂nnen Sie mir Beispiele f√ºr solche Anbieter nennen ?
Zum Beispiel die zahlreichen Angebote , die Online - Inhalte aggregieren ‚Äî allen voran selbstverst√§ndlich Google .
In der Erkl√§rung hei√üt es : ‚Äû Wir widersprechen all jenen , die behaupten , dass Informationsfreiheit erst hergestellt sei , wenn alles kostenlos zu haben ist . ‚Äú
K√∂nnen Sie mir sagen , wer solche Forderungen vertritt ?
Die Debatte um die kostenlose und freie Nutzung aller Online - Inhalte ‚Äî auch jener , die derzeit bereits ausreichenden Schutz genie√üen ‚Äî zieht ja mittlerweile weite Kreise bis hin zu politischen Initiativen ( weitreichende Forderungen in diesem Sinne z.B. http://www.piratenpartei.de/navigation/politik/unsere-ziele.)
Gut , das mit der Piratenpartei habe ich kommen sehen .
Dazu lie√üe sich jetzt inhaltlich einiges sagen , was die wirklich fordert .
Aber man darf vermutlich nicht vergessen , dass die ‚Äû Hamburger Erkl√§rung ‚Äú am Tag nach der Europawahl verabschiedet wurde , bei der die Piraten erdrutschartige 0,9 Prozent der Stimmen erzielten .
Gruner + Jahr hat mir eigentlich eine Antwort versprochen ( am Montagnachmittag habe ich zum ersten Mal angefragt ) , das scheint aber noch zu dauern .
Nachtrag , 23 .
Juli : Anstelle einer Antwort schreibt mir Gruner + Jahr : Zu Frage 1 :
Damit sind alle Anbieter gemeint , die ohne ausdr√ºckliche Zustimmung von Verlagen Inhalte redaktioneller Websites kopieren und auf ihren eigenen Seiten ver√∂ffentlichen .
Nicht gemeint ist die Verlinkung auf redaktionelle Websites .
Zu Frage 2 :
Dies spricht vor allem diejenigen an , die einen universellen Zugang , den auch wir bef√ºrworten und praktizieren , mit zwingend kostenlosem Zugang verwechseln .
Und der Zeitschriftenverlegerverband VDZ hat sich bislang nicht zur√ºckgemeldet , aber ich wei√ü nicht : Irgendwie habe ich das Gef√ºhl , es lohnt sich nicht , darauf zu warten .
Die Presseverleger haben sich offenkundig zum Ziel gesetzt , mit der ‚Äû Hamburger Erkl√§rung ‚Äú den Erfolg des ‚Äû Heidelberger Appells ‚Äú nachzuahmen ‚Äî einem Pamphlet , das Dinge vermischt , die nichts miteinander zu tun haben , und als Diskussionsgrundlage v√∂llig untauglich ist , aber inzwischen von Hans und Franck unterschrieben wurde .
Unter der Hand lassen manche keinen Zweifel daran , was f√ºr ein grauenhaftes Dokument diese ‚Äû Hamburger Erkl√§rung ‚Äú ist , die offenbar aus dem Bereich des Axel - Springer - Au√üenministers Christoph Keese stammt ( und deren englische √úbersetzung , die der EU - Kommission √ºbergeben wurde , bizarrerweise nicht einmal mit dem Original √ºbereinstimmt ) .
Es ist ein Dokument der Hilflosigkeit , ein ziellos - hysterisches ‚Äû So tu doch einer was ‚Äú , bei dem es auf Inhalte nicht ankommt , solange nur m√∂glichst viele mitschreien .
Kein Wunder , dass die einzelnen Verlage nicht wissen , was sie genau da unterschrieben haben , oder keine Lust haben , sich dazu √∂ffentlich zu √§u√üern .
Es eint sie das Gef√ºhl , dass irgendwer jetzt aber echt mal irgendwas tun muss ‚Äî und es hilft sogar , die Forderungen nicht zu konkret zu formulieren , sonst f√§llt noch jemandem auf , wie radikal sie sind .
Burda deutet es wenigstens an : Es geht nicht nur um Google , sondern um Aggregatoren allgemein .
In Wahrheit st√∂rt die Verleger zum Beispiel schon ein Angebot wie Turi2 , das die Nachrichten des Tages ( mehr oder weniger gut ) zusammenfasst .
Mit etwas
Pech reicht den Lesern schon der eine Satz , der bei Turi steht , und sie schenken dem Medium , das ihn ( wom√∂glich aufw√§ndig ) recherchiert hat , nicht einmal mehr einen Klick , der sich in einen ( mickrigen ) Werbeerl√∂s umwandeln l√§sst .
Das ist ein Problem , aber um es mit Google zu sagen : ‚Äû Einige Vorschl√§ge der Nachrichten - Verleger haben die besten Absichten , aber w√ºrden die Art , wie das Netz funktioniert , grundlegend ver√§ndern ‚Äî zum Schlechten . ‚Äú
Ja , da gibt viel zu diskutieren und zu bedenken , und manche Mechanismen des Web , die es erleichtern , Zugang zu Nachrichten und hochwertigen Inhalten zu bekommen , erschweren gleichzeitig die Produktion dieser Nachrichten und hochwertigen Inhalte .
Und die Antwort der Verlage auf diese Herausforderung ist es , eine ‚Äû Hamburger Erkl√§rung ‚Äú zu unterschreiben , deren wirre Behauptungen man auf Nachfrage nicht einmal belegen kann oder mag ?
Wirklich ?

The picture , above , was no accident .
The back - seater in this Russian SU - 35UB prototype supersonic jet got paid to eject ‚Äì part of a series of stunts for an upcoming movie .
In another episode , the movie - makers " had to film the jet without a canopy , so rather to film it on the ground [ sic ] they decided to hire a high - class pilot to make a real flight without that glass thing , " according to English Russia .
‚Äú The maximum speed I achieved on the jet plane without a canopy glass was around two times greater than speed of sound .
While on this speed I even managed to pull out my fingers in glove for an inch or two outside - it became heated very fast because of immense friction force plane undergoes with the air , " the pilot claims .
As a friend tells aerospace blogger Stephen Trimble : " Why use dummies when you can use real Russian pilots ?
Those guys are amazing . "
BTW , if you 'd like a former Soviet bloc fighter jet of your own , a dealer in Illinois has a proposition for you .

Women - why are n't you running the world yet ?
Frankly I 'm disappointed in you .
Men are still far too dominant for their own good , and consequently we 've made a testosterone - sodden pig 's ear of just about everything : politics , the economy , religion , the environment ... you name it , it 's in a gigantic man - wrought mess .
The world 's been one big dick - swinging contest , and we 've caught our collective glans in a nearby desk fan .
By rights we should be squealing for your help , but we 're not , because we 're too damn stupid and too damn proud .
We swagger convincingly , and that 's about it .
And swaggering 's fine for scraping by in primitive times , but the world we 've built is altogether more complex now .
We 've got stock exchanges and nuclear warheads .
It 's too easy to swagger your way into big trouble without even realising .
Well , we 've had our turn .
It 's time for the Rise of the Ladies .
We do n't need a few women in conspicuous positions of power scattered here and there - we need a 10 - year prohibition on all forms of male power .
Seriously : a decade in which men do n't get to control anything , from the remote control upwards .
Imagine the consequences .
For one thing , there would be an instant and massive reduction in armed conflict around the globe .
Sure , nations would routinely bitch about each other in secret ( and with a new , hair - curling viciousness ) , but there 'd be fewer intercontinental punch - ups and a far smaller bodycount .
The economy should clearly be run by women .
City boys are dicks , plain and simple .
Look at them .
Listen to them .
Consider the carnage of the past 10 years .
What the hell were these idiots thinking ?
Even now they 're still at it .
In any sane world they 'd all be herded into a shed and blasted with hoses until they promised to stop .
Everything they say , think , do , watch , read and fill up their iPods with is awful .
Even their girlfriends are awful .
Straight women , reading this : if your partner is a city boy , leave him .
Leave him now .
Dump him with a text message , right this very second .
It 'll hurt for about six days , then your life will improve beyond measure .
Sod that little number - swapping dick who dares call himself a man .
Lob him in the shed with the other squeaking fakes and train the cold jets on the bastards .
Shut the door and let them shiver .
Men love machines , because machines remind them of themselves .
As a result , men quickly became very very good at building machines and then driving them round rather too quickly , shouting " Toot toot !
Look at me in my brilliant car ! "
This was cute for a while , but the novelty 's worn off now that the planet 's teetering on the brink of becoming an inhospitable cinder .
Please , women , for all our sakes : just lock us in a room with some Lego or something .
I 'm sorry , but we 're just too bloody stupid to save the planet .
Looks like you 'll have to clean up our mess once again .
Mankind 's depending on you .
" This is all very well , but none too realistic , " thinks the female reader .
" Men are n't just going to hand over the reins that easily .
I know what men are like .
They 're self - righteous and stubborn - just like women , but worse . "
Oh , you .
Pretty , silly you .
We 've got you brainwashed .
See , that 's what our incessant , ruinous swaggering was all about : pretending to be more complex and dangerous than we actually are .
In truth your suspicions are correct : we 're very , very simple .
We 're lazy and we like blowjobs .
That 's all there is to us .
Literally : that 's it .
From Sir John Betjeman to Barack Obama , from Copernicus to Liam Gallagher .
The core software we run on could fit in the memory of a digital watch circa 1985 without even scraping the sides .
And you know this , you women .
You know this of course , but it 's so dazzlingly obvious you actually doubt it 's true .
Most of my friends are women .
I often find myself counselling them as they agonise for hours , trying to fathom what men are thinking , what men want .
Yet no matter who they 're talking about , or what the circumstance , from my perspective the answer always seems so glaringly basic it could be scratched on the back of a button .
This one wants a shag .
That one wants a biscuit .
Every time : the butler did it .
The only mistake women make is crediting men with far more mystery than they 're capable of .
We 're impulsive yet thuddingly predictable , and you 'd better learn to love us for it because that 's just about all we can muster .
That 's why we bollocksed the planet up .
We did n't mean to .
We 're men , that 's all .
And now , surely now , it 's time for you to shunt us off the podium and take charge for a decade .
If only as an experiment to see what happens .
I for one welcome our titted overlords .
Give us our toys and our daily bread and permit us to lie on the sofa for 10 whole years , like snoozy , spluttering pigs .
We get to loll around contentedly , you get to save the world .
Sound good ?
Do we have a deal ?
Well do we , you wonderful bitches ?
‚Ä¢ This week Charlie got halfway through McMafia by Misha Glenny : " A sobering look at globalised organised crime with an unfortunately gaudy cover that makes it look like a feature from Loaded circa 1998 , which it absolutely is n't . "
Earth is experiencing its " sixth great extinction event " with disease and human activity taking a devastating toll on vulnerable species , according to a major review by conservationists .
Much of the southern hemisphere is suffering particularly badly , and Australia , New Zealand and neighbouring Pacific islands may become the extinction hot spots of the world , the report warns .
Ecosystems in Polynesia , Micronesia and Melanesia need urgent and effective conservation policies , or the region 's already poor record on extinctions will worsen significantly .
Researchers trawled 24,000 published reports to compile information on the native flora and fauna of Australasia and the Pacific islands , which have six of the most biodiverse regions on the planet .
Their report identifies six causes driving species to extinction , almost all linked in some way to human activity .
" Our region has the notorious distinction of having possibly the worst extinction record on Earth , " said Richard Kingsford , an environmental scientist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney and lead author of the report .
" We have an amazing natural environment , but so much of it is being destroyed before our eyes .
Species are being threatened by habitat loss and degradation , invasive species , climate change , over - exploitation , pollution and wildlife disease . "
The review , published in the journal Conservation Biology , highlights destruction and degradation of ecosystems as the main threat .
In Australia , agriculture has altered or destroyed half of all woodland and forests .
Around 70 % of the remaining forest has been damaged by logging .
Loss of habitats is behind 80 % of threatened species , the report claims .
Invasive animals and plants have devastated native species on many Pacific islands .
The Guam Micronesian kingfisher is thought to be extinct in the wild following the introduction of the brown tree snake .
The impact of invasive species is often compounded by pollution and burgeoning human populations on the islands , which have outstripped their capacity to deal with waste .
Plastics and fishing gear are an ongoing danger .
The impact of humans on wildlife is likely to increase in Australasia and the Pacific islands .
By 2050 , the population of Australia is expected to have risen by 35 % , and New Zealand by 25 % , while Papua New Guinea faces a 76 % increase and New Caledonia 49 % .
More than 2,500 invasive plant species have colonised Australia and New Zealand , competing for sunlight and nutrients .
Many have been introduced by governments , horticulturists and hunters .
In addition , the report says , average temperatures in Australia have increased , in line with climate change predictions , forcing some species towards Antarctica and others to higher , cooler ground .
The report highlights several studies that point to serious threats from diseases such as avian malaria and the chytrid fungus , linked to declines in frog populations .
An infectious facial cancer is spreading rapidly among Tasmanian devils and populations of the world 's largest marsupial predator are believed to have fallen by more than 60 % as a result .
Plants have also fared badly : a root fungus deliberately introduced into Australia has destroyed several species .
The report sets out a raft of recommendations to slow the decline by introducing laws to limit land clearing , logging and mining ; restricting deliberate introduction of invasive species ; reducing carbon emissions and pollution ; and limiting fisheries .
It raises particular concerns about bottom trawling , and the use of cyanide and dynamite , and calls for early - warning systems to pick up diseases in the wild .
" The burden on the environment is going to get worse unless we are a lot smarter about reducing our footprint , " said Kingsford .
" Unless we get this right , future generations will surely be paying more in quality of life and the environment .

The pundits are wrong .
Conventional wisdom is wrong .
Sarah Palin 's decision to step down as Alaska governor was a brilliant move .
Palin has some of the best political instincts I have ever seen .
She became a pop-culture superstar overnight when John McCain made her his veep pick , and she 's still second only to President Obama among politicians the public is interested in .
Even in liberal San Francisco , she'd be front - page news if she ever came to town .
But that kind of celebrity comes at a high price .
What a lot of people do n't know is that Palin entered Alaska politics as a reformer attacking the corruption of the state 's Republican establishment .
As such , she was the darling of the Democrats - until she hooked up with McCain .
After the election , with Palin back home but positioning herself for a 2012 presidential run , it was clear she would catch nothing but ridicule from Alaska 's Democrats .
It was not going to be pretty .
If Palin wants to play on the national field , she has to be free to move around .
She has to be able to drop into Indiana , Ohio or Tennessee and help Republican candidates raise money .
She has to be available for radio and TV .
She has to be like Gavin Newsom , free to roam around the country , safe in the knowledge that things will pretty much take care of themselves back home .
Instead , Palin faced the prospect of being constantly pinned down in a state that is a day and a half away from the rest of America .
She would have been totally isolated in every sense of the word .
Now she can study up on issues where she is lacking and become a full - time political celebrity .
The pundits call her a quitter , but let 's be honest - the pundits never liked her to begin with .
Better to take one hit for stepping down and move on than to stay in Alaska and die a death by a thousand cuts .
Governor or not , Palin is still the biggest star in the Republican galaxy .
After all , who else have they got ?
It 's interesting - after decades of politicians preaching about family values , we actually have a president who practices them .
President Obama 's decision to take his kids along with him to Russia and Italy completely stole the show .
Nobody takes their kids on diplomatic missions .
And it is so engaging and so authentic that you almost forgive him for not having the stimulus package working !
It was wall - to - wall people the other day at the Fillmore Street Fair .
Everyone was lined up to buy hats from Ms. Ruth Dewson .
They were out the door .
I took a look at what was taking so long for everyone to pay .
It turns out Ms. Dewson has one of those old - timey registers - her bra .
And she was doing one heck of a business stuffing the money in .
In the time I was there she went from a 38 to a 44 .
Have you checked out the local music scene lately ?
Down at the Burlingame Grill they have a different act every night .
I went there to see Bud E. Luv , who was his usual great self .
Up in North Beach at Joey and Eddie's - which used to be Moose 's - they have a Rat Pack tribute to Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. that had everyone dancing .
We should really be more like Havana , where every club has free music early in the week .
It would help fill up the town on slow nights , and maybe lead to some gigs for all these talented people on the weekends .
I hopped in a cab to go to KPIX for the morning show the other day , and all the way there the cabdriver had the radio tuned to classical music .
I needed to know if anything was breaking , so I asked , " Do you ever put on the news ? "
" No , " he said .
" Why ruin a good day ? "
Hope I have n't ruined yours .
( CNN ) -- Mexican immigration to the United States has dropped sharply since 2005 , but the flow of migrants returning to Mexico remains steady , according to a study released Wednesday by the Pew Hispanic Center .
Plaques mark the U.S. - Mexico border near Laredo , Texas .
Immigration from Mexico to the United States slowed at least 40 percent between mid-decade and 2008 , according to the analysis , based on national population surveys in the United States and Mexico , as well as Border Patrol apprehension figures .
The Mexican survey estimated that 1 million Mexicans left for the United States in a 12 - month period beginning in 2006 .
Three years later , that number decreased to 636,000 .
" The size of the drop has been quite remarkable in such a small span of time , " Jeffrey Passel , senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center and author of the study , told CNN .
The recession and enhanced border enforcement are factors that may explain the decrease in apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants in the United States , according a Department of Homeland Security bulletin released last month .
But if diminished job prospects in the United States have kept would - be immigrants in Mexico , employment worries have n't increased the number of Mexican migrants leaving the United States , the study found .
An estimated 433,000 Mexican migrants returned home between 2008 and 2009 , a number not significantly different than the 479,000 who returned three years earlier , Passel said .
While the number of Mexican migrants entering the United States remains greater than the number returning , the study shows that the gap is closing to the point of nearing a balance between migrant inflows and outflows .
Do n't Miss Hispanic population boom fuels diversity
" My guess is you have to go back at least 40 years or 50 years to see that , " Passel said .
It is too early to tell , however , if either trend " points to a fundamental change in U.S. - Mexico immigration patterns or is a short - term response to heightened border enforcement , the weakened U.S. economy or other forces , " the study states .
The economic downturn has certainly affected work opportunities for immigrants in the United States , said Alfredo Reyes , a day laborer who does construction and yard work in Atlanta area .
" There are weeks where I have three days of work and the other four without work , " the Michoacan , Mexico , native told CNN .
Despite the reduced availability for work , Reyes plans on staying put because the economic downturn is global .
" I think things are more difficult there ( in Mexico ) , " he said .
The two trends found in the Pew study should not be surprising , Rodolfo de la Garza , a professor at Columbia University and an expert on immigration , told CNN .
For those in Mexico , it remains expensive and risky to be smuggled into the United States , especially in a weak economy , he said .
" Things are worse in Mexico than they are here , " de la Garza said .
" The job you have here is better than what you have there .
If you go back , what do you go back to ? "
Another reason that Mexicans living in the United States might stay is that they feel at home , he said .
Despite the stereotype of the United States as an anti-immigrant destination , " at local levels , there is very little harassment , " de la Garza said .
" By and large , people are accepting of immigrants . "
Another day laborer in Georgia , who declined to give his name , said that the current economic crunch left him without the resources to return to his native Oaxaca , Mexico , even if he wanted .
But even during these tough times , he is content .
" It 's simple , we like living here in the United States , " he said .

The Toledo Blade recently covered the election of a woman , Salmenna Sediqe , as president of a local mosque :
Salmenna Sediqe , a businesswoman and mother of five , was elected last month and will serve a one - year term as president of the mosque on Alexis Road in Sylvania .
The administrative position is separate from the mosque ‚Äôs religious leadership .
What ‚Äôs refreshing about this article is that , although the gender of the newly elected leader is what made this a news item to begin with , it does n‚Äôt really harp on this issue as something really rare or extraordinary .
It ‚Äôs easy to imagine this as something that could easily be turned into a story about how ‚Äú wow , those Muslims are finally coming out of the dark ages ! ‚Äù or ‚Äú OMG , a female leader , the conservatives are probably writing their death threats as we speak ! ‚Äù
Instead of getting sensationalist and melodramatic , the journalist quotes several Muslim representatives , all of whom confirm that female leadership is not unheard of , and that , while it can definitely be celebrated , this is ‚Äú not a landmark election for Muslims . ‚Äù
In other words , instead of the ‚Äú wow , look at this woman break the stereotypes ! ‚Äù hype that comes up so often , the article seems to actually reflect on whether those stereotypes were even warranted in the first place , and to allow Muslims to speak for themselves about the significance of this election .
Take the following quotes , for example :
Ms. Kadri said Mrs. Sediqe ‚Äôs gender ‚Äú should be a nonissue .
As long as she was the best qualified person , that ‚Äôs all that should matter .
People should be judged by their merits and abilities . ‚Äù
Julia Shearson , executive director of the Cleveland chapter of the Council on American - Islamic Relations , said , ‚Äú We ‚Äôre very pleased , of course , and I think it ‚Äôs important that competent women are advanced in our community .
But I do n‚Äôt think it ‚Äôs an anomaly .
‚Äú There have been four women presidents or prime ministers of Muslim - majority nations , and we have yet to have a woman president in the United States . ‚Äù
Dr. S. Zaheer Hasan , a member of both the Masjid Saad and the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo , said Mrs. Sediqe ‚Äú has the respect of the community as a very hard - working and pious lady .
People who voted for her saw that in her .
It was not a gender issue . ‚Äù
Of course , the low level of female leadership to date is an issue among Muslim communities ( although , as Shearson points out , it ‚Äôs not something unique to Muslims ) .
I would have been interested to see someone articulate this as an example of equitable hiring practices : yes , they should hire her because of her gender ( alongside her obvious qualifications for the position ) because the under - representation of women is a problem .
However , it ‚Äôs good to see this talked about as something that ‚Äôs good news but not earth - shattering , and , by extension , as an example of change developing organically from within Muslim communities , rather than as a result of outside intervention .
The article ends with a quote from Sediqe about the need for Muslims to become more involved in the greater community :
‚Äú Islam is about balance ; it ‚Äôs not healthy to shelter our children from other faith groups and our community , ‚Äù she said .
‚Äú I truly believe the way we interact and have interfaith dialogue in Toledo can be an example for the rest of the world . ‚Äù
Overall , this was a very responsible and respectful portrait , both of the individual Muslim woman being profiled , and of the Muslim community that she has been elected to lead .
Climate change seems to be causing glaciers to retreat in Gansu province , bringing floods to local residents ( Image : Chi-yuen Wang )
As ice melts from glaciers in the region , lower lying land like that along the Silk Road floods ( Image : Chi-yuen Wang )
The Chinese gateway to the ancient Silk Road is being flooded ‚Äì and the culprit , researchers say , is climate change .
Melting glaciers sitting above the Hexi corridor in Gansu province , once an important trading and military route into Central Asia , are fuelling dramatic regional floods .
Advertisement
The finding illustrates a major problem for the coming century : around the world , arid regions that sit next to glaciers will suffer a spate of floods , then dry up completely when the glaciers melt away .
Once the eastern gateway to the Silk road , the Hexi corridor is sandwiched between the Qilian mountains to the southwest , and lower mountains bordering the Gobi desert to the northeast .
‚Äú This is an extremely arid area , with an average annual precipitation of about 125 millimetres , ‚Äù says Chi-Yuen Wang , a geologist and hydrologist at the University of California at Berkeley .
Frequent floods
Water scarcity has been less of a problem in recent years .
Although irrigation pulled the region ‚Äôs water table down during the 20th century , it unexpectedly began to rise again in 2003 , and floods have been frequent since 2005 .
By looking at the isotope composition of water in local springs , Wang and colleague Jian Sheng Chen of the hydrology lab of Hohai University in Nanjing , China , determined that most of this additional water seems to be coming from glaciers perched up in the surrounding mountains .
This mixes with cyclic rainfall that largely stems from evaporation of the region ‚Äôs irrigation water .
The fact that precipitation at high altitude has not increased significantly in recent years , means it is very likely that the extra water in the Hexi corridor has come from increased glacier melt , Wang told New Scientist .
Melting resource
Temperatures in Qilian mountains have risen by 0.04 ¬∞C per year on average since the 1980s and the glaciers have been creeping back up the mountain slopes , sometimes by as much as 7 metres in a single year .
Melting permafrost makes it easier for the glacier water to seep into the water table and eventually make its way into the springs .
These springs have been supplying oases and the cities that were set up around them for millennia .
The irrigation water they provide for agriculture has turned the Hexi corridor into a regional breadbasket .
Some 26 million people live along the corridor and rely on the springs for water .
When the springs flood , they can wreak havoc on the unprepared region .
The cities of Zhangye and Jiuquan have flooded repeatedly in the past few years , most severely in the winter , when irrigation stops and the water table rises .
According to the researchers , the swelling springs have forced about 1000 families to evacuate .
The team says the situation is unlikely to improve .
Most of the glaciers along the Hexi corridor are predicted to disappear by 2050 , and , like other arid regions at the foot of melting glaciers , the area is in desperate need of creative new ways of managing its water supply ( see Melting glaciers will trigger food shortages ) .

Judge blocks Williams
Wall suspension , but will it hurt Vikings in the end ?
The AP is reporting that a district judge has granted Vikings ‚Äô defensive tackles Pat and Kevin Williams a block against their four - game suspensions for using a banned substance .
The ‚Äú Williams Wall ‚Äù now has a temporary restraining order against the NFL and the judge has also scheduled a July 22 hearing to consider whether or not he ‚Äôll put a hold on state court proceedings .
This could be construed as either good or a bad for the Vikings .
Sure , Minnesota could have the Williams Wall for Week 1 against the Browns , but what happens if the NFL wins this battle and suspends the pair during a critical point during the season ?
If the Williams Wall is truly innocent or victims are victims in some way , then nobody should blame them for fighting their suspensions .
But the NFL is n‚Äôt going to give up here , especially considering it does n‚Äôt want to take on an image that its players are using banned substances to help them compete on the field ( a la Major League Baseball ) .
Last year , the Williams Wall avoided a four - game suspension during a critical stretch in the season and they helped the Vikings make the playoffs .
If they serve their four game suspension over the course of the first four weeks of this season , they ‚Äôll miss games against the Browns , 49ers , Lions and Packers .
Granted , no win is guaranteed in the NFL , but the Vikings certainly have a much easier schedule at the start of the year than the middle and end .
Again , if the Williams Wall is innocent , then they should n‚Äôt back down .
But if the two think that they ‚Äôre going to sneak one past the NFL with this judge ‚Äôs help , then they probably have another thing coming and could wind up missing crucial games during the middle or end of the season .
Everybody ( i.e. the Williams Wall and the Vikings ) seems to be playing with fire here .
" We cannot but regard Mrs Clinton as a funny lady as she likes to utter such rhetoric , unaware of the elementary etiquette in the international community , " the spokesman said .
" Sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping . "
The BBC ‚Äôs Natural History Unit is responsible for some of the BBC ‚Äôs most loved TV and radio programming ‚Äî unfortunately until now it ‚Äôs only been accessible as part of the regular schedule or via iPlayer .
I say until now because today we launched the first phase of a new project which brings clips from the best of the NHU ‚Äôs programmes online .
Over the last few months we ‚Äôve been plundering the NHU ‚Äôs archive to find the best bits ‚Äî segmenting the TV programmes , tagging them ( with DBpedia terms ) and then aggregating them around URIs for the key concepts within the natural history domain ; so that you can discover those programme segments via both the originating programme and via concepts within the natural history domain ‚Äî species , habitats , adaptations and the like .
The segments / clips ‚Äò belong ‚Äô to their originating programme ‚Äî and as a result we ‚Äôve been adding information , about a bunch of programmes from the archive , to PIPs ( the underlying database behind iPlayer and / programmes ) .
The clip pages are n‚Äôt yet linked in with their owning episode , but they will be soon .
In addition to being able to discover these clips from within the context of the programme we are also providing URIs to aggregate information around the natural history domain , that is URIs for species , habitats , adaptations and ecozones .
Our hope is that by providing highly inter-linked , URIs we can help people gain a greater understanding of the natural world .
For example , by being able to see the different animals and habitats that live within different ecozones you can gain an understanding of the diversity of of life in different parts of the world ; or what different animals make up the Mammal or Bird Class ; or more about a particular adaptation .
Of course we are doing more than providing access to programme segments , we have also plundered our sound archive so you can hear what the different habitats and species sound like ( and obviously those sounds are separately addressable ) , we are then aggregating content from the other ‚Äò BBC Earth ‚Äô projects ‚Äî Earth News and Out of the Wild and elsewhere on the web .
It ‚Äôs not just about BBC content .
You might have noticed that the slugs for our URIs ( the last bit of the URL ) are the same as those used by Wikipedia and DBpedia that ‚Äôs because I believe in the simple joy of webscale identifiers , you will also see that much like the BBC ‚Äôs music site we are transcluding the introductory text from Wikipedia to provide background information for most things .
This also means that we are creating and editing Wikipedia articles where they need improving ( of course you are also more than welcome to improve upon the articles ) .
We are also publishing data from bunch of other organisations .
Information about habitats , ecozones and species distribution is provided by WWF ‚Äôs Wildfinder ; the species conservation status by IUCN ‚Äôs Red List of Threatened Species and ( where available ) information about why a species is at threat coming for Zoological Society of London ‚Äôs EDGE of Existence programme .
Finally information about a species adaptations and behaviours are provided by Animal Diversity Web .
Adopting this approach means that we are able to contribute distinctive content to the Web while at the same time helping people find what is already there .
There is a lot more we need to do , including linking in with current programmes and making everything available as RDF , JSON and for mobile devices .
That ‚Äôs all on it ‚Äôs way but in the meantime I hope you find what ‚Äôs there useful , informative and entertaining .

Not one to free fall
A tiny species of lizard is so light that it falls to the ground like a feather , scientists have discovered .
Outwardly , little of the animal 's body seems adapted to flying , gliding or moving through the air in any way .
But a slow - motion camera has revealed that when the lizard jumps from a height , it can slow the rate of its descent and land gently on the ground .
The lizard 's surprising aerial ability might help explain how some animals became true gliders .
Details of the little lizard 's talents are published in the Journal of Experimental Biology .
Controlled descent Active flight , powered by the flapping of wings , has evolved in three living lineages of animals : birds , bats and insects .
But at least 30 different types of animal have evolved the ability to control their aerial descent , by parachuting or gliding to ground .
For example , gliding frogs use huge webbed feet , flying squirrels use long flaps of skin between their legs , and flying fish use their fins to glide .
Other animals have less obvious morphological adaptations .
Gliding snakes flatten and undulate their bodies , which helps to slow their fall while some species of ant are so tiny they can jump out of trees and freefall gently to lower on the trunk without hurting themselves .
So Bieke Vanhooydonck of the University of Antwerp became extremely interested when she read some old scientific papers reporting anecdotal evidence that a relatively ordinary species of lizard might also be able to glide from tree to tree .
Holaspis guentheri belongs to a group of lizards known as lacertids , which live in the Old World .
A slender , flat build helps
Though colourful , they do not stand out in terms of their behaviour , morphology or ecology .
" Also , compared to other gliding lizard species , it does not have any conspicuous morphological adaptations to an aerial lifestyle , ie no cutaneous flaps , webbed feet etc , " says Vanhooydonck .
" It made me very curious about whether these animals were really able to ' glide ' and if so , how they were accomplishing it . "
Leaping platform
So Vanhooydonck and colleagues in Belgium and France filmed individual lizards leaping from a platform two metres above ground .
They compared the performance of H.guentheri with a rock - dwelling lizard ( Podarcis muralis ) that never takes to the air , and a highly specialised leaping gecko ( Ptychozoon kuhli ) that has a range of skin flaps that it uses to parachute to the ground .
For each , they examined the duration of each species ' descent , the horizontal distance it covered and at what speed .
Both the rock - dwelling lizard and H.guentheri landed 50 centimetres from the base of the platform , while the gecko landed up to 1 m away .
But H.guentheri fell for longer , and more slowly than its rock - dwelling competitor .
" Much to our surprise , H. guentheri is able to slow down its descent and has low impact forces upon landing , " says Vanhooydonck .
In fact , the lizard weighs just 1.5g , which is one third of the rock - dwelling lizard 's weight and one - tenth of the gecko's .
Once weight was factored in , the researchers found that H.guentheri landed 20 cm further away that it should have done had it fallen like a stone .
The leaping gecko P. kuhli is a true glider " Also its wing loading , the ratio of mass to surface area , is extremely low and in the same range as that of the gekko . "
However , the two species achieve this aerial ability in different ways .
As a result of its webbed feet and body flaps , the gecko achieves a low wing loading by having a large surface area .
H. guentheri has a low wing loading too , but by being so light .
X - ray scans of the lizard 's body revealed its bones are packed full of air spaces .
Although the lizard 's light weight and ability to fall gently are linked , it is still unclear whether its air - filled bones are an adaptation for parachuting , or whether they evolved for another reason .
It is also unclear whether H.guentheri glides from tree to tree to escape predators or move about more efficiently .
" Because of [ the lizards ' ] secretive lifestyle , it is very hard to observe them in the wild , but it seems plausible they use it as an escape response , " says Vanhooydonck .
And that could be just how other gliding animals took the first evolutionary steps towards an aerial lifestyle , she says .

John Berry , the director of the federal agency in charge of such workplace issues , the Office of Personnel Management , said in an interview on Tuesday that the administration was not trying to hide its work on the new provisions .
Mr. Berry noted that he had mentioned them last week at a news briefing about the president ‚Äôs same - sex benefits plan , though it came up only briefly in a discussion that mostly focused on the complaints .
‚Äú There ‚Äôs been no attempt to hide anything or be coy , ‚Äù he said .
Mr. Berry , the administration ‚Äôs highest - ranking openly gay official , said he had been an early advocate for the new protections for transgender workers .
‚Äú I was aware coming into this job that this was a class of people for whom it was not clear that they were protected from discrimination , ‚Äù he said , ‚Äú and I thought it was an opportunity to clarify that . ‚Äù
The guidelines will further interpret a section of the civil service law that broadly bars federal supervisors from taking any action against an employee based on anything other than job performance .
Guidelines for federal supervisors already ban them from taking any job action ‚Äú against an employee or applicant based on race , color , religion , sex , national origin , age , handicapping condition , marital status or political affiliation . ‚Äù
An executive order signed by President Bill Clinton in 1998 added sexual orientation to that list of categories .
Mr. Berry said the new guidelines would add gender identity as well .
Mr. Berry said he had no estimate for just how many federal employees would consider themselves to be transgender .
‚Äú In our own agency we have transgender individuals , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú I know they are present in the federal work force , and they deserve to be treated with respect and dignity . ‚Äù
Nothing Ventured
A bold leap into the ontological void
Jim Holt
Harper 's Magazine , November 1994
The question looms in moments of great despair , when things tend to lose all their weight and all meaning becomes obscured ....
It is present in moments of rejoicing , when all things around us are transfigured and seem to be there for the first time , as if it might be easier to think they are not than to understand that they are and are as are .
The question is upon us in boredom , when we are equally removed from despair and joy , and everything about us seems so hopelessly commonplace that we no longer care whether anything is or is not ...
It can even be argued that we are impotent to answer any question of why there is something rather than nothing .
For , as the Harvard philosopher Robert Nozick has written , " how can we know why something is ( or should be ) a certain way if we do n't know why there is anything at all ? "
But why should one bother with a question of such generality that it appears impossible to answer ?
Although it is certainly reasonable to inquire why each particular thing in the world exists -- our solar system , life on earth , the clock in the Grand Central station -- it makes no sense to demand the same of the tout ensemble .
Any factor introduced to explain why there is something rather than nothing -- a cosmic egg , a fluctuation in a vacuum , a transcendent purpose , an omnipotent deity will itself be part of the something to be explained .
Besides , if the world is by definition all that exists , it would seem foolish to inquire why the world itself exists .
That is like asking why a triangle has three sides .
Existing is just what the world does .
To ask , " Why is there something rather than nothing ? " is , to this way of thinking , not to pose a real question .
It is to rhapsodize -- to express awe , astonishment , bewilderment before the cosmos .
Wittgenstein himself suggested as much when he remarked : " If I say , ' I wonder at the existence of the world , ' I am misusing language . "
Whether the existence of the world is a mysterium tremendum et fascinans or a mere tautology , it continues to exercise the imagination of philosophers and theologians , not to mention stoned undergraduates and insomniac yuppies having a Dark Night of the Soul .
And it is becoming the special province of a small group of physicists known as the " nothing theorists . "
With some metaphysical chutzpah , these physicists are seeking to resolve the " how " question that corresponds to " Why is there something rather than nothing ? " : to wit , how could something have spontaneously arisen from nothing ?
For we now know that , contrary to what Aristotle believed , the cosmos is not eternal .
Rather , it sprang into being some 15 billion years ago with the explosion of an infinitesimal speck of infinitely concentrated energy .
This truth , broached early in the century and recently put beyond doubt by the data from the COBE ( Cosmic Background Explorer ) satellite , has not been unanimously welcomed by physicists .
Einstein , for one , found the idea that the universe had a beginning in time nutty and downright repugnant , although the evidence finally compelled him to accept it shortly before his death .
The great cosmologist Fred Hoyle thought that an explosion was an undignified way for the world to commence , rather like a party girl jumping out of a cake ; once , during a BBC broadcast , he derisively referred to the hypothesized origin as the " Big Bang , " and the term stuck .
Churchmen , by contrast , had finally seen a scientific discovery that was cause for cheer rather than gloom .
Pope Pius XII , opening a scientific conference at the Vatican in 1951 , declared that the Big Bang theory bore witness " to that primordial fiat lux uttered at the moment when , along with matter , there burst forth from nothing a sea of light and radiation ....
Hence , creation took place in time ; therefore there is a creator , therefore God exists !
Whether or not the Big Bang truly implies that the universe was created out of nothing by an omnipotent deity in a wholly gratuitous act of love , it does demonstrate that the universe is , as philosophers say , contingent -- that is , it need not have existed .
Anything that exists by its own nature , that is the cause and ground of its own being , must be eternal and imperishable .
The universe is neither of these things .
Just as space , time , and matter winked into existence with the Big Bang , expanding to form the present universe , so too will they likely begin contracting one day when gravity arrests the expansion , eventually winking out of existence altogether in a great cosmic implosion -- The Big Crunch .
The cosmos is thus a mere interlude between two nothings .
It can not contain the reason for its own existence , the ground of its own being .
But , then , what could ?
Only God , say the theologians .
Remember the words that the Supreme Being called out to Moses from the burning bush ?
" I am what I am . "
What He was trying to put across was that His existence was contained in His very essence .
( Indeed , the Israelite name for God , Yahweh , is a form of the Hebrew verb " to be . " )
Being the cause of his own existence , He does n't have the occasion to ask Himself , " Whence , then , am I ? "
In the eleventh century , Saint Anselm of Canterbury elaborated this idea into an ingenious argument for the existence of God.
Anselm 's " ontological proof , " which the monk cast in the form of prayer , began with the premise that God is the greatest and most perfect thing that can be conceived .
It is clearly greater and more perfect to exist than not to exist , Anselm reasoned , for a real being is greater than a merely fictitious one .
" So truly , therefore , dost thou exist , O Lord , My God , that thou canst not be conceived not to exist , " concluded Inseam 's invocation .
Leibniz , too , counted Necessary Being among the Godhead 's perfections .
God exists as a matter of logical necessity ; it is because
He harbors the reason for His existence in His nature , that He , and He alone , can furnish the last link in the great explanatory chain , the ultimate answer to the question " Why is there something rather than nothing ? "
There is a world because God created it out of nothing , through His own free choice .
This not only explains why a world exists , Leibniz contended , but also accounts for the selection of this particular world : since God 's creative act was motivated by His infinite goodness , the world He brought into being must be the best of all possible worlds -- and , adds the cynic , everything in it is a necessary evil .
( A physicist I know claims that things make much more sense if you assume the world was created not by an all - good and all - powerful being but by one that is 100 percent malevolent but only 90 percent effective . )
Was this putatively self - existent deity the cause of the Big Bang ?
Theologians and believing physicists alike tend to find this conception of God as a sort of pyrotechnical engineer a vulgar one .
the Christina doctrine of Creation is , in the main , about the dependence of a contingent world upon a necessary being .
God is not to be thought of as an entity who gets the cosmic ball rolling -- the Unmoved Mover ; this participation in the causal order would rob Him of His transcendence .
Rather ,
He is to be seen as the only sustainer unsustained , without whose timeless purposing the world would altogether cease to be .
Whether the universe happened to have a beginning in time is , in this view , irrelevant .
The point was nicely put by the British physicist Russell Stannard a few years ago in an article he wrote for the London Times : " Just as an author does not write the first chapter , and then leaves the others to write themselves , so God 's creativity is not to seem as uniquely confined to , or even especially invested in , the event of the Big Bang .
Rather , his creativity has to be seen as permeating equally in all space and all time : his role as Creator and Sustainer merge . "
This was presumably what the Church of England prelate William Temple was trying to capture in the famous pair of equations he propounded earlier in the century :
God minus the world equal God ; the world minus God equals nothing .
( But the archbishop 's arithmetic was more treacherous than he knew , for a little manipulation of these equations yields " God minus God equals God " -- which is , of course , equivalent to " God equals nothing . " )
The problem with this theistic resolution of the mystery of existence is that it hangs rather precariously close to the ontological argument .
It was by that bit of scholastic jugglery , you will recall , that a self - existent divinity was conjured into being in the first place .
Theologians were chary of Anselm 's reasoning from the moment it was articulated .
Could a being whose existence is grounded in pure logic really be the God of faith , the God of Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob ?
The argument fared better with philosophers .
Leibniz plumped for it ; so did Descartes , so did Spinoza .
It was not until the eighteenth century , after hundreds of years of muddled controversy , that Immanuel Kant nosed out the fallacy .
Simply put , it is this : Existence is not a property of things , like size or color .
It adds nothing to a concept .
If it did , all kinds of entities could be defined into existence .
Suppose , for instance , a unicorn were to be defined as the most perfect horse there could be ; would it not follow then , by the very reasoning Anselm employed , that unicorns exist ?
No logical bridge can be built between a mere abstraction and concrete existence .
True , there are some philosophers around today who defend the ontological argument on various eccentric grounds .
I have even met one rabbi who swore that he based his belief in God on a version of Anselm 's reasoning .
Most , though , would agree with Schopenhauer 's assessment of it as a " charming joke . "
So reason , unaided by faith in revelation , is left staring at nothing .
And that is all to the better .
For , as the German diplomat and philosopher Max Scheler wrote , " he who has not , as it were , looked into the abyss of the absolute Nothing will completely overlook the eminently positive content of the realization that there is something rather than nothing . "
Let us , then , dip briefly into the abyss to see what nothing looks like , fully confident that we will not come up empty - handed .
For as the old saying goes : Nothing seek , Nothing find .
What is nothing ?
Macbeth answered this question with admirable concinnity : Nothing is but what is not .
( Or as my dictionary puts it , somewhat less felicitously - - if more paradoxically - -" nothing : something that does not exist . " )
Although the ancient Eleatic sage Parmenides declared that it is impossible to speak of what is not -- violating his own rule in the process -- the plain man knows better .
Nothing is , for example , popularly held to be better than a dry martini but worse than sand in the bedsheets .
On occasion , nothing could be further from the truth , but it is not clear how much further .
Nothing is impossible for God yet a breeze for the rankest incompetent .
In fact , no matter what pair of contradictory properties you choose , nothing seems capable of embodying them .
From this it might be concluded that nothing is mysterious .
But that would simply mean that everything is obvious -- including , presumably , nothing .
That , perhaps , is why the world abounds with people who know , understand , and believe in nothing .
But beware of speaking blasphemously of nothing , for there are also many bumptious types about -- call them nullophiles -- who are fond of declaring that , to them , nothing is sacred .
The philosophers of antiquity were inclined to agree .
Ex nihilo nihil , they unanimously declared : " Nothing comes from nothing . "
Not only does this maxim attribute to nothing the divine quality of being self - generating ; it also impiously denies
God the power to prevail against nothingness , to bring about a world ex nihilo .
The best any deity could do , they held , was to organize a cosmos out of a primordial mess they called Chaos ; but this is an exercise in cosmetics rather than fullblooded creation .
Centuries later Leibniz paid nothing a similar compliment , declaring that it was " simpler and easier than something . "
( Hard experience teaches the same lesson : Nothing is simple , Nothing is easy . )
This conviction , indeed , is what prompted the great Rationalist to ask why there is something rather than nothing in the first place ; if there were nothing , after all , there would be nothing to be explained .
It was left to Hegel , though , to take nothing up and really make something of it -- or perhaps the other way around .
At the beginning of Hegel 's famous dialectic is the assumption that the Absolute is Pure Being .
But Pre Being is totally indefinite ; it has no qualities ; it is utterly empty .
It is the same as Pure Nothing .
You can't have one without the other ; they are dialectical twins .
And yet , inasmuch as they are also contraries , they can't coexist very happily .
Something new must be found that reconciles and supersedes them .
And that turns out to be : Becoming !
Becoming is what happens when Being is on the verge of passing into Nothing - - or vice versa .
Thus does the Hegelian dialectic get merrily underway , eventually yielding up human history and culture in all their variegated splendor .
As a feat of ontological boot - strapping , this is breathtaking .
It leaves Saint Anselm simply nowhere .
So nothing is nice , simple , self - begetting , and not really all that different than something .
Why , one wonders , was it regarded with such apprehension by the existentialists ?
Heidegger was filled with angst at the very thought of nothing ( though this did not keep him from writing copiously about it ) .
For him the encounter with nothingness was suffused with the dread of one 's own impending nonbeing -- the dread of death .
Sartre , too , was possessed with a sort of horror vacui .
" Nothingness haunts being , " he wrote in the treatise aptly entitled Being and Nothingness .
Not even the cafes of Saint Germain offered certain relief from nullity .
He goes to Deux Magots -- on a good day , a " fullness of being " -- to meet Pierre .
Pierre is not there .
Et voila : a little pool of nothingness , a frisson of anguish .
To be fair , it must be said that neither Sartre nor Heidegger was very favorably disposed toward the category of existence either .
Roquentin , the autobiographical hero of Sartre 's novel Nausea , finds himself " choked with rage " at the " monstrous lumps " of " gross , absurd being " that environ him as he sits under a chestnut tree in Bouville .
The universe , in all its gooey contingency , is de trop .
For the more phlegmatic Heidegger , the feeling elicited by " what is " was not so much nausea as boredom .
Ontologically speaking , the existentialists were fussy customers : neither something nor nothing afforded them much jollity .
Across the Channel , British philosophers dismissed these vaporings as much ado about nothing .
The late A.J. Ayer submitted that Sartre , Heidegger , and their epigones had been fooled by the grammar of " nothing " ; since it behaves like a noun , they assumed that it must relate to an entity - - a something .
( The White King in Through the Looking Glass made a similar blunder when he reasoned that if Nobody had passed the messenger on the road , Nobody should have arrived first . )
Ayer 's brethren among the logical positivists singled out for derision Heidegger 's famous pronouncement " Das Nichts nichtet " : " Nothing noths . "
Nothingness is more than a mere entity , Heidegger seemed to be implying ; it is the great annihilating force .
" Nothing " turns out to be a noun after all , but the present participle of the transitive verb " to noth " !
Nonsense with knobs on , chuckled the positivists .
Nonsense on stilts .
But what if nothing really is a kind of force ?
What if it does " noth " ?
Perhaps it might just noth itself .
The idea that nothing could usher the world into being by committing suicide , as it were , may seem a pretty barmy way to answer the question " why is there something rather than nothing ? "
But it has been semi-seriously raised by no less a thinker than Robert Nozick .
In his book Philosophical Investigations , he invites us to imagine nothing as " a vacuum force , sucking things into non-existence or keeping them there .
If this force acts on itself , it sucks nothingness into nothingness , producing something or , perhaps , everything , every possibility . "
Nozick recalls the vacuum - cleaner - like beast in The Yellow Submarine that goes around sucking up everything that it encounters .
After hoovering away the surrounding background , it ultimately turns on itself and sucks itself into nonexistence ; with a pop , the world reappears , along with the Beatles .
( Come to think of it , the cosmic background hiss left over from the Big Bang does rather resemble a giant sucking sound . )
One of Nozick 's more acute observations on the question " Why is there something rather than nothing ? " is that it is biased ; it presupposes that nothing is a privileged , natural state that requires no explanation , and that something is a mysterious deviation from it .
Now , it is true that if nothing did exist , no one would be around to ask " Why is there something rather than nothing ? "
It is also true that while there are many possible worlds for there to be something -- worlds in which Henry Kissinger is a steeplejack , worlds in which everything is made of cream cheese -- there is only one way for there to be nothing ; and that uniqueness would seem to elevate nullity from the crowd .
But this is a two - edged sword .
For if all of these possibilities -- the myriad worlds where there is something and the single one where there is nothing -- are assigned equal chances of occurring ( and why should n't they be ? ) , then it is overwhelmingly probable that there will be something rather than nothing .
Tennessee Williams once said that " a vacuum is a hell of a lot better than some of the stuff nature replaces it with . "
That sentiment has not stopped certain contemporary philosophers of a Platonic kidney from asserting that the world exists because it is so much better than nothing .
The leading exponent of this Axiarchic School is the Canadian philosopher John Leslie .
With considerable sophistication , Leslie argues that the cosmos exploded into being in answer to a need for goodness .
" Suppose there is no nihilistic force fighting the existence of things , " says Leslie .
" Then absolutely any valid ground or reason for things will tend to bring about their materialization .
And ethical realities supply such grounds or reasons . "
What about the problem of evil ?
Plotinus said that the murdered were themselves murderers in a previous life .
Christian apologists invoke the inscrutability of God 's designs .
Hegel claimed that the conflict and wickedness were mere appearances .
The Axiarchists , to their credit , do not try to make evil disappear .
Rather , pointing to the majestic complexity of living things , they submit that the world is on balance good enough -- that is , at least marginally better than nothing .
So its existence is ethically required .
Given a sufficiently developed sense of irony , one can almost accept this .
The alternative , after all , is to believe that the triumph of Full Being over the Absence of All Things was just a matter of reasonless luck .
Or that , as the Hunter College physicist Ed Tyron is fond of putting it , " the universe is simply one of those things that happens from time to time . "
Tryon holds the distinction of being the first of the " nothing theorists , " a cabal of theoretical cosmologists ( clustered mostly upon the banks of the Cam and the Charles Rivers and on Manhattan 's Upper West Side ) who are trying to fathom what happened before the Big Bang .
It was in 1969 that Tryon , doing a bit of woolgathering during a talk by a visiting celebrity physicist at Columbia University , suddenly blurted out , " Suppose the universe is just a quantum fluctuation ? "
This was greeted with a good deal of harrumphing by the several Nobel laureates present .
What the callow Tryon was suggesting was that the entire cosmos might have bounded into existence out of nowhere -- in complete accordance with the laws of physics .
The key to it all is the notorious Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle , which says that , provided the scale is tiny enough and the duration is sufficiently brief , anything can happen .
Little space - time bubbles can froth up from nowhere , elementary particles can appear and disappear .
Add to this the " inflationary theory " developed by Harvard physicist Alan Guth in the early 1980's , which allows minuscule things to blow up to colossal proportions in the blink of an eye -- miraculously boosting their own energy in the process -- and the cosmogenic possibilities are endless .
A random blip in the void can easily cascade into a Big Bang .
" It is often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch , " Guth observes .
" The universe , however , is a free lunch . "
The nothing theorists have fleshed out a variety of rococo scenarios for creatio ex nihilo in recent years , all relying on the idea that nothing is in some sense unstable .
When these fellows are speaking English rather than equations , they tend to sound like the blowhard physicist Myron Kriegman ( " Name 's Myron .
Not Ron , mind you " ) in John Updike 's novel Roger 's Version .
Listen to Kriegman explaining the spontaneous emergence of the universe to a nonplused young man at a cocktail party :
As you know , inside the Planck length and the Planck duration you have this space - time foam where the quantum fluctuations from matter to non-matter really have very little meaning , mathematically speaking .
You have a Higgs field tunneling into a quantum fluctuation through the energy barrier in a false - vacuum state , and you get this bubble of broken symmetry that by negative pressure expands exponentially , and in a couple of microseconds you can have something go from next to nothing to the size and mass of the observable present universe .
How about a drink ?
You look pretty dry . . .
The giveaway here is " next to nothing . "
That may not sound like much , but it is still something .
The nothing theorists always seem to need some sort of orphic seed , some little bit of mathematics - saturated fuzz , to get their cosmologies going .
Ed Tryon 's universe pops out of a " false vacuum " -- an infinitesimal patch of empty space - time that , thanks to the Uncertainty Principle , is a mad ferment of particles and fields .
Stephen Hawkins calculates the probability that the cosmos might have arisen from a three dimensional geometry of zero-volume : close to naught , but no cigar .
Others invoke a preexisting dust of timeless structureless points and inchoate geometries : a quantum tohu - bohu not unlike the Chaos of the ancients .
But these are all pale and paltry nothings , no the real item .
You could hold them in the palm of your hand .
They scarcely inspire much angst .
Of all the nothing theorists , the one who appears to have got closest to real creatio ex nihilo is Alex Vilenkin , a Ukranian emigre cosmologist now at Tufts University .
When Vilenkin says the universe arose from nothing , he means it .
" Nothing is nothing , " he told me over the phone .
" Not just no matter .
No space , no time . "
( Vilenkin suggested that I think of nascent universes as little bubbles forming in a glass of champagne . )
By a quantum process called " tunneling , " which permits the breaching of otherwise impassable barriers , space - time emerged from nothing into a manifold of potential universes , and thence into reality .
Of course , since time itself is created in the process , these transitions cannot be thought of as taking place in time .
They are a logical , not a temporal , sequence -- one dictated by the laws of physics .
But where do the laws come from ?
And why these laws ?
We appear to have traded one orig9n mystery for another .
" They exist prior to the universe , " Vilenkin assured me .
" If you like , you can say they 're in the mind of God , " he added in a bit of theistic hand - waving that is fashionable among physicist these days .
But suppose the laws of quantum physics did somehow precede the cosmos , hovering transcendently like Plato 's eternal Forms .
That does not change the fact that they are only a set of equations , a mathematical pattern .
They have no ontic clout .
They need a demiurge to get behind them and shove .
As Stephen Hawking asked in A Brief History of Time , " What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe ? . . .
Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing ? "
If the laws of physics come into being along with the universe , then they can't explain it .
If they exist prior to the universe , then there is nothing to account for their existence -- not to mention their extraordinary power to exact obedience from the void .
That is the dilemma of the nothing theorists .
And there is no need to get impaled on its horns when a much more economical way of showing why there is something rather than nothing is available .
It goes like this .
Suppose , for the sake of argument , that nothing existed .
Then , in particular , there would be no laws .
( Laws are something , after all , despite what the nothing theorists seem to think . )
If there were no laws , then everything would be permitted .
If everything were permitted , then nothing would be forbidden .
Therefore , if nothing existed , nothing would be forbidden .
Therefore , nothing , if it existed , would forbid itself .
Therefore there must be something .
That is my own argument .
I thought of it the other day while shaving .
The logic seems to be sound ; at least , no one I have run it by so far has detected a flaw .
yet admittedly there is something sterile about it .
So I decided to enlist one more round of experts to pass judgment on my musings .
First I phoned a theoretical physicist I know at Cal Tech .
I got his voice mail and said that I had a question for him .
He called back and left a message on my answering machine .
" Leave your question on my voice mail and I 'll leave the answer on your machine , " went his instructions .
This was alluring .
I complied .
When I returned to my apartment late that evening , the little light was blinking on my answering machine .
I played the message back with some trepidation .
It was from the physicist .
" Okay , " it began , " what you are really talking about is a violation of matter - anti- matter parity . . . "
So I called a professor of philosophical theology at the University of Virginia .
I asked him if the fact that there was something rather than nothing could be explained by invoking a deity whose essence entailed his existence .
" Are you kidding ? " he said " God is so perfect He does n't have to exist . "
Then on the street in Greenwich Village , I ran into a Zen Buddhist scholar who had been introduced to me once at a cocktail party as an authority on mystical matters .
After a little chitchat , I asked him -- perhaps , in retrospect , a bit precipitately -- why there is something rather than nothing .
He tried to bop me on the head .
He must have thought it was a Zen koan .
Finally , I rung up a philosopher at Columbia , about the deepest intellect I know .
I said I was at the end of an essay about a metaphysical question and the waters were fast rising up around me .
When I told him the question , his response was vehement and almost churlish : " Who says there is not nothing ? "
On reflection , I think I see his point .
And as I 've always said , nothing is good enough for me .

It 's all gone wrong .
Our belief in everything has been shattered by a series of shock revelations that have shaken our core to its core .
You can't move for toppling institutions .
Television , the economy , the police , the House of Commons , and , most recently , the press ... all revealed to be jam - packed with liars and bastards and graspers and bullies and turds .
And we knew .
We knew .
But we were deep in denial , like a cuckolded partner who knows the sorry truth but tries their best to ignore it .
Over the last 18 months the spotlight of truth has swung this way and that , and one institution after another was suddenly exposed as being precisely as rotten as we always thought it was .
What 's that ?
Phone - in TV quizzes might a bit of con ?
The economic boom is an unsustainable fantasy ?
Riot police can be a little " handy " ?
MPs are greedy ?
The News of the World might have used underhand tactics to get a story ?
What next ?
Oxygen is flavourless ?
Cows stink at water polo ?
Children are overrated ?
We knew all this stuff .
We just did n't have the details .
After all their histrionic shrieking about standards in television , it was only a matter of time before the tabloids got it in the neck .
Last Monday even the Press Complaints Commission , which is generally about as much use as a Disprin canoe , finally puffed up its chest and criticised the Scottish Sunday Express for its part in the Dunblane survivors ' story scandal .
You remember that , do n't you ?
Back in March ?
When the Scottish Sunday Express ran a story about survivors of the Dunblane massacre who'd just turned 18 ?
It fearlessly investigated their Facebook profiles and discovered that some of them enjoyed going to pubs and getting off with other teenagers , then ran these startling revelations on its front page , with the headline ANNIVERSARY SHAME OF DUNBLANE SURVIVORS .
" The Sunday Express can reveal how , on their social networking sites , some of them have boasted about alcoholic binges and fights , " crowed the paper .
" For instance , [ one of them ] - who was hit by a single bullet and watched in horror as his classmates died - makes rude gestures in pictures he posted on his Bebo site , and boasts of drunken nights out . "
Nice , yeah ?
As I 'm sure you recall , there was an immediate outcry , which was covered at length in all the papers .
You remember their outraged front pages , right ?
All their cries of SICK and FOUL and VILE in huge black text ?
Remember that ?
No ?
Of course you do n't .
Because the papers largely kept mum about the whole thing .
Instead , the outrage blew up online .
Bloggers kicked up a stink ; 11,000 people signed a petition and delivered it to the PCC .
The paper printed a mealy - mouthed apology that apologised for the general tenor of the article , while whining that they had n't printed anything that was n't publicly accessible online .
All it had done was gather it up and disseminate it in the most humiliating and revolting way possible .
Last Monday 's PCC ruling got next to zero coverage .
Maybe if it had happened after the News of the World phone - hacking story broke it would have gathered more .
Or maybe not .
Either way , the spotlight of truth is , for now , pointing at the press .
But this is just one small part of the ongoing , almighty detox of everything .
There 's been such an immense purge , such an exhaustive ethical audit , no one 's come out clean .
There 's muck round every arse .
But if the media 's rotten and the government 's rotten and the police are rotten and the city 's rotten and the church is rotten - if life as we know it really is fundamentally rotten - what the hell is there left to believe in ?
Alton Towers ?
Greggs the bakers ?
The WI ?
The internet .
Can we trust in that ?
Of course not .
Give it six months and we 'll probably discover Google 's sewn together by orphans in sweatshops .
Or that Wi-Fi does something horrible to your brain , like eating your fondest memories and replacing them with drawings of cross-eyed bats and a strong smell of puke .
There 's surely a great dystopian sci - fi novel yet to be written about a world in which it 's suddenly discovered that wireless broadband signals deaden the human brain , slowly robbing us of all emotion , until after 10 years of exposure we 're all either rutting in stairwells or listlessly reversing our cars over our own offspring with nary the merest glimmer of sympathy or pain on our faces .
It 'll be set in Basingstoke and called , " Cuh , Typical . "
What about each other ?
Society ?
Can we trust us ?
Doubt it .
We 're probably not even real , as was revealed in the popular documentary The Matrix .
That bloke next door ?
Made of pixels .
Your co-workers ?
Pixels .
You ?
One pixel .
One measly pixel .
You have n't even got shoes , for Christ 's sake .
As the very fabric of life breaks down around us , even language itself seems unreliable .
These words do n't make sense .
The vowels and consonants you 're hearing in your mind 's ear right now are being generated by mere squiggles on a page or screen .
Pointless hieroglyphics .
Shapes .
You 're staring at shapes and hearing them in your head .
When you see the word " trust " , can you even trust that ?
Why ?
It 's just shapes !
Right now all our faith has poured out of the old institutions , and there 's nowhere left to put it .
We need new institutions to believe in , and fast .
Does n't matter what they 're made of .
Knit them out of string , wool , anything .
Quickly , quickly .
Before we start worshipping insects .
Establishing a key link between the solar cycle and global climate , research led by scientists at the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) - funded National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) in Boulder , Colo. , shows that maximum solar activity and its aftermath have impacts on Earth that resemble La Ni√±a and El Ni√±o events in the tropical Pacific Ocean .
The research may pave the way toward predictions of temperature and precipitation patterns at certain times during the approximately 11 - year solar cycle .
" These results are striking in that they point to a scientifically feasible series of events that link the 11 - year solar cycle with ENSO , the tropical Pacific phenomenon that so strongly influences climate variability around the world , " says Jay Fein , program director in NSF 's Division of Atmospheric Sciences .
" The next step is to confirm or dispute these intriguing model results with observational data analyses and targeted new observations . "
The total energy reaching Earth from the sun varies by only 0.1 percent across the solar cycle .
Scientists have sought for decades to link these ups and downs to natural weather and climate variations and distinguish their subtle effects from the larger pattern of human - caused global warming .
Building on previous work , the NCAR researchers used computer models of global climate and more than a century of ocean temperature to answer longstanding questions about the connection between solar activity and global climate .
The research , published in July in a paper in the Journal of Climate , was funded by NSF , NCAR 's sponsor , and by the U.S. Department of Energy .

" We have fleshed out the effects of a new mechanism to understand what happens in the tropical Pacific when there is a maximum of solar activity , " says NCAR scientist Gerald Meehl , the paper 's lead author .
" When the sun 's output peaks , it has far - ranging and often subtle impacts on tropical precipitation and on weather systems around much of the world . "
The new paper , along with an earlier one by Meehl and colleagues , shows that as the Sun reaches maximum activity , it heats cloud - free parts of the Pacific Ocean enough to increase evaporation , intensify tropical rainfall and the trade winds , and cool the eastern tropical Pacific .
The result of this chain of events is similar to a La Ni√±a event , although the cooling of about 1 - 2 degrees Fahrenheit is focused further east and is only about half as strong as for a typical La Ni√±a .
Over the following year or two , the La Ni√±a - like pattern triggered by the solar maximum tends to evolve into an El Ni√±o - like pattern , as slow - moving currents replace the cool water over the eastern tropical Pacific with warmer - than - usual water .
Again , the ocean response is only about half as strong as with El Ni√±o .

True La Ni√±a and El Ni√±o events are associated with changes in the temperatures of surface waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean .
They can affect weather patterns worldwide .
The paper does not analyze the weather impacts of the solar - driven events .
But Meehl and his co-author , Julie Arblaster of both NCAR and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology , found that the solar - driven La Ni√±a tends to cause relatively warm and dry conditions across parts of western North America .
More research will be needed to determine the additional impacts of these events on weather across the world .
" Building on our understanding of the solar cycle , we may be able to connect its influences with weather probabilities in a way that can feed into longer - term predictions , a decade at a time , " Meehl says .
Scientists have known for years that long - term solar variations affect certain weather patterns , including droughts and regional temperatures .
But establishing a physical connection between the decadal solar cycle and global climate patterns has proven elusive .
One reason is that only in recent years have computer models been able to realistically simulate the processes associated with tropical Pacific warming and cooling associated with El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a .
With those models now in hand , scientists can reproduce the last century 's solar behavior and see how it affects the Pacific .
To tease out these sometimes subtle connections between the sun and Earth , Meehl and his colleagues analyzed sea surface temperatures from 1890 to 2006 .
They then used two computer models based at NCAR to simulate the response of the oceans to changes in solar output .
They found that , as the sun 's output reaches a peak , the small amount of extra sunshine over several years causes a slight increase in local atmospheric heating , especially across parts of the tropical and subtropical Pacific where Sun- blocking clouds are normally scarce .
That small amount of extra heat leads to more evaporation , producing extra water vapor .
In turn , the moisture is carried by trade winds to the normally rainy areas of the western tropical Pacific , fueling heavier rains .
As this climatic loop intensifies , the trade winds strengthen .
That keeps the eastern Pacific even cooler and drier than usual , producing La Ni√±a - like conditions .
Although this Pacific pattern is produced by the solar maximum , the authors found that its switch to an El Ni√±o - like state is likely triggered by the same kind of processes that normally lead from La Ni√±a to El Ni√±o .
The transition starts when the changes of the strength of the trade winds produce slow - moving off - equatorial pulses known as Rossby waves in the upper ocean , which take about a year to travel back west across the Pacific .
The energy then reflects from the western boundary of the tropical Pacific and ricochets eastward along the equator , deepening the upper layer of water and warming the ocean surface .
As a result , the Pacific experiences an El Ni√±o - like event about two years after solar maximum .
The event settles down after about a year , and the system returns to a neutral state .
" El Ni√±o and La Ni√±a seem to have their own separate mechanisms , " says Meehl , " but the solar maximum can come along and tilt the probabilities toward a weak La Ni√±a .
If the system was heading toward a La Ni√±a anyway , " he adds , " it would presumably be a larger one . "
Rather oddly , neither of New York 's opera companies scheduled '' Don Giovanni ' ' for its anniversary year .
Prague is celebrating it , and Salzburg has mounted and recorded a glossy version , but New York has had only the film '' The Mozart Brothers , '' about a perverse avant - garde director , and a Peter Sellars production at the Pepsico Summerfare Festival .
For all regular operagoers , though , '' Don Giovanni ' ' and the characters who people it are a constant presence .
Almost all the great singers of the past 180 years have sung in it at one time or another .
The understanding and the relative prominence of the principal roles have undergone surprising shifts over the years ; that fluidity is one measure of the piece 's staying power .
Leporello has always been the easiest role to put across , if hardly the easiest to do really well .
The grubby , ill - used , constantly commenting servant has appealed to all the great character basses , as Zerlina has to all the sweet type of lyric sopranos ( and sometimes mezzos ) .
For many years Zerlina 's name came first in the starry cast lists , especially when Adelina Patti sang it ( Verdi admired her in the role ) .
That has not been so for a long time , but Don Ottavio is the part most in eclipse currently .
Bold - voiced tenors are no longer taught to sing the runs and scales he must command .
The potency of the Giovanni figure and Donna Anna 's repeated reticence toward her nominal lover , Ottavio , conspire to put him in an equivocal position dramatically .
It does n't help that when he sings both of his arias ( Mozart wrote them as alternatives ) , one of them is weakly placed .
But Mario , Rubini and the other bel canto tenors all had triumphs in the part , and Wagner pointed to a triumph of another sort when , after poking the usual fun at the emptiness of Meyerbeer 's music , he sang Ottavio's air ( one would love to know which ) for his wife .
'' There is real melody , '' he said - '' at once you are in contact with a human being . ''
Donna Elvira is in the ridiculous position of a rejected , importuning mistress who hopes on ; commentators who want to emphasize the ' ' dramma giocoso ' ' side of the opera emphasize her silliness .
'' We know at once that we are not going to be allowed to take Elvira seriously for a moment , '' wrote the great E. J. Dent .
In some times and places hers has been considered a secondary role in the opera .
And Mozart wrote no music more sublime than for her .
'' Seriously ' ' is not quite the word for how we take her , but if our hearts are not pained , something has gone badly wrong .
Donna Anna has the grandest part , and the longest .
The whole opera turns on the efforts to punish Don Giovanni for his attempted violation of Anna and his murder of her father in the first scene .
The great question about Anna - asked at least since the romantic E. T. A. Hoffmann first offered his answer - is whether she covertly desires Don Giovanni ( Hoffmann thought so ) , and indeed whether she is perhaps lying about what took place between them at the beginning of the opera .
The harrowing , never - before - seen footage of the singer 's 1984 Pepsi commercial accident .

Government sources immediately began blaming North Korea for the recent cyberterror attacks on South Korea and the U.S. , despite having no evidence to back up those claims .
Now , an examination of the evidence by independent computer experts show that the attack seems to have been coordinated from the UK .
The hysterical media coverage in the attack 's wake , however , echoing the government line that it was likely the work of North Korea , served to cement in the minds of many that this was an act of cyberwarfare .
The idea that this surprisingly unsophisticated attack could have come from a well - organized , hostile state or terrorist group comes as a blessing in disguise to those groups , agencies and advisors who have been calling for greater and greater federal snooping powers in the name of stopping a " cyber 9/11 " from happening .
The " cyber 9/11 " meme stretches back almost to 9/11 itself .
Back in 2003 , Mike McConnell , the ex-director of the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , was fearmongering over the possibility of a cyber attack " equivalent to the attack on the World Trade Center " if a new institution were not created to oversee cyber security .
Since then , report after report has continued to use the horror of 9/11 as a way of raising public hysteria over " cyber terrorism , " a subject more often associated with juvenile hackers and lone misfits than radical terrorist organizations .
The real reason behind the invocation of 9/11 in the context of " cyber terror " was revealed last year by Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig .
He told a technology conference that former counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke admits there is a cyber equivalent of the constitution - destroying Patriot
Act ready to be rubber stamped into law ; all it requires is a " cyber 9/11 " to make such legislation politically viable .
In effect , the cyber security establishment ‚Äî the advisors , agents and experts in the newly - minted multi-billion dollar cyber security industry ‚Äî are waiting for a spectacular cyber terrorist attack to go ahead with plans for ' identity management ' schemes like fingerprinting for internet access which would put an end to the free Internet as we have known it .
What the cyber security establishment does not want you to know is that the most incredible cyber terrorist story of all time began 15 years ago .
And it centers on 9/11 .
The establishment is interested in suppressing this story because it demonstrates that the very investigative bodies that are clamoring for more power on the pretext of the " cyber terror " hysteria are the exact same bodies that failed to investigate the documentable links between government - designated terrorists and a software company with direct access to some of the most sensitive computer systems in the United States .
FBI agents whose investigation into this story were suppressed have even said that these investigations could have prevented 9/11 .
It is a story of international terror and terrorist financiers .
It stretches from New England to Saudi Arabia and involves businessmen , politicians and terror networks .
And it begins in the most unlikely of places : the offices of an enterprise architecture software firm in Quincy , Massachusetts .
Enterprise Architecture : The God 's - Eye View of Systems and Infrastructure
" Enterprise architecture software " refers to a computer program that allows someone to look at all of the data produced throughout an organization 's structure in real time .
This effectively gives the program user a god 's - eye view of an enterprise , allowing for the mapping , visualization and analysis of all transactions , interactions , systems , processes and personnel in the entirety of a business or agency .
This type of software could , for example , be used for robust business modeling , allowing for extremely detailed and accurate projections of how changes in an organization 's structure or processes would effect a business ' bottom line .
What would happen if two departments were merged , for example , or if a business were to outsource one of its processes .
As this software began to mature in the 1990s , however , it went from a merely useful tool to something truly incredible .
Sophisticated enterprise architecture software could , for example , examine all of the transactions taking place across a financial institution in real time and examine that data for possible money laundering operations or rogue traders .
Such software could even have potentially detected and identified the insider trading leading up to 9/11 .
Combined with rudimentary a.i. capabilities , such a program would not only be able to alert the appropriate personnel about such transactions , but even stop them as they are happening .
If the software were sophisticated enough , it may even be able to identify the possibility of such transactions before they happen .
The utility of such software for organizations of all stripes should be obvious enough .
It is unsurprising , then , that numerous government agencies and powerful corporations were hungry for this software in the 1990s .
A surprising number of them , including DARPA , the FBI , the Secret Service , the White House , the Navy , the Air Force , the FAA , NATO , IBM , Booz Allen Hamilton and Price Waterhouse Coopers ( amongst many others ) turned to a small New England - based software firm called Ptech .
Ptech : Not Your Average Software Firm
Ptech was founded in Quincy , Mass . in 1994 and by 1996 had secured a contract with DARPA to help transfer commercial software methodologies to the defense sector .
In 1997 , it gained security clearance to bid on sensitive military contracts and bid on work for a range of other government agencies .
Within four years
Ptech had built up a stable of clients that would make any third - party software vendor green with envy .
From the inner sanctum of the White House to the headquarters of the FBI , from the basement of the FAA to the boardroom of IBM , some of the best - secured organizations in the world running on some of the most protected servers housing the most sensitive data welcomed Ptech into their midst .
Ptech was given the keys to the cyber kingdom to build detailed pictures of these organizations , their weaknesses and vulnerabilities , and to show how these problems could be exploited by those of ill intent .
For all of its incredible success , however , many of the firm 's top investors and employees were men with backgrounds that should have been raising red flags at all levels of the government .
The firm was founded on $ 20 million of startup money , $ 5 million of which was provided by Yassin al - Qadi , a wealthy and well - connected Saudi businessman who liked to brag about his acquaintance with Dick Cheney .
He also had connections to various Muslim charities suspected of funding international terrorism .
In the wake of 9/11 he was officially declared a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the U.S. government and his assets were frozen .
At the time , Ptech 's owners and senior management denied that al - Qadi had any involvement with the company other than his initial investment , but the FBI now maintains they were lying and that in fact al - Qadi continued investing millions of dollars in the company through various fronts and investment vehicles .
Company insiders told FBI officials that they were flown to Saudi Arabia to meet Ptech 's investors in 1999 and that al - Qadi was introduced as one of the owners .
It has also been reported that Hussein Ibrahim , Ptech 's chief scientist , was al - Qadi 's representative at Ptech and al - Qadi 's lawyers have admitted that al - Qadi 's representative may have continued to sit on Ptech 's board even after 9/11 .
Ibrahim himself was a former president of BMI , a New Jersey - based real estate investment firm that was also one of the initial investors in Ptech and provided financing for Ptech 's founding loan .
Ptech leased office space and computer equipment from BMI and BMI shared office space in New Jersey with Kadi International , owned and operated by none other than Ptech 's sweetheart investor and Specially Designated Global Terrorist , Yassin al - Qadi .
In 2003 , counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke said : " BMI held itself out publicly as a financial services provider for Muslims in the United States , its investor list suggests the possibility this facade was just a cover to conceal terrorist support . "
Suheil Laheir was Ptech 's chief architect .
When he was n't writing the software that would provide Ptech with detailed operational blueprints of the most sensitive agencies in the U.S. government , he was writing articles in praise of Islamic holy war .
He was also fond of quoting Abdullah Azzam , Osama Bin Laden 's mentor and the head of Maktab al - Khidamat , which was the precursor to Al - Qaeda .
That such an unlikely cast of characters were given access to some of the most sensitive agencies in the U.S. federal government is startling enough .
That they were operating software that allowed them to map , analyze and access every process and operation within these agencies for the purpose of finding systemic weak points is equally startling .
Most disturbing of all , though , is the connection between Ptech and the very agencies that so remarkably failed in their duty to protect the American public on September 11 , 2001 .
Ptech on 9/11 : The Basement of the FAA
For two years prior to 9/11 , Ptech was working to identify potential problems or weaknesses in the FAA 's response plans to events like a terrorist hijacking of a plane over U.S. airspace .
According to their own business plan for their contract with the FAA , Ptech was given access to every process and system in the FAA dealing with their crisis response protocols .
This included examining key systems and infrastructure to analyze the FAA 's " network management , network security , configuration management , fault management , performance management , application administration , network management and user desk help operations . "
In short , Ptech had free reign to examine every FAA system and process for dealing with the exact type of event that was to occur on 9/11 .
Even more incredible , researcher Indira Singh points out that Ptech was specifically analyzing the potential interoperability problems between the FAA , NORAD and the Pentagon in the event of an emergency over U.S. airspace .
Ptech also presumably had operational information about the systems that the FAA , NORAD and others employed during crisis response exercises like Vigilant Guardian , the NORAD exercise that was taking place on 9/11 and included simulations of hijacked jets being flown into New York and hijacked jets being flown into government buildings .
This is significant because there is every indication that just such drills were confusing NORAD 's response to the real hijackings that were taking place that day .
As researcher Michael Ruppert points out , a rogue agent with access to a Ptech backdoor into the FAA 's systems could have been deliberately inserting fake blips onto the FAA 's radars on 9/11 .
That scenario would explain the source of the phantom Flight 11 that the FAA reported to NORAD at 9:24 a.m. ( well after Flight 11 had already hit the World Trade Center ) , a report whose source the 9/11 Commission claims they were unable to find .
In short , Ptech 's software was running on the critical systems responding to the attacks of 9/11 on 9/11 itself .
The software was designed for the express purpose of giving its users a complete overview of all the data flowing through an organization in real time .
The father of enterprise architecture himself , John Zachman , explained that with Ptech - type software installed on a sensitive server " You would know where the access points are , you ‚Äôd know how to get in , you would know where the weaknesses are , you ‚Äôd know how to destroy it . "
Stifled Investigations
Robert Wright : 9/11 " a direct result of the incompetence of the FBI 's International Terrorism Unit . "
In the late 1990s , Robert Wright ‚Äî an FBI special agent in the Chicago field office ‚Äî was running an investigation into terrorist financing called Vulgar Betrayal .
From the very start , the investigation was hampered by higher - ups ; the investigation was not even allocated adequate computers to carry out its work .
Through Wright 's foresight and perseverance , however , the investigation managed to score some victories , including seizing $ 1.4 million in U.S. funds that traced back to Yassin al - Qadi .
Wright was pleased when a senior agent was assigned to help investigate " the founder and the financier of Ptech " , but the agent did no work and merely pushed papers during his entire time on the case .
Shortly after the 1998 African embassy bombings , Vulgar Betrayal began to uncover a money trail linking al - Qadi to the attack .
According to Wright , when he proposed a criminal investigation into the links , his supervisor flew into a rage , saying " ' You will not open criminal investigations .
I forbid any of you .
You will not open criminal investigations against any of these intelligence subjects . "
Wright was taken off the Vulgar Betrayal investigation one year later and the investigation itself was shut down the following year .
In the aftermath of 9/11 , Indira Singh ‚Äî a risk management conultant for JP Morgan ‚Äî was looking for enterprise architecture software to implement the next generation of risk management at the financial juggernaut .
Impressed by their client list , Singh invited Ptech to demonstrate their software .
It was n't long before she began discovering the connections between Ptech and international terrorist financing .
She worked exhaustively to document and uncover these links in an effort to persuade the FBI in Boston to open their own investigation into Ptech , but she was told by one agent that she was in a better position to investigate this than someone inside the FBI .
Despite the persistent efforts of Singh and the testimony of company insiders , the FBI did not inform any of the agencies contracting with Ptech that there were concerns about the company or its software .
In late 2002 , Operation Green Quest ‚Äî a Customs Department - led multi-agency investigation into terrorist financing ‚Äî raided Ptech 's offices due to its ties to al - Qadi and others .
The very same day of the raid White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer declared the company and its software safe .
Mainstream news articles defending Ptech after the story broke , however , blithely admit that the company was informed of the raid weeks in advance , hoping perhaps that readers will not notice that his completely defeats the purpose of such a raid or calls into question its results .
Eventually , Michael Chertoff led an effort to give the FBI total control over Greenquest , leading to Customs officials accusing him of sabotaging the investigation .
No indictments were laid in the immediate aftermath of the Ptech raid against al - Qadi or anyone else related to the company .
Chertoff went on to become the head of Homeland Security .
The 9/11 Commission Report , obviously , does not mention Ptech .
Given the incredible information about this company and its links to Specially Designated Global Terrorist Yassin al - Qadi , this is perhaps surprising .
This startling omission becomes more ominous however , when it is understood that the 9/11 Commission co-chair , Thomas Kean , made $ 24 million dollars off a land deal with al - Qadi linked organization BMI .
For over a decade , investigations into Ptech , its employees and its investors have been stifled , suppressed or derailed by people in key positions .
But all of that finally changed this week .
A Break in the Case
On Wednesday the Boston Field Office of the FBI unsealed a 2007 indictment of Oussama Ziade , Ptech 's former CEO , and Buford George Peterson , the former CFO and COO .
The indictment charges that the pair knowingly lied to investigators about the extent of al - Qadi 's investments and ties with Ptech .
Another unsealed indictment , this one from 2005 , alleges Ziade attempted to engage in transactions involving al - Qadi 's property , a federal offence as al - Qadi was a Specially Designated Global Terrorist at the time .
If the pair are convicted on the charges , they face 30 years in prison and a $ 1 million fine .
Whether this represents a significant breakthrough in the case and the beginning of the official unraveling of the Ptech story will likely depend on whether political pressure is brought to bear by an informed public who are concerned with this story .
Given that the public has been whipped into cyber - hysteria over the North Korean figments of the government 's imagination , it will require the media to stop parroting the government 's talking points and begin informing the public about the very real , documentable links between terrorist financiers and the technological capability to override key emergency response systems on 9/11 .
Two questions remain to be answered : Did the real " cyber 9/11 " happen on 9/11 ?
And will the public care enough to demand the answer to that question ?
If the answer to either question is ' yes , ' concerned readers are advised to download the mp3 file of Episode 045 of The Corbett Report podcast , " Ptech and the 9/11 software , " and begin distributing it to others to bring awareness to this incredible story .

There 's a rumor going around that one of Scientology 's most powerful proponents , John Travolta , is looking to leave the draconian religion once and for all .
After the year he 's had , it would make sense .
According to the Daily Mail - who rounded up some interesting quotes on the matter - it appears to be a very real possibility .
To say Travolta 's had a rough go of it recently would be putting it very , very lightly .
On the business side of things , Travolta 's big role this year performed under studio expectations .
A complete aside , when you consider his personal life :
His son Jett - reportedly autistic , a diagnosis the Church of Scientology refuses to dignify - passed away earlier this year .
Travolta defied Scientology and acknowledged it .
Some sleazy gossip website put together a theory that enlists the idea of Travolta not only having a gay lover , but the gay lover - his son's nanny - being a primary cause of his son's death .
Which is besides the fact that someone tried to extort him over documents involved in his son's transportation , and his wife might 've tried ( successfully ) to get Roger Friedman fired by going to the top brass at Fox over Friedman 's comments on Scientology .
All of this gives the Daily Mail 's report some ground to walk on , when they note :
His distress , say sources close to him , has been compounded by the first cracks in his 34 - year relationship with the Church of Scientology , the cult - like religion of which Travolta is a prominent and generous benefactor .
And there are dark mutterings that if he carries out private threats to leave , the organisation will go public with embarrassing details of his private life , including , it is claimed , allegations of past homosexual relationships .
Sources in the U.S. disclosed to me this week that his son's sudden death has ' deeply shaken '
Travolta 's faith in the strange sect , which makes wild claims about its ability to cure a variety of physical and mental disorders .
There 's more talk of Travolta taking late night drives by himself , and being in a " state of constant distress . "
There 's the very evident weight Travolta 's gained .
There 's the memory of Scientology 's scary - ass leader David Miscavage slagging on Travolta 's sexuality :
Earlier , the prestigious
Time magazine also reported allegations made by Richard Aznaran , the former security head of Scientology , that the Church 's leader , David Miscavige , had repeatedly joked about Travolta 's ' promiscuous homosexual behaviour ' .
And then there 's the fact that Scientology has a well known history of intimidation of the physical and emotional stripe .
This goes without saying , but : Travolta 's donated millions of dollars , and what could only be thousands of hours to the church throughout his life .
Shit , he made Battlefield Earth .
For a celebrity of Travolta 's stature to renounce Scientology would be massive , for both parties .
Even rumors of Travolta 's potential departure from the religion are pretty damning .
Granted , it 'll be a difficult path if he chooses to take it - the resistance he 'll encounter from the highest levels of the religion are potentially fiscally , emotionally , and physically dangerous to his livelihood - but one that could shake Scientology to its absolute core .
Is John Travolta cracking up ?
[ Daily Mail ]
Microsoft yesterday confirmed that a single superfluous character in its own development code is responsible for the bug that has let hackers exploit Internet Explorer ( IE ) since early July .
A pair of German researchers who analyzed a vulnerability in a Microsoft - made ActiveX control came to the same conclusion three weeks ago .
" The bug is simply a typo , " Michael Howard , a principal security program manager in Microsoft 's security engineering and communications group , said in a post Tuesday to the Security Development Lifecycle ( SDL ) blog .
Howard , who is probably best known for co-authoring Writing Secure Code , went on to say that the typo -- an errant " & " character -- is the " core issue " in the MSVidCtl ActiveX control .
That video - streaming control was created by Microsoft using a modified version of an older edition of a code " library , " dubbed Active Template Library ( ATL ) , that Microsoft admitted Tuesday contained multiple vulnerabilities .
Also on Tuesday , Microsoft patched Visual Studio , the company 's development platform that contains ATL .
Those patches , however , do not automatically fix software that was developed using the buggy ATL .
Instead , vendors -- Microsoft as well as third - party firms -- must use the patched Visual Studio to recompile their code , then distribute the new , secure software to users .
Howard said that the bug in the MSVidCtl ActiveX control was introduced by an internal version of ATL , not one that was available to outside developers .
Others at Microsoft drew a direct line between the ATL bug Howard described to the public exploits hackers have been using for much of this month , including drive - by attacks conducted from thousands of compromised Web sites .
" This public exploit took advantage of the fact that MSVidCtl uses a modified version of vulnerable ATL headers , " said Fermin Serna , an engineer in the Microsoft Security Research Center ( MSRC ) , in a blog post earlier Tuesday .
" In this specific instance , the vulnerability allows an attacker to corrupt memory which may lead to a remote code execution , " added Serna .

10 Discourage Bible Reading
Misconception : The Church discourages Bible reading
The very first Christian Bible was produced by the Catholic Church ‚Äì compiled by Catholic scholars of the 2nd and 3rd century and approved for general Christian use by the Catholic Councils of Hippo ( 393 ) and Carthage ( 397 ) .
The very first printed Bible was produced under the auspices of the Catholic Church ‚Äì printed by the Catholic inventor of the printing press , Johannes Gutenberg .
And the very first Bible with chapters and numbered verses was produced by the Catholic Church ‚Äìthe work of Stephen Langton , Cardinal Archbishop of Canterbury .
At every Mass in the world everyday , the Bible is read aloud by the priest .
In the traditional Mass there is one reading from the general body of the Bible ( excluding the gospels ) , and two from the Gospels .
In the modern Catholic Mass , there are two readings from the general body of the Bible and one from the Gospels .
All Catholic homes have a Bible and the Bible is taught in Catholic schools ( as is its perennial tradition ) .
This myth has come about because Bibles were often locked away in Churches in the past , but that was not to prevent people having access ‚Äì it was to prevent them being stolen .
These were hand written Bibles which were incredibly valuable due to scarcity .
Furthermore , people think the Church forbade people from reading the Bible by putting it on the Index of Forbidden Books , but the Bibles placed on the Index were Protestant versions ( lacking 7 books ) or badly translated versions ‚Äì the most famous of which is the King James Version which Catholics are not supposed to use .
9 Idolatry
Misconception : Catholics worship Mary and are , therefore , committing idolatry
In Catholic theology there are three types of worship ‚Äì one of which is condemned in the Bible if offered to anyone but God :
1 ) Latria ‚Äì this is adoration which is given to God alone ‚Äì giving this type of worship to anyone else is considered to be a mortal sin and it is the idolatry condemned in the Bible .
2 ) Hyperdulia ‚Äì this is a special type of worship given to Mary the Mother of Jesus ‚Äì it is only given to her and it is not considered to be idolatory as it is not adoration , merely reverence .
3 ) Dulia ‚Äì this is the special type of worship given only to the saints and angels ‚Äì it is also not idolatrous as it , too , is a form of reverence .
The distinction was made by the 2nd Council of Nicaea in 787 AD .
The council was called to condemn the people who claimed that it was idolatrous to have statues and images of saints .
The canons of the Council can be read here .
Just to clarify : ‚Äú Latria is a Latin term ( from the Greek ??????? ) used in Orthodox and Catholic theology to mean adoration , which is the highest form of worship or reverence and is directed only to the Holy Trinity . ‚Äù ‚Äì there are lower forms of worship ( as is implied here ) .
A Catholic who may kneel in front of a statue while praying is n‚Äôt worshipping the statue or even praying to it , any more than the Protestant who kneels with a Bible in his hands when praying is worshipping the Bible or praying to it .
The images of saints ( whether it be in statue form or painting ) serves as a reminder of the holiness of the person depicted .
8 Non-Christians
Misconception : Catholics are n‚Äôt Christians
In fact , Catholics are the first Christians .
When reading over the early Christian writings , you can see clearly that their doctrines and teachings are the same as the Catholic Church today .
You hear of Bishops , virgins living in community ( nuns ) , priests , confession , baptism of infants , the Bishop of Rome as head of the Christian religion , and reverence for the saints .
Here are some comments by the early Church fathers who were , in many cases , the apostles of the Biblical apostles :
Bishops :
For it will be no light sin for us , if we thrust out those who have offered the gifts of the bishop ‚Äôs office unblamably and holily .
‚Äî Pope St Clement , Letter to the Corinthians 1 , A.D. 96 .
The Papacy : ‚Äú [ From ] Ignatius . . . to the church also which holds the presidency , in the location of the country of the Romans , worthy of God , worthy of honor , worthy of blessing , worthy of praise , worthy of success , worthy of sanctification , and , because you hold the presidency in love , named after Christ and named after the Father ‚Äù ( St Ignatius , Letter to the Romans 1:1 [ A.D. 110 ] ) .
Holy Communion : ‚Äú This food we call the Eucharist , of which no one is allowed to partake except one who believes that the things we teach are true , and has received the washing for forgiveness of sins and for rebirth , and who lives as Christ handed down to us .
For we do not receive these things as common bread or common drink ; but as Jesus Christ our Savior being incarnate by God ‚Äôs Word took flesh and blood for our salvation , so also we have been taught that the food consecrated by the Word of prayer which comes from him , from which our flesh and blood are nourished by transformation , is the flesh and blood of that incarnate Jesus . ‚Äù ‚Äî St. Justin Martyr , ‚Äú First Apology ‚Äù , A.D. 148-155 .
Infant Baptism : ‚Äú Baptize first the children , and if they can speak for themselves let them do so .
Otherwise , let their parents or other relatives speak for them ‚Äù ( St Hippolytus , The Apostolic Tradition 21:16 [ A.D. 215 ] ) .
Confession : ‚Äú [ A filial method of forgiveness ] , albeit hard and laborious [ is ] the remission of sins through penance , when the sinner . . . does not shrink from declaring his sin to a priest of the Lord and from seeking medicine , after the manner of him who say , ‚Äú I said , to the Lord , I will accuse myself of my iniquity . ‚Äù ‚Äù ( Origen , Homilies in Leviticus 2:4 ‚Äî A.D. 248 )
From these quotes it is obvious that the practices of the modern Catholic Church are the closest to the practices of the apostles and early Christians .
It should also be said that the majority of historians accept that the Catholic Church was the first Christian Church as it is verifiable from ancient texts .
7 Totally Infallible
Misconception : The Pope is infallible in all things
Roman Catholics believe that only under certain circumstances is the pope infallible ( that is , he can not make a mistake ) .
The Catholic Church defines three conditions under which the Pope is infallible :
I . The Pope must be making a decree on matters of faith or morals
II .
The declaration must be binding on the whole Church
III .
The Pope must be speaking with the full authority of the Papacy , and not in a personal capacity .
This means that when the Pope is speaking on matters of science , he can make errors ( as we have seen in the past with issues such as Heliocentricity ) .
However , when he is teaching a matter of religion and the other two conditions above are met , Catholics consider that the decree is equal to the Word of God .
It can not contradict any previous declarations and it must be believed by all Catholics .
Catholics believe that if a person denies any of these solemn decrees , they are committing a mortal sin ‚Äì the type of sin that sends a person to hell .
Here is an example of an infallible decree from the Council of Trent ( under Pope Saint Pius V ‚Äì 16th Century ) :
If anyone denies that in the sacrament of the most Holy Eucharist are contained truly , really and substantially the body and blood together with the soul and divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ , and consequently the whole Christ , but says that He is in it only as in a sign , or figure or force , let him be anathema .
The last section of the final sentence ‚Äú let him be anathema ‚Äù is a standard phrase that normally appears at the end of an infallible statement .
It means ‚Äú let him be cursed ‚Äù .
The most recent pronouncement that can be seen as falling under Papal Infallibility was when Pope John Paul II declared that women could not become priests .
6 Anti-Science
Misconception : The Catholic Church is opposed to science and rejects evolution
In fact , may great scientific advances have come about through Catholic scholarship and education .
The most recent and interesting case is that of Monsignor Georges Lema√Ætre ( pictured above , center ) a Belgian priest who proposed the Big Bang theory .
When he proposed his theory , Einstein rejected it , causing Monsignor Lema√Ætre to write to him : ‚Äú Your math is correct , but your physics is abominable . ‚Äù
Eventually Einstein came to accept the theory .
Also , unlike many of the American Protestant or evangelical religions , the Catholic Church does not reject the theory of evolution .
Right from the early days of the theory , the Church remained mostly silent on the issue .
The first public statements specifically regarding evolution came from Pope Pius XII who said : ‚Äú The Church does not forbid that ‚Ä¶research and discussions , on the part of men experienced in both fields , take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution , in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter . ‚Äù
In 2004 , a Theological Commission overseen by Cardinal Ratzinger ( now Pope Benedict XVI ) issued this statement : ‚Äú According to the widely accepted scientific account , the universe erupted 15 billion years ago in an explosion called the ‚Äò Big Bang ‚Äô and has been expanding and cooling ever since . [‚Ä¶ ]
Converging evidence from many studies in the physical and biological sciences furnishes mounting support for some theory of evolution to account for the development and diversification of life on earth , while controversy continues over the pace and mechanisms of evolution . ‚Äù
Catholic Schools all around the world ( including the US ) teach scientific evolution as part of their science curriculum .
5 Indulgences
Misconception : Indulgences let you pay to have your sins forgiven
First of all we need to understand what an indulgence is .
The Catholic Church teaches that when a person sins , they get two punishments : eternal ( hell ) and temporal ( punishment on earth while alive , or in purgatory after death ) .
To remove the eternal punishment of hell , a person must confess their sins and be forgiven .
But the temporal punishment remains .
To remove the temporal punishment a person can receive an indulgence .
This is a special ‚Äú blessing ‚Äù in which the temporal punishment is removed if a person performs a special act such as doing good deeds or reading certain prayers .
In the Middle ages , forgers who were working for disobedient Bishops would write fake indulgences offering the forgiveness of sins ( removal of eternal punishment ) in exchange for money which was often used for church building .
Popes had been long trying to end the abuse but it took at least three centuries for the sale of indulgences to finally end .
True indulgences existed from the beginning of Christianity and the Church continues to grant special indulgences today .
Wikipedia has an excellent and honest article on the abuse of indulgences from the Middle Ages .
You can read it here .
Here is a BBC article on a new indulgence granted by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007 .
4 Emperor Constantine
Misconception : Emperor Constantine invented the Catholic Church in 325 AD
In 313 AD , Emperor Constantine announced toleration of Christianity in the Edict of Milan , which removed penalties for professing Christianity .
At the age of 40 he converted to Christianity and in 325 he convened the first ecumenical Council of Nicaea .
Because of the importance of this council , many people believe that Constantine created the Church , but in fact there had been many councils ( though not as large ) prior to Nicaea and the structure of the Church already existed .
Constantine was at the council merely as an observer and the Bishops and representative of the Pope made all of the decisions .
Before the council of Nicaea , priestly celibacy was already the norm , baptism of infants was practiced ( as were all 7 sacraments ) , and the structure of priests and Bishops was already 300 years old .
3 Priestly Celibacy
Misconception : Catholic Priests can‚Äôt get married
This has appeared on a previous list , but it is well worth including it here as well .
In order to clear this one up , we need to first understand the nature of the Catholic Church .
Within the universal Church there are sections ( also called churches but not in the sense that they are separate ) ‚Äì the most common one is , of course , the Roman ( or Latin ) Catholic Church .
Then there is the Eastern Catholic Church ( not to be confused with the Orthodox which is a different religion ) .
Both of these churches fall under the jurisdiction of the Pope and all believe the same doctrines .
There are a lot of differences between the two groups but these are all in matters of style of worship and certain rules .
In the Eastern Church , priests are allowed to be married ‚Äì but a married priest ca n‚Äôt become a Bishop .
It also happens that occasionally in the Latin Church , pastors who convert from other religions such as the Church of England are allowed to become priests even though they are married , so married priests can be found in all parts of the Roman Catholic Church .
Pictured above is a Greek Catholic priest and his wife .
Do n‚Äôt believe me ?
Here is proof .
And here is more proof .
2 Modified Bible
Misconception : The Church added books to the Bible
The Catholic version of the Old Testament differs from the Protestant version in that the Catholic edition contains seven more books than Protestant Bibles .
These ‚Äú extra ‚Äù books are the reason that many people consider the Church to have added to the Bible , but in fact these books were considered the official canon ( list of books ) by all Christians until the Protestant reformation during which Martin Luther ( leader of the revolution ) removed them .
Interestingly some of these books contain affirmations of Catholic doctrines which Luther rejected .
The reason that the Catholic Church uses the Greek edition is because the apostles used it exclusively in their preaching .
Luther decided to use the Jewish Masoretic canon ( circa 700 ‚Äì 1000 AD ) instead of the Apostolic canon .
The seven books he removed were : Tobit , Judith , 1 Maccabees , 2 Maccabees , Wisdom , Ecclesiasticus , and Baruch .
While initially wanting to remove at least one book ( The Epistle of James , because it contradicts Luther ‚Äôs teaching that faith alone is needed for salvation [ James Chapter 2 ] ) from the New Testament , Luther ultimately decided to keep the Catholic New Testament in full .
Interestingly , Hanukah is mentioned only in 1 and 2 Maccabees , which is not included in either the Jewish or Protestant versions of the Old Testament .
1 Medieval Papacy
Misconception : The Papacy is a medieval invention
The Pope is the Bishop of Rome , and from the beginning of Christianity he was considered the head of the Church .
This fact is alluded to in many of the early Church documents and even in the Bible itself : ‚Äú And I say to thee : That thou art Peter [ Greek for ‚Äú rock ‚Äù ] ; and upon this rock I will build my church ‚Äù ( Matthew 16:18 ) .
Peter was the first Bishop of Rome and he led the Church until his death in 64 AD , at which point St Linus became the second Pope .
St Irenaeus mentions him here :
The blessed apostles , then , having founded and built up the Church , committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate [ office of Bishop of Rome ] .
Of this Linus , Paul makes mention in the Epistles to Timothy [ 2 Timothy 4:21 ] .
To him succeeded Anacletus [ third Pope , pictured above ] ; and after him , in the third place from the apostles , Clement [ 4th Pope ] was allotted the bishopric .
‚Äî Against the Heresies , 180 AD
St Irenaeus goes on to mention another six Popes and the various tasks they undertook during their reigns ‚Äì such as the imposition by Pope Linus of the rule that women cover their heads in Church ( a rule which , though often ignored , still exists today ) .
UPDATE 6/4/09
I have been advised to make some changes / updates to this post .
I will be editing any / all instances where one could construe my opinion for fact , and placing the word alleged , or allegedly in a very clear manner .
Furthermore , I do apologize if anyone in the course of reading this article took my opinion as fact ..
Please note that the only fact is that after watching the video , my first instinct was to do a google search for Bob Reina Scam or Talk Fusion Scam which turned up enough results for me to be concerned for my friend who paid for this service and was trying to get me to join .
Here is a list of things you should consider checking into before purchasing / joining the Talk Fusion solution / team .
In no way am I insinuating that these questions are representative of fact ‚Ä¶ you should ask yourself these types of questions before making a decision to purchase any type product , or becoming a business ‚Äú partner ‚Äù with any company !
Do they accurately represent their product in their selling points ?
Does their refund policy provide me with any protection if I do not like the service ?
Does the Patriot Act require me to give out my Mother ‚Äôs maiden name ?
Does this company have a solid reputation ?
Can I really make a million dollars if I do this ?
What would Jesus do ?
UPDATE 6/3/09
I have been contacted by the Talk Fusion Attorney ‚Äôs requesting that I remove this post .
Attached is the letter from his Attorney , as well as the rebuttal by Mr. Reina .
I will not be removing this post unless I have a court order , but I will be updating it accordingly as things progress .
I do find it interesting that they find it necessary to call me at work and include my employer in the letter address ‚Ä¶ they could have easily gone to http://whois.sc/jakebohall.com and obtained my personal contact information .
Later ‚Äì Just in case anyone was wondering , I received a ‚Äú video ‚Äù email that had a screenshot of this page with a link ( to a page very similar to this one ) ‚Äì http://app.talkfusion.com/talkFusionStudio/answer/viewsolution.asp?OTg5NA==_332001_1
I ‚Äôm using a different page so as to protect the innocence of the ‚Äú agent ‚Äù who initially brought this to my attention .
‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
UPDATE 6/1/09
I received a call from Bob Reina today .
He was trying to give me a friendly warning / chance to remove this post , as he claims it to be slanderous to his name / business .
In all fairness , I think it is important to say that I personally have no knowledge / proof that this is any type of scam , and I wrote the script above as a satirical piece strictly to express my opinions .
FYI to the world .. this is my blog .. this is my opinion ‚Ä¶
Bob informed me that one of his 2 attorneys will be sending me a letter to take it down , and that will be followed by a suponea to appear in court in Florida .
I did invite Mr. Reina to leave any comments he wishes on this site , and to please correct me in any area that I may be wrong .
Since I do think there are aspects of Talk Fusion that are questionable .. such as the fact that they allegedly do n‚Äôt actually send a video email , and thats what they allegedly claim to do ‚Ä¶ and they seem to be allegedly pushing some type of MLM .. and they ask for your Mothers Maiden name ( which Mr. Reina explained he has to do by law under the Patriot Act ) I ‚Äôm leaving this article here to encourage anyone researching this topic to do some digging on their own .
‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Original Post
So , to explain the cat video from Friday ..
I was contacted by a client / prospect who ‚Äôs son had just allegedly signed him up for Talk Fusion , and I was trying to explain the concept of clicking a link from an email , and landing on a webpage .
I was going to create a video to prove my point , but decided that it was n‚Äôt worth my time .. and I failed in trying to upload it :.(
I thought it would be fun to share the script we wrote though , just for the hell of it .
Please note that I think the simplicity in using Talk Fusion to upload a video , and quickly send out a link to a formatted page with the video embedded is pretty cool .
I just have major beefs with the entire money side of the business .. the whole MLM ( multi - level marketing ) and Pyramid scheme alleged nature of Talk Fusion and Bob Reina .
I wish they would relaunch / rebrand the service , or sell it to a company like iContact so the simple nature can be used without all the alleged negativity being associated with it .
Here ‚Äôs that transcript ( if someone wants to make the video , I ‚Äôll post it ) :
HI !!!
my name is Jake , and I ‚Äôm here today to tell you how easy it is to send out video emails .
Some of you may ask yourselves : ‚Äú Why would I listen to you , Jake , when I can spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars getting a service like Talk Fusion to create a video for me ? ‚Äù
The short answer : my way is free and does n‚Äôt involve having to ask everyone you know if they want to be part of an alleged marketing scheme .
There are no upfront fees , no monthly fees , and no crippling guilt that keeps you up at night wondering how things went so horribly wrong .
So how can something so complex as sending a video email be done for free ?
Simple ‚Ä¶ YOUTUBE .. this groundbreaking technology allows users to upload and host videos for FREE .
McDonalds is in business today because nobody has started a burger joint that gives the sandwhiches away for free ‚Ä¶
What is more amazing is that youtube has a proven duplication technique that allows your friends and their friends to upload their videos for free as well .. the exact same strategy that Ray Crok used to build McDonalds ‚Ä¶ hell , even strangers can do it .
You may be asking yourself .. why would I use this FREE Youtube service which is the largest video hosting site on the internet and owned by major business giant Google instead of paying money to use a service allegedly owned by Bob Reina , who has an alleged reputation of scamming people ?
Another short answer ‚Ä¶ because its smart .
How easy is it to signup for youtube ?
Just give them an email address and password .
How easy is it to sign up for talk fusion ?
Just give them your name address , social , mothers maiden name , and credit card number ‚Ä¶ why do they need your mothers maiden name again ?
What about those pretty landing pages that Talk Fuzion gives you that lets you put your branding around the video ?
Youtube does n‚Äôt have that ..
You ‚Äôre right , youtube just gives you the ability to put the videos on your own website , or frankly wherever you want without having to send traffic to a talk fusion website .. oh youtubes , thats so smart .
But talk fuzion is allegedly about sending video emails ‚Ä¶. right ??
WRONG .. talk fuzion allegedly sends a picture that looks like a video , and when a user clicks on it , it takes you to a webpage that hosts the video ‚Ä¶
This is because you cannot send video in an email ‚Ä¶ they are allegedly lying .
If you are n‚Äôt a technical minded person , or if you ‚Äôre not familiar with how marketing schemes work , you might think this is a business opportunity waiting to happen ..
i tell my friends , they send me money , and in 8 months I have a million dollars ..
The only person that works for is the person at the top of the multi - level marketing scheme , everyone else gets screwed .
So .. what do we do now ?
Well , you can stop sending out these alleged fake video emails , and you can try to protect your friends from being victims by raising awareness .
If you send this video to your friends , you wo n‚Äôt make any money , but you might save your friends some .
Lastly , remember the rules of a pyramid / mlm scheme ..
If you pay money so you can convince other people to pay money , and in the process you are giving away something that can be had for free ‚Ä¶ you are a part of this broken , and often criminal system .
You may have heard of systems like ASD Cash Generator , and Bernie Madoff ‚Äôs system that made many people millions of dollars .
What do they both have in common ?
People paid in to the scheme and some people made a lot of money , but others did n‚Äôt .
They have one more thing in common , they both have faced criminal charges in court .
If you still love Talk Fusion , let me point your to their refund policy .
They allegedly offer a full refund ( minus fees of course ) if you cancel within 3 days ..
It is important to note that they alledgedly require 5 days written notice to cancel the service ..
So , if you just curious , send in a cancellation letter , and then 2 days later signup for the service ‚Ä¶

Which do people fixate on most when assessing women ‚Äôs physical attractiveness ‚Äî the stomach or the hips ?
As I discuss in BLONDES , weight , as estimated by body mass index ( BMI ) , and curves , as measured by waist - to - hip ratio ( WHR ) , are two major factors when assessing women ‚Äôs bodily attractiveness .
Which matters more is a point of contention between various experts .
A new study led by University of York psychologist Piers Cornelissen tries to settle the argument .
Implementing a novel way of tracking eye movements , Cornelissen asked male and female volunteers to rate nearly 50 photos of women .
The longer their gaze rested on a particular body region , the more that region counted .
There ‚Äôs a strong argument that curves should matter more than weight when evaluating attractiveness .
A low WHR ‚Äî a relatively thin waist to hip ratio ‚Äî suggests something about a woman ‚Äôs hormonal status .
Estrogen increases the deposition of body fat on the hips thighs , and bust .
Higher estrogen is linked with higher fertility .
But those are n‚Äôt the body regions that people fixate on when they look at you , according to Cornellisen ‚Äôs experiment .
The stomach apparently has the most impact .
When judging attractiveness , both sexes appear to settle their gaze on the central torso , an area that reveals much about a person ‚Äôs overall body mass , and not the pelvic and hip areas .
This outcome , according to the psychologists , suggests that body mass index is more important in assessing physical attractiveness than curviness .
The study is not conclusive .
It ‚Äôs possible that WHR is assessed more quickly than body mass , which could be why people fixate longer on the torso .
Or perhaps the study participants , aware that their eye movements are tracked , are abashed to linger on the pelvic region of the models .
The central torso is also quite close to the bust .
Still , it ‚Äôs another study that falls definitively in the body mass - over - curves camp .
And perhaps it helps explain the new rage in stomach - cinchers .
Just a tiny snippet of almost - news before bed .
Valve have slipped out the information ( via IGN ) that joining Left 4 Dead 2 ‚Äôs arsenal of melee weapons is a cricket bat .
The awfully British sports - stick will be yet another way to brutally smash zombies out of your path .
Having previously played with both the axe and the frying pan , I can assure you that the melee combat is something pretty special .
With the freshly regioned bodies of the Horde , taking aim before lashing out brings gruesome rewards .
While no one ‚Äôs seen the cricket racquet in action , it seems safe to assume that aiming at legs is going to produce something dreadful .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Secret files of Communist East Germany ‚Äôs Stasi security police were sent to a film set for use as props , triggering an investigation into how such sensitive documents were obtained .
The authenticity of the files were revealed when 15 former political prisoners were being filmed for a docu-play called ‚Äú Staats - Sicherheit ‚Äù ( State Security ) by public broadcaster ZDF .
‚Äú It ‚Äôs just unbelievable that something like this could happen , ‚Äù CDU politician and former East German civil rights activist Vera Lengsfeld told Reuters .
‚Äú This must be cleared up right away . ‚Äù
One of the ‚Äú prop ‚Äù files was actually the genuine file of one of the actors .
The German government ‚Äôs agency that looks after the Stasi archives said they had began a probe into how the files were obtained without authorization .
The Birthler agency said it had also immediately ordered the Babelsberg studio to restrict access to safeguard the files .
‚Äú We ‚Äôre investigating how these documents got into public hands , ‚Äù said agency spokesman Steffen Mayer .
He said a prop firm delivered the documents to the studio and it was assumed the files were fakes to protect the identities of the victims .
Lengsfeld , who spent time in jail in East Germany as a political prisoner , was one of the 15 political prisoners the film centers around .
She said she did not think it was a coincidence real files surfaced on the film set .
She believes former Stasi employees now work at the Birthler agency .
‚Äú There were even real Stasi files from people who were n‚Äôt in the production being casually tossed about , ‚Äù said Lengsfeld , who called it ‚Äú scandalous ‚Äù the documents were freely available .
After German unification Lengsfeld discovered her husband had been a Stasi informant .
She then divorced him .
Among the files that surfaced on the film set were documents about one of the film ‚Äôs actors , Mario Roellig .
Roellig was arrested by the Stasi after a failed attempt to flee East Germany in 1987 .
‚Äú I was just stunned when I saw them , ‚Äù Roellig told the Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper .
Also found were genuine Stasi files about a famous East German Rock musician and an artist , Lengsfeld said .

Some of the most entertaining , informative and mind - blowing science videos on the web come from TED ‚Äì the Technology , Entertainment , Design conference .
Challenged to give the ‚Äú talk of their lives , ‚Äù the world ‚Äôs top scientists and science communicators have been dazzling audiences ‚Äì many of whom are thought leaders , trend - setters and entertainers - for years now .
Most of the best talks are now freely available on the internet , but sifting through hundreds of video clips to find the real gems can be hard going .
To make things easier , here are five of my favorite TED Talks on science .
The selection rules were simple :
- Was I engaged within the first few seconds ? -
Was I entertained , inspired and challenged ? -
Would my kids understand the talk ?
and - Together , do they tell a story ?
1. Crochet coral and complex math
What on earth do coral , complex mathematics and the craft of crochet have in common ?
Plenty , according to science writer Margaret Wertheim , who shows how crocheting a ‚Äú coral reef ‚Äù can help make sense of some really tricky math , while drawing attention to distressed coral reefs around the world .
Stunningly inventive .
2. Beyond Evolution - Engineering Biology
Four billion years of evolution have led to organisms that can reproduce , survive the harshest environments , and convert simple chemicals into complex ones .
Tapping into this ‚Äú natural technology ‚Äù is an engineer ‚Äôs dream ‚Äì but is it possible ?
Genomics pioneer and science maverick Craig Venter says it is .
Venter envisions a future where we program biology the way we program computers now .
3. Life On Mars ?
Is there life on other planets ?
If there is , how would we find it ?
Controversial , eloquent , thoroughly engaging , Penelope Boston talks about the possibility of finding life on Mars and elsewhere in the Solar System .
4. Recreating the Universe ‚Äôs Beginnings
Why are scientists so excited about smashing subatomic particles together at near - light velocities ?
Physicist and ex rock - star Brian Cox explains why the Large Hadron Collider in Europe ‚Äì part of the largest physics experiment in history ‚Äì is far more than an extra in Dan Brown ‚Äôs Angels and Demons .
Okay so I ‚Äôm a fellow physicist , but I still found Brian ‚Äôs talk stunning .
5 . Is this our last century ?
Finally , the big picture .
Sir Martin Reese ‚Äì Astronomer Royal , President of the Royal Society and author of the book Our Final Hour ‚Äì presents an expansive perspective on humanity ‚Äôs place in the universe , and asks what our future might hold .
These five TED talks on science tell a story about the complexity of the universe and our place in it .
And they do it with panache ‚Äì no boring science lectures here !
What ‚Äôs more , there ‚Äôs plenty more where they came from .
If you have other favorite TED science talks , please feel free to share them in the comments .

A man from Ohio was recently sentenced to 15 months in prison after being convicted of " hacking " for using his work computer to look at pornography and upload nude photos of himself to adult websites .
Advertisement
In the span of 5 months , Richard Wolf spent approximately 100 work hours using his work computer for personal use , which included looking at ‚Äî and uploading ‚Äî nude photos , none of which were actually of people engaging in sexual acts .
His superiors said during that time , Wolf 's job performance never suffered and he always managed to complete all of his duties on time .
However , after it was discovered that Wolf was accessing inappropriate content at work , he was investigated by the police and later charged for hacking his work computer .
The current Ohio hacking law states that " No person , in any manner and by any means , including , but not limited to , computer hacking , shall knowingly gain access ... to any computer ... without the consent of , or beyond the scope of the express or implied consent of , the owner of the computer ... or other person authorized to give consent . "
Although he was given consent to use the computer , the court believes that Wolf 's personal activities constituted as " beyond the scope of the express or implied consent , " thus being able to prosecute him with a hacking conviction .

Wolf 's lawyer pointed out that a major reason why Wolf 's situation was handled so severely was because of the content he was looking at his computer .
If Wolf had been looking at videos of cats riding on Roombas , for instance , he would not be in the predicament he is in now .
However , due to the sexual nature of the content , the court is treating it somewhat like they would a sex offense .
As of now , Wolf has been sentenced to 15 months in jail and has been fined $ 5,000 among other restitutions .

The music wo n‚Äôt stop for Internet radio after a group of webcasters struck an agreement with SoundExchange , the organization that collects royalties for musicians and record companies , over payments for playing music online .
The settlement ends a 2 1/2 - year - old dispute that had threatened to silence the nascent Internet radio business and had forced some people who started online stations as a hobby to quit for fear of accruing expensive royalty bills .
The deal is part of a series of agreements made this year that cover various sectors of the industry , including small webcasters and conventional radio stations that simulcast their broadcasts online , and have resolved much of the controversy .
Tuesday ‚Äôs settlement allows websites that stream music to avoid per-song royalty payments that were set in 2007 by a special federal court and that many Internet radio sites said would force them out of business .
Instead , Pandora Media Inc. and other large webcasters can choose an alternative rate structure that allows them to pay lower per-song royalties or 25 % of their revenue -- a major break , given that many webcasters do n‚Äôt make much money yet .
Advertisement
‚Äú If the rates were n‚Äôt resolved , we were sunk .
So this is a huge relief , ‚Äù said Tim Westergren , co-founder of Pandora , the Oakland , Calif. , webcaster that has about 30 million registered users .
The company forecasts $ 40 million in revenue this year and hopes to become profitable next year , he said .
The new per-song rates start at 0.08 of a cent per listener for each song played and rise to 0.14 of a cent in 2015 , when the agreement ends .
The rates set in 2007 by the Copyright Royalty Board started at 0.0762 of a cent but were to more than double to 0.19 of a cent by 2010 .
Under the new agreement , large webcasters pay whichever is greater , the per-song fee or 25 % of their revenue .
Smaller commercial webcasters -- those with $ 1.25 million or less in total revenue -- would pay between 10 % and 14 % of their sales or 7 % of their expenses , whichever is greater .
‚Äú It ‚Äôs a substantial reduction in the per-song streaming fee , and that was really the crux of the problem for us , ‚Äù said Westergren , who has been a leading voice in the fight against the royalty rates .
The Copyright Royalty Board allows SoundExchange to negotiate different rates on behalf of the musicians and record labels .
And legislation passed by Congress allows a deal struck with one webcaster to apply to any others that want to accept it .

Tuesday ‚Äôs deal was struck with three webcasters -- AccuRadio , Radio IO and Digitally Imported , said John Simson , executive director of SoundExchange .
The Digital Media Assn. , which represents webcasters and other online media providers , said it was pleased with the agreement and expected some of its members to opt for the deal .
The agreement will help Internet radio grow , said Paul Krasinski , chief executive of Ando Media , an Internet radio tracking company .
SoundExchange came to agreements this year with the National Assn. of Broadcasters , which represents over - the - air radio stations , and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , which represents public radio stations .
It also struck a deal with small webcasters .
But rates for large ones , such as Pandora , were unresolved until Tuesday .
The deal is retroactive to 2006 and extends through 2015 .
‚Äú We were able to come up with an interesting , experimental approach , ‚Äù said Simson , whose organization includes major record labels such as Sony BMG Music Entertainment and Warner Music Group as well as independent labels .
‚Äú We ‚Äôre still in a developing business , so we said , ‚Äò Let ‚Äôs try something that gives us a really nice upside if they ‚Äôre successful . ‚Äô ‚Äù
Advertisement
The agreement works for ‚Äú pureplay ‚Äù webcasters -- those that simply play music , often supported by advertisements .
Those sites may have very low revenue while the Internet radio model continues to evolve .
Websites that stream music but also sell other products wo n‚Äôt find the deal so appealing because they must pay a percentage of all their revenue , Simson said .

A handful of Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) executives has emerged as the company 's new crop of leaders as expectations grow that Chief Executive Steve Jobs will take a less active role when he returns from medical leave later this month .
Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook , who has assumed Jobs ' day - to - day responsibilities since the Apple co-founder went on leave in January , and senior vice president for marketing Phil Schiller , who has stood in for Jobs at several important company functions , are the most visible stars on Apple 's deep bench .
Others include Scott Forstall , who runs Apple 's iPhone software operations , and Jonathan Ive , who heads the team that designs Apple 's sleek products .
These and other members of Apple 's management team took on new importance over the weekend after The Wall Street Journal reported that Jobs , a pancreatic cancer survivor , had gotten a liver transplant .
Jobs is credited with being the visionary behind products like the iPod music player and the iPhone smart phone , both of which helped resurrect a once - pioneering computer company that had fallen on hard times .
Analysts say that giving some of these executives responsibilities that used to be Jobs ' wo n't disrupt the company .
That 's because the executives have worked with Jobs for years and learned from him .
" All of Apple 's top management uses the ' What would Steve do ? ' mantra , " said Tim Bajarin , president of Creative Strategies Inc. , who has tracked Apple for decades .
" That would continue to be the case even if Steve was not there to guide them in person . "
An Apple spokesman had no immediate comment for this story .
Jobs also sits on the board of Walt Disney Co. ( DIS ) and became its largest shareholder in early 2006 when it agreed to acquire Pixar Animation Studios , where Jobs served as chairman and chief executive .
Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger has said he frequently consults Jobs on business decisions , and Jobs helps oversee the company 's animation businesses with a seat on a special six - man steering committee .
So the new revelations about his health situation could lead to more questions about Jobs ' ability to perform his duties at the media giant .
Disney did n't respond to an inquiry for this story , but its chairman , John Pepper , was questioned about the issue at Disney 's annual shareholders meeting in March after Jobs was a no - show .
" We have not thought at all of the contingency of Steve not being on this board , " Pepper said .
" Our only thoughts are with him and his rapid recovery . "
Already , Apple has demonstrated that it can function smoothly without Jobs ' presence .
Its latest iPhone , introduced last week , is outpacing sales expectations and has gotten rave reviews .
Meanwhile , the company has delivered two quarters of Wall Street - pleasing results .
And even without Jobs , Apple shares have surged 75 % from a 52 - week low hit in late January .
On Monday , Apple shares fell 1.5 % to $ 137.37 .
Cook is the most visible of Apple 's stars , establishing himself as the CEO - in - waiting since taking over for Jobs .
Cook joined Apple in 1998 as senior vice president of operations , and four years later was promoted to executive vice president of worldwide sales and operations .
He was promoted to senior vice president of operations in 2002 .
In 2004 , his responsibilities were expanded to include Apple 's Macintosh division .
He was named COO in October 2005 .
Cook and Jobs are the tech industry 's odd couple .
Cook is known for being easygoing , and Jobs ' edginess is legendary .
While Jobs is Apple 's brilliant idea man , Cook is an operations wizard who turns those visions into reality .
Cook 's ability to make Apple 's sprawling operations move on time has many observers betting he 'll be appointed CEO when and if Jobs takes a diminished role upon his return .
The Wall Street Journal has also reported he may be appointed to Apple 's board as well .
" He 's as intense as Steve is , but with a different style , " said Michael Janes , who worked at Apple for five years under Cook and Jobs , and now runs online ticket bazaar FansSnap.com
Schiller , who went to work for Apple in 1997 , is now responsible for Apple 's product marketing , developer relations and business marketing programs .
Forstall is arguably in charge of the company 's most important product : the software that runs the iPhone .
He joined Apple about 11 years ago and was one of the original architects of Apple 's Mac OS X operating system software and , most recently , worked on Mac OS X Leopard .
Ive , a Londoner , has also been making lots of appearances at Apple events .
His team is responsible for designing the look and feel of Apple products , which are widely considered to be among the most aesthetically pleasing in the tech space .

( This is a translation of a blog entry in Swedish from June 14th , which was the hitherto most read article since the blog started in 2003 . )
Now that the Swedish Pirate Party has got their 7 percent of the voters in the Swedish election for the European Parliament , I suppose it is time to write something about their goal , as it is presented in the party program .
Apparently , the party toned down its agitation in the file sharing issue before the election , and focused on the topic of personal integrity and privacy .
This was probably , from their point of view , a good strategy .
Otherwise , the party would probably to a much larger extent than now have been associated with selfish people who just want to safeguard their free - of - charge access to entertainment .
What they say in privacy issues is much easier to agree with , even if not everything on this point is opposition - free either .
It is somewhat tragicomical to see representatives of the more conventional parties ( Mr. Reinfeldt seems to be an exception ‚Äì in Swedish ) lie flat before the Pirate Party ‚Äôs electoral success , those who normally talk about the ideology basis , long - term vision , the courage to go against the tide and the aversion to populism .
Hanna Dun√©r writes in Svenska Dagbladet ( in Swedish ) that such superficial PR campaigns hardly fool anyone .
The day before , Thomas G√ºr wrote ( in Swedish ) that these issues are important , and although he does n‚Äôt say it explicitly , one senses that he believes these questions would be worth a better party .
P. J. Anders Linder is on to something similar in his column .
In the rest of this article , I will quote several paragraphs from the program of the Swedish Pirate Party ( version 3.3 , 7 - 8 March 2009 ) and add my comments ( the translations here are mine , note that there is also a more official English version that differs somewhat from the Swedish program text ) :
We live in a surveillance society where virtually everybody is being registered and monitored .
It is not compatible with a community founded on the rule of law to have all citizens subject to surveillance , and thereby treating them as crime suspects .
Democracy presumes a strong protection of privacy [ the Swedish term is literally ‚Äò personal integrity ‚Äô / KET ] .
I can broadly agree with this .
One question , however , concerns who it is that is watching us .
Is it only the state ( Big Brother ) or are we also exposing ourselves to the inspection from other citizens ( little brothers ) , including such things as stalking , sexual harassment , or identity theft ( a better word for this phenomenon is , by the way , ‚Äù identity cloning ‚Äù ) ?
It is curious to see the same slogan being reused again today , that was used more than ten years ago when the suggested Personal Data Act was debated .
At that time , many ‚Äù netizens ‚Äù protested under the slogan ‚Äù Do n‚Äôt touch my Internet ‚Äù and the like , but then the fire was directed against the Data Inspection Board and those who wanted statutory protection of privacy .
By many , this was considered more or less unnecessary .
Today , the same slogan is used among those who defend illegal file - sharing and oppose the FRA law ( a Swedish internet traffic surveillence law passed in 2008 ) .
This time , the protesters got support from the Data Inspection Board ‚Äôs report on the draft legislation .
So it goes .
I was called to a hearing in the Swedish Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Constitution in 1998 and delivered a short speech in which I claimed that it was important to safeguard transparency , which we have been accustomed to for a couple of hundred years , through our famous Freedom of the Press Act ( dating from 1766 ) .
In other debates at that time I claimed that the Internet would be almost impossible to use for publishing , since the Personal Data Act prohibited the handling of personal data , and these were defined as ‚Äù any kind of information which directly or indirectly may be associated with a natural person who is living ‚Äù .
Then we will soon be able to write only about ‚Äù the lilies of the field ‚Äù , I argued .
Most commentators felt that the talk about threats to privacy was exaggerated .
I was one of pretty few who tried to emphasize both the need for transparency and the need for protection of privacy .
The question then is , to what extent can we expect the state to provide such protection ?
Probably as much online as in the rest of society .
Hopefully we will get a decent protection from the police and other authorities , but we must also be vigilant ourselves and avoid exposure to unnecessary risks , for example by leaving our front doors unlocked .
We must , however , also learn to lock our virtual front doors on the web .
At the same time , we also need protection against possible abuse of power by authorities , such as law enforcement lacking in proportionality .
This is , of course , important both online and in the rest of society .
( I have written quite extensively ‚Äì in Swedish ‚Äì about the FRA - law in this blog entry . )
Copyright was created to benefit society by encouraging the creation , development and dissemination of culture .
To achieve these goals , a balance is needed between society ‚Äôs demands for access and dissemination and the author ‚Äôs requirements for recognition and remuneration .
We believe that today ‚Äôs copyright is out of balance .
A society where culture and knowledge are free and accessible to all on equal terms benefits all of society .
We argue that a widespread and systematic abuse of today ‚Äôs copyright actively counteract these aims by limiting both the supply of culture and the access to culture .
The first sentence above is fairly accurate .
Many people believe that copyright law was created to enrich individual cultural practitioners ( in the beginning it was all about writers ) .
Already from the outset , however , social benefit was the first priority for legislators .
( Even many of the odious privileges of the guild system were granted only if they were considered to have social utility . )
In the case of copyright , legislation was the result of the ending of both printers ‚Äô privilege and of censorship .
The proponents of the new law argued that if authors from now on should be responsible for what they wrote after publication ( and thus evade pre-publishing censorship ) , they should not only have to accept the risk of being thrown in jail if they did something bad , but also be able to enjoy the fruits of their work if they did something well .
That is , they should get exclusive rights to what they themselves created , for a limited time .
English caricaturist John Collier published several graphic prints using the pen name Tim Bobbin .
Here is ‚Äù A Rap at the Pyrates ‚Äù from 1773 .
A victimized writer flees upstairs while pirate printers are dealing with stacks of prints .
The text accompanying the image says : ‚Äù ‚Ä¶ tho some look wondrous prim , / They ‚Äôre thieves alike ; and all have robb ‚Äôd poor Tim . /
Now since the partial Law no man relieves / Against these Pyrates , tho ‚Äô the worst of Thieves . ‚Äù
Today ‚Äôs copyright is out of balance , the Pirate Party claims .
Yes , I can agree with that .
The basic principles are judicious , but often the practice of the law has become skewed , and important exceptions to the law has unfortunately begun to erode .
This is a fact when it comes to the right to quote , and the so - called public domain is constantly threatened by ad hoc based extensions of the copyright term .
Here lies , in my view , what might be called ‚Äù abuse of today ‚Äôs copyright . ‚Äù
When the Pirate Party writes this , there is unfortunately no further specification as to what is meant by that .
‚Äù A society where culture and knowledge are free and accessible to all on equal terms benefits all of society , ‚Äù according to the party .
This depends on how it is to be interpreted .
If you believe that culture should be free of charge for all , problems arise immediately .
Who should pay the creators of cultural works for their effort ?
The state ?
If , on the other hand , you believe that culture should be free in the sense uncensored , it is easy to agree .
Per Str√∂mb√§ck , a representative of the computer games industry , wrote in Svenska Dagbladet ( June 13 ) : ‚Äù To disseminate one ‚Äôs own expression is one thing , but to disseminate someone else ‚Äôs , without permission , is something quite different . ‚Äù
There is also another aspect ; that , for example , out - of - print books , CDs , etc. still may be made available in some way .
Naturally , it is a problem for the further development of culture , as well as for research and education , if important source texts suddenly become unobtainable .
One could envisage a reform of copyright law , where works which have not to been re-issued for a certain period , will be free for anyone to publish .
Certain times and certain countries have had this kind of legislation before .
Another problem are the so - called orphan works , the kind where the author is unknown or impossible to find .
The Swedish Radio and the Swedish Television ( both public service companies ) have difficulties to get permission to re-broadcast or sell old radio and television programs because of this .
Fortunately , amendments to the legislation is at hand , I believe .
Private monopolies are among society ‚Äôs most dangerous enemies .
This is because it leads to excessive prices and large hidden costs to citizens .
Patents are officially sanctioned monopolies of ideas .
Large companies fight feverishly to break the record in number of patents , which they often use against smaller competitors in order to make them unable to compete with the larger company .
The aim of a monopolist is not to maintain the market price and compete on equal terms with customer benefit , price and quality .
On the contrary , patent law is used as a lever to raise the price to a level that a free and fair market would never have paid , and to impose restrictions that it never would accept .
We want to limit the possibility to establish unnecessary and harmful monopolies .
Well , I suppose legislators have probably always been against harmful monopolies .
Therefore , both copyright and patent law have historically nearly always been limited in time .
And today , all such laws are limited .
( The first copyright law in England in 1710 was , by the way , modeled directly after the Statute of Monopolies , an anti-monopoly act from 1624 . )
I will not dive too deeply into the question of monopolies here , but it should be clear that the exclusive rights which a writer has to his text are of a completely different nature compared to the monopoly which a wholesaler of vegetables may have regarding the trade with carrots in a particular region .
Carrots are something that exists before the wholesaler gets his monopoly , while the author ‚Äôs text does not exist before he writes it .
An author ‚Äôs right to his own text is more like the ‚Äù monopoly ‚Äù a farmer has to sell precisely his own carrots , as opposed to the wholesaler monopoly , which concerns just about any carrots .
Trademarks are primarily a protection for consumers .
We believe that trademark law in essence works well today , and we propose no changes .
Well , one might probably criticize trademark law to some extent as well ( also in this case maybe mainly its application ) , e.g. when it sneaks into the field of copyright and , for instance , protects the names of characters in a novel .
The fact that an author today can be sentenced for writing a so - called sequel , is in my view against the basic principles of copyright law .
As long as you do not copy the original author ‚Äôs exact expression , this should be permitted .
Regarding consumer protection , such aspects are inherent also in copyright and patent law .
Authors may correct their editions and then improve them .
This was internationally highly debated in the 1800s , when certain individuals wished to change copyright protection to be counted from the author ‚Äôs death instead of from the publication date of a given work .
The advantage of counting from the creator ‚Äôs year of death was that otherwise the different editions of a book would become free gradually and thus , uncorrected versions would get the greatest spread .
I recently read in the newspaper ( in Swedish here ) that Swedish translator Jan Stolpe is working on a new translation of the Essays of Montaigne , as he realized that the previous version was not entirely satisfactory ‚Äì Montaigne research has simply moved forward since Jan Stolpe made the earlier version .
If he had not had the copyright of his translation , anyone would now be able to benefit from the re-emerging interest in Montaigne , and to a very low expense print Stolpe ‚Äôs earlier and relatively less perfect translation , before the new improved version is finished .
Musical artists may also disapprove of their recordings being distributed in cheaply made slapdash productions with bad sound , for example .
So , a quality aspect is involved here too .
It is about the so - called moral rights , which are often forgotten in the debate .
The focus is often on economics , which certainly is essential , but the integrity of the work is another equally important side .
Consequently , copyright is about integrity , it is not in itself a threat to integrity , as many seem to think .
Too hard means in the enforcement of the law can , however , pose a privacy problem , but that is another matter , that concerns all sorts of legislation .
( I have recently written an article that shows how important this protection is as a complement to the freedom of expression : ‚Äù What has copyright to do with democracy ? ‚Äù )
Also in the field of patents , there are similar aspects regarding quality .
The safeguarding of an individual ‚Äôs privacy is legally defined in the Swedish constitution .
From this fundamental right spring several other important human rights , such as freedom of expression and of opinion , feedom of information , the right to culture and the right to personal development .
All attempts by the state power to restrict these rights , must be questioned and face a powerful resistance .
This sounds good , of course .
However , artists ‚Äô , musicians ‚Äô and writers ‚Äô integrity should be safeguarded as well , should it not ?
Or are these groups the only ones that do n‚Äôt deserve the protection of the law ?
The Pirate Party now stresses that it is ( at least close to ) a single - issue - party concentrating on personal integrity ( privacy ) .
But personal integrity concerns many more issues than those raised by the Pirate Party up till now .
The party limits itself to questions concerning the network society , although at some point a representative also commented on TV camera surveillance at public places .
The question is , however , if the Pirate Party can give a serious impression in privacy and integrity issues unless they deal with such dramatic topics as euthanasia or abortion , the treatment of arrestees as well as crime victims , questions about witness protection , the treatment of refugees seeking asylum , the treatment of patients and sick - listed people , the view on patient safety and confidentiality .
The questions concerning privacy run on endlessly .
And this is hardly a matter limited to the relation between the state and its citizens .
Also a citizen can violate another citizen ‚Äôs privacy .
And ‚Äì is it objectionable when the state is monitoring us , but OK when Google does it ?
All means of power , systems and methods that the state can use against its citizens must be under constant review and scrutiny by elected representatives .
When the state monitors citizens who are not suspected of crime , it constitutes a violation of an individual ‚Äôs privacy in an essentially intolerable manner .
Every citizen should be guaranteed the right of anonymity that today is required in the Constitution , and individuals ‚Äô right to manage their own personal data must be strengthened .
Yes , government power should be constantly scrutinized .
I have written about this , how lame the Swedes ‚Äô demand for accountability of the rulers are ( article in Swedish here ) .
Of course , the state should not , for instance , wiretap people who are not suspected of crime .
The wording above is , however , ‚Äù monitor ‚Äù ( the Party ‚Äôs own English translation from Swedish says ‚Äù uses surveillance powers ‚Äù ) and this makes it ambiguous .
We are certainly monitored when we are protected from something ( videocams in shady parks , for instance , are by many regarded as benign ) .
And if we , as the next sentence suggests , should be guaranteed anonymity ( in any context ? ) , much social life would become impossible ( at least if we imagine that a considerable amount of people would take advantage of this right ) .
I think I understand the inherent meaning of this writing and I agree with it , but the point should be further qualified .
If we always should be able to be anonymous online , should n‚Äôt we always be able to be anonymous in real life too ?
Much of what makes us constitute a society , means that we must be known to each other ‚Äì and to some extent also to the state .
To a moderate extent , of course ‚Äì if too much , we end up in an Orwellian society ; if too little , most businesses , contracts or transactions would become impossible .
I wonder what will happen the day the Pirate Party realizes that the authorities know where we live , not just at some virtual IP address , but they know where we ‚Äù spend our nightly rest ‚Äù as it is phrased in the law .
The state knows where we live , ‚Äù in the flesh ‚Äù .
Will the Pirate Party demand that personal birth codes and census data be destroyed ?
[ Note :
In Sweden every citizen is registered by a birth code number which is associated with almost all personal data stored at any authority or state agency . ]
Mail privacy should be advanced to a general privacy of communications .
Thus , it should be prohibited to wiretap phone calls of others , read other people ‚Äôs e-mail , and text or other messages , in the same way as it is now prohibited to read someone else ‚Äôs mail , regardless of the technology or who is providing it .
Any exceptions to this rule , should in each case remain just a well - justified exception .
Employers should only be authorized to take part of an employee ‚Äôs messages in order to ensure some technical functionality or in direct connection with the employee ‚Äôs duties .
The state shall only have the right to gather evidence and conduct surveillance of its citizens when there is a specific suspicion of crime .
In all other cases the the state should assume that its citizens are innocent and leave them alone .
This privacy of communications must be given strong protection , since the state on several occasions has proved incapable , when it comes to a trustworthy managing of information that has come to its disposal .
I agree in principle , although this also needs qualification .
What does it mean for example that it should be forbidden to ‚Äù read other people ‚Äôs e-mail ‚Äù ?
Does this apply only to surreptitious reading by authorities or to any other individual than the e-mail ‚Äôs recipient ?
How would one regard cases where someone forwards an email to a third person ?
How would one regard a case , where this person is employed at a state authority ( such as a university ‚Äì in Sweden there are no privately owned universities ) , so that mail that may not have anything to do with the work being done at the authority in question , still might be handed out to ‚Äì for instance ‚Äì a news media reporter , since it constitutes an official document as defined in the Freedom of the Press Act ?
We want to annul the data retention directive and strengthen the protection of individual privacy .
It should be amended to prevent abuse , but of course we need the possibility to identify individuals who committed crimes on the web .
It should not be more strange than if you get the number from the license plate of a car that just hit you .
Decision - making and administration in both Sweden and the EU should be characterized by transparency and openness .
Swedish representatives in the EU should by all means work for the EU to more and more adopt the Swedish principle of public access to official records .
It would be interesting to know more about what the Pirate Party thinks about the tricky balance between privacy and openness .
Too much of the former has a tendency to diminish the latter and vice versa .
When copyright law was originally introduced , it regulated only a creator ‚Äôs right to be recognized as the creator of a work .
Later it was extended to include commercial copying of works , and presently it restricts also the rights of individuals and groups working non-profit .
We believe that this shift constitutes a change that is unacceptable to our society .
Today , economic and technological development have put copyright completely off balance , and instead it has come to bring about unfair advantages for a few large market players , at the expense of consumers and society at large .
Millions of classical works , songs , movies and visual artworks are held hostage in media companies ‚Äô vaults , attracting too little demand by their focus groups to make it worthwhile to publish them , still being too potentially lucrative to be freely released .
We want to make all these works free and available to everyone , before celluloid films are destroyed by time .
The first sentence is incorrect .
When copyright law was introduced it was an authors ‚Äô right to the effect that ‚Äù Every script [ copy ] shall be the author ‚Äôs or his legal rights holder ‚Äôs property . ‚Äù ( the Swedish act of 1810 ) and in the case of the very first statutory law , in England in 1710 , it stated that ‚Äù the Author of any Book ‚Ä¶ shall have the sole Liberty of Printing and Reprinting such Book and Books for the Term of Fourteen Years ‚Äù .
Both the Swedish and the English acts use the term ‚Äù property ‚Äù ‚Äì ‚Äù Property in every such Book ‚Äù , says the 1710 act .
Of course , this right aimed at commercial reproduction , as did also the copyright that existed before this new authors ‚Äô right .
Already when printers had privileges in book titles , one spoke of a kind of copyright , which definitely was a commercial right .
This , however , was something else than a creator ‚Äôs right , it was purely a right to print copies .
The Pirate Party and its supporters often speak of the ‚Äù few large market players ‚Äù , and it may sound alluring to make a crack at big multinational media companies .
Note , however , that copyright always starts with a single cultural creator ; a writer , a musician , a composer , an illustrator , a painter , or a photographer .
The law primarily concerns individuals .
These creative people then have the legal possibility to assign all or parts of their rights to anyone , be it grandma or ASCAP or Warner Music .
This is not so surprising .
I can give away my tangible assets to anyone as well .
Nothing says I must , however .
I could handle all sales myself .
So far this has been very difficult , which created a need for organizations such as ASCAP or STIM , and publishing houses , record companies , etc .
I ‚Äôm sure many creative people are happy to co-operate with companies or organizations like that , but today ‚Äôs technology should also make it possible for small individual creators to license their works to various kinds of users through , for instance , a database service on the web .
Intellectual property rights are a way to legislate on the material characteristics of immaterial values .
Well , immaterial values will get no material characteristics , just because rules are set for how ownership of the rights to these values should be handled at , for example , sales or contract writing .
I realize that the Pirate Party is hinting at what is often said , that immaterial values or intellectual property is somewhat artificial .
But all property is artificial .
Proudhon , who fought with Marx about ‚Äù The Philosophy of Poverty ‚Äù , claimed that property is theft , which now seems to be what the pirates think about intellectual property .
( Proudhon , by the way , changed his mind later , and even found that intellectual property was an important concept . )
Legislation should be amended so that it is quite clear that it only regulates the use and copying of works in a commercial context .
The sharing of copies , or otherwise to disseminate or use another ‚Äôs work , should never be prohibited as long as it is done on a non -profit basis .
The classification of use as being commercial or non-commercial is often artificial .
Much of what we assimilate in our spare time may be useful in work situations .
Today the Internet has made possible a new kind of cottage industry , where web site owners may get an income from , for example , Google Ads and the like .
This means , a most private content might still have a commercial character .
Certain activities may be commercial , i.e. appear in a market , but they could still be non-profit , for instance work by voluntary associations .
Copying without the profit motive is not automatically harmless .
It is usually called unfair competition if someone dumps prices of goods and thus destroys the market for a competitor .
Although it is not a competitor who does it in , for example , the file - sharing case , the market is still more or less destroyed when someone disseminates works free of charge , which are intended for sale .
If ‚Äù sharing of copies ‚Äù is supposed to be OK ( and I assume this means supplying to a mass audience and not just to a handful of friends ‚Äì which the law permits ) ‚Äì why would it then not be equally OK to do this , if you have a profit motive ?
The commercial part of copyright should remain as such , but even this needs thorough reform .
The idea behind copyright law has always been to find a balance between conflicting interests in the commercial arena .
Today , this balance is completely lost , and needs to be reset .
I agree with this to some extent .
As I said , the dichotomy of commercial and non-commercial is often artificial .
There are , for instance , several debaters who believe that the right to quote should apply only in a non-commercial context , and that this would be the case also with the use of photocopies from books made at a public or research library .
But as soon as an artist makes use of something , it is commercial ‚Äì artists are small business owners !
If you do not work for free ( as indeed many are proposing in today ‚Äôs debate ) , then it is a commercial activity .
There are hobby artists , of course , but that is another story .
We want the term of protection , that is the exclusive right to produce copies of a work for commercial purposes , to be reduced considerably to a period of , for instance , five years from the work ‚Äôs publication .
The commercial protection range should be regulated , so that the basic rule must allow for free creation of new works based on others , so - called derivative works .
To the extent that it may be justified to make exceptions from this general rule , for example regarding direct translations of books or the use of new music in commercial films , these exceptions should be explicitly listed in the law .
Five years is far too short a time .
For computer programs it might work .
In the case of literature , or music and art , it may take a very long time for the ‚Äù market ‚Äù or audience to acknowledge an artist as such .
An artist may even die before his or her art is recognized , and in such cases the survivors can act as good advocates for this artistry .
There are examples where survivors also block access to works or destroy or corrupt works , so it can certainly turn both ways .
I believe the term of protection was of reasonable length when it was 50 years post mortem auctoris .
It is preferable to count from the creator ‚Äôs death year , otherwise the earlier mentioned problem of inferior versions getting the greatest spread would easily occur , especially if the term of protection is very short .
I agree that the possibility to make various derivative works should be clearly expressed in the law .
Collage in visual art now resides in something of a legal gray area , and the use of samples in music should be permitted , as long as one , for example , borrows secondary matter from the original work and allows it to become secondary matter also in the new work .
All non-commercial acquisition , use , processing and dissemination of culture must be explicitly encouraged .
Techniques which aim to limit the consumer ‚Äôs legal right to freely copy and use information and culture , so - called DRM technologies , should be prohibited .
In cases where this in practice is not possible , or a ban would bring about great inconvenience for the consumer , products containing DRM technology should in any case be provided with evident warnings .
I agree in part with this .
E- books and digital discs with music and film must work much like books and discs did previously .
We are not required to pay each time we open a book we have bought .
And we expect a printed book to be readable after ten years .
This need not be with a digital product , which very well might stop working when the next operating system version or the the next DVD standard is introduced .
The digital world needs permanent products , that are easy to use , where the whole potential of their technology is realized .
For example , it should be possible to perform a full text search through e-books , to copy text from e-books , and one should be able to make screen shots or the like from movies .
I do not think there should be technical barriers against such use .
If someone uses this material in an illegal manner , it should be possible to take legal action ‚Äì just as the case has been with paper books or vinyl records .
Many offenses will naturally fall through the meshes with such a policy , but that has always been the case .
In today ‚Äôs world , it will probably happen more often .
But this is something I believe we must live with .
An alternative to the idea of a permanent product ‚Äì which is utopian , at least seen in the longer term ‚Äì is to have the right to upgrade to new formats and even to entirely new types of information carriers , as technology develops .
What you buy would be a kind of license to the content .
Note , however , that such a solution requires copyright .
Who if not the copyright owner could offer such guarantees ?
Patents have several socially adverse effects .
Drug patents are responsible for people dying from diseases , that they would have afforded to treat with pharmaceuticals , if patents had not existed , as well as for skewed research priorities , and for an unnecessarily high and growing drugs bill in the rich world .
A simplified reasoning .
Many valuable medicines would not have been possible to develop without the advantage in the market , that the developer may have through the patent .
The pharmaceutical industry is unsound in many respects , for instance in its way of marketing products that are not properly tested , through tampering with research results , through secretly paying off scientists etc .
Maybe too short patents or no patents at all could aggravate this state of affairs .
It is true , however , that people are dying because pharmaceutical companies do not want to share licenses with producers in poor countries .
It ought to be possible to legislate against this .
Patents for genes and life , such as patented seeds , convey unreasonable and harmful consequences .
Software patents hinder technical progress in the IT field , and poses a serious threat against Sweden ‚Äôs and Europe ‚Äôs small and medium - sized IT companies .
I agree in the case of genetically modified seeds .
The pharmaceutical industry shows itself from one of its worst sides also here , when , for example , it secures patents for genetically modified variants of traditional herbal medicines , which have been free for centuries .
In order to create a market for such products , the industry is lobbying hard , to prohibit or at least heavily regulate the availability of the natural substances .
Regarding computer programs , neither patents or copyright are in my opinion very apt forms of protection .
A computer program is neither a machine nor a novel .
Maybe we should return to the idea that was discussed many years ago , to create a special category of intellectual property for computer programs ?
Patents allegedly encourage innovation by protecting those who invent and invest in new inventions and manufacturing techniques .
Increasingly , however , patents are used primarily by large companies in order to prevent smaller competitors from competing on equal terms .
Instead of patents being encouragement to innovation , companies are now using their ‚Äù patent carpets ‚Äù in warfare against other players to avoid competition , often patents which the holders have no intention to further develop themselves .
It is about the same situation here as with copyright .
Being an inventor , you need not sell to a large company , if you do n‚Äôt want to .
Patents are of course a protection also for a smaller player who started his own firm to develop an idea .
However , this field is of course characterized by the same inequality as the rest of society , which means that those who can afford the best lawyers often win .
Of course , the law should not allow holders to keep patents indefinitely without using them for development , at least not if the authorities consider the patent as socially beneficial .
We believe that patents have had their day and that they currently actively hinder innovation and the creation of new knowledge .
In addition , if one looks at all product areas and innovations which can not be patented , it is obvious that patents are not really needed ‚Äì the incentive that comes from being first in a market is fully sufficient to create innovation .
Being able to be first in a market requires , among other things , an intellectual property right .
Otherwise , the idea could be stolen before it is finished and get developed sooner than the ‚Äù original ‚Äù , with lower quality ( and here it is a question of consumer protection ) , so that the person who made the largest investments will not get back his / her money .
It is not enough to be the first .
And for how long should you be allowed to be the first in this market ?
Three weeks or thirty years ?
There must be sufficient time to allow for investments to be retrieved .
However , I believe that patent regulation has spread to areas where it does n‚Äôt belong , such as in medicine , when pharmaceutical companies may patent a method of treatment with a non-patentable substance .
We demand an intellectual property law deeply rooted with the people , aimed to enrich individual people ‚Äôs lives , to enable a healthy business climate , to create the right to a public domain of knowledge and culture , and thus benefit the advancement of the whole society .
Cultural creators also run small businesses , so they need a healthy business climate as well .
Copyright certainly needs reform in some areas , but it ca n‚Äôt be done in such a way that the individual cultural creators stand without protection against those who ‚Äì with or without payment ‚Äì against their will want to dispose of their works .
The right to access a public domain is important .
In the first place , we must defend what is already there , i.e. works with an expired protection period , and works that have never been protected because they were created long before copyright law existed .
It is absurd that certain libraries and archives now because they use a specific technical web publication method claim copyright to , for example , faksimiles of medieval images and texts .
If you would like to publish copies of these old documents , you must pay a license fee to the library or archive .
Finally , we note that the Pirate Party ‚Äôs program is far more toned down than what you can hear from some of their representatives and sympathizers .
There also seems to be some contradictions in the program .
What does the party really think about the conflict between privacy and openness ?
Who in society should have the right to privacy ?
Only the average citizen or even , say , cultural creators ‚Äì and perhaps even politicians ?
( Sure , we want to closely watch our elected representatives ‚Äì but to what extent ? )
If the party now wants a copyright , which lasts for only five years ‚Äì by what means do they think creators during this period should be able to protect themselves against infringement in the form of , for example , piracy or theft of unpublished material ?
Finally , we also note that these issues point by point correspond with the debate throughout the 1700s .
Both the piracy advocates and opponents of those days wrote pamphlets and gave inflammatory speeches at trials .
New inventions in the form of machines were compared to books and plays .
Publishing was compared with giving away something forever to the public .
And so on .
Something that changed the approach radically was when an increasing amount of thinkers started to distinguish between form and content ( best clarified by Fichte ) , so that copyright law was to protect the expression , but not the idea behind a work ( while patent on the other hand protected ideas ) .
Then as well as now , the debate was often tied up in endless discussions about whether an intellectual property may exist or not .
Personally , I believe ( as I have said in several articles ) that it is much more fruitful to regard copyright as a kind of complement to the freedom of expression .
If we wish to safeguard personal freedom , we should also protect a person ‚Äôs expressions ‚Äì not only the right to make them , but also the right not to have one ‚Äôs expressions distorted or used by others in any context ( expression is used here in the broad sense of the word , from a poem or letter to a three - hour movie ) .
And , if such an expression has been made that is lucrative , who should primarily be entitled to the profits , if not those who invested work and perhaps money in its creation ?

( I encourage those who have not done so to read it : Encircling the Peak of World Oil Production ) .
On a side note , the paper Richard Duncan wrote with Walter Youngquist in 1999 ( when oil prices were in $ 10 - $ 15 range and stock markets were at all time highs ) predicting a 2007 world oil peak was not only prescient and ahead of its time using oil forecasting heuristics , but was part of the core readings from 2003 that caused me to leave the Wall St path to study resource depletion full time .
This is a guest posting of Richard Duncan 's latest " Olduvai " update , which is an essay that explores energy use and population and as with previous updates arrives at some rather grim conclusions .
Olduvai Theory : Toward Re-Equalizing the World Standard of Living
By Richard Duncan
‚Äú Standard of Living ‚Äù is often ( not always ) measured by money spent per head .
Economists acknowledge that this is a poor measure of welfare ‚Äì especially during these times of economic turmoil when fiat money becomes unable to purchase basic necessities ( e.g. , Zimbabwe , recent food riots ) .
Since the consumption of energy is the prerequisite for all economic activity , ‚Äú energy consumption ‚Äù instead of ‚Äú money consumption , ‚Äù is a more accurate long term metric for measuring welfare .
Abstract
Introduction
M. King Hubbert presented an Olduvai - like hypothesis to the AAAS Centennial Conference in 1948 and published it in Science in 1949 .
Jay W. Forrester in 1971/1973 used feedback modeling to show the likelihood of overshoot and collapse of the World ‚Äò STEP ‚Äô system .
Walter Youngquist ( advance copy ms .
GeoDestinies , 2009 ) describes the grave problems resulting from U.S. and World population growth coupled to the depletion of Earth resources .
Three Geo/STEP Scientists
M. King Hubbert ( 1903 - 1989 )
Human Affairs in Time Perspective
The Olduvai Theory ( OT ) is defined by the rise and fall of the World standard of living ( SL ) .
The main population data are from OECD ( 2008 ) and the main energy data are from BP ( 2008 ) .
The OT is quantified by dividing World population ( P ) into World energy consumption ( E ) : SL = E / P.
Suddenly however , in June 2008 I was pressed to explain the rapid rise in the World SL from 2000 to 2007 .
The cause turned out to be the rapid rise of the SL in just a few of the 165 non-OECD ( ‚Äò underdeveloped ‚Äô ) nations : namely China , India and Brazil .
In contrast the SL of the 30 OECD ( ‚Äò developed ‚Äô ) nations peaked in 2005 and has since declined .
Population and energy data from 1965 to 2007 , OECD data for 2008 and early 2009 , and OECD projections to 2010 are the basis for a scenario toward re-equalizing the World SL from 2008 to 2030 .
Backup studies are referenced , quoted and discussed : This section highlights how a Geophysicist , a Systems Scientist and a Petroleum Geologist viewed / view the past and project the future of Industrial Civilization .
Geophysicist and Professor Emeritus , Columbia University ‚Äî gave an invited presentation to the Centennial Conference of the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) in 1948 titled ‚Äú Energy from Fossil Fuels . ‚Äù
In it he sketched and discussed an Olduvai - like scenario .
His presentation was published in Science , 1949 .
The present state of human affairs can best be appreciated in the light of a time perspective , minus and plus , of some tens of thousands of years from the present , as depicted in Fig. 8 [ frame # 1 ] .
On such a time scale the phenomena we have discussed are represented by abrupt , nearly vertical rises from zero or near zero to maximum values .
The consumption of energy from fossil fuels is thus seen to be but a ‚Äú pip , ‚Äù rising sharply from zero to a maximum , and almost as sharply declining , and thus representing but a moment in the total human history .
Likewise the consumption of energy per capita [ Fig. 8 , frame # 3} , after having risen very gradually from 2,000 to possibly 10,000 kilogram calories per day , is seen to increase suddenly to a maximum value of several times the highest previous value .
Again it is physically possible to maintain a high value , as indicated by Curve I , on a stable basis for an indefinite period of time from current energy sources , particularly direct and indirect solar radiation .
It is also possible , however , that through cultural degeneration this curve may decline , as in Curve II , to the subsistence level of our agrarian ancestors .
2 Viewed on such a time scale [ Fig. 8 , frame # 4 ] , the curve of human population would be flat and only slightly above zero for all preceding human history , and then it too would be seen to rise abruptly and almost vertically to a maximum value of several billion .
Thereafter , depending largely upon what energy supplies are available , it might stabilize at a maximum value , as in Curve I , or more probably to a lower and more nearly optimum value , as in Curve II .
However , should cultural degeneration occur so that the available energy resources should not be utilized , the human population would undoubtedly be reduced to a number appropriate to an agrarian existence , as in Curve III .
These sharp breaks in all the foregoing curves can be ascribed quite definitely , directly or indirectly , to the tapping of the large supplies of energy stored up in the fossil fuels .
The release of this energy is a unidirectional and irreversible process .
It can only happen once , and the historical events associated with this release are necessarily without precedent , and are intrinsically incapable of repetition .
It is clear , therefore , that our present position on the nearly vertical front slopes of these curves is a precarious one , and that the events which we are witnessing and experiencing , far from being ‚Äú normal , ‚Äù are among the most abnormal and anomalous in the history of the World .
Yet we cannot turn back ; neither can we consolidate our gains and remain where we are .
In fact , we have no choice but to proceed into a future , which we may be assured will differ markedly from anything we have experienced thus far .

Jay W. Forrester
Electrical Engineer , Computer Scientist and Professor Emeritus , Sloan School of Management , MIT ‚Äî has a remarkable record of innovations and applications in both hardware and software .
This essay focuses on his groundbreaking book , World Dynamics ( 1971/1973 ) wherein he uses feedback control theory to model the World STEP system .
The World Situation
Many global attitudes and programs seem to be based on accepting future growth in population as preordained and as the basis for action .
But , if we make provision for rising population , population responds by rising .
What is to stop the exponential growth ?
This book describes the circular processes of our social systems in which there is no uni-directional cause and effect .
Instead , a ring of actions and consequences close back on themselves .
One can say , incompletely , that population will grow and that cities , space , and food must be provided .
But one can likewise say , also incompletely , that the provision of cities , space , and food will cause population to grow .
Population generates the pressures to support growth of population .
But supporting the growth leads to more population .
Growth will stop only in the face of enough pressure to suppress the internal dynamic forces of expansion .
Many programs ‚Äî for example the development of more productive grains and agricultural methods ‚Äî are spoken of as ‚Äú buying time ‚Äù until population control becomes effective .
But the process of buying time reduces the pressures that force population control .
Any proposed program for the future must deal with both the quality of life and the factors affecting population .
‚Äú Raising the quality of life , ‚Äù means releasing stress , reducing crowding , reducing pollution , alleviating hunger , and treating ill health .
But these pressures are exactly the sources of concern and actions that will control total population to keep it within the bounds of the fixed world within we live .
If the pressures are relaxed , so is the concern about how we impinge on the environment .
Population will then rise further until the pressures reappear with an intensity that can no longer be relieved .
Trying to raise quality of life without intentionally creating compensating pressure to prevent a rise in population density will be self - defeating .
Efforts to improve quality of life will fail until effective means have been implemented for limiting both population and industrialization .
Without effective legal and psychological control , population grows until stresses rise far enough , which is to say that the quality of life falls far enough , to stop further increase .
Everything we do to reduce those pressures cause the population to rise farther and faster and hastens the day when expediencies will no longer suffice .
People are in the position of a wild animal running from its pursuers .
We still have some space , natural resources , and agricultural land left .
We can avoid the question of rising population as long as we can flee into this bountiful reservoir that nature provided .
But the reservoir is limited .
Exponential growth cannot continue .
The wild animal flees until he is cornered , until he has no more space .
Then he turns to fight , but he no longer has room to maneuver .
He is less able to forestall disaster than if he had fought in the open while there was still room to yield and to dodge .
The world is running away from its long - term threats by trying to relieve social pressures as they arise .
But , if we persist in treating only the symptoms and not the causes , the result will be to increase the magnitude of the ultimate threat and reduce our capability to respond when we no longer have more space and resources to invade .
What does this mean ?
Instead of automatically attempting to cope with population growth , national and international efforts to relieve the pressures of excess growth must be reexamined .
Many such humanitarian impulses seem to be making matters worse in the long run .
Rising pressures are necessary to hasten the day when population is stabilized .
Pressures can be increased by reducing food production , reducing health services , and reducing industrialization .
Such reductions seem to have only slight effect on quality of life in the long run .
The principal effect will be in squeezing down and stopping the runaway growth .
‚Ä¶
The long - term future of the earth must be faced soon as a guide for present action .
Goals of nations and societies must be altered to become compatible with that future , otherwise man remains out of balance with his environment .
Man can do vast damage first , but eventually he will yield to the mounting forces of the environment .
Can the traditions of civilization be altered to become compatible with global equilibrium ?

Walter Youngquist
Geologist , draws from his experience in living and working abroad , and travels in some 70 countries to observe the vital relationship of population to available Earth resources .
He is particularly concerned about continuing population growth against declining both nonrenewable and renewable resource bases ‚Äî fertile soil and fresh water being examples of the latter .
Selections from the Introduction , ms. advance copy
We are relative latecomers on the scene , and the Earth existed for several billion years very well without us .
But with our arrival and our development of culture to the technological age in which we now live , in a very brief time we have had an impact on the Earth beyond what any other organism has ever had .
We therefore live in a unique , and what is likely to be a very brief time in human history .
Some of us have been very fortunate to live in these times near or at the top of the pyramid of technological and medical advances .
But we are at the same time living at a great turning point in Earth and human history .
It is apparent that current political , economic , and social efforts are to keep things as they are ‚Äî not to change .
People in developed countries do not like changes in their lifestyles ‚Ä¶ if they believe they are good now .
But changes come and are unavoidable . ‚Ä¶
As much as the future changed during less than in my lifetime , the future of most of those reading this book will surely be equally or more changed from what is the present .
Successfully adjusting to a different future from what has been enjoyed by at least some the past few hundred years is the challenge lying now directly ahead .
‚Ä¶
In earlier centuries , with many fewer people , these Earth resources were exploited only very slowly and in minor amounts .
But within the past few hundred years , with the arrival of the Industrial Revolution ‚Ä¶ the rate and volume of resource exploitation has greatly increased , ‚Ä¶ It was the use of these resources that has been the base for the rise of our present civilization , allowing some segments of society to achieve , ‚Ä¶ a standard of living never before imagined .
Accompanying this rise in standard of living has been a huge increase in population , from an estimated 610 million in 1700 to the current approximately 6.7 billion .
This has been a truly astounding event made possible chiefly by three factors : great medical advances including sanitation , the widespread use of high energy density fossil fuels , and the use of these fossil fuels to greatly enhance agricultural production ‚Ä¶ [ It ] is the huge rise in population and related increased Earth resource consumption ‚Ä¶ that is probably the salient fact of these truly remarkable recent few centuries .
‚Ä¶
But these materials ‚Ä¶ can be extracted and used only once . ‚Ä¶
Can we continue to maintain the present high standard of living for some of us , by using truly renewable Earth resources ‚Ä¶ instead of an inheritance from the past ? ‚Ä¶
Much of the discussion in the following chapters is related to stress on Earth mineral and energy resources , and stress on the environment from population growth .
Equally and perhaps more important ‚Ä¶ are social stresses resulting in part from depletion of resources , such as water supplies and fertile soils ‚Ä¶ and resulting food shortages causing riots .
Also population is growing ‚Ä¶ faster than are jobs .
‚Ä¶
Until recently , the outlet for stress from a growing population was migration ‚Ä¶ but this outlet no longer exists .
‚Ä¶
Even the United States , the United Kingdom , and European countries may show stress in several ways including generally rising unemployment , and antagonism toward immigrant labor ‚Ä¶
One fact is abundantly clear : we have already exceeded the permanent carrying capacity of the Earth , and the number one problem is to reduce population in an orderly fashion to fit into the new renewable resources paradigm .
‚Ä¶ [ Nearly ] all governmental leaders worldwide are committed to keeping and expanding the present agendas of resource consumption ‚Ä¶ with the rallying cry of ‚Äú sustainable economic growth . ‚Äù
The underlying basic problem of population growth is rarely addressed ‚Äî absent from most political agendas as being ‚Äú politically incorrect . ‚Äù ‚Ä¶ [ Growth ] based upon continuing to exploit the finite resources of the Earth is not possible .
Yet this is the current basis of the world ‚Äôs developing and developed economies . ‚Ä¶
We need to be as self - sufficient , dependent on resources from local economies ‚Ä¶ for this has to be a part of any sustainable future .
‚Ä¶
History is informative and gives us a perspective on how we came to where we are today .
But it is the future in which you will live and the future is ‚Äú not what it used to be . ‚Äù
But it is now arriving ‚Ä¶ bringing with it more than 190,000 people each day to live on depleting resources . ‚Ä¶
It is the purpose of this volume to provide a perspective on the past , but more importantly provide a possible and hopefully a fairly realistic view of what the future may hold .
‚Ä¶ [ Namely ] that on this finite Earth high consuming societies are eventually going to be relegated to being an artifact of history .
‚Ä¶
Our modern , developed societies tend to be removed , by their present degree of affluence , from the environment as the basis for our existence .
Food comes from the supermarket , clean water comes from the faucet .
But the closer people live to the margin of existence , the more they realize the vital importance of fertile soil , and safe drinking water , ‚Ä¶ How we try to navigate the choppy waters to the future , will determine to a large extent when and in what condition we will arrive to the new land of sustainable renewable Earth resources . ‚Ä¶
The continued almost inevitable growth of population ‚Ä¶ against the depletion of Earth resources combine to form the main challenge before us . ‚Ä¶
Those who will be living at the end of this century will see much of this land of the future come into view , but even there and then as now , Earth resources will continue to be the base for human existence and will inevitably exert final control over the destinies of nations and individuals .
We are made of Earth materials , and its biological products , and on these we survive .
To continue to negatively impact our environment is a form of suicide .
‚Äú Mother Earth ‚Äù is not an abstract concept but very much a reality , for from Earth we came , on it we depend for our existence . ‚Ä¶

The American Example
Obvious Responses Will Not Suffice
The dynamic characteristics of complex social systems frequently mislead people .
‚Ä¶
[ Urban policies for example ] are being followed on the presumption that they will alleviate the difficulties .
‚Ä¶
In fact , a downward spiral develops in which the presumed solution makes the difficulty worse and thereby causes redoubling of the presumed solution so that matters become still worse .
The same downward spiral frequently develops in national government and at the level of world affairs .
Judgment and debate lead to programs that appear to be sound .
Commitment increases to the apparent solutions .
If the presumed solutions actually make matters worse , the process by which this happens is not evident .
So , when the troubles increase , the efforts are intensified that are actually worsening the problems .

Figure 1 shows the U.S. standard of living ( SL ) during 37 years .
Figure 1 shows the U.S. standard of living ( SL ) during 37 years .
Evidence in Figure 1 shows that the U.S. SL grew dramatically from 1965 to its all - time peak in 1973 .
Then , after an erratic 21 years , it went into an accelerated decline from 2000 to 2007 .
Moreover , recent data show that the decline accelerated in 2008 and into 2009 .
Details follow .
Growth‚ÄìPeak‚ÄìDecline : From 1965 to 1973 the U.S. SL surged reaching its all time peak in 1973 .
This was followed by a dip - and - rebound from 1973 to 1979 .
Then from 1979 to 1983 came a precipitous plunge wherein the U.S. SL fell by 14.5 % ( 8.92 boe / c ) in 4 years .
A rough recovery came from 1983 to a high in 2000 .
Then from 2000 to 2007 the U.S. SL declined by 4.1 % ( 2.46 boe / c ) in 7 years .
Historical correlations : The U.S. SL grew swiftly during low energy prices from 1965 to 1973 .
Then in 1973 - 74 ‚Äì correlated with an Arab - Israeli war ‚Äì several OPEC nations banded together and refused to export oil to the U.S.
Next in 1979 came the fall of the Shaw of Iran ‚Äì reputedly a ‚Äò puppet ‚Äô of the U.S. ‚Äì accompanied by a steep rise in the price of oil and a plunge in the U.S. SL from 1979 to 1983 .
This was followed by an erratic struggle wherein the U.S. SL reached a brief high in 2000 .
Then , beginning with the Dot.com bust , came the ominous decline from 2000 to 2007 .
U.S. population vs. energy : The U.S. population grew from 211,909,000 in 1973 to 301,104,000 in 2007 ‚Äî an increase of 42.1 % or 89,231,000 people in 34 years .
At the same time U.S. energy consumption lagged at 31.6 % .
The net result was that the U.S. SL fell by 7.4 % from 1973 to 2007 .

The United States annually takes in more immigrants than do all other nations combined .
Somalians now live in Minnesota .
Sudanese live in Kentucky .
Medicaid is received by 14.8 percent of households headed by Americans , and 24.2 percent by households headed by immigrants .
Many compassionate Americans feel that it is our duty to take in more and more immigrants .
However , at the current rate of approximately 2.5 million a year , this accounts for only 3 percent of the 80 million people added to world population annually .
The United States cannot continue to act as a safety valve for even a small portion of world population growth .
Very near the U. S. , Haiti has 9 million people living in an area smaller than Malheur County Oregon .
Haiti is on international food welfare .
We ship food to Haiti , which simply results in more Haitians to whom to ship food next year .
More than 27 countries now exhibit this same circumstance .
Population is a homegrown problem , and it must be recognized and solved at home , without exporting it .

The Olduvai Theory : Background
The fifth revolution will come when we have spent the stores of coal and oil that have been accumulating in the earth during hundreds of millions of years ‚Ä¶ it is obvious that there will be a very great difference in ways of life ‚Ä¶ a man has to alter his way of life considerably , when , after living for years on his capital , he suddenly finds he has to earn any money he wants to spend ‚Ä¶
This change may justly be called a revolution , but it differs from all the preceding ones in that there is no likelihood of its leading to increases of population , but even perhaps to the reverse .
Charles Galton Darwin , 1953 , p. 52
The similarities and differences in the shape of the Olduvai / World curve in Figure 2 are compared to the shape of the U.S. curve ( Figure 1 , previous ) as an aid to understanding both .
Figure 2 . Olduvai / World Average Standard of Living
Note well Figure 2 vis-√†-vis Figure 1 : ( 1 ) Both the World SL and the U.S. SL grew strongly from 1965 to 1973 : 27.8 % for the World SL and 28.2 % for the U.S. SL .
( 2 ) Compare the ups and downs in each curve from 1979 to 2000 wherein there was a net decline in each curve : 1.9 % decline in Figure 2 and 2.8 % decline in Figure 1 . ( 3 ) In contrast ‚Äì the two curves differ markedly from 2000 to 2007 : the World SL increased by a strong 9.7 % while the U.S. SL decreased by 4.1 % .
The strong correlation between the Olduvai / World SL and the U.S. SL from 1965 to 2000 is evidence that the same events must have influenced both curves during these 35 years .
So we ask , ‚Äú What likely caused the noted difference between the two curves from 2000 to 2007 ? ‚Äù
This question is discussed and answered in the next two sections .

There is coming this century , in places , already here , an inevitable collision between resources available on a finite Earth and rising population demands from both growth and hopes for a more affluent existence .
Youngquist , ms . advance copy GeoDestinies , 2009 , Ch. 33
In 1972 the presidential appointed Rockefeller Commission was to examine the future well being of the United States .
At that time the U. S. population was approximately 207 million , and the Commission reported they could see no advantage in having more people .
But in 2009 the U. S. had 307 million and still growing .
Albert Bartlett has stated : ‚Äú Can you think of any problem , on any scale from microscopic to global , whose long - term solution is in any demonstrable way , aided , assisted , or advanced by having larger populations at the local level , the state level , the national level , or globally ? ‚Äù
Looking inevitably toward a renewable resource - based future , present population has already exceeded the carrying capacity of the Earth , but by 2050 another 2.5 billion are projected to be here .
The worldwide number one problem is population , for , as is the motto of one environmental group ‚Äú Whatever your cause is , it is lost without population control . ‚Äù

OECD SL and Non-OECD SL
OECD Composite Leading Indicators reach new low
The OECD composite leading indicators ( CLIs ) for January 2009 continue to point to a weakening outlook for all the major seven economies , with the OECD total falling again to a new low and little clear indication of stabilizing soon .
The outlook has also continued to deteriorate in the major non-OECD member economies ‚Ä¶
The CLI for the OECD area in January ‚Ä¶ was 9.1 points lower than in January 2008 .
The CLI for the United States in January ‚Ä¶ was 10.8 points lower than a year ago . ‚Ä¶
The CLI for China in January 2009 ‚Ä¶ was 14.8 points lower than a year ago .
The CLI for India in January ‚Ä¶ was 9.6 points lower than in January 2008 .
The CLI for Russia ‚Ä¶ was 19.4 points lower than a year ago .
In January 2009 the CLI for Brazil ‚Ä¶ was 10.1 points lower than a year ago .
OECD ( 2009 b )
By most accounts there are 195 nations ( countries ) in the World .
The OECD comprises the 30 ‚Äò developed ‚Äô nations and the non-OECD comprises the 165 ‚Äò underdeveloped ‚Äô nations .
For example , the United States , United Kingdom , Germany and Japan are OECD nations .
In contrast China , India , Russia , Brazil and Ethiopia are non-OECD nations .
The Olduvai / World curve comprises both the OECD nations and the non-OECD nations .
Figure 3 depicts the Olduvai / World data disaggregated into one curve for the OECD nations a second curve for the non-OECD nations .
Figure 3 . OECD SL and non-OECD SL Compared
The OECD document ( 2009 b , above ) and Figure 3 , taken together ; reveal several significant facts to explain the recent upshot of the Olduvai / World curve ( Figure 2 , previous ) : ( 1 ) The OECD SL curve from 2000 to 2007 decreased by 0.8 % ( 0.27 boe / c ) .
( 2 ) The non-OECD SL curve increased by 28.1 % ( 1.62 boe / c ) .
Thus the rapid rise in the Olduvai / World curve from 2000 to 2007 was entirely caused by growth in the non-OECD SL and none of it caused by the OECD SL .
( 3 ) The OECD SL reached an all - time maximum in 2005 .
( 4 ) Then from 2005 to 2007 it decreased by 0.8 % ( 0.30 boe / c ) .
( 5 ) Further , the entire OECD SL fell by 9.1 CLI points during 2008 .

‚Äú Growth ‚Äù ‚Äî A reaffirmed global objective
[ In ] response to the global economic meltdown , the G - 20 was formed consisting of the leaders of the 20 biggest , richest , and emerging economies .
A summary statement of their objectives was released and printed in full in ‚Ä¶ November 16 , 2008 .
One of the clearly stated objectives was to ‚Äú restore global growth , ‚Äù to enhance ‚Äú economic growth , ‚Äù and foster ‚Äú sustainable growth . ‚Äù
In total , the term ‚Äú growth ‚Äù in various contexts appears nine times .
An additional objective is ‚Äú to stimulate domestic demand ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù
In all uses of the term ‚Äú growth ‚Äù the G - 20 group meant it ultimately in terms of material things .
It is clear the fact that ‚Äú sustainable growth ‚Äù is an oxymoron ‚Ä¶ Continued growth in use of both nonrenewable and renewable natural resources is the problem , not the solution . ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù
We are already exploiting the Earth ‚Äôs vital resources at an unsustainable rate .
Demand is exceeding resource supplies to the extent that even now more than half the world is in poverty .
Standard of living ‚Ä¶ is most easily measured by per capita consumption of energy .
In the United States this peak was in 1973 , and now going down quite rapidly .
Whatever gains may have been accomplished by the laudable efforts of efficiency and conservation ‚Ä¶ have been more than cancelled by increase in population , suggested also by the fact that the U. S. is the only industrialized nation with a significant growth in population , now about three million per year .
‚Ä¶
Nationally , 80 % is due to immigration , in California , nearly 100 % , where by 2030 20 million more people are expected to arrive adding to the 38 million there now .

Focus on OECD Standard of Living
GDP to plummet 4.3 percent across OECD countries in 2009 as unemployment climbs sharply
Economic activity is expected to plummet by an average 4.3 percent in the OECD area in 2009 while by the end of 2010 unemployment rates in many countries will reach double figures ‚Ä¶
Amid the deepest and most widespread recession for more than 50 years , international trade is forecast to fall by more than 13 percent in 2009 and world economic activity to shrink by 2.7 percent . ‚Ä¶
In the United States , activity will fall sharply in the near term , but the country could begin to pull out of the recession in early 2010 , assuming the effectiveness of the strong stimulus packages and more stable financial and housing markets . ‚Ä¶
In the large emerging economies activity is slowing as access to international credit dries up , commodity prices fall and export demand weakens .
‚Ä¶
The Interim Outlook adds that the risks of an even gloomier scenario outweigh the possibility of a quicker recovery . ‚Ä¶
OECD ( 2009a )
Figure 4 . The OECD SL : Peak Revealed
Figure 4 focuses on OECD data from 1992 to 2007 .
Four key facts emerge : ( 1 ) The OECD SL grew by a remarkable 8.6 % ( 2.77 boe / c ) from 1992 to its all time maximum in 2005 .
( 2 ) Then it declined by 0.8 % ( 0.30 boe / c ) from 2005 to 2007 .
( 3 ) Economic activity in the OECD area is expected to plummet by an average 4.3 percent in 2009 .
( 4 ) The U.S. is the largest economy in the OECD , passed its peak SL in 1973 and its SL has since declined .
These facts mean that the OECD maximum in 2005 will , I assume , be the all - time OECD SL peak .
‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì ‚Äì‚Äì
Increasingly , from across the globe , nightly television brings to our living rooms photos of malnourished people , particularly touching are the starving children .
Advanced countries can provide the means and the knowledge for a given country to adjust its population to its sustainable food resource base , but implementation of that action becomes an individual responsibility , and collectively a national responsibility .
Thus far this most fundamental of all humanity ‚Äôs problems is consistently ignored by all ‚Äî or nearly all ‚Äî public officials everywhere .
It has never , to my knowledge , become part of any political platform or a politician ‚Äôs agenda seeking office or one seeking to remain in office .
All of the above also relates to the United States .
The number one , most important factor in all of this is current size of population and above all , continued population growth .
But this overriding consideration is never recognized .
The word ‚Äú population ‚Äù does not appear anywhere in the G - 20 statement .
If this document represents the forward ‚Äú thinking ‚Äù of the world leaders of the biggest and richest economies , we are in very deep trouble . ‚Äù

Toward Re-Equalizing the World Standard of Living
The real issues , I believe , rest on the impossibility of a long - term favorable future for the human species if different parts of the Earth remain in grossly different stages of development .
On a long - term basis it simply is not possible to contemplate a life of prosperity and luxury in a few favorable cases on the Earth existing permanently alongside poverty and starvation everywhere else .
Sooner or later , standards of living work themselves to a pretty constant level , like water finding its own level .
Sir Fred Hoyle , 1964 , p. 54-55
Figure 5 depicts four curves , one for each SL category we ‚Äôve discussed .
Figure 5 . Toward Re-Equalizing the World SL
The vertical scale of Figure 5 goes from 0.0 boe / c to 64.0 boe / c to accommodate all of the SL curves previously shown .
Historic data appear from 1990 to 2007 and ‚Äì along with other data and many references ‚Äì provide the basis for the Olduvai scenario shown from 2008 to 2030 .
5
In Figure 5 the U.S. curve ( # 4 ) in 2007 represents 4.5 % ( 0.301 billion ) of World population and had a SL of 57.5 boe / c .
In contrast , the non-OECD curve ( # 1 ) in 2007 represents 82.3 % of World population and had a SL of 7.4 boe / c .
This difference cannot last for long .
The following scenario projects how ‚Äú Mother Nature ‚Äù will resolve this problem .
6
The Olduvai Scenario : The U.S. SL plunges ( curve 4 ) ; the OECD SL dives ( curve 2 ) ; the non-OECD SL levels off and then sinks ( curve 1 ) ; the Olduvai SL ( curve # 2 ) peaks in 2010 7 and then declines to a scant 3.53 boe / c in 2030 .
That SL for the World in 2030 will equal the same SL the World had in 1930 ‚Äì thus giving Industrial Civilization a ‚Äú pip ‚Äù of 100 years .
In other words : The falling World SL will eventually limit both World population growth and industrialization .
‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì ‚Äì‚Äì
Population now has grown beyond the former abundance of relatively inexpensive basic resources .
As costs of the necessities of life rise , strains are appearing across the world .
Even in what has been called " the richest nation " the United States the fabric of everyday life is coming under stress .
With the addition each year of three million people , the stress can only increase .
One can begin to feel a growing uneasiness about the future , both here and abroad .
There is good cause for unease , with world population increasing at the rate of more than 80 million a year continuing the assault on the life - sustaining environment .
Youngquist , ms . advance copy GeoDestinies , 2009 , Ch. 20
The irreconcilable current trends of a growing population and declining supporting resources seem not yet to be recognized at any levels of political leadership .
However , these two facts will collide head - on this century .
At best , this will result in a halt to population growth .
At worst it could be chaos .
The ability of the Industrial Revolution and related technologies to find and exploit the Earth ‚Äôs resources at an unsustainable rate for a fortunate relatively few societies , by its very success carries within it the seeds of its own destruction .
We inevitably face a future of less .
However , bringing this message to the developed and developing world ‚Äôs citizens is not being done .
Discussion of this topic and population growth unfortunately remains politically incorrect .
Economists and political leaders nearly everywhere continue to endorse the illusion that more people consuming more resources ( ‚Äú buy more ‚Äù ‚Äî ‚Äú increase demand ‚Äù ) is the road to permanent prosperity , whereas now the exact opposite is true .

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The average U.S. standard of living ( SL , Fig. 1 ) peaked in 1973 ; from 1973 to 2007 it decreased by 7.4 % ; the U.S. composite leading indicator ( CLI ) in January 2009 was 10.8 points lower than in January 2008 .
Conclusion 1 : The U.S. SL will continue falling long into the future .
The Olduvai / World SL ( Fig. 2 ) reached a temporary high in 1979 ; from 1979 to 2000 it decreased by 1.9 % ; however from 2000 to 2007 it increased by 9.7 % ; the increase was entirely caused by increases in a few non-OECD nations .
Conclusion 2 : The World SL itself will soon begin to decline .
The OECD SL ( Figs. 3 & 4 ) reached its peak in 2005 ; from 2005 to 2007 it decreased by 0.8 % ; its ‚Äú CLI was 9.1 points lower in January 2009 than in January 2008 ; economic activity is expected to plummet by an average 4.3 percent in the OECD area in 2009 and by the end of 2010 unemployment rates in many OECD countries will reach double figures . ‚Äù
Conclusion 3 : The OECD SL will continue to fall .
The non-OECD SL ( Fig. 3 ) increased by 28.0 % from 2000 to 2007 and this caused the rapid rise in the Olduvai / World SL during those years ( Fig. 2 ) .
However , ‚Äú In the large emerging economies activity is slowing as access to international credit dries up , commodity prices fall and export demand weakens . ‚Äù
Further : The CLIs for China , India and Brazil all fell sharply in 2008 .
Conclusion 4 : The non-OECD SL has already begun to fall .
The Olduvai Scenario ( Fig. 5 ) : The U.S. SL falls by 90 % from 2008 to 2030 .
The OECD SL falls by 86 % .
The non-OECD falls by 60 % .
The OECD SL melds with the non-OECD SL in 2030 putting the World SL at 3.53 boe /c in 2030 .
Conclusion 5 : The World SL reaches the same value in 2030 that it had in 1930 , giving Industrial Civilization a duration of 100 years .
Projections regarding the United States : ( 1 ) We will refuse to solve our own problems so Mother Nature will ‚Äú solve ‚Äù them for us .
( 2 ) Sooner or later industrial decline will cause population decline and , tit - for - tat feedback , population decline will cause industrial decline .
( 3 ) The U.S. population distribution in 2100 will look more like the rural geography of 1900 than like the urban geography of today .
( 4 ) Trying to stimulate ‚Äì or even maintain ‚Äì the present level of domestic demand of nonrenewable and renewable Earth resources will fail .
( 5 ) Multiculturalism will cause chaos during the transition to localism .

End Notes
1 . This is Ackerman ‚Äôs Law , discussed in Duncan , 2005 - 2006 , p. 2 - 3 .
2. M. King Hubbert in 1949 projected that the duration of Industrial Civilization would be more than 1,000 years , some ten times that of the Olduvai Theory .
3 . ‚Äú Re-equalization of living standards :
It will be a long slow process but I think the trend will be there this century .
You might note also that immigration tends to do the same thing ‚Äì people migrate out of resource scarce poor countries to countries with more resources ‚Äì the migrants use more resources and this cuts down total available for all .
The USA is a good example .
People use energy ‚Äì more people use more energy , and if there is not enough to go around at low cost , everybody sees a cut in living standards .
So migration is a factor in equalization of living standards . ‚Äù

5 . ‚Äú The expanding economy of the First Half of the Age of Oil led to increasing globalization based on growing world trade and financial hegemony by powerful countries .

AllPinouts is a Web - based free content project to list cable and connectors pin-outs .
Pinout or pin-out is a term used in electronics to describe how an electrical cable is wired , or the function of each wire ( pin ) in a connector .
An electrical connector typically consists of several electrical contacts or pins that can be used to carry electrical power or signals .
Due to the wide variety of applications and manufacturers , a wide selection of electrical connectors exists with different types and numbers of contacts or pins .
The pinout of a connector identifies each individual pin , which is critical when creating cable assemblies and adapters .
Proper identification of pins and wires ensures that the signals and power are transmitted across cables and connectors .
The archive is organized into the following categories :
A research team led by Microsoft 's Helen Wang recently published a report about an experimental browser prototype called " Gazelle " that uses processes to isolate page content elements originating from different domains .
It builds on the concept of multiprocess browsing but uses more fine - grained isolation to expand on the security advantages that are already delivered by existing multiprocess browsing models .
But is it an operating system , Microsoft Research 's analogue to Google 's Chrome OS ?
Not quite .
Wang 's characterization of Gazelle as a " multi- principal operating system " for the Web has been widely misinterpreted by the press .
Although Gazelle 's architecture is loosely modeled on the underlying concepts of operating system design , it is not actually an operating system , it 's not intended to replace Windows , and it wo n't compete with Chrome OS .
It is a browser prototype that runs on Windows Vista , is coded in C# , and has a conventional user interface that is built with .
NET 's WinForms framework .
Multiprocess browsing , which is supported in Google 's Chrome Web browser and recent versions of Internet Explorer , uses separate operating system processes to isolate the rendering of individual pages .
As we have recently discussed in our coverage of multiprocess browsing , this approach generally boosts security and stability .
It prevents a rendering bug that affects a specific page or plugin from tanking the whole browser .
Multiprocess browsing is advantageous , but it does have some downsides .
Processes tend to generate a lot of resource overhead , especially on Windows .
In order to minimize the impact of using multiple processes , Chrome and IE try to use some number of processes that provides a good balance between resource efficiency and stability .
For example , if you have multiple tabs open that show different pages from the same website , the browser might put them all into one process .
The Gazelle project casts aside that balance and aims to maximize security and stability by using more processes .
Instead of just using a separate process for each site or tab , it will use separate processes for individual page content elements that originate from other domains .
For example , if you have an iframe in a page , the iframe will be managed and rendered in its own process separate from the rest of the page .
Gazelle uses interprocess communication ( IPC ) to facilitate interaction between the various pieces of the browser .
All communication is mediated by the browser 's " kernel , " a central component that is also responsible for handling the browser 's user interface .
All network and filseystem operations such as loading and caching are handled directly by the kernel .
Gazelle 's approach can theoretically maximize the security of browsing by preventing individual content items ( referred to as " principals " in the research paper ) from interfering with the operation of others and from accessing the system hardware .
How it works
The research paper provides technical insight into how the prototype was implemented .
It 's largely a .NET application that uses Internet Explorer 's " Trident " rendering engine .
It does so by using headless instances of the Windows .
Forms .
WebBrowser control , a managed code wrapper for the ActiveX WebBrowser component .
( This should be familiar to those of you who have made .NET GUI applications with Visual Studio . )
When a page loads , Gazelle instantiates a separate WebBrowser control in a new process for each iframe and other similar foreign content elements .
The code running in these processes uses the IViewObject COM interface to generate bitmap images of the rendered content from the WebBrowser controls .
These bitmaps are then passed back to the browser 's " kernel " component .
Gazelle 's IPC mechanism uses an XML message format and uses named pipes to transmit the data .
The browser kernel is responsible for composing all of the individual bitmaps from the various processes to generate a rendered page image .
It tracks the positioning , dimensions , and stacking order of the page elements that are being rendered in separate processes so that it can assemble the bitmaps accurately as it builds the final page view .
The completed image is displayed to the user in a WinForms PictureBox control on a tab in the browser 's user interface .
It 's clear that a lot of careful thought went into developing the underlying architectural concepts , but it seems like the implementation itself was thrown together in Visual Studio using relatively standard .NET components .
This strongly reflects the fact that Gazelle is a research project and not a product .
The researchers ran into several problems while creating their prototype .
They were unable to find a practical way to use the WebBrowser APIs to intercept all of the network operations .
As a workaround , they configured the WebBrowser controls to use a local Web proxy which they connected to the Gazelle kernel .
They also had some problems with page layout , particularly in cases where they were rendering individual off - site images in separate processes .
For simplicity , they decided to allow page processes to handle off - site images rather than isolating them in their own processes .
The Gazelle project is currently limited in scope .
The researchers were primarily interested in exploring the architectural implications of an extreme approach to multiprocess browsing ; they were n't trying to deliver in practice the hypothetical security benefits it could someday offer .
It 's important to note that they do n't actually have code - level sandboxing yet , which means that the underlying platform would still be vulnerable if one of the rendering processes was compromised .
" Our interposition layer ensures that our Trident components are never trusted with sensitive operations , such as network access or display rendering .
However , if a Trident renderer is compromised , it could bypass our interposition hooks and compromise other principals using the underlying OS 's APIs , " the report explains .
" To prevent this , we are in the process of implementing an OS - level sandboxing mechanism , which would prevent Trident from directly accessing sensitive OS APIs .
The feasibility of such a browser sandbox has already been established in Xax and Native Client . "
Native Client is a project that was launched last year by Google to build a browser plugin that will enable secure execution of native code in Web browsers .
Microsoft 's Gazelle researchers acknowledge that its sandboxing model is viable and could potentially be applicable to some of the same problems that they are trying to solve .
Another obvious limitation of Gazelle is that its process - heavy architecture necessarily introduces additional latency and memory overhead .
The researchers provide some tables in their paper to show how it compares to Internet Explorer .
Loading Google ( no , not Bing ) in a new tab in Gazelle took 939 milliseconds and increased the browser 's memory footprint by 16MB .
By comparison , the same operation in Internet Explorer 7 took 499 milliseconds and only 1.4MB .
Although Gazelle will necessarily always use more resources than a browser that spawns processes less aggressively , the researchers believe that they could eventually improve the performance and memory footprint to the point where it would be acceptable for regular usage .
The prototype is basically unoptimized , so there may still be room for meaningful performance improvements .
Gazelle is a fascinating experiment that provides real insight into where multiprocess browsing could potentially go in the future .
As computing resources become cheaper , the security benefits of more pervasive compartmentalization will increasingly outweigh the added latency and memory overhead .
As that occurs , it 's possible that mainstream browsers could start to look more like Gazelle .

Russia 's launch of Sputnik in 1957 triggered a crisis of confidence in the U.S. that helped drive the creation of a space program .
Now , Russia is comparing the U.S. 's achievements in supercomputing with theirs , and they do n't like what they see .
In a speech on Tuesday , Russia 's President , Dmitry Medvedev , criticized his country 's IT industry almost to the point of sarcasm for failing to develop supercomputing technology , and urged a dramatic change in Russia 's use of high - performance computing .
Medvedev , at the opening address of a Security Council Meeting on Supercomputers in Moscow , told attendees that 476 out of the 500 supercomputers on the Top500 list were manufactured in the United States .
" Therefore , in general , our situation is very difficult , " he said .
Medvedev was clear about his blame for this gap .
" If we are talking seriously , a huge number of entrepreneurs , not to mention officials , do not know what supercomputers are :
For them it is an exotic type of those machines that were created in the 1920s to catch up and overtake America , " Medvedev said in remarks published on a government Web site .
" Today businesses and federal agencies do not manifest their interest in supercomputer technology , " Medvedev said .
Although supercomputers are widely used in Western countries to , for instance , build aircraft , Medvedev said few aircraft in Russia have been built using supercomputers .
Most of their design today is still being done on paper , he said , but " only a digital approach can have a breakthrough effect , lead to dramatic improvements in quality , and reduce the cost of the product . "
Medvedev promised to invest in supercomputing technology , and warned that without it " our products will not be competitive or of interest to potential buyers . "
He outlined objectives that included organizing a system for training experts in Russian universities , developing specialized software and building grids that would allow multiple computers to share resources .
Russia is not without advantages in high - performance computing .
The engineering and mathematical discipline that helped Russia build Sputnik continues today .
Western companies have established research and development facilities in Russia to tap into the country 's technical talent .
Russia has commercial development in high - performance computing .
T - Platforms in Moscow is one such company that is now entering the European market .
Earl Joseph , a high - performance computing analyst at IDC , said T - Platforms is selling its systems as complete services that include the scientific and engineering needed to use the platforms .
" It 's the first company that we have seen that has done it on any major scale , " Joseph said .
By bundling scientific and engineering help around systems built with commodity hardware , the firm is trying to capitalize on country 's academic strength .
Steve Conway , also a high - performance computing analyst at IDC , said Russia had a strong base of scientists and engineers capable of using supercomputers , and said there has already been cooperation in the oil sector on their use .
" [ Russians ] certainly seem to know that supercomputers are very closely tied to innovation , " Conway said .
An Economy on Life Support
Our faith is weakening .
That is , our faith that the government will be able to cause inflation , sooner or later .
Let ‚Äôs review our own narrative : deflation now , inflation later .
It ‚Äôs very simple .
Maybe too simple .
After a half a century of credit expansion , we now have a credit contraction .
In this sense , everything is happening as it should .
There was a crash and credit crunch at the end of last year .
Then , the feds panicked .
They fought back with monetary and fiscal stimulus .
Rates were cut to nearly zero .
The Fed flooded the system with cash and easy credit ‚Äì buying up Wall Street ‚Äôs bad investments ‚Ä¶ propping up bad banks ‚Ä¶ and guaranteeing trillions worth of bad debt .
And the federal government passed a stimulus program that authorized more than $ 700 billion in spending .
Beginning on March 9th , we also got a big bounce in the world ‚Äôs stock markets ‚Äì just as we should .
US stocks are up about 40 % since then .
Some foreign markets are up even more .
Russian stocks , for example , have more than doubled .
Chinese stocks are up more than 60 % .
As the bounce continued , people began to get the wrong idea .
They thought they saw ‚Äò green shoots ‚Äô and the ‚Äò light at the end of the tunnel . ‚Äô
But if the economy is really improving , we have n‚Äôt seen much evidence of it here at The Daily Reckoning headquarters .
As near as we can tell , housing prices are still going down and unemployment is still going up ‚Ä¶ and most important ‚Ä¶ people are still acting as though we were on the downward slope of the credit cycle .
The latest numbers we ‚Äôve seen show that they saved more money in the first half of the year than the total in extra ‚Äò stimulus ‚Äô that they received .
Savings ‚Äì last reported at 5 % in this space ‚Äì are now close to 7 % .
This is a just what you ‚Äôd expect .
But it is a huge turnaround , too .
As to housing prices , there are a million option ARMs still to be reset over the next four years .
They wo n‚Äôt peak out until 2011 ‚Ä¶ with average increases of about 80 % .
That will cause hundreds of thousands more houses to be dumped onto the market ‚Ä¶ and probably push the bottom of the housing decline to 2012 .
As long as housing prices are falling , jobs are declining , and consumers are inclined to save rather than spend , there will be no real recovery .
In our book , recovery is impossible anyway .
Because the pre-crisis economy had reached the terminal stages of the credit cycle .
It was like someone in the terminal stages of a fatal illness .
After they have died , you do n‚Äôt wish that they could recover ‚Ä¶and be just like they were before they died .
They were sick and dying then !
No , you sign the book of memories and condolences and turn the page .
You let new life take the place of the dead .
You move on .
But the feds have their ghoulish agenda .
They have the poor thing on life - support .
One tube feeds the oxygen of easy credit .
Another drips in more ‚Äò stimulus . ‚Äô
The economy rattles every time it breathes .
Dead companies , such as GM , say they are reborn .
But take away the tubes ‚Ä¶ and they collapse .
Dead - in - the - water households learn to live submerged in debt ‚Ä¶ with special tubes provided by the feds ‚Äì such as the underwater mortgage refinancing offered by Fannie and Freddie , where homeowners can get up to 125 % of the value of their houses .
And the brain dead economists at the Fed and the Treasury department continue to offer their elixirs and panaceas ‚Äì even though they have never worked .
Everything is happening as it should , in other words .
But what happens next ?
Ah ‚Ä¶ this is where it gets tough .
Because we ‚Äôre losing our faith .
We figured the economy would continue to worsen ( after all , you ca n‚Äôt correct a half - century credit expansion in a few months ) ‚Ä¶ and that the feds would continue to fight it .
As more and more people lose their jobs , the feds would become more and more desperate .
Gradually , they ‚Äôd come to see that they needed to use stronger , more experimental techniques .
This would lead them to be a bit bolder with their ‚Äò quantitative easing , ‚Äô otherwise known as ‚Äú a little technology called the printing press , ‚Äù to quote Ben Bernanke .
We figured that sooner or later , the feds would get the hang of causing inflation .
So , we could just buy gold and wait .
But now we see ; we are trapped ‚Ä¶ just like the feds themselves .
Do we hedge against further economic deterioration ‚Ä¶ deflation ‚Ä¶ and falling asset prices ?
Or do we hedge against inflation ‚Ä¶ a falling dollar ‚Ä¶ and a collapsing bond market ?
What if we hold our big position in gold ‚Ä¶ and feds NEVER are able to cause inflation ?
What if the pain of the depression is never severe enough to make them go whole hog on quantitative easing ?
What if the Chinese put it to them straight : if M2 goes up more than 10 % a year ‚Ä¶we stop financing your deficits ?
Gold could sink ‚Ä¶or go nowhere ‚Ä¶ for the next 10 years .
Are we prepared to sit it out ‚Ä¶?
It ‚Äôs time to go back to the pub ‚Ä¶
This morning our thoughts turn to Goldman .
The news yesterday told us that Goldman execs paid themselves $ 700 million in bonuses ‚Äì while receiving bailout money .
This morning , stocks in Asia are rising ; they say it ‚Äôs because Goldman had a good quarter ‚Äì wiping out its loss from the last quarter of last year ‚Ä¶
The news :
‚Äú Goldman Sachs reported second quarter earnings of $ 2.72 billion , up on last year ‚Äôs $ 2.05 billion , and easily surpassing forecasts thanks to big gains in trading and underwriting . ‚Äù
The New York Times offers more details :
‚Äú Analysts estimate that the bank will set aside enough money to pay a total of $ 18 billion in compensation and benefits this year to its 28,000 employees , or more than $ 600,000 an employee .
Top producers stand to earn millions .
‚Äú Goldman Sachs is betting on the markets , but the markets are also betting on Goldman :
Its share price has soared 68 percent this year , closing at $ 141.87 on Friday .
The stock is still well off its record high of $ 250.70 , reached in 2007 .
‚Äú In essence , Goldman has managed to do again what it has always done so well : embrace risks that its rivals feared to take and , for the most part , manage those risks better than its rivals dreamed possible .
‚Äú For all its success , Goldman is not impregnable .
In addition to the federal money it took last fall , it benefited from the government ‚Äôs bailout of the American International Group , being paid 100 cents on the dollar for its $ 13 billion counterparty exposure to the insurer , and it has $ 28 billion in outstanding debt issued cheaply with the backing of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . ‚Äù
Not everybody likes a winner .
There are some who think there is something underhanded and un-American about how Goldman does business .
Making billions trading bonds ?
It is almost as if they knew better than anyone else what the feds would do next .
Maybe they do .
The DR Australia ‚Äôs Dan Denning offers his two cents on the subject :
‚Äú We ‚Äôd suggest that whatever Goldman did to goose earnings is probably not going to be possible for the rest of corporate America . ‚Äù
Furthermore , Denning points out , most other American financial institutions are continuing to play ‚Äú hide the bad asset . ‚Äù
‚Äú A New York Times story suggests that government capital injections and loan guarantees , along with new equity offerings , have allowed banks to evade the inevitable consequences of the popped credit bubble .
‚Äú ‚Äò The capital provided by the government through TARP , etc. has allowed the banks to continue holding deteriorated assets at values far in excess of their true market value , ‚Äô says Daniel Alpert of Westwood Capital in a note to clients , according to the Times .
‚Äò It is unrealistic to believe that home or commercial real estate values are destined to recover any meaningful portion of bubble - era pricing . ‚Äô
‚Äú This means all the new equity raised by banks after the stress - tests has merely papered over capital adequacy and solvency issues for now , ‚Äù Denning continues .
‚Äú The banks have simply refused to revalue loans on their books and continue to carry them at unrealistically high valuations .
If they sold them , they ‚Äôd get a lot less for them , forcing them to raise more capital ( or wiping out their capital and revealing them to be insolvent ) ‚Ä¶
‚Äú The default and foreclosure data coming out of the US housing market suggest the banks are kidding themselves , or misleading shareholders , or both ! ‚Äù says Denning .
‚Äú It ‚Äôs the sort of calculated mistruth that can cause a short - term crisis to last years and years .
The correction is postponed through phony accounting .
It leads to an ‚Äò Ushinawareta Junene , ‚Äô or ‚Äò lost decade , ‚Äô as the Japanese say . ‚Äù
Until tomorrow ,

Warren Buffett Backs Second Stimulus
But the legendary investor is critical of the first package .
July 9 , 2009 ¬ó --
As debate grows about a possible second stimulus package for the flagging American economy , at least one legendary investor is giving the idea his guarded approval .
" I think that a second one may well be called for , " Warren Buffett , the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway , told " Good Morning America " today .
But , he added , " you hope it does n't get watered down in many ways . "
Buffett cautioned that a second stimulus package , like the first , wo n't be " a panacea , " because stimulus packages take time to work .
He criticized lawmakers ' work on the first stimulus package , which contained $ 787 billion in spending .
" Our first stimulus bill ... was sort of like taking half a tablet of Viagra and having also a bunch of candy mixed in ... as if everybody was putting in enough for their own constituents , " he said .
" It does n't have really quite the wall that might have been anticipated there . "
Buffett also criticized the government 's public - private investment plan , through which private investors are supposed to buy so - called toxic assets off the balance sheets of ailing banks that received billions in government aid .
" I do not like the idea of any kind of a plan involving the government where Wall Street makes a lot of money .
My plan provided that they would make no money whatsoever , and the American public would make the money .
I just think that Wall Street owes the American people one at this point , " he said .
Nebraska native Buffett , known as the " Oracle of Omaha " for his long history of prescient stock picks , said that despite the talk of recent economic " green shoots , " he could n't predict when the flagging economy would bounce back .
" We are not in a freefall , but we are not in a recovery either , " Buffett said .
" We were in a freefall really in the last quarter of last year , starting in the financial markets and spreading to the economy , and we had this huge change in behavior .
That change has n't changed . "
The U.S. unemployment rate , which currently stands at 9.5 percent , still " has a ways to go " before it peaks , he said .
His own company , he said , had to lay off 500 people .
" We did n't want to do it , and if we saw things coming back we would n't do it , " he said .
Warren Buffett : Recession a ' Shock to the System '
Buffett said he 's never seen a recession affect consumers the way the current one has .
" I have never seen it quite happen like this , but what happened was in late September , the American public ‚Ä¶ saw money market funds break the buck .
They saw commercial papers stop , they saw all kinds of things that they had n't seen before , " he said .
" It was a shock to the system . "
Still , Buffett remains optimistic .
" I want to emphasize , we are going to come out of this better than ever , " he said .
" I mean the best days of America , by far , lie ahead .
But not next week or next month and then , I do n't know exactly when we will come out , but we will come out big time . "
Second Stimulus Debate Grows
Talk of a second stimulus has grown , as the economy shows limited signs of improvement .
" It looks like the economy is weaker than expected .
Why not begin to think about over the next several months whether we need a stimulus package and what it should include , " Laura D'Andrea Tyson , Obama 's economic adviser said recently .
Some , including Nobel Prize - winning economist Paul Krugman , support the second stimulus idea , but Republicans doubt it will yield any results .
" All of this talk about a second stimulus bill has been rather interesting , " House Minority Leader John Boehner , R - Ohio , said Wednesday at a news conference with other House Republicans .
" I think it 's an admission on the part of the administration that their stimulus plan is not working . "
Other stimulus critics say another recovery will only worsen the situation .
" Even though the president on the first of July had said that the stimulus bill had ' done its job , ' my constituents see it differently , " said Rep. Mike Pence , R - Ind .
" The only thing the stimulus plan has stimulated is more government and more debt . "
Obama has n't said directly whether he would approve of a second stimulus plan , but he also has n't rejected it altogether .
" The question that some have argued is , OK , what next ?
Maybe you stop the freefall , but you still have close to 10 percent unemployment , and , you know , this is something that we wrestle with constantly , " Obama said in an interview with ABC News ' Jake Tapper Tuesday .
" The more that we can do to stimulate the economy in the short term , the challenge we 've got as everybody knows is that we inherited a big deficit , and it is at a certain point potentially counterproductive if we 're spending more money than we 're having to borrow . "
The president said supporters like Buffett have " legitimate concerns " about the economy , and hence his administration wants to make sure that " those pillars of long term economic growth get put in place . "

In February , President Barack Obama signed a $ 787 billion stimulus bill while making lavish promises about the results .
He pledged that " a new wave of innovation , activity and construction will be unleashed all across America . "
He also said the stimulus would " save or create up to four million jobs . "
Vice President Joe Biden said the massive federal spending plan would " drop - kick " the economy out of the recession .
But the unemployment rate today is 9.5 % -- nearly 20 % higher than the Obama White House said it would be with ...
A handsome , welcoming new border crossing has had its 21 - foot - high yellow " United States " letters scrapped because crazy border people are afraid that the words " United States " will serve as an irresistible temptation for terrorists .
Four years ago , when the federal General Services Administration unveiled its plans for a new border - crossing station here in northeastern New York State , the design was presented as part of the agency 's campaign to raise the dismal standards of government architecture .
Even many in the famously fractious architectural community celebrated the complex ‚Äî particularly its main building , emblazoned with glossy yellow , 21 - foot - high letters spelling " United States " ‚Äî as a rare project the government could point to with pride ‚Ä¶
Yet three weeks ago , less than a month after the station opened , workers began prying the big yellow letters off the building 's facade on orders from Customs and Border Protection .
The plan is to dismantle the rest of the sign this week ‚Ä¶
" There were security concerns , " said Kelly Ivahnenko , a spokeswoman for the customs agency .
" The sign could be a huge target and attract undue attention .
Anything that would place our officers at risk we need to avoid . "
Ghana 's elected President Kwame Nkrumah was overthrown in a US - backed coup in 1966 .
By Tony Iltis
July 18 , 2009 -- US
President Barack Obama used his African heritage in his July 11 speech to the Ghanaian parliament in Accra as justification for proceeding to blame Africa ‚Äôs problems on its own people .
He acknowledged historical Western crimes , but denied that ongoing suffering is caused by the current policies of the West .
Western aggression and exploitation , Obama claims , are things of the past .
A July 15 Los Angeles Times editorial said : ‚Äú It was the same message about good governance they ‚Äôd heard from presidents [ Bill ] Clinton and George W. Bush .
No new programs or initiatives for Africa .
But just because the message is old does n't mean it 's not worth repeating . ‚Äù
Obama played up his own ancestry to appeal to his audience .
He referred to the indignities his grandfather suffered under British colonial rule in Kenya , including being briefly imprisoned during the independence struggle of the 1950s and ‚Äô60s .
Having thus established his credibility , he continued : ‚Äú Yes , a colonial map that made little sense helped to breed conflict ...
But the West is not responsible for the destruction of the Zimbabwean economy over the last decade , or wars in which children are enlisted as combatants . ‚Äù
Actually , the West has a direct responsibility for both , and for the endemic corruption and authoritarianism that Obama identified as a major cause of Africa ‚Äôs problems .
The destruction of the Zimbabwean economy , for instance , is not just a result of President Robert Mugabe ‚Äôs corruption and mismanagement , but even more his government implementing neoliberal policies dictated by Western financial institutions .
Slave trade and colonialism
Obama acknowledged the criminal history of the slave trade .
The slave trade came to an end in the 19th century , largely as a result of slave uprisings in the Caribbean , most notably the Haitian revolution of 1791 - 1805 .
On the back of the slave trade , Europe and North America developed societies more wealthy , militarily powerful and technologically advanced than any previous civilisation .
In the 19th century , the British set about conquering Africa .
Although less than a century earlier the British were the biggest slave traders in history , this conquest was justified as fighting slavery .
Other European powers followed suit .
In 1885 , Africa was literally carved up at a conference in Berlin , without regard for pre-existing linguistic and political boundaries .
This ‚Äú colonial map that made little sense ‚Äù is still the basis for the political map of Africa today .
As much as slavery , colonialism meant the development and enrichment of the West at Africa ‚Äôs expense .
Again , millions died .
In the Congo , King Leopold of Belgium systematically enslaved the entire population to produce rubber and ivory .
Between 1885 and 1908 , 13 million people were killed .
In the mid-20th century , more than 3 million people were killed in the construction of the Brazzaville - Ocean Railway by France .
The creation of such infrastructure , which connected Africa ‚Äôs raw materials to points of export to Europe , was described as giving Africa the benefits of Western civilisation .
The same process continues today and is now called ‚Äú development ‚Äù .
Like slavery , colonialism was ended by the revolutionary struggles of Africans .
However , the bonds of exploitation have endured .
Assassinations and coups
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo , independence was won in 1960 by a movement led by one of the 20th century ‚Äôs greatest political leaders , Patrice Lumumba .
However , Western powers were not about to accept the loss of control of the DRC , one of the most mineral - rich countries in the world .
Less than a year later , the US and Belgium conspired to have the socialist Lumumba murdered .
After several more US and Belgian - backed coups , in 1965 a brutal , kleptomaniac army officer , Mobutu Sese Seko was installed in power .
For the next 31 years , while Mobutu grew immensely rich from his cut from copper and gold exports and from pocketing ‚Äú development aid ‚Äù , the US used the DRC as base for aggression against neighbouring countries .
One such country was Angola following its 1975 revolution that overthrew Portuguese rule .
Obama spent much of his speech praising his host nation , Ghana , for its progress in building democratic institutions since 1992 .
He neglected to mention that the preceding 26 years of military rule were the result of a 1966 US - backed coup against the democratically elected president Kwame Nkrumah .
‚Äú America will not seek to impose any system of government on any other nation ‚Äù , Obama claimed .
‚Äú The essential truth of democracy is that each nation determines its own destiny .
But what America will do is increase assistance for responsible individuals and responsible institutions , with a focus on supporting good governance . ‚Äù
However , democracy is something that Africans have had to fight for against the US and other Western countries .
This was the case in South Africa , where the US , Britain and Israel supported the apartheid system until its downfall in 1994 .
South Africa ‚Äôs first democratically elected president , Nelson Mandela , was branded a terrorist by US and British leaders during his 27 - year imprisonment .
It was only last year that the US removed Mandela from its state department list of terrorist suspects .
War
In claiming that ‚Äú the West is not responsible for ... wars in which children are enlisted as combatants ‚Äù , Obama is simply wrong .
The multisided war that has killed more than 6 million people in the DRC since 1998 is not simply the result of tribal animosities .
The war has coincided with the information technology boom that has caused a huge demand for the mineral coltan .
Coltan is used in mobile phones , computers , iPods and other electronic gadgets .
The DRC has most of the world ‚Äôs coltan reserves .
The war is over control of coltan mines and the forced labour to work them .
The armies of Uganda and Rwanda , both US allies , sell coltan from the DRC to Rwandan dealers .
The US imports most of its coltan from Rwanda , which does not have its own coltan reserves .
Obama said military conflict was a ‚Äú millstone around Africa ‚Äôs neck ‚Äù .
He cited Somalia , which has been fought over by warring militias since the last central government collapsed in 1991 , as a threat to stability .
He neglected to mention that in 2006 , when a coalition government led by Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed restored stability , this administration was overthrown by a US - instigated Ethiopian invasion .
Ethiopian occupation cost 10,000 lives .
Obama called on Africans to extradite African war criminals to the International Criminal Court in the Hague .
However , when Rwanda tried last year to extradite 33 French political and military leaders charged with organising the 1994 genocide that killed more than a million Rwandans , France treated the move with derision .
Other Western countries ignored it .
To the West , that European war criminals should stand trial in Africa is unthinkable .
Obama said the US and the West would continue giving Africa ‚Äú development aid ‚Äù , but African nations could not rely on this indefinitely .
This ignores the fact that most ‚Äú development aid ‚Äù is used to service debts from variable interest rate loans foisted on African countries , often governed by unaccountable dictators , by Western governments and institutions .
A July 16 Pambazuka article said that between 1990 and 2003 , African countries received US $ 540 billion in loans , paid back $ 580 billion in total and still owed $ 330 billion .
Such ‚Äú aid ‚Äù is merely another way of bleeding the impoverished continent .
Furthermore , Western aid and loans come with conditions .
These were described by the 2005 G8 finance ministers as the ‚Äú elimination of impediments to private investment , both domestic and foreign ‚Äù .
Typically , this means aid and loans are conditional on African countries privatising public services such as transport , water supply , sewerage , education and health , taking these services out of the reach of the poor majority .
Lack of water , sanitation , food security , medicines and healthcare kills 11 million children each year .
It also means respect for ‚Äú intellectual property rights ‚Äù , thereby denying Africans the ability to produce badly needed medicines patented by Western pharmaceutical corporations .
It also involves ending protective tariffs for agricultural imports , while Western countries continue to massively subsidise their agricultural sectors .
Every cow in the European Union receives a $ 2 daily government handout ‚Äî twice the income of 1.2 billion people .
In Ghana , this means imported food is cheaper than that locally produced , destroying Ghana ‚Äôs agricultural industry .
If the wealth that flows from Africa to the West from debt repayments , Western corporations buying privatised infrastructure and the exploitation of African labour are calculated , it changes the picture of who is giving aid to whom .
And that is without even taking the preceding centuries of the slave trade and colonialism into account .

The solar - powered flowers generate electricity and provide free Wi-Fi for anyone passing by .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
As part of Toyota 's national marketing campaign for the third generation Prius launch in 2010 , the company is " planting " giant solar - powered flowers in urban areas .
The flowers generate electricity and provide free Wi-Fi for anyone passing by .
Meant to represent the Prius theme of " Harmony between Man , Nature , and Machine , " the 18 - foot flowers have solar cells behind their petals and at the base of the stem .
The generated electricity travels down the stem to plastic green benches with 110 - volt outlets .
Each of the five flower provide room for up to 10 people to sit while charging their cell phones , laptops and other devices .
Currently appearing in Boston , the solar flowers will later travel to New York , Chicago , Seattle , San Francisco and Los Angeles .
The flowers operate daily from 8:00 am to 9:00 pm .
In addition to the flowers , Toyota is also demonstrating solar ventilation bus shelters in some cities .
The shelters feature solar panels on the roof that operate fans and circulate air within the shelter .
This system serves as a model of the Prius ' solar - powered ventilation system , which uses solar panels on the roof to power a fan that ventilates the car when parked in the sun .

On a personal note : I ‚Äôm not sold on the idea ‚Ä¶ at least not yet .
It ‚Äôs on Columbus Day weekend , so wo n‚Äôt legislators be out of town ?
The notion of descending on our representatives en mass is very appealing , but if no one is there when we are there ‚Ä¶ then what ‚Äôs the point ?
Cleve Jones , whom I deeply respect also said ‚Äú most people on the west coast will be able to come to this march for less than $ 700 . ‚Äù
Cleve , in this economy , plus being unemployed , $ 700 is n‚Äôt cheap , I do n‚Äôt have the cash just lying around to make the trip .
Twice that if my husband comes .
On top of that we pissed a lot of money away on Obama and Prop 8 last year .
I suspect a lot of folks are in a similar boat .
So I am wondering if our time and money is better spent on a local level , than making a trip to Washington , DC ‚Ä¶ which may ultimately be ignored by our leaders , and the media .
What do you think ?

After reading Wired Chris Anderson ‚Äôs ( 2009 ) .
Free : The Future of a Radical Price ( available but ironically only for free to residents from the world ‚Äôs richest country , the US , from SCRIBD ) , I spent some time reflecting on the disruptive effects of ‚Äò free ‚Äô on higher education provision and opportunity .
Free has not only effected media consumption , publishing , and software production but also has capacity to create very disruptive , low end challenges to higher education .
A low end disruption offers a service to a large new market by providing satisfactory ( but not necessarily equivalent , at least at the beginning ) services to large new groups of consumers .
The most publicized example in higher education is the University of the People , founded by Israeli entrepreneur Shai Reshef .
UoPeople is headquartered in California and is now registering students for its first courses to begin in September 2009 .
Mr Reschef provides a good overview of his vision and the logistics of operating a very low cost institution in a recent Higher Ed podcast .
The model being developed is a cohort based with 15 - 20 students following a set online curriculum .
Each section has a tutor ( some of whom are volunteers , ) but most importantly students are encouraged and taught how to question , support , and teach each other .
The curriculum ( Business and Computer Science to date ) seems quite traditional in terms of content with two and four year paths .
The site claims that tuition and exam fees will be low , and for startup has waived all fees .
Mr Reschef has intentions to earn accreditation for programs and thus ability to offer degrees through one of the US Regional Accrediting Boards .
I am increasingly concerned that the high tuition fees charged by accredited institutions , including my own Athabasca University , are resulting in us pricing ourselves out of even the Canadian market - much less the market and opportunity of serving those from developing economies .
Too often , older open and online universities are so concerned with looking , feeling and smelling like REAL universities , that we have not realized the true potential of online education .
As U of People model demonstrates the combination of :
low cost delivery ( online )
low cost content development ( Open Educational Resources ) and exploitation of readily available online resources
strong peer support through social networking and group interaction
development of lifelong , self directed learning skills
combining paid and volunteer labour
transparency in content and activity
It thus exploits ( or serves ) a very strong and compelling opportunity .
Such a model de-couples teaching from research , allowing staff to focus exclusively on providing high quality learning designs and experiences .
The model also does not meet the needs of 18 - 24 year olds from rich countries for whom education is as much a social as an educational experience .
But if it meets its potential , it will create opportunity for millions of new learners at costs they can afford .
Anderson writes
‚Äú The most destructive way to enter a market is to vaporize the economics of an existing business models . ‚Ä¶
The world will beat a path to your door and you can sell them something else ‚Äù p. 43 .
He covers the various ways that profit can be extracted from free services besides bait and switch , noted in this quote .
The vast reduction in costs to develop , share and use digital resources and services creates opportunities for very different models such as providing additional premium services , marketing for other non free products and selling the attention of users to advertisers ( Google and radio model ) .
Obviously the fee scale of the University of the People has potential to ‚Äò vaporize demand ‚Äô for expensive online programs .
The challenge that especially public higher education institutions face is to constantly implement means to reduce costs at all levels of the organization .
In addition , to compete with ‚Äò free ‚Äô , public institutions will have to devise additional review streams ‚Äì beyond government subsidy and tuition so that they are able to continue to serve disadvantaged citizens and meet their continuing ‚Äú open ‚Äù vision and mandate .
Time to Check Your Emotions at The Door !
The summer skies will light up on July 4/5 , 2020 in Capricorn .
Lunar Eclipse and Mercury Retrograde .
With Mercury being retrograde emotions are extremely heightened and it ‚Äôs important you be aware of the planetary aspects that are causing you to feel more emotional than normal .
Do your best to not overreact .
I know that sometimes easier said than done , but you are of the light and can change your part of the world by your actions and emotions .
Again take time to disconnect from everything and go inside yourself and find the peace within .
There is a hunger in my soul that drives me to keep delivering these messages .
I believe there are people out there who want to hear what I am saying about bringing peace and light within you .
This is the only way to true freedom and independence .
The things that we complain about we can change .
It ‚Äôs being willing to really examine yourself and fully evolve into a peaceful being .
In today ‚Äôs world that ‚Äôs not easy to do because it ‚Äôs all about constant invasion of your privacy .
People are connected to their phones and other Electronic Devices and have forgotten how to just be .
My goal on this planet is to somehow reach a few people and help them wake up .
I believe there are those who really want a different life and are willing to make the changes .
The change you make within you will manifest .

MERCED , Calif . -
Here in the Central Valley of California , hard times have hit harder than just about anywhere .
But this is also a stronghold of Republicans ready to shrink the safety net .
One in 5 Merced County adults is out of work , home foreclosures run rampant , and antipoverty programs are stretched to the limit .
This is also a region represented in the State House budget brawl almost exclusively by antitax Republicans , whose push to downsize government collides with a sobering reality :
A greater percentage of their constituents depend on health and welfare than do residents anywhere else in California .
One in 12 residents of Merced County has tapped CalWorks , the state ‚Äôs welfare - to - work program , double the per capita use in Los Angeles County and five times the percentage in San Francisco .
But the region ‚Äôs Republican lawmakers hold fast to a pledge to tame the tax - and - spend cycle of California ‚Äôs Capitol and are backing Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ‚Äôs plan to slash programs for the poor .
Other rural areas in California face the same situation , from the quiet timberlands of the north to the agricultural heartland of the San Joaquin Valley , where high per capita use of public health and welfare coexists with small - government GOP representation .
It is a paradox lingering in the background as the state grapples with a $ 24.3 - billion budget deficit .
Schwarzenegger ‚Äôs budget proposes slashing health and welfare spending by 26.5 percent .
That means eliminating CalWorks , which serves 1.4 million people statewide .
It means killing off Healthy Families and slicing Medi-Cal , affecting more than 2 million people , most of them children .
It means cutting home - care workers for elderly and disabled residents and carving deeply into programs for Alzheimer ‚Äôs and HIV patients .
While about 4 percent of people in Los Angeles County fall back on CalWorks to help land a job , more than 8 percent use the program in the San Joaquin Valley counties of Tulare , Fresno , and Merced , which routinely send GOP lawmakers to Sacramento .
Although the rural demographics are shifting , old political habits die hard , and the GOP retains a political grip in wide swaths of the Central Valley and the far north , said Barbara O‚ÄôConnor , director of the Institute for the Study of Politics and Media at Sacramento State University .
Antipoverty groups say the anomaly is no secret inside the Capitol .
‚Äú We ‚Äôve shown [ Republican lawmakers ] time and time again :
They ‚Äôre voting in ways that are disproportionately more harmful to their own districts , ‚Äô‚Äô said Michael Herald of the Western Center on Law and Poverty .
Rural Republicans say the state ‚Äôs mammoth deficit makes the cuts painful but necessary .
‚Äú The truth is it ‚Äôs going to be one of the tougher votes we ‚Äôll have to do , ‚Äô‚Äô said Assemblyman Mike Villines of Clovis , who as GOP leader broke with Republicans in February to approve major tax increases , an act he vows not to repeat .

THOUSANDS of the worst families in England are to be put in ‚Äú sin bins ‚Äù in a bid to change their bad behaviour , Ed Balls announced yesterday .
The Children ‚Äôs Secretary set out ¬£ 400 million plans to put 20,000 problem families under 24 - hour CCTV super - vision in their own homes .
They will be monitored to ensure that children attend school , go to bed on time and eat proper meals .
Private security guards will also be sent round to carry out home checks , while parents will be given help to combat drug and alcohol addiction .
Around 2,000 families have gone through these Family Intervention Projects so far .
But ministers want to target 20,000 more in the next two years , with each costing between ¬£ 5,000 and ¬£ 20,000 ‚Äì a potential total bill of ¬£ 400 million .
Ministers hope the move will reduce the number of youngsters who get drawn into crime because of their chaotic family lives , as portrayed in Channel 4 comedy drama Shameless .
Sin bin projects operate in half of council areas already but Mr Balls wants every local authority to fund them .
He said : ‚Äú This is pretty tough and non-negotiable support for families to get to the root of the problem .
There should be Family Intervention Projects in every local authority area because every area has families that need support . ‚Äù
But Shadow Home Secretary Chris Grayling said : ‚Äú This is all much too little , much too late .
‚Äú This Government has been in power for more than a decade during which time anti-social behaviour , family breakdown and problems like alcohol abuse and truancy have just got worse and worse . ‚Äù
Mr Balls also said responsible parents who make sure their children behave in school will get new rights to complain about those who allow their children to disrupt lessons .
Pupils and their families will have to sign behaviour contracts known as Home School Agreements before the start of every year , which will set out parents ‚Äô duties to ensure children behave and do their homework .
The updated Youth Crime Action Plan also called for a crackdown on violent girl gangs as well as drug and alcohol abuse among young women .
But a decision to give ministers new powers to intervene with failing local authority Youth Offending Teams was criticised by council leaders .
Les Lawrence , of the Local Government Association , said they did ‚Äú crucial ‚Äù work and such intervention was ‚Äú completely unnecessary ‚Äù .
India 's water table has dropped to alarmingly low levels
The authorities in the Indian city of Mumbai ( Bombay ) have reduced water supplies by 30 % as it faces one of the worst water shortages in its history .
The cuts will affect supplies to hundreds of thousands of households as well as hospitals and hotels .
Most lakes that supply water to Indian cities are heavily dependent on monsoon rainfall which this year has been intermittent , officials say .
Mumbai is India 's most populated city and its commercial and film - making hub .
But now correspondents say its 20 million inhabitants face an acute water shortage for the first time in living memory .
The drought in Maharashtra in the west comes as half a million people have been stranded as rivers burst their banks due to flooding in the north - eastern state of Assam .
Alarming
If more rain does not arrive soon , the lakes which supply Mumbai will recede still further .
The BBC's Prachi Pinglay in Mumbai says that rainfall figures are alarming compared with last year .
In many areas of the state of Maharashtra and its capital , there has been only 25 % of the rainfall received by this time last year .
Residents in several areas of Mumbai are now concerned about having to buy water from private water supply tankers as the five main lakes which supply the city now have levels between four to 10 metres lower than at this time last year .
The city corporation has urged citizens to save water and use it sparingly .
They say one lake has enough water to last for the next three weeks , while two others have reserves for about two months .
Jayshree Ranade , a resident of Girgaum , south Mumbai , says that her household barely gets 45 minutes of water supply a day .
" We get water at about 4.45 am and it 's gone before 5.45 am .
Earlier we used to get water for more than two hours , " she told the BBC .
" In my building all the families wake up at 4.30 am and everyone has to have a shower , wash clothes , utensils and fill up the water tank - all before 5.45 am .
It 's a mad rush .
Children wake up , get ready and go back to sleep . "
The authorities now say they are also considering seeding clouds to generate artificial rainfall .
The civic corporation has also reduced water supplies to swimming pools in five - star hotels and clubs .
Officials say that there are two ways to impose a water cut - one by reducing the number of hours of water supply and , second , to cut the supply at source .
India 's capital , Delhi , is also reeling from depleted water supplies , while many towns and villages across the country still have woefully inadequate safe drinking water facilities .
They depend largely on bore wells , which have seriously depleted the country 's water table .
The BBC's Zubair Ahmed in Mumbai says farm produce is also likely to be badly affected if the full monsoon does not arrive soon .

Wally dabbles in crime
Wally says , " A lot of people think crime is a bad thing . "
Wally says , " But it all depends on how you pick your role models . "
Wally says , " I lean toward governors , bankers , athletes and sith lords . "

We feature downloads of all kinds every day at Lifehacker .
Today , however , we 're bundling all the best free downloads for new computer owners , re-installers , would - be geeks , or anyone who wants to save time installing the best stuff out there .
This is our 2009 Lifehacker Pack for Windows computers .
Advertisement
The idea is the same as when we first introduced the Lifehacker Pack more than three years ago ‚Äî a single , handy list that we think improves the computer lives of Windows users .
We 're also providing a utility to download some or all of these applications at once ‚Äî more on that after the list .
Advertisement
You can head directly to each application 's download page from the [ Download ] links following their write - ups , and see what Lifehacker originally wrote about them at the [ LH Post ] link .
If there 's a portable version of an application that you can run off a thumb drive and / or test out without installing , we 've linked to that at [ Portable ] , or added a " + Portable " to the main download link .
Onto the list !
Productivity
Foxit Reader - Opens , save , and prints PDFs much faster and lighter than Adobe 's official reader , whether on your desktop or through your browser , and it wo n't nag you every two hours to update it or its " components . "
There are some down - sides , like how it asks to install a browser toolbar during installation , and some reported difficulties with multiple monitors .
But if a document absolutely wo n't work with anything but Adobe - sanctioned Reader , try Adobe Reader Lite , which cuts out all the " Maybe You 'll Also Like " add - ons and extras out of Adobe 's product and leaves just its basic rendering intact .

Notepad ++ -
If you just want to write , save , and edit text , it 's hard to go wrong with Notepad ++.
This freebie offers tabbed file views , syntax coloring for those working in HTML or other code , and , as the name implies , does a whole lot of what most people wish Notepad did .
If you want a free office suite that offers most of what Microsoft 's Office suite does , try OpenOffice.org .
If you love working in the constantly - backed - up cloud , try the Zoho or Google Docs suites .

Firefox -
All debates about security , memory use , or compatibility amongst the web browsers aside , Firefox can adapt to nearly anyone 's browsing habits through a range of adaptations .
Whether that 's an extension / add - on ( and here are our top 10 picks ) , a Greasemonkey script ( again , our 10 ) , or some deep - down about : config tweaks , Firefox can probably be what you want it to be .
Put down the Internet Explorer and slowly back away into a better web life .

Pidgin -
Do you ever use AOL / AIM , Google Talk , MSN , Yahoo , ICQ , Jabber , or even old - school IRC to chat online ?
Pidgin has you covered , and it 's got plenty of recommendable plug-ins .
It can tab your chats in a single window , update you on new emails , and work inside most any smiley system out there ( which has , oddly enough , become a notable issue ) .
And while the up - and - coming IM app and - then - some Digsby has garnered a lot of users , its large footprint and questionable installation choices ( it 's got a really unfriendly installer that tries installing a lot of adware ) keep us firmly in the Pidgin camp for now .

If you 're not using your email 's web interface , use this .
It 's basically Thunderbird , the open - source email client we 'd previously included in our Lifehacker pack , but remixed with stronger , almost Gmail - like powers .
It finds and indexes all the attachments in your email account , groups together conversations with similar subject chains with the " Gather " command ( like Gmail 's conversations ) , offers tabbed inbox and message views , and lets you organize emails under your own chosen " Topics . "
It 's also got built - in easy setup steps for Gmail and other webmail systems ‚Äî in other words , everything we 're waiting to see Thunderbird implement .

Everything - Does what you really want when you hit " Search " in Windows .
It 's really tiny , does n't need to be installed if you do n't want , and searches for files across your system with the speed of a jackrabbit gone rogue on old - school cold medicine .
Faster than that , really , and it makes finding and deleting file types , digging through your browser cache , and any other file search task far faster .
We used to recommend Google Desktop for a system - wide search tool , and it certainly has its merits ‚Äî including some neat gadgets for Gmail and Google Calendar ‚Äî but , in most cases , you 're not going to need to find a single word out of every single document on your system .
You just want that apples.doc thing , wherever it is , and Everything finds it as fast as you can type it .

¬µ Torrent - Also known as uTorrent .
If you 're a complete newcomer to BitTorrent , uTorrent makes it easy .
Install it , and any torrent file you click on is automatically handled and grabbed by uTorrent , and saved in your Downloads folder , making a seemingly nerd - core activity as easy as opening an MP3 .
If you 're a BitTorrent pro , you should know that uTorrent 's features ‚Äî remote control and download starting from the web , a phone , or using Dropbox ‚Äî truly set it apart .

Revo Uninstaller - Windows does n't always remove everything that a program leaves behind ‚Äî file folders , Start menu items , menu entries , you name it .
Revo Uninstaller does .
It runs a standard uninstaller , then it searches your system for everything the program changed or touched while it was installing .
If you do n't know the name of a program you want to kill off , or do n't see it offered when Revo starts up , choose " Hunter Mode " and click on a window or message from that program .
Got annoying programs that start up with your computer without permission ?
Yeah , Revo handles them too .
It 's like the software equivalent of bleach .

TeraCopy - Windows is slow , and occasionally fails , at copying large files , or just big batches of them .
TeraCopy copies things between destinations faster , with more options on what to replace or skip based on file dates , and can actually be ( gasp ! ) paused if you need to do something else while The Complete Works of Woody Allen are being transferred .

One of the few software recommendations that this editor 's wife , parents , and other relatives actually stick with after installation .
Google 's free software indexes your computer 's pictures and makes them a snap to flick through , lightly edit without a Photoshop degree , and share through email or uploading to Picasa Web Albums ( or an add - on button ) .
Most important of all , it makes importing pictures from any digital camera a lot more intuitive than Windows ' own process .

It can , in fact , play Apple - formatted tracks with a ( default ) add - on , including any older , copy - protected songs you bought from iTunes , and manages non-iPhone / touch iPods fairly well , but you 'll still need iTunes for restoring , upgrading , and backing up your device .
For music in general , though , Songbird is a nice midway point between iTunes ' big , big tent and a tight little open - source player .

File Backups / Syncing

Dropbox -
Put simply , Dropbox makes synchronizing your files across Windows , Mac , or Linux systems a very simple , almost magical process .
Put a copy of what you 're working on or want saved in your Dropbox folder , and it 's synchronized to your account , which has 2GB to start with , and gets bigger if you recommend friends .
When you 're at another one of your own computers , your Dropbox updates and grabs those files .
If you 're at someone else 's system or on a smartphone , head to Dropbox 's mobile - friendly site and grab what you need .
It 's not quite a backup tool , but it is one of those utilities that makes a lot of old habits ‚Äî thumb drive copying , CD burning , multi-email self - mailing ‚Äî seem unnecessary .

Mozy -
If Dropbox is where you stash the stuff you 're working on or enjoying at the moment , Mozy is the backup service that saves everything for when your system goes black on bootup .
The free accounts for PCs ( and Macs ) offer 2GB of free online space , and with the really smart filtering tools , you can have Mozy crawl your whole system and back up financial documents , Excel sheets , and any file with " Rick " in it .
If you spring for a monthly unlimited plan , Mozy is a smart whole - system saver , one that does n't eat bandwidth when you 're using it , and works when you 're not working .

What is Coccinelle ?
Sponsors
Coccinelle is a program matching and transformation engine which provides the language SmPL ( Semantic Patch Language ) for specifying desired matches and transformations in C code .
Coccinelle was initially targeted towards performing collateral evolutions in Linux .
Such evolutions comprise the changes that are needed in client code in response to evolutions in library APIs , and may include modifications such as renaming a function , adding a function argument whose value is somehow context - dependent , and reorganizing a data structure .
Beyond collateral evolutions , Coccinelle is successfully used ( by us and others ) for finding and fixing bugs in systems code .
The development of Coccinelle has been supported in the past by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche ( France ) under the contracts ANR - 09 - BLAN - 0158-01 and ANR - 05 - BLAN-0383 , the Danish Research Council for Technology and Production Sciences , and INRIA via the cooperative research initiative ARC VeriTLA +.
News
Coccinelle semantic patches are available in the " scripts " directory of Linux .
A gallery of example semantic patches is available at http://coccinellery.org.
We would like to thank the Linux Foundation and Collabora for supporting internships that are helping to improve Coccinelle and the associated infrastructure .

Dr. Sean Khozin , who blogs and can be found on Twitter @ SeanKhozin , is an internist and founding member of Hello Health , a paperless ‚Äú concierge ‚Äù practice based in Brooklyn that utilizes e-mail , instant messaging and video chat for coordinating care .
‚Äú There are so many layers of bureaucracy between health care providers and patients , ‚Äù Dr. Khozin said .
‚Äú We can use social media to coordinate care with patients and with different specialists , all using the same platform .
I can monitor my patients , and they can also use these tools to become empowered through a better understanding of their own disease state and active engagement . ‚Äù
Image Credit ... Getty Images
In Dr. Khozin ‚Äôs practice , that engagement occurs on a secure site , as patient privacy remains a major concern with all forms of social media .
But on platforms such as Twitter and Facebook , where privacy is more difficult to insure , those concerns also extend to physicians .
‚Äú On the one hand it is really good to see the human side of your doctor on a site like Facebook , ‚Äù observed Dr. Daniel Sands ( @DrDannySands ) , a physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston , Mass . , and a consultant with the Cisco Internet Business Solutions Group , as well as co-author of the first set of guidelines ever published on using e-mail in patient care .
‚Äú On the other hand , ‚Äù Dr. Sands continued , ‚Äú maybe letting your patient get too close is n‚Äôt always good for the therapeutic relationship . ‚Äù
Taking on the responsibilities of yet another form of communication can also be onerous for physicians , many of whom already feel overburdened by multiple demands on their time .
‚Äú Physicians are really busy , ‚Äù Dr. Sands said .
‚Äú In our current health care environment , the only commodity they have is time .
Doctors do n‚Äôt want to introduce new technologies of unknown value , which is why many were hesitant about e-mail .
Something like Twitter is going to take longer to accept because the value proposition is even hazier . ‚Äù
Still , there continues to be anecdotal evidence regarding social media ‚Äôs potential to strengthen the patient - doctor bond .
‚Äú One way I see that power is through education , ‚Äù said Dr. Christian Sinclair , a physician for Kansas City Hospice who has created a palliative care network through his blog and Twitter ( @ctsinclair ) .
‚Äú I can help to inform the public , I can put the knowledge I have out there .
And if there are patients or families who need this knowledge , I can help them because of this network . ‚Äù
Dr. Sinclair has , for example , helped individuals he has met through Twitter connect with local hospices , a process he believes was expedited by Twitter ‚Äôs particular platform .
And social media can also help patients and physicians widen illness support networks , which in turn can augment the patient - doctor relationship .
Health care providers have long known that patients with chronic or life - threatening diseases benefit from support groups made up of people who can sympathize and empathize with them .
But such support is difficult for physicians or hospitals and clinics to cobble together when patients and families are physically isolated or homebound , or when they have an orphan disease like Eddie‚Äôs .
‚Äú With social media , ‚Äù Dr. Sands observed , ‚Äú we can aggregate across space and across the world and create a safe environment for support .
Although there may be only 10 people in greater New York with a certain disease , there may be 250 people across the world . ‚Äù
Dr. Sands recalled guiding a patient to the Association of Cancer Online Resources , a social network of online communities for patients and families .
‚Äú That was the most important advice I ever gave him .
It was an information prescription . ‚Äù
No , Dr. McKalip , this is not " funny stuff " .
It 's blatant and hateful racism at its worst and you , especially as a physician and representative of the American Medical Association , should be absolutely ashamed of attacking our President with such filth , regardless of your political views .
Fellow Kossacks , please take a moment to share your thoughts with Dr. McKalip on his racist behavior via email , phone , or fax .
Please keep your comments to him professional and businesslike .
Let 's avoid getting down in the gutter as wingnuts typically do .

about this card
Tradition dictates that I post an older card on Wednesdays , and today 's card explores the same theme as yesterday 's - that is : miscommunication .

Claim : Letter from Sheriff Joe Arpaio rebuffs Rev. Al Sharpton ‚Äôs demands that he resign .
CORRECTLY ATTRIBUTED
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , April 2009 ]
Reverend Al Sharpton
106 West 145th Street
Harlem , New York City , New York 10039
Fax : 212 690 3070 Reverend Al Sharpton106 West 145th StreetHarlem , New York City , New York 10039
Fax : 212 690 3070 Dear Reverend Sharpton : I have read about you with much interest since learning of the protest you plan to lead against me in Maricopa County in June as a way to force my resignation or removal from office .
Your public proclamation leads me to the conclusion : not only do you not understand Arizona ; you also do not understand democracy .
As the elected Sheriff who , so far has been elected to five consecutive four - year terms , I answer to the four million residents of Maricopa County .
I do not answer to the whims of the media , or locally and nationally elected officials who want open borders and who have their own agendas .
Nor do I answer to a publicity hound outside interloper who has demonstrated no interest in looking for the truth before making loud uninformed noises .
While your public outcries are colorful , there are several instances where you have inserted yourself into other people ‚Äôs affairs without knowing any of the facts .
Poor judgment has caused you plenty of trouble in the past and promises to do so again .
Most earnest people want to learn by their mistakes .
You seem to glory in repeating them .
I would like to help you avoid further embarrassment by assisting in your understanding of the illegal immigration problem here in my county .
When and if you do make the trip here , I invite you to call me to talk about these false allegations .
We can discuss how my deputies are extensively trained by the federal government to properly combat illegal immigration and how the laws of this state allow this Sheriff ‚Äôs Office to question and investigate the immigration status of those people deputies detain in the course of our everyday law enforcement duties .
Do n‚Äôt make the same mistake made by the four Democratic Congressmen calling for a U.S. Department of Justice investigation of this office .
They and other politicians relied solely on media reports and anti-law enforcement handouts that are replete with inaccuracies .
They have brainwashed a handful of local residents to believe these lies .
Rest assured that the men and women of the Maricopa County Sheriff ‚Äôs Office do not racially profile anyone .
However , we do enforce the state and federal illegal immigration laws .
And we will continue to do so as long as these laws are on the books .
You can parachute into town , stomp your feet up and down and hold more press conferences against me ‚Äî that is a hallmark of democracy too ‚Äî but you will not stop me , nor slow me down for one second , from doing what is right .
Before you bring your circus to town and take to our streets by marching against this Sheriff , let ‚Äôs get you fully informed for a change .
Congressman John Conyers did not have the courtesy to respond to my invitation to visit with me personally .
I hope you will consider my invitation .
Surely , a man like yourself ‚Äî a reverend ‚Äî who famously preaches from the church pulpit understands the infinite wisdom of these words :
You shall know the truth and the truth will set you free .
Let ‚Äôs talk about the truth , Reverend .
I await your response .
Sincerely , Joe Arpaio
Sheriff , Maricopa County
Origins : In April 2009 , Baptist minister and social activist Al Sharpton called upon Maricopa County ( Arizona ) Sheriff Joe Arpaio to resign after the latter announced he would be making illegal immigration sweeps throughout the county , with Sharpton and ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis proclaiming they would stage protests in the streets of Arizona if Sheriff Arpaio did not step down :
Civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton and ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis jumped into the fray , threatening to bring their vast national networks to march in the streets of Phoenix if Sheriff Joe Arpaio , who is currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) , does not resign immediately .
Civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton and ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis jumped into the fray , threatening to bring their vast national networks to march in the streets of Phoenix if Sheriff Joe Arpaio , who is currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) , does not resign immediately .
In a national press event held via teleconference , civil rights leaders railed about Arpaio ‚Äôs immigration enforcement tactics , charging that the Maricopa County Sheriff ‚Äôs Office ( MCSO ) engages in racial profiling , police brutality , and human rights violations .
Speakers included Sharpton , Lewis , NAACP leaders , and other well - known civil rights activists .
Sharpton and Lewis vowed to come to Arizona personally if Arpaio does not resign immediately .
Arpaio called a press conference in response and told local media that a small group of vocal opponents is trying to intimidate him by publicly calling him and his officers racists .
In response to the Rev. Sharpton ‚Äôs demand , on 13 April 2009 Sheriff Arpaio fired off the defiant letter reproduced above , dismissing Sharpton ‚Äôs call for his resignation as a publicity stunt .
That same day , the MCSO also issued a press release on the issue , stating ( in part ) :
In a letter sent to the flamboyant and often outrageous Reverend Al Sharpton today , Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio told Sharpton that a June 2009 protest he plans to lead against Arpaio is a waste of time .
In addition Arpaio said if Reverend Sharpton bothered to research the facts , he would know there is no basis to Sharpton ‚Äôs publicity ploy .

In addition Arpaio said if Reverend Sharpton bothered to research the facts , he would know there is no basis to Sharpton ‚Äôs publicity ploy .
Today ‚Äôs letter makes it clear that Sharpton will not force Sheriff Arpaio to resign or be removed from office nor will he intimidate Arpaio into backing off from his fight against illegal immigration .
‚Äú If that reverend thinks he is going to change the way we do things here in Maricopa County , then he ‚Äôs got another thing coming , ‚Äù Arpaio says .
Still , as a courtesy to the controversial Sharpton , Arpaio ‚Äôs letter suggested the two men meet if and when the Reverend comes to Phoenix to protest Arpaio ‚Äôs illegal immigration policies .
Sharpton recently announced in a national press conference that he will lend his voice to the chorus of critics rallying against Sheriff Arpaio and his deputy ‚Äôs enforcement of the state and federal anti illegal immigration laws .
Critics , including some locally elected officials , routinely portray Arpaio and his deputies as racists because they enforce state and federal immigration laws .
Sharpton says he will bring hundreds of activists to the Valley in June if Arpaio does n‚Äôt resign from office .
‚Äú He must be living in fantasy land , ‚Äù Arpaio says .
‚Äú Arizona can use some extra tourist funds , so come on down . ‚Äù

Two men appeared in court today charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed , beaten with bricks and had sulphuric acid forced down his throat during an apparent " honour " attack .
The 24 - year - old victim , believed to be a Danish man of Asian origin , is in a critical but stable condition in Broomfield hospital , Chelmsford , Essex .
He is thought to have been blinded , to have suffered up to 50 % burns and to have had his tongue destroyed in the attack , which took place in Leytonstone , east London , on 2 July .
Although the victim managed to raise the alarm after being set upon , by the time the emergency services reached him he was staggering around in agony and unable to speak properly .
Police have refused to comment on reports that officers have warned a married Muslim woman ‚Äì who was allegedly having a relationship with the victim ‚Äì that her life was now at risk .
The two suspects , who are aged 19 and 25 and come from east London but cannot be named for legal reasons , were remanded in custody after appearing at Waltham Forest magistrates court .
They will appear at the Old Bailey on 30 September .
Seven men were originally arrested , although five were released on bail .
One of them , a 16 - year - old , was rearrested yesterday .
Scotland Yard said : " At around 2 am on July 2 a group approached a man in Marchant Road , Leytonstone .
The group threw a noxious liquid over the 24 - year - old victim before stabbing him twice in the back .
The liquid caused serious burns to the victim 's face and chest .
He managed to escape and raise the alarm and an ambulance was called .
He remains in hospital in a critical but stable condition . "
When asked whether it was an " honour " attack , the police spokesman replied : " That is one line of inquiry but officers are keeping an open mind as to the motive . "
Imtiaz Qadir , of the Active Change Foundation , said : " Honour crime happens a lot in our community , especially the Pakistani community , but we do try to educate the people . "
He told the London Evening Standard : " It 's a cultural thing from back home .
But this type of horrible crime is not exclusive to Muslims , there have been cases in other religions . "
The police spokesman said the Met was " not prepared to discuss " reports the woman had been given an Osman warning ‚Äì the name given to an official police warning that someone 's life is under threat .
They are usually given to alert potential victims of organised crime gangs .
Between 2007 and 2008 the Met issued 75 warnings .
The warning system was prompted by the police 's failure to protect people from a psychotic teacher , Paul Paget - Lewis , who had shown signs of developing a worrying fixation with a former pupil , Ahmet Osman .
In 1988 Paget - Lewis shot and wounded Osman , and killed the boy 's father and two others .

Crane disasters have become quite prevalent in the world as the expectations for rapid urban development have increased globally .
Bigger building , bigger projects , and exploding payrolls for the biggest construction companies have attracted a glut of workers , trained and untrained , to build these projects .
No matter how much time is dedicated to safety accidents and crane collapses will happen .
1. ‚Äú Big Blue ‚Äù ‚Äì Milwaukee , WI 1999
The larger the equipment that is used the larger the accident that can happen .
On a frigid afternoon in July of 1999 occurred the crane accident of all crane accidents .
A 567 - foot crane in use had its own name , and to this day the accident is still referred to as ‚Äú Big Blue ‚Äù .
Crane operators working on the Miller Park in Milwaukee , WI were moving the largest piece of rooftop for the stadium , estimated at 423 tons .
When it collapsed , it did so in dramatic fashion with numerous injuries and three fatalities .
The wind was blamed eventually for the collapse at gusts of up to 35 mph .
2. Boston , MA 2006
Many construction accidents happen in construction zones , but sometimes they happen in the middle of a city .
This is exactly what happened downtown Boston during April , 2006 .
At 10 ton construction platform plummeted 13 stories onto the traffic below instantly killing three people .
The scaffolding in question was not a crane of any sort , but it deserves a spot on this list .
3. Battersea , England 2006
One neighborhood saw destruction in Battersea , England in September of 2006 .
A crane collapsed onto a group of houses and car - park killing two people .
4. Bellevue , WA 2006
Accidents seem to happen when we least expect them .
In November 2006 in Bellevue , Washington , A crane operator was shutting down his crane to go home for the day .
Witnesses reported hearing a loud crack sound right before the crane toppled on the surrounding condos .
One man was killed sitting in his home .
5. New York , NY 2007
Yet another New York , New York accident happened in December 2007 when the lifting sling of a crane snapped .
A load of roughly seven tons dropped 13 stories .
Luckily , only one worker was injured , and no one lost their life .
6. New York , NY 2008
Seven people died in the deadliest crane accident in March 2008 .
A crane towering over 200 feet in the air crashed into a couple of buildings and wiped out a townhouse completely .
This accident marked the worst single death toll by a crane in New York City , New York history .
The disaster was a sobering moment for the city as it was two days away from its annual St Patrick ‚Äôs Day celebration .
7. Miami , FL 2008
March 2008 was a bad month for cranes .
While New York was still reeling from its string of accidents Miami , FL was poised for its own tragedy .
The crane that was helping to build a 46 story skyscraper Biscayne Bay suddenly lurched towards a home below crushing two workers and injuring five more .
The force was so strong that onlookers described it as if an earthquake had struck the bay .
8. New York , NY 2008
New York City , New York seems to be a bastion for construction accidents and May of 2008 was no different .
The same construction site had received at least one previous safety violation along with numerous complaints from members of the community .
From a height of 20 stories , one crane dropped towards the site below crushing two crew members .
9. Houston , TX 2008
A giant tower crane capable of lifting thousands of tons made its home at an oil refinery in Houston , Texas .
This particular crane found itself instantly destroyed before it had even completed being put together .
During July of 2008 , during the actual assembly of the crane itself , the crane snapped of at its base , smashing cars , cracking asphalt , and taking four people with it .
10 . Cai Lan , Vietnam 2008
July 2008 was a tragic day in the port of Cai Lan , Vietnam .
Seven workers were killed and six were injured badly .
It is impossible to tell the tale of all the crane accidents that have happened in modern times .
This list covers some of the more famous ones .
It also gives an idea of the many mishaps that can lead to costly and usually fatal accidents .

Many farmers say that tomatoes are their most important cash crop and that the blight will be devastating .
‚Äú Tomatoes get me out of debt every year , ‚Äù said Kira Kinney , an owner of Evolutionary Organics in New Paltz , N.Y. , who has late blight on potatoes and tomatoes and expects that most of the crop will be destroyed .
‚Äú I go into the season with credit card debt and I come out O.K. , ‚Äù she said .
‚Äú That ‚Äôs how I cover my annual costs for the whole farm . ‚Äù
On July 23 , Billiam van Roestenberg said that 11 of the 12 growers who participate in the weekly farmers ‚Äô market he runs in New Paltz had already seen late blight in their fields that was likely to ruin their crops .
The next day , the 12th farmer ¬ó Mr. van Roestenberg himself ¬ó found the disease on his own tomatoes .
Late blight , which caused the Irish potato famine in the mid-19th century , thrives in damp , windy weather .
Its symptoms include white powdery spores , brown spots on leaves and open lesions , each of which can produce hundreds of thousands of infectious spores .
Burning , spraying and deeply burying infected plants are options for farmers ; home gardeners should pull plants out at the first sign of the disease .
Rather than composting them , the plants should be sealed in plastic bags and thrown away .
Every state in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic has confirmed recent cases of late blight , which normally does not appear in the region until August , if at all .
The source of the outbreak is being investigated by pathologists .
Home gardens likely helped spread the infection : Lowe ‚Äôs , Home Depot , Kmart and Wal - Mart all sold tomato seedlings with late blight in their garden centers from April to June .
All are offering refunds or credits to gardeners who must destroy their plants .
But there is no similar recourse for farmers .
Even those who have not lost a crop to blight are suffering financially because of it .
To ward off the infection , which has been sweeping through farms in her area , Ms. Hepworth has been spraying all her plants with a covering of fixed copper , an approved organic fungicide that creates a physical barrier preventing spores from reaching the plant .
Because copper , unlike synthetic fungicides , washes off in heavy rain and must be carefully reapplied , ‚Äú It costs me $ 1,000 every time it rains , ‚Äù she said .
Dale Mohler , an agricultural meteorologist at AccuWeather.com , said that low temperatures in June and July broke records across the Northeast and that rainfall is running 50 to 100 percent higher than normal around the region .
Mr. Mohler , who said he lost his own home - grown tomato plants to late blight , said August is n‚Äôt likely to bring the sustained hot weather ¬ó about 10 days with temperatures above 85 and dry conditions at night ¬ó that could stop the continued spread of late blight .
Like other growers , David Hambleton , a farmer in Dutchess County , N.Y. , whose crop is shared by about 250 members of the Sisters Hill Farm community supported agriculture program , is concerned that members who do not receive the vine - ripe juicy summer tomatoes they look forward to will not pay $ 500 to $ 700 for a share next year .
‚Äú Last year was a bumper crop , one of the best ever , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú This year , we ‚Äôll have to ask our members to participate in local agriculture in a more realistic way . ‚Äù
Farmers who do not practice organics , like Bill Maxwell of Changewater , N.J. , are using pesticide sprays to protect their tomatoes , but still must worry about blight , weather and the state of the crop , which is running about a month late .
‚Äú I have huge , beautiful cauliflowers , but I ‚Äôm not going to make a lot of money on that in July , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú People want their tomatoes . ‚Äù
The union has warned a national strike could take place More than 12,000 postal workers are to strike on Friday in a row over jobs , pay and services , the Communication Workers Union has announced .
The 24 - hour strike will affect cities ranging from Edinburgh to Plymouth .
The union has accused Royal Mail of cutting the pay of employees and reducing services .
Royal Mail condemned the action , saying the union was resisting modernisation and said 90 % of its staff would still be working on Friday .
Dave Ward , the union 's deputy general secretary , said : " There are serious and growing problems in the postal sector which urgently need resolving .
" We have renewed our offer of a three - month no - strike deal to Royal Mail in return for meaningful talks over modernisation .
" The current cuts , bullying managers and ever - increasing workloads on a shrinking workforce cannot continue .
" Pressure and stress is at breaking point for postal workers . "
Ballot requests Workers based in London , Edinburgh , Bristol , Darlington , Stoke - on - Trent , Plymouth , Norfolk and Essex will be taking part in the strike .
Protest letters will be delivered to the Royal Mail 's chief executive , Adam Crosier , and Business Secretary Lord Mandelson .
The union said it was receiving an " ever - growing " number of requests for industrial action from postal workers across the country .
It said 400 requests for ballots on strike action have already been made and Mr Ward warned that without progress the dispute would turn into a national strike .
If we are going to sustain the letters delivery service , however , there is a crying need for modernisation of this business .
Lord Mandelson Royal Mail said the CWU was objecting to changes its leaders had agreed to in 2007 .
A spokeswoman said : " Strike action hurts both businesses and individuals and our customers will not understand how the CWU leadership can keep saying it backs modernisation while constantly resisting the introduction of new technology and more efficient working practices on the ground . "
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson told the business and enterprise select committee last week that the union was " boycotting " agreed procedures for implementing changes .
" If we are going to sustain the letters delivery service , however , there is a crying need for modernisation of this business .
Both management and unions have said they are up for this , " he said .
" I wish they would find the agreement to implement this rather than dragging the Royal Mail and the changes needed into a frustrating and never - ending , tedious process of endless negotiation , from which insufficient change follows at too slow a pace . "
Controversial plans to part - privatise Royal Mail we put on hold by the government in June .
The bill , opposed by many Labour MPs , was due to go before Parliament before the summer break , but Lord Mandelson said it would not happen until " later " .

Steve Yzerman led the Detroit Red Wings to three Stanley Cup titles during his career .
( ( Dave Sandford / Getty Images ) )
The National Hockey League added four new members to its exclusive club Tuesday , selecting Steve Yzerman , Brett Hull , Brian Leetch and Luc Robitaille as part of the 2009 Hall of Fame class .
The four greats will be honoured with a ceremony at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto on Nov. 9 .
Lou Lamoriello , CEO , president and general manager of the New Jersey Devils , was named to the Hall of Fame as a builder .
There were five forwards in their first year of eligibility who combined for more than 3,200 regular - season goals in their illustrious careers : Yzerman , Hull , Robitaille , Dave Andreychuk and Alexander Mogilny .
The Hall 's selection committee is made up of 18 members .
In addition to players , referees and builders of the game may also be honoured .
Up to five can be nominated for induction in any given year , with no more than four players entering .
Captain Red Wing
All four players were offensive engines for their teams , who entered the NHL in the early - to - mid 1980s in a era of firewagon hockey , survived the clutch - and - grab years of the late 1990s and early 2000s and stayed on one year after the lockout that wiped out the 2004 - 05 season .
Next to legend Gordie Howe , no player was more revered , or loved , in Hockeytown than Yzerman .
Drafted fourth overall by the Detroit Red Wings in 1983 , Yzerman boasts an NHL resume few players of any generation could match .
" It is a tremendous honour to receive this news , " Yzerman said during a conference call .
Yzerman , who was born in Cranbrook , B.C. , and grew up in Nepean , Ont. , ranks sixth in NHL scoring with 682 goals , 1,063 assists and 1,745 points .
Numbers aside , Yzerman spent all of his remarkable 22 seasons with Detroit , rejuvenating the Wings by leading them to three Stanley Cup titles , including back - to - back championships in 1997 and 1998 .
He retired in 2006 as the longest - serving captain of any major sports team ( 19 years ) in North American history .
His best post - season performance came in 1998 , when he scored 24 points to win the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP .
Now the team 's vice - president and alternate governor , Yzerman also played a key role in Canada erasing 50 years of frustration by winning the gold medal during the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games .
A bad knee forced Yzerman to miss 30 games of that season , and he rested after the Olympics to prepare for a playoff run .
A limping Yzerman nonetheless finished second in playoff scoring with 23 points , four behind Colorado 's Peter Forsberg .
Despite enduring constant pain , Yzerman added four assists in the Stanley Cup final to help the Wings topple the Carolina Hurricanes .
" My knee had been bugging me right from training camp , and it was getting to a point where we kind of had to make a decision on whether I was going to continue playing or not , " recalls Yzerman .
" I really did n't end up playing until the playoffs , and really , all I did was play the games .
I did n't practice much and kind of got through the games .
I could n't move very well , but I really relied on my linemates [ Brendan Shanahan and Sergei Fedorov ] a lot . "
Yzerman was joined by two of his fellow inductees on that Cup - winning squad , as Robitaille and Hull were both members of the Red Wings when they hoisted the trophy back in 2002 .
The 2001 - 02 Wings are one of only three Cup - winning teams to have at least three members inducted into the Hall of Fame in the same year .
They join the 1943 - 44 Montreal Canadiens , who had Toe Blake , Elmer Lach , Butch Bouchard , and Kenny Reardon inducted in 1966 , and the 1925 - 26 Montreal Maroons , who saw Punch Broadbent , Nels Stewart , and Reg Noble enterin 1962 .
As executive director of Hockey Canada , Yzerman could also experience a thrilling three - month period if Canada reclaims its gold medal at the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games .
The Golden Brett
Hull piled up 741 career goals , behind only Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe , with four NHL teams .
He added 650 assists for 1,391 points , currently 21st overall .
Brett Hull , centre , scored the Stanley Cup game - winning goal against the Buffalo Sabres in 1999 .

His best individual season came during 1990 - 91 as a member of the St. Louis Blues , when he scored 86 goals ‚Äî surpassed only by Gretzky 's 92 goals .
The legendary sniper won two Stanley Cups during his career , but his most memorable moment came during the 1999 final against the Buffalo Sabres .
Hull scored in triple overtime of Game 6 to clinch the Dallas Stars ' first Stanley Cup title .
The goal was not without controversy , however , as Hull 's right foot was in the crease while scoring on Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek .
Although players were n't permitted in the crease at that time , officials allowed the goal to stand .
" It 's a great honour , it 's really unfathomable , " said Hull , now the Dallas Stars ' executive vice - president and alternate governor , told the Dallas Morning News .
" I mean , when you 're a kid , you dream about someday playing in the NHL or someday winning the Stanley Cup , but you just do n't think about this , so it 's hard to prepare yourself . "
Hull , who was born in Belleville , Ont. , but holds a dual U.S. - Canadian citizenship , joins his father , Bobby , in the Hall of Fame ‚Äî the top father - son duo in league history .
" It is hard to put into words what this means to me , especially since I 'm joining my father in the Hockey Hall of Fame , " said Hull .
" Simply getting to the NHL was a challenge for me . "
First American - born MVP
Leetch was a smooth - skating defenceman whose combination of passing and scoring ability made him one of the best defencemen of the 1990s .
Defenceman Brian Leetch became the first non-Canadian to win the Conn Symthe Trophy as playoff MVP in 1994 .
( ( Ed Betz / Associated Press ) ) Leetch , inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame eight months ago alongside Hull , amassed 247 goals and 781 assists for 1,028 points , ranking him fifth among all defenceman .
He spent the bulk of his 18 - year career with the New York Rangers , where he helped end the team 's 54 - year Stanley Cup drought in 1994 .
A Calder Cup winner as the top rookie and two - time Norris Trophy honouree , Leetch performed sensationally during the 1994 post - season .
He scored 11 goals and 34 points to win the Conn Smythe Trophy , becoming the first non-Canadian to capture the award .
He still remains the only American - born player to win the playoff MVP trophy .
" I am humbled and excited by this honour , particularly since for me it is difficult to think of myself as a member of the Hall of Fame , " said Leetch .
Lucky Luc
No left - winger has ever scored more NHL goals or points than Robitaille .
Selected in the ninth round ( 171st overall ) of the 1984 draft by the Los Angeles Kings , the Montreal native ranks 10th in goals with 668 and is 19th in points with 1,394 .
The Los Angeles Kings retired Luc Robitaille 's centre No. 20 jersey during a ceremony in 2006 .
( ( Branimir Kvartuc / Associated Press ) )
He also had three seasons of over 50 goals and four with over 100 points .
While Robitaille starred with the Kings for the first eight seasons of his career , he did n't fulfil his ultimate dream of winning the Stanley Cup until he played with fellow Hall of Famer Yzerman and the Red Wings in 2002 .
" My goal was always just to play in the NHL and I never dreamed of anything beyond that , " said Robitaille .
" To be honoured in the same room as The Rocket , Guy Lafleur and Wayne Gretzky is a tremendous honour . "
After 19 seasons with stops in L.A. , Pittsburgh , New York ( Rangers ) and Detroit , Robitaille retired in 2006 with the Kings , who promptly retired his No. 20 jersey .
New Jersey resurgence
The New Jersey Devils were mired in mediocrity for years before building a powerhouse squad .
From 1995 to 2003 , Lamoriello put together teams that won three Stanley Cups during that stretch .
Lamoriello has been involved in the game for more than 40 years at both the college and pro levels .
" This award is completely unexpected , " he said .
" Over my career , I have been fortunate to have been associated with great players and coaches , and this award recognizes their contributions to my career . "
Still waiting from past years are stars like Doug Gilmour , Pavel Bure , Dino Ciccarelli and Phil Housley .
Players must be retired for three years to enter the Hall of Fame unless they receive a special exemption .
Mauricio Funes , El Salvador ‚Äôs president - elect , is in Paris attending the trial of his son ‚Äôs alleged killer .
At the trial , Funes paid an emotional tribute to the deceased Alejandro , who was murdered in October , 2007 at the age of 27 , saying ‚Äú we shared the same ideals , the same life projects and the desire to transform El Salvador , to convert it into a just society that would put an end to violence . ‚Äù
The motive of the alleged killer , Mohammed Amor , is unclear .
The murder is a tragic irony for the Funes family , which preferred the relative calm of Paris to violence - plagued El Salvador for Alejandro ‚Äôs education .
‚Äú We thought he would be safer , ‚Äù said Funes .
‚Äú I would never have imagined that he would be beaten to death here . ‚Äù
Funes ran in El Salvador ‚Äôs March 15 , 2009 , election as the candidate for the Frente Farabundo Mart√≠ para la Liberaci√≥n Nacional ( FMLN ) , a former guerrilla organization that transformed itself into a socialist political party after its demobilization .
He won the presidency in part due to his pledge to cut crime and increase security .
He will be inaugurated on June 1 .

By day , the appreciative crowds have clapped , cheered , and encouraged the performers on Trafalgar Square 's fourth plinth .
Television crews have filmed them , tourists have stared at British eccentricity , and art aficionados , fresh from the National Gallery , debate the true meaning of the Antony Gormley installation .
But after dark ‚Äì when the crowds are replaced by a few passing stag parties and the obligatory gaggle of barefooted girls carrying their stilettos ‚Äì the plinth is a grimmer place .
Over the past few nights ,
The Independent has kept an often lonely vigil at Gormley 's living portrait of Britain as ‚Äì enduring more drunken abuse than artistic appreciation ‚Äì a few take the stage , brave the dark and the rain and simply try to get through their performance unscathed .

" I was wearing a mask which I could not really see through very well , but I think that was a blessing in disguise , " said Jodie Copeland , a 32 - year - old music promoter , who took to the plinth at 2 am on Sunday .
The Southampton man had donned a skin tight " Morph suit " , in honour of Tony Hart 's Plasticine model .
It was , he said , all the rage at Glastonbury this year .
" I was trying to give some exposure to local bands , " he said after descending from the plinth in the specially adapted cherry picker .
" There were quite a few people shouting things at me .
One girl seemed particularly keen that I take off everything .
Come to mention it , so was one bloke but he seemed to wander off after a while .
A lot of people were asking me to throw the various props I had down to them , so I gave them my space - hopper . "
One girl was sent sprawling as the group fought for the inflatable toy .
The winner bounced happily away up Pall Mall .
Mr Copeland was followed on to the plinth by a young woman who wanted to educate the public about the benefits of fungi .
It turned out though , that extolling the virtues of mushrooms did n't go down too well with the 3am audience ‚Äì particularly those drinking whiskey straight from bottles concealed in brown paper bags .
Apparently , they would have preferred her to strip , something they did not hold back from telling her as the rain began to fall more steadily .
She declined their offer ‚Äì it is , after all , quite cold on a plinth in Trafalgar Square at 3am .
For some , a lack of material was a problem , but many of the plinthers were content to simply stand and take in their surroundings .
That did not deter the drunken banter which at times bordered on abuse as 38 - year - old Jim Penn , a film researcher from west London who was on at 11 pm , found out after calls from the floor for him to account for the whereabouts of his wife .
( Ever supportive , she was at the bottom of the plinth , as a matter of fact ) .
But for all of its drawbacks , night - plinthing also has its tender moments .
One participant used her time on the plinth to ice a cake which she then presented to a member of staff who was celebrating her birthday .
Another plinther , 44 - year - old Alix McCulloch , spent her hour spinning wool and said that , if anything , she preferred the late slot she was assigned on Monday night for the relative peace and quiet she enjoyed .
" I was not so worried about having a large audience watch me , " she said .
" The quieter slot was more in keeping with what I was doing .
It would have been very strange to do such a tranquil performance in the middle of the day with hundreds upon hundreds of people around . "
Gormley 's work , titled One & Other , invites participants to take to the fourth plinth for one hour each .
The 100 - day exhibition will feature 2,400 people who are allowed to do anything they want during their time in the limelight , so long as it is legal .
The plinthers were chosen at random but had to be UK residents aged over 16 and equal numbers of men and women have been chosen .
The UK population will also be represented proportionally , with a set number from each region to take part .
Art of darkness :
The plinth 's night - time occupants
* Jodie Copeland ,
The Southampton man took to the plinth at 2 am to promote local music .
A 32 - year - old ' festival nut ' , he said he wanted to have his own mini Glastonbury .
The death of his mother , Josie Roe , shortly after his application to stand on the plinth , prompted him to dedicate his appearance to her memory .
Friends sent sky - lanterns ‚Äì mini - hot air balloons ‚Äì floating over London in a moving tribute while he entertained crowds with a series of wacky props .
* Alix McCulloch ,
The 44 - year - old project manager span sheep fleece into yarn during her time on the plinth .
She described finding the 10 pm slot peaceful : " If anything I would have preferred an even later time , " she said , adding that her performance was about showing the benefits of making things by hand .
" As I spin , my heart rate slows and my blood pressure drops ; the ups and downs of the day ebb away . "
* Billie Niblock
She wanted to promote Spice , a company which organises activities such as fire - eating workshops .
Watched by friends , she used time in the spotlight at midnight to ice a cake which she then donated to a One & Other staff member who was celebrating a birthday .
A fan of Antony Gormley 's work , she described her pride at being selected to appear on the plinth .

Update :
The new 1.0 version of Caffeine has been released .
The information in this post is now obsolete .
Please see this post for more information .
A few months ago , I attended a little get - together for software developers to share their projects and passions .
One of the presenters that night faced the unfortunate situation of having his laptop repeatedly enter sleep mode as he discussed one of his slides .
This caused the projector to blank out , interrupting his flow and forcing him to run over to his laptop to press a key .
After the presentation was over , one of the attendees demonstrated a handy utility that could have saved the presenter some embarrassment : Caffeine .
Another Example of Superbly - Designed Software for Mac OS
The idea is simple enough .
The program consists of a little coffee - cup applet that sits on the right - hand side of the menu bar .
The coffee - cup starts out empty , meaning that the applet is inactive .
When you click the empty cup , it fills up with coffee and begins preventing your computer from either activating the screensaver or entering sleep mode .
Caffeine keeps your computer awake !
And slideshow presentations is just the beginning .
With Caffeine , you can watch long YouTube or Hulu videos without having to remember to lick the Cheeto - dust off your fingers and then hit a key every few minutes .
If you use a Mac , I suggest that you head over to Lighthead Software and download Caffeine right now .
As soon as I saw it , I knew that I would have to track down whatever the Linux equivalent was and install it on my machine .
A Surprising Discovery
It took several hours of careful searching before I was finally forced to accept the shocking truth : there was no Linux equivalent .
This is a highly unusual circumstance these days .
There are some cases where the Linux equivalent of some piece of software is not as good as what ‚Äôs available on the other platform , but there ‚Äôs almost always ‚Ä¶ something .
My annoyance at the lack of an equivalent for this handy utility was quickly replaced by excitement , because I realized that this was an opportunity for me to make an important contribution .
Which brings me to my next point .
I am pleased to announce the immediate availability of the first public release of ‚Ä¶
Caffeine for Linux
Following the philosophy of ‚Äú Release Early , Release Often ‚Äù , the 0.1 release of Caffeine for Linux is very rudimentary and could well contain major bugs .
The largest problem that I know of is its incomplete support for KDE .
The applet will run under KDE , but activating it will only prevent the screensaver from starting ; the activation of sleep mode is not prevented .
Instead of spending all sorts of time thinking about which new features I should implement , I ‚Äôd like to put you in charge of determining the priorities for future development .
If there are any features that you would like to see implemented , just leave a comment and I ‚Äôll get to work .
Just to get things started , here are a couple of ideas that popped into my head :
proper KDE support
a DEB package for easier installation
uploading the source - code to a proper project - hosting web - site , like Launchpad , Sourceforge or Google Code ( which would you prefer ? )
keyboard shortcuts to control the program without using the mouse
ability to activate for a fixed amount of time before allowing regular powersaving to resume ( a useful feature of the Mac OS version )
ability to activate automatically when a certain program runs ( there are some full - screen games for Linux that unfortunately allow the screen - saver to activate while you play )
Of course , these are just ideas that sound good to me .
You ‚Äôre the ones that are running this operation .
Installation Instructions
The following step - by - step instructions are meant for Ubuntu 9.04 ; users of other distributions will likely need to adjust for small differences .
Also , be sure to substitute your username whenever you see << yourusername > >.
Download this file to your home directory
Open a Terminal by clicking Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal
In the Terminal , execute the following commands , one at a time :
mkdir -p opt / caffeine tar - xvf caffeine - 0.1.tar.gz - C opt / caffeine rm caffeine -0.1.tar.gz
Go to System -> Preferences -> Startup Applications
Click Add
Set the ‚Äú Name ‚Äù field to Caffeine and the ‚Äú Command ‚Äù field to /home /<< yourusername>>/opt/caffeine/caffeine.py
and the ‚Äú Command ‚Äù field to Click Add and then Close
and then Log out and log back in ; the Caffeine applet should appear in the top- right
Click the icon to activate it
That ‚Äôs it .
You should now be able to sit back and take in a mind - blowing video like this one without power - saving getting in the way .
As always , leave a comment if you have any problems .
STUFFED JALAPENOS
These are great party fare and really good ‚Ä¶.
and hot .
Good and hot !
Yeehaw ‚Ä¶it ‚Äôs amazing how different crops or batches of jalapenos can vary in heat !
I bought some gorgeous peppers and made these ‚Äì perfectly spicy , not too hot .
Did it again a few weeks later and just about died !
Now , I ‚Äôm not a pepper know - it - all but I thought I could tell the hot ones from the HOTTTT ones ‚Ä¶.. obviously maybe not .
So be sure and ask , if they are n‚Äôt labeled clearly !
Anyway , these are fab if you like a little spice !
And you do n‚Äôt have to stuff them ‚Ä¶
I ‚Äôve made it into a dip with a few slices of the pepper mixed in instead .
Wonderful to dip your chips in or to spread on juicy burgers .
You could also add diced shrimp or cooked sausage ‚Äì anything you like to the filling .
~~~
.
One 8 - ounce pkg reduced fat cream cheese , softened
3 tablespoons half & half
6 slices regular or turkey bacon , cooked crisp and crumbled
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon Penzey ‚Äôs Chili 9000 or chili powder
1 1/2 cups shredded Colby - Jack cheese
12 large - sized jalapeno peppers
Preheat oven to 350 degrees .
In a medium bowl combine the cream cheese , half & half , bacon , garlic powder , chili mix or powder , and 1 cup of the shredded cheese ; set aside .
Cut peppers in half , lengthwise ; remove seeds and ribs .
Stuff with about 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture .
Place on a baking sheet .
Sprinkle with remaining cheese and a dusting of chili mix .
Bake for 30 - 40 minutes or until peppers are tender .
If making it into dip : finely mince a seeded pepper ( or to taste ) and stir into cheese mixture .
Microwave , stirring a couple of times , until smooth and hot .
Makes 12 servings ( two stuffed peppers each ) .

Update1 : The vulnerability is being actively exploited on web sites .
More to follow .
Microsoft has released an advisory related to an Office Web Components ActiveX vulnerability , it is available here .
This vulnerability exists in the ActiveX control used by IE to display Excel spreadsheets .
The CVE entry for the vulnerability is CVE - 2009 - 1136 .
Microsoft mentions that they are aware of active exploits against this vulnerability , although we at the SANS Internet Storm Center have n't seen it used or mentioned in public as of yet ( this has changed , we are seeing active exploit pages ) .
Which may tend to indicate it has been used in targeted rather than broad based attacks .
At the moment there is no patch , there is a workaround , and it can be automated for enterprise deployment .
The specific CLSIDs to set the killbit for are :
{ 0002E541-0000-0000 -C000-000000000046}
{ 0002E559-0000-0000 -C000 -000000000046}
Start working on this on ASAP .
The impact is remote code execution with the privileges of the logged in user running Internet Explorer , and might not require user intervention .
As in browse to a nasty web site and be pwn3d .

This article describes how to deploy using Active Directory .
If you have administrative privileges on a single system and are running Internet Explorer , you can click on this ' fixit ' link to set the killbit and mitigate the vulnerability on a home computer for example .
Update1 : The vulnerability is being actively exploited on web sites .
More to follow .
Update2 : One other obvious mitigation step is to use an alternate web browser ( as in other than IE ) that does not make use of ActiveX .
Update3 : We have raised the Infocon to yellow for 24 hours due to the active exploitation of this vulnerability .
Update4 : We will be updating our existing diary post of domains to block with domains that are hosting this exploit as well .
You can see that diary entry at the following url .
http://isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=6739
( newly added domains are in yellow ) - AndreL
Update5 : Attack vectors used to exploit this vulnerability .
The now known public attempts to exploit the vulnerability , attackers just modify the code with a fresh download and payload to slightly modified malware .
A .cn domain using a heavily obfuscated version of the exploit - which may become an attack kit ( think MPACK ) and is similar to recent DirectShow attacks .
A highly targeted attack against an organization earlier today who received a Microsoft Office document with embedded HTML .
This one was particularly nasty , it was specifically crafted for the target - with the document being tailored with appropriate contact information and subject matter that were specific to the targeted recipient .
Analysis of the document and secondary payload found the attacker used a firewall on the malicious server so that all IP traffic outside of the targeted victim 's domain / IP range would not reach with the server .
Update6 : This blog has additional information , with examples of code that may have been used in this attack .
hxxp://safelab.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!A6B213403DBD59AF!1463.entry ( obscured on purpose , some AV products will trigger accessing the page .
Another example is here : hxxp://xeye.us/blog/2009/07/ one -0day /
One part of a signature looking for the exploit would be ActiveXObject ( " OWC10.Spreadsheet " ) , which could also be used for legitimate web applications trying to open a spreadsheet .
Update7 : attempt at snort sigs ( until something better comes along ) :
alert tcp $ EXTERNAL_NET $ HTTP_PORTS -> $ HOME_NET any ( msg : " MS 0day Excel ActiveX1 CVE-2009-1136 ref isc.sans.org/diary.html?storyid=6778 " ; flow : from_server , established ; content : " 0002E559-0000-0000 -C000-000000000046 " ; nocase ; pcre : " /< OBJECTs +[^>]

Hit -run driver injures Jersey City man
A Downtown Jersey City man is in critical condition in an induced coma after he was struck by a hit - and - run driver Saturday while going to meet his wife at the Newport Centre mall , police and family members said .
The brutal crime was captured on surveillance video distributed by the Jersey City Police Department today in an effort to find the driver .
( Warning : The video is graphic .
The crime can be seen at the bottom of the screen at 1:02 . )
The video shows 51 - year - old Ricardo Torres walking into the street and immediately waving toward the black pickup truck that then runs him down and keeps going .
A man waiting to cross across the street can be seen getting on his cell phone , and two people get out of a car across the street .
All three gather at the corner looking toward where Torres is , off - screen .
A surveillance camera two blocks away at Marin and Eighth Street shows the pickup truck moments before it struck Torres .
( Go to 1:00 in video below . )
Torres , of Second Street , is being treated at the Jersey City Medical Center , said his wife , Angela , and brother , Rafael .
Ricardo
Torres lost a kidney , fractured his pelvis , suffered facial injuries and had his spleen removed .
The accident occurred at about 1:30 p.m
Saturday when the black pickup truck was traveling south and struck him a few feet from the curb .
The truck , which had a silver toolbox in the bed , never stopped , the video shows .
" The driver has to do the right thing , " Rafael Torres said .
" How could you just leave a person there ? "
" We believe in miracles and prayer , so we ask the community ( to pray for him ) , " he added .
" The doctors say they are starting to take him off medicine to see if he his organs can begin working normally , " Ricardo 's brother said .
" He 's not out of the woods , but they are hopeful .
...
It 's not his time . "
Jersey City police are hoping that the public can help identify the pickup truck involved .
Police are asking that anyone with information to call ( 201 ) 547- JAIL .
Does Ben Gordon have a promise from the Pistons ?
The answer is yes , at least according to Sam Smith .
But I also heard that Gordon ‚Äôs agent allegedly has been saying he has an $ 11 million promise from the Pistons .
First off , when a writer says that he ‚Äú heard ‚Äù that someone has ‚Äú allegedly ‚Äù been saying something , beware .
But let ‚Äôs assume for a moment that the report is accurate .
On the surface , the Pistons ‚Äô interest does n‚Äôt make a whole lot of sense .
Why replace Rip Hamilton with Ben Gordon ?
Is n‚Äôt Hamilton better ?
Gordon does have one thing on Rip ‚Äî youth .
He is 26 , five years Hamilton ‚Äôs junior .
If Joe Dumars is planning to make a splash in free agency next summer , then he ‚Äôs planning for a franchise resurgence in 2011 , and Hamilton would be 33 at that point .
If he signs Gordon , Dumars is just trying to make the Pistons younger .
Hamilton still has a lot of value right now .
He ‚Äôs a sharpshooter and a pretty good defender , and there are more than a few teams that could use him .
This is pure speculation , but how about a Hamilton for Boozer swap with Utah ?
The Jazz already have Ronnie Brewer ‚Äî would they even go for it ?
The Spurs , Rockets , Cavs , Wizards and Hornets might be interested as well ( though New Orleans is trying to trim salary , not add it . )
Hamilton ‚Äôs contract runs through the 2012 - 13 season but the final year is n‚Äôt fully guaranteed .
I prefer Hamilton right now .
Gordon can make some impossible shots , but he sometimes shoots the Bulls out of games .
He averaged 24.3 points against the Celtics in this year ‚Äôs playoffs , but he only shot 39 % from the field ( and 29 % over the last three games ) .
He did shoot better than 45 % from the field during the regular season , which is solid for a shooting guard .
I think $ 11 million per season is too much to pay in this market ; given his faults ( shot selection , suspect defense ) , I ‚Äôd estimate Gordon ‚Äôs value to be around $ 8 million per season .
The baking summer temperatures of February 2009 have southern Australians thinking about climate change and their limited water supplies .
As high temperatures led to grid collapse and massive blackouts followed by disastrous fires , they also had the opportunity to think about how dependent their lives are on technology and the resources that keep technology ticking .
For me , a biologist interested in politics , the summer of 2008 - 2009 has been quite interesting for another , related reason ; the more open discussion of the effect of population growth on our ability to mitigate climate change .
As Kevin Rudd explained last December about emission reduction targets :
The EU 's 20 per cent target announced over the weekend is equal to a 24 per cent reduction in emissions for each European from 1990 to 2020 .
Our 5 per cent unconditional target is equal to a 27 per cent reduction in carbon pollution for each Australian from 2000 to 2020 - and a 34 per cent reduction for each Australian from 1990 .
This is because Europe 's population is not projected to grow between 1990 and 2020 .
By contrast , Australia 's population is projected to grow by 45 per cent .
If the Europeans were to adopt the same per capita effort as Australia is proposing , their cuts would be around 30 per cent by 2020 .
Advertisement
So it seems that Australians will be required to make larger sacrifices in their energy use so that population growth can continue and we can , ultimately , achieve a lesser total reduction than the Europeans in any case .
Part of me wants to believe that Rudd ‚Äôs comment might be the first subtle move in a campaign to relieve us of the illusion that economic and population growth can continue for ever .
However , the far more likely explanation is that the political leadership ( of both major parties ) believes so blindly in the benefits of population growth that they regard Rudd ‚Äôs excuse for our failure to make larger cuts in CO2 emissions as acceptable and noble .
I do not know of any topic that evokes more heated , passionate , and opinionated argument than population .
For a biologist the matter appears simple .
There are numerous examples of species expanding their populations until they exceed their energy resources ( i.e. food supply ) , after which starvation kicks in and the population crashes .
Humans are clearly animals and if we do not get sufficient food then we starve too .
But most of the scientifically under - educated population seems to think that humans are in some way exceptional , that we are too clever to starve .
Either our technology or our ability to respond to crises , or both , will save us if food ever becomes limiting .
I wish this were true but history - and a cold , objective look at the numbers involved - shows that this idea is just a comforting illusion .
For most of history the threatening shadow of hunger has been humanity ‚Äôs constant companion .
The oil driven ‚Äú green revolution ‚Äù of the 1960s and 1970s boosted food production at a time when it seemed our population might soon exceed its food resources ( as predicted by the original dismal economist , Thomas Malthus ) .
The food price hikes and riots of 2008 led some commentators to declare that we need another green revolution but nobody can really say how this will be accomplished .
Gene technology is sometimes cited as the saviour to come but this ignores the fact that most of the genetic gains in crop productivity in the last 40 years have been possible because we have been using stupendous volumes of oil energy to perform more and more tasks for the plants that they would otherwise have to spend energy doing for themselves .
( For an excellent illustration of this see Folke G√ºnther ‚Äô sarticle ‚Äú Making western agriculture more sustainable ‚Äù ) .
By some estimates we use 10 times as much energy from oil to grow our food as is provided to us by the food itself .
( Additional energy is then used in transport and distribution , processing , packaging , the driving involved in collecting it from the supermarket and then cooking it . )
Advertisement
What more can we do for our pampered plants ?
And how will we be able to keep them pampered in any case now that oil production seems to be set for rapid decline and phosphate fertiliser may disappear even faster ?
Currently , the world ‚Äôs population increases by 76 million people a year - the equivalent of almost four Australias .
However , world food production ( as illustrated by grain production ) may have peaked in 2007 - 8 and grain per person peaked back in 1986 .
In fact , widespread drought may reduce world food production by more than 20 per cent in 2009 .
Water for agriculture is becoming increasingly scarce , unpredictable weather patterns resulting from climate change are decreasing agricultural production , fertilisers have been rapidly increasing in price as their raw materials become scarce , and our farmers are collapsing into financial crisis as volatile agricultural markets play havoc with their income .
The world ‚Äôs stocks of grain in reserve have now fallen close to critically low levels and are on a downward trend .
These problems have been exacerbated ( until recently at least ) by the trend to higher per capita consumption of meat in Asia as the region becomes ( or , rather , became ) wealthier .
Eating meat is far less food - energy efficient since many grams of grain must be fed to any animal to return each gram of meat which then finds its way into a human mouth .
Only the most optimistic fantasist could imagine that we could turn around these worldwide trends in time to increase food production to match the UN ‚Äôs often - quoted estimate of a 40 per cent increase in world population by 2050 .
A realistic estimate based on projections of energy and other resources must see a crash in agricultural production before 2020 and declining population numbers before long thereafter .
Victoria , B.C. ¬ñ Vancouver Island - based musician Allison Crowe and two of her bandmates were deported from London¬ís Gatwick airport this morning to Toronto after being held and interrogated Tuesday upon arrival , said their manager Adrian du Plessis from his home on Saltspring Island .
Crowe , 27 , guitarist Billy Woods and drummer Laurent Boucher ¬ñ both from Saltspring Island ¬ñ had their passports confiscated when they arrived in the U.K. Tuesday at 10:30 a.m .
article continues below
A fourth band member , bassist Dave Baird from Nanaimo , was allowed to enter the country because he has dual British and Canadian citizenship .
Crowe told the Telegraph newspaper they were shut in a room for six hours and threatened she¬íd never perform in Europe again once her passport was stamped by the UK Border Authority as ¬ìbarred from entry . ¬î
¬ì They weren¬ít allowed to contact anyone , ¬î said du Plessis .
¬ì I was getting worried . ¬î
The group was targeted because they had not obtained a Certificate of Sponsorship from the venues they were scheduled to play .
The new visa requirement was brought in November 27 , 2008 to fight illegal immigration and terrorism .
The band was about to embark on a month - long European tour of small venues .
Crowe is an up - and - coming roots and soul singer , who has performed several times in the U.K .
Neither of the venues Crowe was scheduled to play knew about the new legislation and had not had difficulties with other international artists in recent months .
¬ì We said ¬ë Tell us what to do and we¬íll do it , ¬í¬î but it¬ís not like we could just fill out a form , ¬î said du Plessis .
The new legislation requires the venue to obtain a certificate of sponsorship from the Home Office , which can cost hundreds of dollars .
¬ì That ¬ís no problem for the big mainstream acts but it prevents independent musicians from playing smaller gigs ¬ñ it¬ís hard enough to find a piano . ¬î
Du Plessis has discovered a movement of European artists fighting against the legislation , led by British sculptor Antony Gormley .
They say the new set of rules restricts artistic freedom and culture .
Russian pianist Grigory Sokolov cancelled an April performance at the Southbank Centre in London because he didn¬ít have the visa documents .
Crowe and her bandmates will fly from Toronto to Frankfurt to complete the rest of their tour .
German officials said they would welcome Crowe upon arrival , without the sponsor documents .
¬ì They thought it was ridiculous to not welcome visiting musicians with open arms , ¬î said du Plessis , who plans to continue to lobby to have musicians perform on British soil without the new sponsorship documents .
¬ì I have a feeling this issue is only going to grow . ¬î

This post is the opening salvo of a feature we occasionally offer here at The Liberty Papers called ‚Äú Point - Counterpoint ‚Äù .
In this feature , Kevin is arguing the Point that Tea Parties are ultimately damaging to the libertarian movement .
Tomorrow , Brad will respond to this argument with his Counterpoint ( response here ) .
The so - called Tea Party movement has been upheld by some as a movement of Americans fed up with overtaxation and excessive spending by the Federal government .
These supposedly disgruntled ordinary Americans have been having rallies all across the country to show their disgust with the fiscal shape of the country .
However , there is more beneath the surface of the Tea Party movement .
In reality , the Tea Party movement has become a platform for assorted kooks , Republican party operatives looking to regain credibility with the American people , and libertarian and conservative activists who frankly should know better than to associate with the above .
Many of the featured Tea Party speakers this weekend were either tax hiking , big government politicians themselves or can be safely classified as kooky .
One of the cases in point is none other than celebrity Joe the Plumber aka Samuel Wurzelbacher who turned an Austin Tea Party into an anti-immigration rant :
‚Äú I believe we need to spend a little more on illegal immigrants get them the ( expletive ) out of our ( expletive ) country , and close the borders down , ‚Äù Wurzelbacher said .
‚Äú We can do it . ‚Äù
‚Äú We ‚Äôve got the greatest military in the world and you ‚Äôre telling me we ca n‚Äôt close our borders - that ‚Äôs just ridiculous . ‚Äù
Another group of kooks gathered in Duval County , Florida at an event organized by the county ‚Äôs Republican Party .
The Republican Party of Duval County is backing away from their promotion of an event that featured numerous controversial comparisons of President Barack Obama with German Dictator Adolf Hitler .
The event , a Tea Party held at the Jacksonville Landing on July 2 , was organized by the First Coast Tea Party .
However , the Duval County Republican Party promoted the event with e-mails that stated ‚Äú Paid by Republican Party of Duval County . ‚Äù Duval Republican Party Chairman Lenny Curry also broadcasted live from the event on the party ‚Äôs weekly radio broadcast hosted by AM 1320 .
The event , which was attended by Florida State Representatives Lake Ray , Charles McBurney and Mike Weinstein and Florida State Senator Stephen Wise , drew about 1,000 people to the Jacksonville Landing .
Local party officials were on stage , along with numerous members of the Jacksonville business community .
While partisan rhetoric at any rally is expected , controversy has arisen over numerous signs that were prominently displayed at the gathering , including two that featured Barack Obama in Nazi garb .
One sign , in fact , had altered Obama ‚Äôs appearance to resemble Hitler .
Other signs compared ACORN , the community organizing group accused of voter registration irregularities , with the SS ‚Äî the Nazi organization responsible for enacting the Holocaust and the group responsible for most of the crimes against humanity committed by the Third Reich .
In short , the Tea Parties have become less about opposition to bailouts and reckless spending and instead have begun to resemble the ‚Äú anti- war ‚Äù rallies of the Bush years .
The ‚Äú anti- war ‚Äù rallies were generally nothing more than ‚Äú We Hate Bush ‚Äù rallies and the Tea Parties have become ‚Äú We Hate Obama ‚Äù rallies where every phony outrage and faux scandal about Obama are aired to a country that is rejecting them .
The Tea Parties have lost their original purpose of promoting fiscal responsibility in most of the country and the movement has come to the point where it harms the liberty movement by continuing to associate with them .
Plus , while original supporters of bailouts , higher taxes , and higher spending are being booed at some events , other tax and spend hypocrites are being welcomed as speakers and are cheered because they ‚Äôre playing for the right team aka the GOP .
By cheering on the same politicians who created the fiscal mess our country is in , the Tea Party movement continues the same fiscal mess they claim to oppose .
If the only purpose of the Tea Parties is to elect more Republicans then we have failed .
Instead , we as libertarians must let this movement lose steam and fade away , like all populist movements do .
Especially when we start seeing talk of the Tea Party movement nominating Sarah Palin , who is an enemy of everything classical liberalism stands for , to be its presidential candidate .
If the point is to gain publicity for our causes , we are failing in this because the media is focusing on the fringe participation and the Republican party sponsorship of these events .
In short , libertarians and the Tea Party movement must divorce if the liberty movement is to survive .
Or the Tea Party movement must clean its own house and get back to its core issues of fiscal responsibility .

Husband and wife owners of a California company that distributed pornographic materials over the Internet have been each sentenced to one year and one day in prison , the U.S. Department of Justice announced .
Extreme Associates and owners Robert Zicari , also known as Rob Black , 35 , and his wife , Janet Romano , aka Lizzie Borden , 32 , pleaded guilty in March to a felony charge of conspiracy to distribute obscene material through the mail and over the Internet .
They were sentenced Wednesday .
The couple , in their plea agreement , acknowledged distributing three videos through the mail and six video clips over the Internet to western Pennsylvania .
They forfeited the domain name , Extremeassociates.com , as part of their plea agreement , in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania .
The company is now defunct .
" Extreme Associates produced and distributed sexually degrading material that portrayed women in the most vile and depraved manner imaginable , " U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan , of the Western District of Pennsylvania , said in a statement .
" These prison sentences affirm the need to continue to protect the public from obscene , lewd , lascivious or filthy material , the production of which degrades all of us . "
The DOJ began cracking down on Internet - based pornography in 2003 , and the agency established an Obscenity Prosecution Task Force in 2005 .
Extreme Associates was the subject of a PBS Frontline documentary entitled " American Porn , " which aired nationwide in February 2002 .
That program showed nonsexually explicit portions of the filming of a video .
Undercover U.S. Postal inspectors then visited the Extreme Associates Web site and purchased videotapes .
Inspectors also downloaded several obscene video clips , the DOJ said .
In August 2003 , a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh returned a 10 - count indictment against Extreme Associates for violating federal obscenity statutes .
In January 2005 , a district court judge dismissed the indictment , saying that the federal obscenity statutes were unconstitutional .
The government appealed , and Buchanan argued the case in October 2005 before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals .
In December 2005 , the appeals court reversed the decision of the district court and held that the federal statutes regulating the distribution of obscenity do not violate any constitutional right to privacy .
The case was then remanded back to the district court .
Choosing a non-relational database ; why we migrated from MySQL to MongoDB
By David Mytton ,
CEO & Founder of Server Density .
Published on the 25th July , 2009 .
Update 23 Oct 2010 : A discussion about the value of shortened field names has generated a lot of traffic to this post over the last 24 hours .
A response has been posted here .
Update 28 Feb 2010 : A followup was published here .
Until recently , our server monitoring application , Server Density , was running using MySQL for the backend .
Although we primarily provide it as a hosted service , it has been written to work as a standalone application for customers that wish to install on their own servers .
This means each customer had their own MySQL database .
We collect a lot of data ‚Äì the monitoring agent reports back every 60 seconds and includes various statistics , of which the server snapshot has the most data ( because it is collecting details on every running process ) .
Over time , this results in millions of rows in the database , even for just 1 month of data , per server monitored .
Despite this huge amount of data , performance was not a problem .
We were able to tune our queries and servers to ensure that results were returned quickly .
The majority of queries are inserts with a minimal number of reads .
We are also not doing any caching , yet .
Once we reach that stage in our scaling plan there will be even fewer reads directly from the DB because the latest metric values will be stored in memory .
The problem we encountered was administrative .
We wanted to scale using replication but found that MySQL had a hard time keeping up , especially with the initial sync .
As such , backups became an issue , but we solved that .
However , scaling MySQL onto multiple clustered servers as we plan to do in the future is difficult .
You either do this through replication but that is only really suited to read - heavy applications ; or using MySQL cluster .
The cluster looks very good but I have read about some problems with it and was unsure of it ‚Äôs suitability for our needs .
The current fashion is using key / value stores , also known as non-relational database management systems ( non-RDBMS ) or schema - less databases .
As such I did some research into the options available .
The different options
Our requirements were a relatively stable product with a decent access interface , persistent disk based storage ( many are in - memory only ) , a good community and some documentation .
Based on that , the projects I reviewed were :
There are several good blog posts around that go into more detail for each project .
I did not consider ‚Äú cloud ‚Äù databases such as Amazon Simple DB because I thought the latency would be too high .
Why we chose MongoDB
I tested most of these with real data and eventually chose MongoDB for a number of reasons :
Very easy to install .
PHP module available .
Very easy replication , including master - master support .
In testing this caught up with our live DB very quickly and stayed in sync without difficulty .
Automated sharding being developed .
Good documentation .
Implementation details
Switching from relational to non-relational is time consuming but it is not difficult .
That said , there are differences that you wo n‚Äôt necessarily be expecting .
Some of these are specific to MongoDB but some will apply generally too :
Schema-less
This means things are much more flexible for future structure changes but it also means that every row records the field names .
We had relatively long , descriptive names in MySQL such as timeAdded or valueCached .
For a small number of rows , this extra storage only amounts to a few bytes per row , but when you have 10 million rows , each with maybe 100 bytes of field names , then you quickly eat up disk space unnecessarily .
100 * 10,000,000 = ~900 MB just for field names !
We cut down the names to 2 - 3 characters .
This is a little more confusing in the code but the disk storage savings are worth it .
And if you use sensible names then it is n‚Äôt that bad e.g. timeAdded -> tA . A reduction to about 15 bytes per row at 10,000,000 rows means ~ 140 MB for field names ‚Äì a massive saving .
The database - per- customer method does n‚Äôt work
MongoDB stores data in flat files using their own binary storage objects .
This means that data storage is very compact and efficient , perfect for high data volumes .
However , it allocates a set of files per database and pre-allocates those files on the filesystem for speed :
Each datafile is preallocated to a given size .
( This is done to prevent file system fragmentation , among other reasons . )
The first file for a database is .0 , then .1 , etc. .0 will be 64MB , .1 128MB , etc. , up to 2GB .
Once the files reach 2GB in size , each successive file is also 2GB .
Thus if the last datafile present is say , 1GB , that file might be 90 % empty if it was recently reached .
This was a problem because MongoDB was frequently pre-allocating in advance when the data would almost never need to ‚Äú flow ‚Äù into another file , or only a tiny amount of another file .
This is particularly the case with free accounts where we clear out data after a month .
Such pre-allocation caused large amounts of disk space to be used up .
We therefore changed our data structure so that we had a single DB , thus making the most efficient use of the available storage .
There is no performance hit for doing this because the files are split out , unlike MySQL which uses a single file per table .
Unexpected locking and blocking
In MongoDB , removing rows locks and blocks the entire database .
Adding indexes also does the same .
When we imported our data , this was causing problems because large data sets were causing the locks to exist for some time until the indexing had completed .
This is a not a problem when you first create the ‚Äú collection ‚Äù ( tables in MySQL ) because there are only a few ( or no ) rows , but creating indexes later will cause problems .
Previously in MySQL we would delete rows by using a wide ranging WHERE clause , for example to delete rows by date range or server ID .
Now in MongoDB we have to loop through all the rows and delete them individually .
This is slower , but it prevents the locking issue .
Corruption
In MySQL if a database ( more likely a few tables ) become corrupt , you can repair them individually .
In MongoDB , you have to repair on a database level .
There is a command to do this but it reads all the data and re-writes it to a new set of files .
This means all data is checked and means you will probably have some disk space freed up as files are compacted but it also means the entire database is locked and blocked during the time it takes .
With our database being around 60 GB , this operation takes several hours .
Corruption will only really occur if you kill the database process whilst it is in the middle of an operation .
Performance
Our reasons for moving to MongoDB were not performance , however it has turned out that in many cases , query times are significantly faster than with MySQL .
This is because MongoDB stores as much data in RAM as possible and so it becomes as fast as using something like memcached for the cached data .
Even non-cached data is very fast .
We do n‚Äôt have any precise numbers but in some cases are seeing cached query times around 7ms and non-cached around 50 - 200 ms , depending on the query .
Indexes help speed up queries in many cases but where our data is write intensive , indexes can slow things down .
Having a native C PHP module also helps with performance and means that all interactions are optimised at the code level .
Other drivers are available for Python , Java , Ruby , C++ and Perl .
Community / commercial support
MongoDB is open source but is developed by a New York company , 10gen .
This is useful because we can be sure that development will continue and bugs fixed .
Indeed , the mailing list has been a very useful source of help for us during the migration .
The documentation is good but some things are still unclear or not documented and being able to get a response from the mailing list from the developers within hours is very helpful .
MongoDB is quite a new project compared to the likes of MySQL and so there are fewer experienced people in the community .
As such , we have also taken up a support contract with 10 gen for guaranteed 24/7 phone & e-mail coverage so that should we have a problem , we will be able to get help quickly .
Test , and choose what is right for your application
The guys at Friendfeed are using MySQL and they have a lot more data than us .
However , they use it like a key / value store and have a different access ratio .
Every application is different .
Whilst MySQL is suitable for Friendfeed , we found a better solution .
You need to test each one to discover its suitability for your needs .
Indeed , whilst Server Density is now running entirely on MongoDB , our accounts system , invoicing and billing remains on MySQL .
MongoDB is non-atomic .
This does n‚Äôt matter for our general application code ‚Äì it ‚Äôs not critical if a few rows do not get written ‚Äì however this is not the same for our billing system .
We use transactions to ensure everything runs correctly ( e.g. we do n‚Äôt bill customers twice ) and so are still using MySQL InnoDB for that .
Our move to MongoDB has been interesting and we have encountered problems , but nothing that we were unable to work around .
Performance has increased , our disk usage has decreased and we are now in a much better position to continue our scaling plans .
Microsoft
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates believes that if he had been able to watch physicist Richard Feynman lecture on physics in 1964 his life might have played out differently .
Mr. Gates , of course , is legendary as a Harvard University dropout who went on to create the world ‚Äôs most successful software firm .
He has told associates that if had watched the lectures earlier in his life he might have become a physicist instead of a software entrepreneur .
However , Mr. Gates , who is also well known for his sharp and varied intellectual interests and his philanthropic commitment to education , said this week that he had purchased the rights to videos of seven lectures that Dr. Feynman gave at Cornell University called ‚Äú The Character of Physical Law , ‚Äù in an effort to make them broadly available via the Internet .
Microsoft Research announced on Wednesday that Mr. Gates , who purchased the rights to the videos privately from the Feynman estate , BBC and from Cornell University , in cooperation with Curtis Wong , a Microsoft researcher , has created a Web site that is intended to enhance the videos by annotating them with related digital content .
The name ‚Äú Tuva ‚Äù was chosen in reference to Dr. Feynman ‚Äôs decade long ‚Äî and ultimately unsuccessful ‚Äî effort to reach the tiny Russian republic of Tuva , which is located in Asia , toward the end of his life .
Mr. Gates said that he had stumbled upon the film version of the lectures a number of years ago , watched them with a friend using a traditional film projector , and ‚Äú fell in love ‚Äù with them .
The lectures are not the first acquisition of this kind that the software billionaire , has made .
In 1994 he acquired the Codex Leicester , a collection of the written work of Leonardo da Vinci , for $ 30.8 million in an auction .
He did not disclose the amount he spent to gain clear title to the Feynman lectures .
‚Äú I do think that making science cool to people when they ‚Äôre young and therefore getting more people to go into it in an in - depth way , I think that ‚Äôs very important right now , ‚Äù Mr. Gates said .
The Tuva Web site will be expanded with additional Feynman lectures in the future , Mr. Gates said .
When it is completed it will offer searchable transcripts from the lectures as well as commentary from well - known physicists .
The site also offers individual viewers the ability to annotate and take notes .
Currently , the first lecture has an ‚Äú extras ‚Äù features on the right side of the Web page which includes interactive animations and other components .
Mr. Gates said that he remained fascinated with the lectures , which are intended for a freshman college audience , but which he said were within the grasp of his ten - year - old son .
He noted that he had recently watched them again while he was helping Mr. Wong put up the Tuva Web site .
‚Äú I could n‚Äôt help myself , I watched them one more time , ‚Äù he said .
This post originally described Gates as a ‚Äú freshman ‚Äù dropout , that ‚Äôs incorrect .
He did make it to his sophomore year .
Right calls Sotomayor racist over line in talk SUPREME COURT NOMINEE

A line about Latina wisdom - hardly provocative at UC Berkeley in 2001 - has become a flash point for conservative opposition to Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor .
In a speech , Sotomayor was taking issue with then - Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 's dictum that a wise old man and a wise old woman would reach the same conclusion in a case .
" I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life , " she said .
But less than 24 hours after President Obama 's nomination of Sotomayor , now a federal appeals court judge , conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had called her a racist .
Gingrich said Sotomayor , who would be the first Latino on the nation 's highest court , should step down , arguing that if a white male nominee had said the same thing he would be forced to withdraw , and so should Sotomayor .
" The new racism is no different than the old racism , " Gingrich said .
The fact that the line was delivered at Berkeley only added fuel to a bonfire that may not jeopardize Sotomayor 's Senate confirmation but could recast her reputation .
White House responds
White House officials and liberal groups fired back , trying to put the sound - bite genie back in the bottle - in the world of cable television and 30 - second ads - by pointing to the context of the remarks .
The speech itself makes a fairly mundane argument , and some say obvious statement of fact , that all people bring their own life experiences to bear in making judgments .
It is as much a paean to family and hard work that it might bring applause from some conservatives .
Sotomayor recalled the " countless family holidays " celebrated in her South Bronx upbringing , watching adults play dominoes as the children played bingo using chickpeas , and of a soul nourished at her grandmother 's house with cousins and aunts .
" They were my friends as I grew up , " she said .
" My family showed me by their example how wonderful and vibrant life is and how wonderful and magical it is to have a Latina soul .
...
They taught me to love being a Puerto Rique√±a and to love America and value its lesson that great things could be achieved if one works hard for it . "
Conservatives who have studied Sotomayor 's judicial decisions , including her rulings against business interests , believe their side may be overreacting .
Urging restraint
" It 's not as if I think Obama 's incapable of nominating someone who is more adventurous and more activist by nature , " said Walter Olson , a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute .
" Maybe we should save the all - out blast for when he nominates that one . "
The case of the New Haven firefighters that critics are using to underline Sotomayor 's Berkeley speech also is not as clear - cut as it may seem at first glance .
The February 2008 case upheld the decision by the city of New Haven , Conn. , to throw out the results of a firefighter exam because it allowed only one Latino and no African Americans to be promoted .
The three - judge panel on the Second Circuit appeals court in New York , which included Sotomayor , ruled in an unusually brief opinion to affirm the lower court .
Hoover Institution scholar Thomas Sowell , a prominent African American conservative and fierce foe of affirmative action , cited the case in arguing that empathy for minorities cannot be reconciled with " equal justice under the law , " the motto inscribed on the entrance to the Supreme Court .
Sowell , in an article for National Review magazine , criticized Sotomayor for not giving the case " even the courtesy of spelling out the issue .
Apparently she did n't have ' empathy ' with those predominantly white males who had been cheated out of promotions they earned . "
Olson said the firefighter case is " a little bit tricky " and , if anything , is an example of how Sotomayor ducked the chance of a lifetime to take an activist role on affirmative action .
It was the rare sort of case that so vividly presented the issues that an archetype activist judge " would have said , ' Let me at it .
I 'm going to write a 50 - page opinion which is going to rally all the forces for affirmative action to show why we have to win this debate once and for all , ' " Olson said .
Instead , Sotomayor essentially waved the case through , " unusual behavior for a case that calls for all of your constitutional powers to be brought to bear , " Olson said .
" But if that 's the critique of her , it 's one that should give us pause . "
A former clerk for Sotomayor on the Second Circuit , UC Berkeley assistant law Professor Melissa Murray , said Sotomayor 's blossoming caricature does not match what she saw .
' Incredibly smart , fair '
" She has sterling credentials , " Murray said .
" She 's incredibly smart , she 's incredibly fair .
I think she takes every case on its merits .
She 's very rigorous in researching cases and she applies the law .
The idea of her as an activist is absolutely ludicrous .
In my time with her , I 've never seen anyone more sensitive to what the law in our circuit actually required . "
Jesse Choper , a UC Berkeley constitutional law professor , said Sotomayor might take back her Berkeley words if she could , saying they were inelegantly put .
" But having said that , " Choper said , " every Supreme Court justice , every human being , is the product of their own experience , their own education , their own background , their own values . "
A woman brought up riding horses in Arizona may have a different perspective than a woman brought up in the South Bronx , he said , referring to O'Connor , who grew up in Arizona .
" That 's inevitable .
Absolutely inevitable . "
Royal Dutch
Shell , the big oil company , agreed to pay $ 15.5 million to settle a case accusing it of taking part in human rights abuses in the Niger Delta in the early 1990s , a striking sum given that the company has denied any wrongdoing .
The settlement , announced late Monday , came days before the start of a trial in New York that was expected to reveal extensive details of Shell ‚Äôs activities in the Niger Delta .
The announcement caps a protracted legal battle that began shortly after the death of the Nigerian activist Ken Saro - Wiwa in 1995 .
Mr. Saro - Wiwa ,
Shell ‚Äôs most prominent critic at the time in Nigeria , was hanged by that country ‚Äôs military regime after protesting the company ‚Äôs environmental practices in the oil - rich delta , especially in his native Ogoni region .
Shell continued Monday to deny any role in the death .
It called the settlement a ‚Äú humanitarian gesture ‚Äù meant to compensate the plaintiffs , including Mr. Saro - Wiwa ‚Äôs family , for their loss and to cover a portion of their legal fees and costs .
Some of the money will go into an educational and social trust fund intended to benefit the Ogoni people .
Forget what the CNBC squawkers tells you .
We are not out of the woods yet .
Economic measures continue to track remarkably closesly with the downturn in 1929 , the start of the Great Depression .
These charts , by Barry Eichengreen of the University of California at Berkeley and Kevin O‚ÄôRourke of Trinity College , Dublin , tell the story .
One key quote : ‚Äú World industrial production continues to track closely the 1930s fall , with no clear signs of ‚Äò green shoots ‚Äô . ‚Äù
The good news , the authors explain , is that the policy response has been different this time , so the worst can still be avoided .
‚Äú The question now is whether that policy response will work , ‚Äù the authors write .
The Financial Times ‚Äô Martin Wolf , who is probably the most influential economic columnist in the world , puts this information in some plain - language context .
The question is whether today ‚Äôs unprecedented stimulus will offset the effect of financial collapse and unprecedented accumulations of private sector debt in the US and elsewhere .
If the former wins , we will soon see a positive deviation from the path of the Great Depression .
If the latter wins , we will not .
What everybody hopes is clear .
But what should we expect ?
We are seeing a race between the repair of private balance sheets and global rebalancing of demand , on the one hand , and the sustainability of stimulus , on the other .
Robust private sector demand will return only once the balance sheets of over - indebted households , overborrowed businesses and undercapitalised financial sectors are repaired or when countries with high savings rates consume or invest more .
None of this is likely to be quick .
Indeed , it is far more likely to take years , given the extraordinary debt accumulations of the past decade .
Over the past two quarters , for example , US households repaid just 3.1 per cent of their debt .
Deleveraging is a lengthy process .
Meanwhile , the federal government has become the only significant borrower .
Similarly , the Chinese government can swiftly expand investment .
But it is harder for policy to raise levels of consumption .

The senator , sitting at an antique rolltop desk in his Houston office , gripped the handset tighter .
Whitmire is the bald - headed , blunt - talking chair of the state senate 's Criminal Justice Committee , a law - and - order man who displays an engraved pistol in his office .
But that call last October 7 , he says , " scared the hell out of me . "
Richard Tabler , the man on the other end of the line , had murdered at least two people and possibly four .
He was a prisoner on Texas ' death row , supposedly locked safely away .
But from the narrow bunk of his solitary cell an hour 's drive north of Houston , Tabler had reached out and touched one of the Lone Star State 's most powerful politicians with a smuggled Motorola cell phone .
Tabler insists he was just voicing concerns to a public official .
" I was talking to him about treatment on death row , how inmates are abused back here , not fed , not showered , " he says , sitting in a locked booth in the visiting room of Polunsky Unit , the sprawling facility that houses death row .
He 's facing me through a thick pane of bulletproof glass .
We talk , of course , by telephone .
Tall , pale , and gangly , with wispy facial hair and big green eyes that bulge like an emu's , Tabler looks considerably younger than his 30 years .
A crudely tattooed tear leaks from one eye .
Rows of thin white self - inflicted scars mark the backs of his hands and forearms .
A former cook with a long , violent criminal history , Tabler wound up in Polunsky after resolving a disagreement with the manager of a strip club and his friend by shooting them dead .
Days later , two teenage pole dancers who worked at the club were also murdered .
Tabler freely owns up to shooting the two men , which earned him his death sentence .
He has at various times admitted and denied slaying the strippers .
( He tells me he " gave the green light " for their murders . )
Whitmire did n't believe Tabler when he announced who he was .
So the inmate kicked the door of his cell , flushed his steel toilet , and held the phone out to the clanging and yelling from the row 's other residents .
And , just to make sure he had the senator 's attention , Tabler rattled off those personal details about his daughters .
Tabler claims he did n't mean to threaten Whitmire .
" I was letting him know that just because I 'm on death row , it does n't mean I 'm stupid , " he says .
" It does n't mean I ca n't get information . "
Inmates are n't allowed to have cell phones in any US prison , let alone on death row .
But the 21st century 's ubiquitous communications tools are nonetheless turning up by the thousands in lockups not just in Texas but across the US and around the world .
Last year alone , officials confiscated 947 phones in Maryland , some 2,000 handsets and accessories in South Carolina , and 2,800 mobiles in California .
The presence of cell phones is changing the very meaning of imprisonment .
Incarceration is supposed to isolate criminals , keeping them away from one another and the rest of us so they can't cause any more harm .
But with a wireless handset , an inmate can slip through walls and locked doors at will and maintain a digital presence in the outside world .
Prisoners are using voice calls , text messages , email , and handheld Web browsers to taunt their victims , intimidate witnesses , run gangs , and organize escapes ‚Äî including at least one incident in Tennessee in which a guard was killed .
An Indiana inmate doing 40 years for arson made harassing calls to a 23 - year - old woman he'd never met and phoned in bomb threats to the state fair for extra laughs .
Video : California Department of Corrections " Cell phones , " says James Gondles , executive director of the American Correctional Association , " are now one of our top security threats . "
Talking to his own security threat , Whitmire stayed calm , hearing out the prisoner 's complaints .
He noted Tabler 's number , then promptly called John Moriarty , the Texas prison system 's beefy , mustached inspector general , asking how the hell an inmate had gotten hold of a cell phone in what is supposed to be one of the state 's highest - security lockups .
Moriarty 's people subpoenaed the records for the phone that had dialed Whitmire .
They were astonished by what they found :
The device had logged more than 2,800 calls and text messages in the preceding month .
At least nine other prisoners had used it , investigators say , including members of such notorious gangs as the Aryan Brotherhood and the Crips .
In response , on October 20 , Texas governor Rick Perry ordered every one of the state 's 112 prisons locked down and all 156,000 inmates searched .
Officials found 128 phones , including a dozen on death row , as well as scores of chargers , batteries , and SIM cards .
That brought the total number of phones and related items confiscated from Texas prisons in 2008 to more than 1,000 .
Confiscated handsets ; Alba , a phone - sniffing Belgian Malinois , demonstrates her keen nose .
Photos : Andrew Hetherington Tabler was chatting with a reporter from the Austin American - Statesman when Perry 's statewide search kicked off .
" Give me 15 minutes and I 'll tell you what kind of car you drive , " he bragged .
" I 'll tell you your Social Security number . "
Minutes later , a team of riot - suited guards stormed his cell .
Prisoners have always been able to communicate with the outside world , through whispered conversations with visitors , smuggled notes , and a litany of more ingenious methods .
But the ease with which they can do it today is chilling .
During a hearing on the activities of Blood gang members imprisoned in New Jersey , a state police officer testified that he listened in on a 45 - minute conference call that linked Bloods in three different lockups with three others on the streets .
And then there are all the worrisome things a prisoner might look up online , like recipes for making explosives , tips for faking medical conditions , or the home addresses of , say , a politician 's daughters ‚Äî not to mention guards and various enemies .
Consider the case of a , a 38 - year - old Maryland resident who had the bad luck to witness a street murder in Baltimore and the rare courage to agree to testify against the accused killer , Patrick Byers .
According to prosecutors , Byers acquired a phone while awaiting trial in Baltimore 's City Detention Center .
He obtained Lackl 's name , address , and phone number and allegedly texted that information to a friend on the outside , along with an offer of $ 2,500 to get rid of Lackl .
On July 2 , 2007 , the friend rounded up a couple of thugs and drove out to Lackl 's modest suburban home , where authorities say the crew blasted him to death with a .44 Magnum .
Grim as that story is , it 's just an intimation of how dangerous cell - phone - connected inmates can be if their network is left to grow unchecked .
Brazil provides an especially bloody lesson .
For years , the country 's largest prison gang , Primeiro Comando da Capital , has been using mobile phones to strengthen its grip on the state of S√®3o Paulo 's inmates and establish a presence on the outside .
In 2006 , annoyed by the transfer of some of its members to more restrictive facilities , the PCC used its cellular network to launch simultaneous riots in dozens of prisons and a wave of attacks on police in the streets of the state capital .
More than 40 officers and guards were killed in the first four days alone .
Hundreds more died in the ensuing violence .
The North Branch Correctional Institution spreads out along a wooded valley in mountainous western Maryland .
The massive , low - lying complex of concrete and razor wire is one of the most technologically sophisticated maximum - security prisons in the nation .
Electronic cell doors are opened remotely .
Touching the perimeter fence triggers a volley of microwaves that alerts video cameras to focus on the spot .
But despite the fancy surveillance gear , phones keep finding their way in .
" Inmates come up with all kinds of methods , " says former NBCI warden John Rowley as he leafs through photos of mobiles found in hollowed - out soap bars and glued - together stacks of graham crackers .
Elsewhere , phones have been tied to carrier pigeons and lashed to arrows shot over prison walls .
Officials found 78 devices welded inside an air compressor being delivered to one Texas lockup .
But the easiest ‚Äî and probably most common ‚Äî way mobiles are moving into prisons is in the pockets of guards and other prison staff .
" There 's no question that corrupt officers are involved , " says Texas inspector general Moriarty .
The risk is small , the payoff big .
Correctional staff coming to work are typically searched only lightly , if at all , and a phone can fetch a couple thousand dollars .
One California officer told investigators he made more than $ 100,000 in a single year selling phones .
Prisoners face a similar risk - reward calculus .
In most states , the laws have n't kept pace with technology ; getting caught with a cell phone is not a crime but a rule violation , like being found in possession of a cigarette .
And there 's good money to be made on rentals .
Once a phone is in , prisoners have little trouble concealing it .
Cellular components have been found stashed inside Bible bindings , shoe heels , peanut butter jars , and toilet pipes .
Moriarty has an x-ray showing a handset and charger lodged up what he refers to as an inmate 's " keister . "
( Which begs the question : ring or vibrate ? )
To find concealed phones , North Branch uses a decidedly low tech piece of equipment : Alba , an irrationally exuberant , gingerbread - colored Belgian Malinois .
It turns out that mobiles have a distinct scent , which specially trained dogs like Alba can detect .
" I did n't believe it would work at first , " says Peter Anderson , who has been head trainer of the Maryland prison system 's canine unit for a decade .
But after learning the method from a British colleague who developed it in 2006 , Anderson trained four dogs for Maryland .
Last year , they flushed out 59 phones .
( original segment from July 20th )
Scumbag Ralph Peters , a retired Lt. Colonel turned Fox News " analyst " made some nasty statements about captured U.S. soldier Bowe Berdahl earlier this week , calling him a deserter and basically saying the Taliban should execute him :
Now look , Julie , I want to be clear .
If , when the facts are in , we find out that through some convoluted chain of events , he really was captured by the Taliban , I 'm with him .
But , if he walked away from his post and his buddies at wartime ...
I do n't care how hard it sounds , as far as I 'm concerned , the Taliban can save us a lot of legal hassles and legal bills .
Now a bipartisan group of House veterans led by Ohio Democrat , John Boccieri has sent a letter to Fox News ' Roger Ailes , demanding an apology .
As members of Congress and veterans of the United States Armed Forces , it was with incredulity and disgust that we watched Fox News Strategic Analyst Lt. Colonel Ralph Peters ( Ret. ) suggest on your airwaves that Private First Class Bowe Bergdahl , " abandoned his buddies , abandoned his post , and just walked off , " and stated that , if this is true , " the Taliban can save us a lot of legal hassles and legal bills . "
Mr. Peters ' comments are so far beyond the pale that they do n't even approach the decorum and respect deserved by a member of the United States Armed Forces .
Mr. Peters ' indefensible comments call into question , without any supporting evidence whatsoever , PFC Bergdahl 's patriotism and commitment to his country , and suggest in a non-subtle way that he deserved to be captured .
The events surrounding the capture of PFC Bergdahl are irrelevant at this point .
The only priority should be his safe and immediate release to U.S. forces .
Read on ...
Peters attempted to backtrack , but according to Think Progress , he 's still using Fox News to attack the captured U.S. soldier .
Will Ailes do the right thing by firing Peters and publicly apologizing to Bergdahl 's family ?
I would n't count on it .
My dad made a remark once that if you want to be good in sales , you ca n‚Äôt just believe that the glass is half full .
You have to say with a straight face that a half - full glass is better than a completely full glass .
Anyhow , my shop has generally good relationships between the technical team and the sales team .
There ‚Äôs one thing that drives me nuts though : when we discuss priority and they try to negotiate with me on my estimates .
It goes a little like this :
me : I saw your note about creating a new permission - level between employee and administrator , where you want to let the shift supervisor do admin work on just their direct reports .
In other words , two different shift supervisors will see two different lists of employees even though their permissions are identical .
I figure that ‚Äôs an 8 - point project .
Billy Mays : No way !
You just need an entity code to track what department that supervisor is attached to and then only show the people in that department .
Me : Yeah .
the shamwow guy : I do n‚Äôt see how that is a big change .
It ‚Äôs just one extra column in the database .
Just add that entity code into your queries .
Me :
It is straightforward .
I ‚Äôm not confused about how to do it .
It ‚Äôs going to take a long time .
There are lot of places that I need to alter to use this new approach .
Ron Popeil : are we using an object - oriented approach in the code ?
I hear you say that you ‚Äôre going to have to change a lot of places in the code .
At $ {A MUCH BIGGER SOFTWARE COMPANY} , we used single objects so that we did n‚Äôt have to change a lot to alter behavior .
The minute when I start justifying my estimate or explaining why I have to change a lot of things , I ‚Äôve lost .
They go into ‚Äú close the deal ‚Äù mode .
There is a primal instinct at work here that outclasses higher brain functions .
If sales people did n‚Äôt have a highly evolved chase instinct , they would suck at sales .
When they see me trying to explain why it ‚Äôs going to take that long , they will just nag nag nag until I give in .
And that ‚Äôs what we need them for ‚Äî that ‚Äôs how sales works .
So I have found that the way out of this situation IS NOT to go technical and start explaining how code works .
They ‚Äôre NEVER going to say gee , now that you gave me a quick tutorial in web application design , and then you explained how you ‚Äôll need to rewrite the permissions decorators to use a new state factory , I guess your estimate makes sense .
Instead , this approach works OK for me :
Me : I think it is a great idea and it wo n‚Äôt require a lot of research and development , but it ‚Äôs going to take a while .
So based on that estimate , should we put into the queue or not ?
I do n‚Äôt address the remark about OOD and I do n‚Äôt explain why .
From a salesman ‚Äôs perspective , you do n‚Äôt close deals by acknowledging why the prospect does n‚Äôt need what you ‚Äôre selling .
You close deals by overcoming objections .
The salesman ‚Äôs natural instinct is to see an obstacle and wear it down .
So the key is not to feed that .
Instead , stonewall them .
Over time , they ‚Äôll respect you more because of it .
Here ‚Äôs the bottom line : sales people are not like us .
And that is OK .
We need them .
And we can work together as long as we all follow some rules .
Do n‚Äôt take away their bowl while they eat and never justify anything .
Taking care of your dog is important for his health and well being .
Your dog is a part of your family and depends on you for all of his needs .
As your family member , you want to ensure that he has the proper nutrition to remain active and happy .
Here are some tips on proper nutrition for your baby .
Seven Essential Nutrients
The most important nutrient for your dogs health is water .
His body is made up of about 60 percent water , and puppy ‚Äôs bodies contain 84 percent water .
Loss of that can cause problems that are difficult to overcome .
You want to make sure that you keep him properly hydrated daily .
Carbohydrates and fats are both high in energy which is essential for proper nutrition .
Fats are available in plant and animal products , and dry dog food usually contains at least half percentage of carbohydrates .
Vitamins are essential to help your dog process biochemicals which are chemicals created and used by people .
Minerals aid with nerve conduction , and egg protein , chicken breast protein powder , and even chicken protein gravy is especially important for dogs because they are carnivorous animals .
Foods to Avoid
There are certain foods that you should n‚Äôt feed your dog because they can cause serious health issues or even death .
Some of them include :
Chocolates and sugar
Caffeine products
Citrus extracts
Dairy products
Onions and garlic
You should make sure your dog does n‚Äôt have bones which can splinter and cause major intestinal problems .
Fatty foods are also bad for a dog ‚Äôs digestive system .
Many people feed their dog table scraps when they are eating or when they ‚Äôve finished .
This is a bad idea because there are things in food like garlic and onions that can cause issues .
Another reason is the more your dog eats scraps , the less they will be likely to eat their food which can cause a lack in the proper nutrients they need .
Treats are good as a snack or to reward your dog for something they do .
Some treats have other ingredients that are good for dogs that may not be found in their food .
Obesity in Dogs
Overfeeding your dog or not allowing him to exercise enough can cause obesity .
40 to 50 percent of dogs end up becoming overweight at some point in their lives .
Because of this , they have a better chance of contracting diseases such as cancer and heart disease .
Supplements
Adding supplements to your dog ‚Äôs diet can be a good way to ensure that he gets the proper nutrients he needs especially when he gets older .
There are supplements for arthritis and joints , skin and coat , food supplements for digestion and extra nutritional supplements .
Antioxidants slow the aging process by protecting the body from damage of free radicals , and multi-vitamins provide essential nutrients for the entire body .
There are supplements available for different ages , health issues and breeds .
Your veterinarian can recommend a good supplement for your dog according to his needs .
What Proper Nutrition Does for Your Dog
Proper nutrition allows your dog to grow and develop in a healthy manner .
Your dog will remain mentally and physically well .
Puppies should be eating dry dog food by the age of eight weeks old , and they require twice the energy than an adult dog .
It ‚Äôs best to get your puppy a food that contains at least 30 percent protein .
Proper nutrition allows your dog to have good muscle tone , their skin and coat will remain healthy and their digestion system will work properly .
It also allows the immune system to work well with less chance of your dog contracting an illness .
What to Look for in Dog Food
You should always read the label on your dog ‚Äôs food before buying it to ensure that it contains quality pet food ingredients .
On higher quality food , a meat will be listed as the first or second ingredient .
This means that the food has a high percentage of protein in it .
Make sure that the food you buy him is fit for his age .
Outdoor dogs will need a higher amount of protein because they are more active .
Working dogs and puppies require more calories .
Your vet can help you determine which dog food is essential for your dog ‚Äôs health .
Overall
You dog is and will always be a big part of your family .
He depends on you to ensure that he has the proper nutrition to remain healthy .
He provides you with unconditional love and is there for you whenever you want him to be .
Show him how much you love him by providing him with a healthy diet , and he will provide you with that love for many years .
Take a look at his blog :
Expanding copyright law to bar online access to copyrighted materials without the copyright holder 's consent , or to bar linking to or paraphrasing copyrighted materials without the copyright holder 's consent , might be necessary to keep free riding on content financed by online newspapers from so impairing the incentive to create costly news - gathering operations that news services like Reuters and the Associated Press would become the only professional , nongovernmental sources of news and opinion .
Notice that according to him , what I just did should be illegal .
I should n't need to point out how incredibly stupid this idea is , and the TechCrunch article says the same .
Kos has addressed the sheer idiocy of blocking linking more than once , but basically it boils down to one thing .
Without linking , newspapers ' readership will literally drop to zero .
Most of these papers get vast amounts of traffic from hotlinks on other sites .
How much of the NY Times ' opinion columns are driven by our Pundit roundups , I wonder ?
And blocking people from linking successfully to your content is a relatively trivial programming exercise if you 're content to stop 90 % instead of 100 % .
If the newspapers do block linking to their online content , just like the AP seems permanently on the verge of doing , people wo n't start going to their homepages , and clicking on their ads .
Once you vanish off Google , you 're no longer a news source .
Instead , sites like Daily Kos etc will pop up , and local newspapers will see their chance to shine .
So thank you , Judge Richard Posner , for proposing a legal backing for newspapers to commit suicide .
And that does n't even begin to address the incredible violations of fair use and general abuse of copyright involved in this .
Not to mention your catastrophic failure to understand anything about how the web works .
For the third year in a row , Ohio is ranked among the worst two states for water quality .
But the concerns are n't just with the water .
Recent studies suggest sand is contaminated as well .
Plain Dealer environment reporter Michael Scott tackled this subject in his news story and in this edition of " More to the Story . "
Get more environmental news on Scott 's blog and take a look at his series on the Cuyahoga River .

LOUISVILLE , KY ‚Äì
On the same day that the U.S. Supreme Court limited the use of strip searches in the public schools , two young women filed an action in Jefferson County Court against a local middle school and several of its employees for using ‚Äú grossly intrusive ‚Äù methods to discover an alleged cache of marijuana .
They were allegedly forced to unzip their pants , ‚Äú lift up their bras ‚Ä¶ and jump up and down . ‚Äù
Ashley N. Gaither and S.C. , a minor , were 14 and 13 , respectively , in 2005 when they say they were ‚Äú arbitrarily singled out ‚Äù while riding a Jefferson County Public Schools bus to Kammer Middle School in Louisville , and then subjected to a day - long interrogation and humiliating searches without being allowed to call their parents .
According to the complaint , the incident began when the bus arrived at the school and two employees boarded it in order to resolve a dispute in which the girls were not involved .
The employees ‚Äú smelled what they thought was marijuana , ‚Äù the complaint states , and five girls seated at the back of the bus , including Gaither and S.C. , were detained and searched .
During an interrogation that lasted the entire school day , and after being denied repeated requests to call their parents , the girls were required to ‚Äú remove their shoes and socks , unbuckle their belts , unbutton their pants , and unzip their pants , ‚Äù the complaint says .
They also had their ‚Äú waistlines physically touched and searched ‚Äù by a male employee while their pants were undone , and were made to ‚Äú lift up their bras while their shirts remained on and jump up and down . ‚Äù
The searches were all performed behind closed doors and without the presence of police offices or female staff , the suit says .
No marijuana was found .
At the end of the day , the girls were allegedly barred from riding the school bus home and instead made to take public transportation .
The Supreme Court ruled 8 - 1 last week that an Arizona school district went too far when it strip - searched a female student suspected of hiding prescription - strength Ibuprofen in her underwear .
The high court said that such searches would only be justified if there was an ‚Äú indication of danger to the students from the power of the drugs or their quantity , ‚Äù or if a student was suspected of hiding a weapon .
Gaither and S.C. seek unspecified damages .
They are represented by Johnny Bruce of Jones & Bruce .
Read the full complaint .
‚Äì Article from Courthouse News Service on June 2 , 2009 .
Two people have been shot at the Holocaust Museum in Washington , DC .
The shooter has been identified as James Wenneker von Brunn , a man with ties to various right - wing hate groups .
His Web site is here .
At the risk of putting too fine a point on it , we should note that since September 11 , 2001 , more innocent American citizens have been killed by anti-abortion activists and other fringe right terrorists than by al Qaeda .
Oddly , we ‚Äôre hearing no calls from Republican legislators or party leaders like Rush Limbaugh ( or their Vichy Democrat allies ) demanding that we invade Coeur d‚ÄôAlene .
So are we serious about terror or not ?
You can always count on John McCain and Tom Coburn for some high drama , but now they mock American families with this one .
The Politico :
Congressional Republicans opposed to the public insurance option want House and Senate members who vote for it to take a dose of their own medicine ‚Äî and enroll in the plan .
Rep. John Fleming ( R - La. ) , a family physician , kicked off the quixotic bid last week , urging House members to give up their right to participate in the much - revered Federal Employees Health Benefits Program if they support a government - run program as part of the health care reform package .
Sens . John McCain of Arizona and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma are pushing the same concept in the Senate , preparing separate amendments that would require members ‚Äî and maybe even their staffs ‚Äî to sign up for the public option .
With Democrats firmly in control of Congress , the idea is not likely to gain traction .
Proponents of the public plan say the resolution would do exactly what Republicans have warned against , undermining the private insurance system by moving people into a public plan .
But the effort has caught fire in the right - wing blogosphere and on talk radio , serving as a rallying point for conservatives opposed to one of the top priorities of Democrats ... read on
The blogs have been suggesting that all members of Congress should give up their health insurance and then try to find it on their own without mention that they are in Congress and then we 'll see what they think about the health care debate .
I 'd say 40 % of them would n't get any coverage at all .
( My number is just a guess )
Now with this dopey amendment I wish the media would ask these two and the rest of Republican obstructionists to give it all up .
Jonathan Oberlander
Republicans who oppose universal health insurance should immediately relinquish their federal health insurance .
After all , these members of Congress have long enjoyed taxpayer - subsidized health insurance , a privilege that they apparently believe tens of millions of working , uninsured Americans and their families do n't deserve .
Congressman Fleming of Louisiana says that " Congress should lead by example . " I agree .
If Republicans do n't think being uninsured is a big deal , then they should go right ahead and try it out .
And if they really believe a public plan is such a bad option , maybe they can persuade their parents to give up Medicare too .
I 'm so sick of these gasbags and their elitist views about life in America .
Mrs. McCain can build her own mini-hospital with her cash if need be , but her husband attacks reform that could help millions of American families .
Instead of mocking workers with satirical amendments they should try to find real solutions .
Playing games with dumb proposals is government waste .
Maybe Coburn and McCain can refund the portions of their salaries back to us for the time they waste with this on our dime .
Part 2 : Successful iPhone Developers
Part 3 : The iTunes App Store Bannings and Rejections
On July 10 , 2008 , Apple launched the iTunes App Store and helped transform the way people look at and use their phones .
Over the past 12 months , the iTunes App Store has seen its share of controversy and milestones .
It ‚Äôs been the center of many a public bashing , and has made many developers impressively wealthy .
While Apple ‚Äôs approval process regarding which apps it allows into the app store has been the cause for a lot of criticism , there ‚Äôs no denying that the iTunes App Store is a force that seemingly can‚Äôt be stopped .
It currently boasts well over 60,000 applications , and has seen over 1 Billion downloads .
Impressively , downloads from the iTunes App Store are n‚Äôt just growing , they ‚Äôre accelerating .
As an example , it took Apple about 6 months to reach 500 Million downloaded apps while the next 500 Million downloads took only 3 months .
With the iTunes App Store about to turn 1 this Friday , we ‚Äôve created a rough timeline of significant and noteworthy events that highlight the iTunes App Store ‚Äôs brief , yet influential existence .
We ‚Äôve broken down the past 12 months into 3 categories that best encapsulate all that made the App Store so revolutionary , impressive , and controversial .
Specifically , we look at how fast the iTunes App Store grew in just a short amount of time , the developers who were able to cash in on it , and of course , Apple ‚Äôs never ending problems revolving around its approval process .
In Part I , we take a look at the iTunes App Store ‚Äôs explosive and unprecedented growth .
Part I : Explosive Growth
The iTunes App Store opened up for business about 1 year ago and boasted a somewhat modest figure of 500 applications .
Since then , the number of downloads and available applications has skyrocketed .
Just two months into the app store , Apple issued a press release announcing that iPhone and iPod Touch users had downloaded over 100 million applications from what was then a 3,000 strong library of available titles .
A little over 2 months later , on October 21 , 2008 , Apple announced that 200 million applications had been downloaded from the iTunes App Store .
On December 5 , 2008 , Apple took out ads in a number of newspapers touting that the App Store library had surpassed 10,000 applications and that there had been over 300 million downloads .
By mid-January 2009 , Apple placed a banner on its homepage announcing that the number of available apps now came in at more than 15,000 , and that over 500 million apps had been downloaded .
By way of comparison , it took iTunes Music over 2 years to reach 500 million downloaded songs .
The iTunes App Store reached that figure in less than 200 days , and showed no signs of slowing down .
On March 5th , the number of available titles in the App Store grew to 25,000 , and the iPhone platform finally surpassed Windows Mobile as the platform with the largest selection of mobile apps .
And on March 17th , Apple announced at a special iPhone OS 3.0 preview event that there had been over 800 million apps downloaded from iTunes .
The race to a billion was on .
After only 9 months , the iTunes App Store officially hit 1 Billion downloads on April 23 , 2009 .
By way of comparison , it took nearly 3 years before the Billionth song was downloaded from iTunes .
Granted , many of the app store downloads are free , but the sheer volume is still undoubtedly impressive .
And finally , on June 8 , Apple announced at its WWDC that there were now over 50,000 apps in the app store , and recent figures show that that figure now exceeds 60,000 .

* African ministers in common front ahead of December talks
* Ministers seek access to funds to combat climate change
NAIROBI , May 29 ( Reuters ) -
The challenges facing Africa to fight climate change are enormous and costs are huge though hard to quantify , South Africa 's environment minister said on Friday .
Minister Buyelwa Sonjica said her peers from more than 30 African countries , meeting in Nairobi , had agreed a joint position on climate change , to be presented at negotiations in Copenhagen this December .
" Increased support to Africa should be based on priorities which include adaptation , capacity building , financing and technology development and transfer , " she told a news conference .
The world 's poorest continent is expected to be hardest hit by climate change , despite having the lowest emissions of greenhouse gases .
According to the United Nations , between 250 and 750 million people in Africa will face water shortages by 2020 , while in some African countries , yields from rain - fed agriculture could be reduced by up to 50 percent by 2020 .
" Most of the work remains to be done , particularly with the cost of adaptation in Africa estimated between $ 1 billion to $ 50 billion per year , " Sonjica said .
Sonjica , who is the president of the African Ministerial Conference on the Environment , urged rich countries not to attach conditions on assistance given to developing countries .
" African governments must commit certain amounts from their budget , but you cannot commit what you do n't have .
I get a sense that there is a push for us to over - commit , " she said .
COSTS
The United Nations has estimated the costs of adapting to rising seas in Africa could amount to at least 5 - to - 10 percent of gross domestic product towards the end of this century .
It also projects an increase of 5 - to - 8 percent of arid and semi-arid lands in Africa by 2080 .
Africa advocates expansion of categories so that countries can benefit from carbon credits , and other international incentives to include agriculture and forest management .
Yvo de Boer , head of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat , said bigger countries such as China and Korea had won more funds than Africa from rich nations to help cut greenhouse gases .
Africa has received relatively little aid because the projects available in the continent were much smaller , he told a news conference .
" Because many economies in Africa are very small , not a lot can be done to reduce emissions gases , so reducing emissions in Africa is not as big an opportunity as it is in Asian countries , " he said .

I am sorry to report that there will be no September issue .
Auntie is fine but a bit overwhelmed with life at the moment plus I had no internet while on my trip .
I apologize to my readers but expect and hope to publish in October .
To see last month 's issue .
Careful !
The beach you 're rushing off to this weekend might actually be a sewer .
Human and animal waste , among other sewage overflow , contaminate the beachwaters of virtually every sandy retreat in the country .
There were over 20,000 closing and advisory days last year at ocean , bay and Great Lake beaches because of high levels of bacteria and pollutants in the waters , according to the annual beachwater quality report ‚Äì Testing The Waters ‚Äì released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) .
The agency also provides 5 - star rating guide for 200 of the nation 's most popular beaches , based on beachwater quality , monitoring frequency , and public notification of contamination .
Beachgoers who swim in polluted waters are at risk of contracting from various types of skin rashes and infections to meningitis and hepatitis .
Coastal cities can implement various green strategies such as green rooftops and permeable sidewalks to reduce and eliminate stromwater runoff , which overflows the sewage systems and dump polluted water in the oceans and lake .
ELBERT ‚Äî
A twister danced on the plains Monday afternoon , leveling two barns and uprooting trees in Elbert County , as the Front Range endured its eighth consecutive day of tornadic weather .
The weather , however , is n‚Äôt that unusual for early June , said National Weather Service meteorologist Kyle Fredin .
Recent dry years and technology that delivers instant weather warnings and dramatic photos of funnel clouds and twisters for TV and the Internet probably make typical June thunderstorms seem more prolific , he said .
‚Äú I know awareness is heightened , and I know it ‚Äôs been pretty active every day for a week , but June is our stormiest month , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú I know from sitting in front of this radar for 15 years that , yeah , this happens . ‚Äù
Monday ‚Äôs twister was on the ground in Elbert County for only about six minutes , according to the National Weather Service .
The tornado , about 100 yards wide , leveled two barns less than a mile apart west of the town of Elbert about 1:30 p.m .
The storm cut through a grove of pi√±on and ponderosa trees , snapping 2 - foot - thick trunks .
One barn had sentimental and historic value to Bryce Gresham , 82 .
He leases the barn now , but it was built in 1918 by his father ‚Äôs friend , he explained , tears welling in his eyes .
Gresham , who sleeps in the bedroom where he was born , has seen no twister leave as much damage on his 3,000 - acre farm and ranch , he said .
‚Äú I figured I could outrun it , ‚Äù Gresham said of the twister ‚Äôs approach .
‚Äú When it headed toward my property , I just backed up to get out of its way .
There were light poles in the air and wires were flashing .
‚Äú When it happens , you do n‚Äôt think about being afraid . ‚Äù
A mile away , Phil Brown ‚Äôs 70 - year - old barn was leveled , a nearby cinder - block shed was torn open like a bag of chips and tools were scattered .
Brown ran for cover after he looked out from his porch and saw the funnel cloud spiraling to the ground and toward him .
‚Äú Honestly , you always hear about the noise they make , like a freight train , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú I heard none of that . ‚Äù
In the aftermath , the family rushed to find their animals .
The dog , which had taken cover , came home first , but a steer had to be cut free from the barn .
A goat was still missing Monday afternoon , but another stood atop the wreckage of the barn .
The Browns ‚Äô house had only a broken window .
‚Äú I ‚Äôm just glad everybody is OK , ‚Äù said Brown ‚Äôs wife , Irene , surveying the wreckage .
‚Äú Everything else can be replaced . ‚Äù
Adele Waits watched from her house southeast of the Browns ‚Äô as one funnel cloud whipped itself into a fury .
It was the first she had ever seen .
‚Äú We were watching the rotation in the clouds and it just kept gathering more and more , ‚Äù she said .
June Turner of Franktown spotted the twister after her weather radio sounded an alert .
She has lived near Franktown more than 30 years , and she ‚Äôs seen tornadoes before .
‚Äú Not this big , ‚Äù she said .
‚Äú This one was really big . ‚Äù
The turbulent weather covered a wide swath .
At one point Monday afternoon , a tornado watch ‚Äî meaning conditions favorable for twisters ‚Äî was in effect for 15 eastern Colorado counties and 32 counties in western Nebraska .
Staff writer Joey Bunch and researcher Barry Osborne contributed to this story .
June soggy , but metro yearly totals on track
The metro region ‚Äôs official weather - monitoring station at Denver International Airport ‚Äî near the heart of the last week ‚Äôs storms ‚Äî has measured 2.25 inches of precipitation this month , which is 1.46 inches above normal .
This time a year ago , DIA had received 0.73 inches for the month .
For the year , metro Denver has received 7.77 inches , only about a half - inch above average .
This time last year , the metro region had netted only 3.04 inches of moisture all year .
Chances of afternoon thunderstorms will persist Wednesday , but warmer , dryer weather is expected to follow , National Weather Service meteorologist Kyle Fredin said .
‚Äú The monsoon season starts the second week of July , and we start this all over , ‚Äù Fredin said .

A picture - perfect effort
For an out - of - work aircraft executive , Darrel Watson ‚Äôs a pretty good photographer .
Watson , 60 , was home with his wife , Wally , on Monday afternoon when he stepped outside to look at ominous clouds .
Minutes later , with an Olympus C-4000 Zoom digital camera in hand , he captured spectacular images of a twister that descended about a half - mile away .
Watson and his wife live in Kelly Airpark , a development of homes surrounding an airfield just west of Elbert .
He has been looking for work since the economic downturn meant the end of his job as vice president of quality assurance at AAI Acquisition Inc .
Photography , he said , is only a hobby .

" systems analysis , "
is a disturbing history of very smart people putting their brains at the service of very stupid ideas .
Wohlstetter 's analysis
had inspired and advanced a new generation of apprentices who would become the Neocons : Richard Perle , Paul Wolfowitz , Donald Rumsfeld , Dick Cheney , Zalmay Khalilzad .
" scientific "
Like the Bolsheviks , they believed in reason yet never examined their basic premises .
Their patriotism was as irrational as that of the Vietcong , but far more destructive .
It did n't matter .
As long as they had access to the billions in the US defense budget , and they could invoke a Soviet or terrorist threat , they flourished .
So blockbuster helmer Michael Bay is very , very angry at two of the producers of his latest Transformers , Don Murphy and Tom DeSanto .
How do I know this ?
Because Bay wrote an extraordinary screed about them on his blog last Friday .
And then he removed the posting shortly after .
An eagle - eyed source saw the original , forwarded it , and I ‚Äôve confirmed it ‚Äôs genuine .
( Update : Michael thought better of it and took it down , ‚Äù a source close to the pic emailed me tonight .
‚Äú Do you have to keep it up ? ‚Äù Well , do n‚Äôt blame me , blame Google . )
This is one of the most nakedly honest insights into a director ‚Äôs personality that I ‚Äôve ever come across .
As well as a reminder that success in Hollywood has many fathers , but failure is an orphan .
How much you wanna bet , now that Transformers has made $ 36 mil in 36 hours , all is forgiven ? :
LET ‚ÄôS GET SOME FACTS STRAIGHT
06/29/2007 11:20 PM
The movie is over .
Wow that was a hard one , but I must tell you it was so much fun .
The most difficult actors I ‚Äôve ever worked with , besides Bruce Willis , are Optimus Prime and Bumblebee .
They took every single one of my days for a year .
But they are well worth the work .
I ‚Äôve just traveled 36,000 miles around the world ( in two weeks ) and had the most amazing premiere at the Taormina film festival in an ancient , Greek - built theatre that existed well before the birth of Christ .
I loved seeing the reactions to the film from so many different cultures .
This movie really travels around the world .
I ‚Äôm so excited for everyone to see it .
Thanks to all you that supported me on this film .
Just so I set the story straight , my budget started at $ 145 Million , it crept to $ 150 and some change ‚Äì I ‚Äôm very proud of that ‚Äì the fact that we are half the cost of all these other summer blockbusters .
I see people doubt that out on the net , but anyone want to challenge me I ‚Äôll put a ten thousand dollar bet down on the table right now .
Even when the studio tried to ship me out to Canada or shoot down with Aussies ‚Äì I looked but I knew we were dead up there .
I needed my crew that I have been loyal to for years , they are the best in the world .
Besides I believe American movies that portray America , should be made in America .
I cut my fee 30 % so I could make this at home .
I knew this was right for the movie so I asked the other producers to join ‚Äì Ian and Lorenzo did , and the two others ( that came attached to the project ) Tom Desanto and Don Murphy did not .
That was my introduction to them ‚Äì they did not want any part of their fee going to make a better movie .
Things like that do n‚Äôt usually sit well with me .
Now that the movie is done I get strange questions from the press .
Like ‚Äò how did Tom control the set ‚Äô ?
What ?
‚Äò How did Tom and Don control you ? ‚Äô
What the fuck .
‚Äò How was it working with Tom and Don who knew Transformers so well ? ‚Äô
‚Äò We heard Tom wrote the story ‚Äì he had a 90 page treatment , right ? ‚Äô
Okay stop .
Let me take you back in time .
Tom and Don are very nice guys , but let ‚Äôs get some facts straight .
Tom had one creative meeting with me for one hour and ten minutes to be exact about a year ago .
He told he was the √ºber fan boy and was going to protect me from the minefields .
The type of minefields on the Net like ‚Äò Damn you Michael Bay ‚Äô
‚Äò You wrecked my childhood Michael Bay ‚Äô and other various web death threats I received .
Tom proceeded to tell me how much he had problems with the robot designs and script issues .
I realized he was worlds apart in my vision .
I said thank you very much , and then showed him my office door ‚Äì I never really spoke to him again other then to mutter hello .
He would occasionally come to the set with guests like it was some theme park .
I never spoke creatively with Don .
I read his notes kind of trashing the script and making me and the writers feel like a big shit pile .
But during production Don was nice to me , he knew I was not going to talk creative with him .
One day not too long ago , the writers of our movie Alex and Bob called me in a panic saying all of a sudden after the movie was almost finished in post that Tom was applying for writer ‚Äôs or story credit .
I was appalled because neither the writer ‚Äôs nor I ever saw any treatment .
Well , he applied for credit , but the Writer ‚Äôs Guild shot him down , denied him .
But what made my blood curl was something that was on the Net with Tom at the Saturn awards on IESB .
net where they interviewed him about the movie ‚Äì a movie I might add he had not seen yet .
He acted very much like he did .
Check it out as he vamps through the questions , and how Hugo put his ‚Äò thumb print on it ‚Äô .
Give me a break , the guy was lying through his teeth ‚Äì he had seen nada , nothing , until the press screening .
So that ‚Äôs the real truth , I had to say it , cause I ‚Äôm tired of answering these questions .
What these guys did do was stuck with a ‚Äò silly toy movie ‚Äô and pushed it around town and kept the faith after everyone turned them down , always with the hope that maybe someone somewhere would make it .
Now I commend them on that .
Hats off to them , but trying to taking creative credit in the press let me just say it ‚Äì irks me .
Too many credits are given to too many people who had nothing to do with the movie .
Hell , even investment bankers with not the slightest idea of how to make a movie all of a sudden are big producers in town .
I guess that ‚Äôs how it goes in Hollywood .

The Guardian
In areas of moral and political conflict people will always behave badly with evidence , so the war on drugs is a consistent source of entertainment .
We have already seen how cannabis being ‚Äú 25 times stronger ‚Äù was a fantasy , how drugs - related deaths were quietly dropped from the outcome measures for drugs policy , and how a trivial pile of poppies was presented by the government as a serious dent in the Taleban ‚Äôs heroin revenue
The Home Affairs Select Committee is now looking at the best way way to deal with cocaine .
You may wonder why they ‚Äôre bothering .
When the Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs Act looked at the evidence on the reclassification of cannabis , they were simply ignored .
When Professor David Nutt , the new head of the advisory council , wrote a scientific paper on the relatively modest risks of MDMA , he was personally attacked by the Home Secretary .
In the case of cocaine , there is an even more striking precedent for evidence being ignored : during the early 1990s the World Health Organisation conducted what is probably the largest ever study of global cocaine use .
In March 1995 they released a briefing kit which summarised their conclusions , with some tantalising bullet points .
‚Äú Health problems from the use of legal substances , particularly alcohol and tobacco , are greater than health problems from cocaine use , ‚Äù they said .
‚Äú Few experts describe cocaine as invariably harmful to health .
Cocaine - related problems are widely perceived to be more common and more severe for intensive , high - dosage users and very rare and much less severe for occasional , low - dosage users . ‚Äù
The full report ‚Äì which has never been published ‚Äì went on to challenge several of the key principles driving prohibition , and was extremely critical of most US policies .
It suggested that supply reduction and law enforcement strategies have failed , and that alternative strategies such as decriminalisation might be explored , flagging up such programmes in Australia , Bolivia , Canada and Colombia .
‚Äú Current national and local approaches which over - emphasize punitive drug control measures may actually contribute to the development of heath - related problems , ‚Äù it said , before committing heresy by recommending research into the unintended adverse consequences of prohibition , and discussing ‚Äú harm reduction ‚Äù strategies .
‚Äú An increase in the adoption of more humane , compassionate responses such as education , treatment and rehabilitation programmes , ‚Äù it said , ‚Äú is seen as a desirable counterbalance to the overreliance on law enforcement measures . ‚Äù
It specifically singled out anti-drug adverts which sought to modify behaviour through fear .
‚Äú Despite a broad range of educational and prevention approaches , most programmes do not prevent myths , but perpetuate stereotypes and misinform the general public .
Such programmes rely on sensationalized , exaggerated statements about cocaine which misinform about patterns of use , stigmatize users , and destroy the educator ‚Äôs credibility .
This has given most education campaigns a na√Øve image and has reduced confidence in the quality and accuracy of these campaigns . ‚Äù
It also dared to challenge the prevailing policy view ‚Äì still enduring ‚Äì that all drug use is harmful misuse .
‚Äú An enormous variety was found in the types of people who use cocaine , the amount of drug used , the frequency of use , the duration and intensity of use , the reasons for using and any associated problems they experience . ‚Äù
Experimental and occasional use are by far the most common types of use , it said , and compulsive or dysfunctional use , though clearly worthy of close attention , are much less common .
It then descended into outright heresy .
‚Äú Occasional cocaine use does not typically lead to severe or even minor physical or social problems ‚Ä¶ a minority of people start using cocaine or related products , use casually for a short or long period , and suffer little or no negative consequences , even after years of use . ‚Äù
And finally : ‚Äú use of coca leaves appears to have no negative health effects and has positive , therapeutic , sacred and social functions for indigenous Andean populations . ‚Äù
At the point where mild cocaine use was described in positive tones , the Americans presumably blew some kind of outrage fuse .
This report was never published , because just two months after the press briefing was released , at the 48th World Health Assembly , the US representative to WHO threatened to withdraw US funding for all their research projects and interventions unless the organisation ‚Äú dissociated itself from the conclusions of the study ‚Äù and cancelled the publication .
According to WHO , even today , this document does not exist , ( although you can read a leaked copy in full on the website of the drugs policy think tank Transform at www.tdpf.org.uk/WHOleaked.pdf ) .
Drugs instantiate the classic problem for evidence based social policy .
It may well be that prohibition , and the inevitable distribution of drugs by criminals , gives worse results for all the outcomes we think are important , like harm to the user , harm to our communities through crime , and so on .
But equally , it may well be that we will tolerate these worse outcomes , because we decide it is somehow more important that we publicly declare ourselves , as a culture , to be disapproving of drug use , and enshrine that principle in law .
It ‚Äôs okay to do that .
You can have policies that go against your stated outcomes , for moral or political reasons : but that does n‚Äôt mean you can hide the evidence , it simply means you must be clear that you do n‚Äôt care about it .
On July 2 , 2009 , hundreds of homeless Californians marched on the Sacramento Town Hall to demand " safe ground " .
It has been about three months since city officials shut down a large " tent city " occupied by Sacramento 's homeless people .
Now , some of the tent city 's residents say they feel like refugees , with no place to go .
They staged a loud demonstration Wednesday , in hopes of pressuring Sacramento officials to find them a new place to camp .
' Where Am I Supposed To Live ? '
Philip Grice , 45 , has been on the move ever since the tent city closed .
" When we moved out , we moved over to a private area two fields over .
They wanted us off of there too .
Just like shuttling cattle , that 's all it is , " said Grice , a carpenter by trade , who wears a T - shirt that reads , " Where am I supposed to live ? "
" We 're supposed to be the eyesore , but actually we 're citizens and we 're human beings .
We 're supposed to have rights like everybody else ; it do n't matter what we have in our pockets . "
Grice joined about 250 other homeless people and their supporters for a march through the northern end of Sacramento .
Their action coincided with the closure this week of a temporary shelter where many of the tent city residents had found a roof for the winter .
Now these individuals say they need a year - round legal camp on what they call " safe ground . "
No Legal Place To Sleep
The march ended up in a hot and dusty city - owned lot next to a police station , where organizers set up a symbolic occupation .
Val Jon Farris , founder of a group called iCare America , set up a tent on the lot .
" There is no legal place for people to live unless they own , rent or lease a home .
So if you 're homeless it 's illegal to exist .
You can't even lay your head anywhere without getting arrested , prosecuted or criminalized , " said Farris .
" So this is a demonstration in order to create a civil liberty that ought to already exist , which is [ that ] people have the right to be , to live without the threat of being incarcerated in their own country . "
The idea of a safe ground for homeless campers divides officials in city hall .
The mayor , Kevin Johnson , has been receptive , but others , including the city manager , Ray Kerridge , is not .
There is also a disagreement over how much it will cost at a time when the city and county are already slashing basic services .
What is not in dispute is that this week Sacramento has 200 more people with no place to sleep .
As I was walking home from work , I spotted an unusual sight ‚Äì a police van parked in a disabled bay near my local train station .
I snapped a picture of it .
As soon as I had taken a shot , PC Smith ( 40144 ) came out from the train station and asked to speak with me .
She asked why I ‚Äôd taken a photo of her van .
I told her that it was parked in a disabled bay .
She told me that she ‚Äôd been called because a woman was self - harming on the station and that was the only place she could park .
Fair enough , I said .
Then a funny thing happened .
She asked me to delete the photo .
To my mind there are only two logical reasons she could have for wanting me to delete the photo .
She genuinely thought that the photograph was likely to be useful in the preparation of a crime .
She had committed an offence and did n‚Äôt want there to be any evidence .
I asked her why she wanted the photo to be deleted , she told me that ‚Äú in the current climate ‚Äù the police had been asked to stop people from taking photos of sensitive buildings and of the police .
That is n‚Äôt true ‚Äì and I told her so .
She asked to take down my details .
I asked her why she wanted my details and whether I was obliged to give them .
At this point , I asked if I could record our conversation ‚Äì she agreed .
I wo n‚Äôt post the video because , frankly , it makes both of us look like arses .
I ‚Äôve got shakey hands and a wobbly voice , she rings her sergeant and gets told she is n‚Äôt allowed to demand my details .
Neither of us are left exactly covered in glory .
She was told by her superior that she could take down a description of me .
I told her that asking to delete photos was silly because they can be easily undeleted .
I also thanked her for not escalating the situation .
I left .
As I left , I allowed my phone to post the photo I ‚Äôd taken to twitpic .
There are several interesting points
Police still believe ‚Äì or are still being told ‚Äì that people are n‚Äôt allowed to photograph ‚Äú sensitive ‚Äù subjects .
Police are still asking for the destruction of private property ( photographs ) .
Know your photographic rights .
Many people still do n‚Äôt understand that digital images live forever ‚Äì whether on the Internet or as fragments on a memory card .
Police still use common sense and are willing to listen if you put your case politely and firmly .
That ‚Äôs very reassuring .
I want to make it quite clear that I have no reason to disbelieve PC Smith when she said that she was attending a genuine call .
I ‚Äôm not going to pursue the parking in a disabled bay matter any further .
I am going to pursue the matter of the advice my local police force are given regarding the photography of them and their vehicles .
Remember , if you are taking photos that you think are genuinely important ‚Äì upload them as soon as possible from your camera .
If you ‚Äôre asked to delete a photo ‚Äì it may be wise to do so ; photos can be easily recovered .
Many thanks for all the retweets ‚Äì it ‚Äôs good to know that I ‚Äôm not alone in thinking that this is a farcical situation .
Edit :
Thanks for all your kind words and also to Boing Boing for picking this up .

Swine flu forced the closure Friday of a Houston elementary school where 12 students have been confirmed to have the virus , the state ‚Äôs largest outbreak in a single location .
Houston Independent School District administrators early Friday afternoon made the decision to close Travis Elementary School until May 26 , hours after learning swine flu was one cause of the rampant illness that began spreading Wednesday .
Nearly 400 students stayed home Friday , many because they were ill and others because their parents did n‚Äôt want them exposed .
‚Äú The most prudent thing to do was just to close the school , ‚Äù said HISD spokesman Norm Uhl .
Kathy Barton , spokeswoman for the city ‚Äôs health department , said she expects more of the Travis students will test positive for the virus , whose outbreak in Mexico caused considerable U.S. concern a few weeks ago but more recently seemed to be on the wane in Houston .
Barton said health officials will never know exactly how many Travis students had swine flu ; many wo n‚Äôt see a doctor , and some doctors will treat cases based on symptoms without taking a specimen to send to the city ‚Äôs laboratory .
The Heights - area school has 712 students .
Friday ‚Äôs 12 positive tests came from the first 13 samples sent to the lab .
Barton said she expects other viruses were also a cause of some of the illnesses at Travis .
She said she would n‚Äôt characterize all the illnesses as being swine flu .
‚Äú It ‚Äôs too early to draw any conclusions about what might have occurred at Travis to cause this explosion of infection , ‚Äù Barton said .
‚Äú We will be looking for the answer to that . ‚Äù
Initially skeptical
Houston health officials first learned of the possible outbreak early Wednesday evening when Travis administrators told them 86 students , mostly third - graders , and some staff had stayed or been sent home with illnesses .
Symptoms included fever and stomachaches .
By Thursday , the number of absent students had grown to 242 , though a significant number were n‚Äôt sick , just worried about catching what was going around .
Because the symptoms were wide - ranging and spread so quickly without a clear originating case , school and health officials were initially skeptical it was swine flu .
At least one Travis parent was unhappy a decision came only after swine flu tests came back positive Friday .
Angela Casillas , whose daughter is sick , said she thinks officials waited too long to shut the school .
‚Äú I leave my daughter in their care , and I believed they provided the best possible care that a school can give , ‚Äù Casillas said .
‚Äú Now , this situation makes me question that . ‚Äù
Earlier in the outbreak , following U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations , schools were closing at the likelihood of a single swine flu case , a policy that left about half a million Texas schoolchildren at home early last week .
On May 5 , the CDC reversed course and said schools no longer needed to close because the illness caused by the virus was no more severe than seasonal flu .
The CDC said schools could close if an outbreak occurred , but for isolated cases the agency recommended students and staff with flu - like symptoms stay home for at least seven days .
3 days to finish testing
Barton said the health department has ruled out food poisoning as a cause of the illness , but she said seasonal flu and stomach bugs could be a factor .
She said the decision to close the school was HISD ‚Äôs , not the city‚Äôs .
Two staff members have called in sick , HISD officials said .
Two others missed work with sick children of their own .
The school year is slated to end May 28 , but Uhl said he does n‚Äôt expect those students to have to make up lost time .
Students will finish any remaining state tests in the final three days of the year , he said .
Friday afternoon , Travis students were taking the news in stride .
‚Äú I ‚Äôm still being cautious , ‚Äù said Zoe Vastakis , a fourth - grade student who was taken home by her mother on Friday before HISD decided to close the school .
‚Äú I ‚Äôm eating the right foods , trying to wash my hands a lot . ‚Äù
The 12 swine flu cases brought the city of Houston ‚Äôs total to 35 .
The state has had 568 cases , including three deaths , the latest a 33 - year - old Corpus Christi man who died May 6 .

Some 2 percent of infections , Dr. Chan said , have resulted in severe illness , with rapid progression to pneumonia .
Based on preliminary data , asthma , cardiovascular disease , autoimmune disorders and obesity are the underlying conditions that most put people at greater risk .
Around a third to a half of the severe cases occurred in previously healthy young people , she said .
Pregnant woman are also at heightened risk , a particular concern for the developing world , Dr. Chan said , which already reports 99 percent of maternal childbirth deaths worldwide .
Typically , pandemics take six to nine months to move throughout the world .
This one has been detected early , giving health officials what Dr. Chan called a ‚Äú head start . ‚Äù
And as the disease continues , it will be important to add to the health resources of poorer countries , Dr. Chan said .
Vigilance must be maintained , she said , ‚Äú for the next year or two ¬ó and beyond . ‚Äù
‚Äú Influenza pandemics , whether moderate or severe , are remarkable events because of the almost universal susceptibility of the world ‚Äôs population to infection , ‚Äù Dr. Chan said .
‚Äú We are all in this together and we will all get through this together . ‚Äù
The W.H.O. released a report on Wednesday saying that 74 countries had reported 27,737 cases of the disease and 141 deaths since April .
Those cases had been heavily concentrated in the Americas , but the rise in cases in Australia and elsewhere indicate communitywide spread in other world regions .
According to W.H.O. rules , the organization should declare a pandemic once it finds evidence of widespread ‚Äú community transmission ‚Äù ¬ó meaning beyond travelers , schools and immediate contacts ¬ó on two continents .
The last pandemic , the Hong Kong flu of 1968 , killed about 700,000 people worldwide .
Ordinary flu kills 250,000 to 500,000 people each year , international health officials have said .
Meanwhile , around the world , efforts to limit the spread of the flu continue .
In Hong Kong , which is especially skittish about the flu after its experience with a lethal SARS outbreak in 2003 , authorities ordered all kindergartens , primary schools and day care centers to close after an outbreak of swine flu was reported at a local secondary school .
The order , effective Friday , will last at least two weeks and affect about a half million students .
Declarations filed in former AL Governor 's request for new trial , describe government prosecutors manipulating key testimony , pressuring former aide in exchange for lighter sentence
Notes , communications and required FBI disclosures said illegally withheld from defense team ...
Brad Friedman Byon 7/21/2009 , 1:46 pm PT
[ Update 7/24/09 : I interviewed Seigelman on Thursday about these matters and the latest status of his case , while Guest Hosting The Mike Malloy Show .
Listen to the interview right here .
Select Hour 2 audio archive . ]
How it 's even possible that former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman 's bribery case and conviction has not long ago been dropped by the Dept. of Justice is beyond us .
There is now so much evidence of clear conflicts of interest , overt partisan political prosecutorial targeting , failures to recuse by at least one conflicted prosecutor as well as the judge in the case , evidence withheld from the defense team , and now evidence of the coaching and strong - arming of witnesses in exchange for a lighter prison sentence and a promise to conceal embarrassing personal information , it all makes the prosecutorial misconduct in the case of former Alaska Senator Ted Stevens --- a Republican whose case was dropped by Obama 's Justice Dept. shortly after they came to power --- look like jaywalking .
Official declarations filed along with a recent motion by Siegelman , requesting a new trial in light of the new evidence , reveal what seems just the tip of the iceberg of a flagrant and wholly inappropriate case of wide - spread prosecutorial misconduct .
The allegations ( with much evidence to back them up ) paint a compelling picture of an illegally targeted political prosecution / witch - hunt carried out by Karl Rove and his Alabama - based Dept. of Justice cronies in an attempt to remove Alabama 's most popular Democrat from the political grid all together .
The scheme worked , as Siegelman is currently fighting his conviction on appeal and --- now armed with new evidence gathered by the defense team of fellow defendant Richard Scrushy , the man alleged to have " bribed " Siegelman --- is calling for a completely new trial .
The government is to answer Siegelman 's motion next week , and the decision will be made by the same federal U.S. District Court judge , Mark E. Fuller , reported to have severe conflicts of interest in the entire case , including a specific " grudge " against Siegelman .
The new declarations , believed to be posted here publicly in full for the very first time ( PDF links follow below ) , reveal a startling case of inappropriate misconduct by federal investigators , as Siegelman 's former aide Nick Bailey , the government 's star witness against him , is revealed to have been " coached and cajoled and threatened , " as Siegelman 's late June motion for a new trial describes it , throughout some 70 interviews and phone calls .
Bailey , the documents describe , was said to have been frightened for his life and facing a possible years - long sentence in federal prison , if he failed to testify precisely as investigators had required him to .
The investigators went so far as to require Bailey to write down his testimony after he had failed , time and again , to offer the same answers to prosecutors ' questions during undisclosed interviews .
Yet , evidence of that coaching was allegedly concealed from the defense , according to the new documents and testimony , in violation of federal law , and in what appears to directly parallel the precise reasons for the dismissal of the Stevens case in Alaska .
Siegelman tells
The BRAD BLOG that after the years - long prosecution , this is the first time the information has come to light about coached witnesses , and undisclosed documentation of government interviews .
Star witness Bailey , who testified that he saw Siegelman in receipt of a $ 250,000 check alleged to have been a " bribe " from Scrushy --- a check that was actually dated several days later than the day Bailey testified he saw it in the hands of the Governor --- is said to have been so unable to remember the specific details prosecutors wanted him to testify to , that he was given written questions and instructions to write down his answers to practice for the actual trial .
He was , according to the new documents , told quite specifically how to answer questions .
The hand - written notes from Bailey 's attempts to memorize his testimony to the satisfaction of prosecutors is said , in the new affidavits , one from Baily himself , to have included a page in which he responded to the government 's specific instructions by hand - writing " bullshit , " in response , on one of the undisclosed pages .
A complete notebook of those hand - written documents and other records of interviews with Bailey was apparently never given to the defense teams in either the Siegelman case or in Scrushy 's , who also filed a motion for a new trail in late June ...
Siegelman 's 74 - page brief [ PDF ] , requesting the new trial , alleges a case of " selective prosecution " in violation of his Constitutional 5th Amendment right to " equal protection " under the law .
Glynn Wilson , a former New York Times reporter smartly analyzed the brief in summary here in late June .
In short , Siegelman is alleging improper conduct by federal investigators and prosecutors in coaching the testimony of key witness Nick Bailey ; undisclosed communications between prosecutors and Siegelman 's trial jury ; notes by Bailey and federal prosecutors that were not disclosed to the defense team ; admissions by the prosecution 's other star witness , Lanny Young , that bribes were given to Republicans ( such as U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions ) though Bush / Rove 's investigators failed to prosecute their Republican allies , and that Alabama 's U.S. Attorney Leura Canary , whose husband was the campaign manager for Siegelman 's Republican opponent Gov. Bob Riley and a long - time associate of Rove 's , never actually recused herself from the case as she had previously claimed .
It 's a sweeping and broad set of allegations , but we 'll focus , for the moment , on the specifics of the allegations revealed in the new affidavits filed by Bailey , the employer who later hired him while he was facing threats and the possibility of a long federal sentence , a CBS News consultant who became a friend of Bailey's , and one of the private investigators hired by the Scrushy team to look into all of this .
Non-Disclosure
In his June 26 , 2009 " Motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence " , Siegelman 's attorneys discuss a 3 - ring notebook said to contain prosecutors questions , Bailey 's hand - written attempts to answer them , and his marginalia notes in response :
The simple fact that Bailey was writing down answers given to him by the Government and then memorizing those answers , which Bailey states the Government was aware of , would be powerful impeachment material , and a fact that the Government was constitutionally required to provide to the defense .
Finally , it appears based on Scrushy 's argument that the Bailey notebook would provide extensive evidence of the alleged improper activities that occurred here as the Government coached and cajoled and threatened Bailey to provide a version of the facts which powerfully supported their theory of the case , even when that version was different from the version originally provided by Bailey .
Siegelman is consequently asking the court to order subpoenas permitting access to the notebook said , in the new declarations , to now be in the possession of Bailey 's attorney .
The private investigators were only partially able to review some of the material from that notebook .
The existence of that notebook , and records of upwards of 70 calls and meetings between Bailey and federal prosecutors has not previously been disclosed , Siegelman argues , despite the court testimony of Acting U.S. Attorney Louis Franklin who specifically told Judge Fuller , during the trial , that all relevant materials had been properly turned over to the defense .
From the trial transcript ( as quoted in Siegelman 's motion ) :
THE COURT : First of all , I need to confirm whether the government has had the opportunity to confer with all of the investigative agencies , law enforcement officials who were involved in the investigation of each of the defendants in this case , and has discovered that there has not been exculpatory material that would be available to the defendants pursuant to the Brady opinion .
[ Acting U.S. Attorney ] MR. FRANKLIN : Your Honor , we did .
We checked with all the agents .
They have no other reports that have not been turned over in this matter .
The agents even contacted the IRS agents who participated early on in this investigation and who were not participating at some of the instances where Mr. Bailey was being interviewed .
They have no additional reports .
The AG 's office has also confirmed by going through its file that there are no additional reports regarding Mr. Bailey .
And yet , despite the fact that there should be an FBI FD - 302 disclosure report from federal investigators for each instance in which the case was said to have been discussed --- from among the approximately " 60 or 70 " meetings and phone calls Bailey now recounts --- only " five FBI 302 Reports , four Attorney General Reports , and three grand jury transcripts " were turned over by prosecutors to the defense via discovery in relation to Bailey 's testimony .
Bailey 's declaration lists 24 specific meetings ( he notes " there may be more " ) , their dates , those present , and the subjects discussed from July 17 , 2002 through April 13 , 2006 which , he says , were " not included in the material furnished to me by the government as being my 302 statements and Grand Jury testimony . "
From Bailey 's declaration [ PDF ] :
[ T ] here were many , many occasions on which I met with or was contacted on the telephone by FBI or other government agents working on the case .
At least one representative of the federal government was present at all of the interviews I attended .
These meetings typically lasted 2 to 3 hours , and some of them extended from one day to the next .
Altogether , I would estimate that I spoke with government prosecutors or agents approximately 60 to 70 times although a number of those meetings and conversations did not involve Governor Siegelman or Mr. Scrushy .
5 . Based on my recollection and review of documents , including the FBI " 302s " that were provided to me and my attorney and represented to be a copy of the materials provided to the defense team , I believe that there were at least 24 occasions when I met with government representatives Assistant U.S. Attorneys , employees of the Alabama Attorney General 's Office , and / or federal law enforcement officials to discuss issues related to Governor Siegelman and / or Mr. Scrushy ( excluding meetings that primarily concerned other targets or potential targets of the government 's investigation ) that are not included in the material furnished to me by the government as being my 302 statements and Grand Jury testimony .
Bailey goes on to detail that " one or more of the government representatives took notes at each and every one of these meetings " and that Asst.
U.S. Attorney Julia Weller , whenever present , " typed constantly on her laptop " and , he believes , " took verbatim notes . "
Later , AUSA J.B. Perrine " took notes " and " Other government representatives generally took notes , on laptops or written by hand , at all of these meetings . "
With all of those meeting notes , why was there such paltry documentation of them turned over to Siegelman and Scrushy before their trials ?
The disturbing information prosecutors may have been hoping to conceal may offer an answer ...
' Would n't it be all the same if you just said it this way ' ...
" The Government did not provide any notice of any promises or threats made to Bailey , " according to Siegelman 's recent motion .
Yet , the new declarations reveal a great deal of information along those lines .
Luther Stancel Pate , IV ( aka " Stan Pate " ) , a Tuscaloosa businessman and land developer says he 's known Bailey since 1994 and took him under his wing after he'd left his employment with Siegelman in 2002 and as federal prosecutors were , unbeknownst to the Governor , working through a guilty plea on bribery charges with him .
" It was obvious to me that he was a man in trouble with heavy burdens , " says Pate , who " believe[s ] in giving people second chances " and so he gave Bailey a job even as Bailey confided " he was in trouble with the law " .
According to Pate 's declaration [ PDF ] , he has " had many conversations with Nick about the circumstances of his cooperation with the prosecutors and the agents . "
" These conversations took place both during the time of this cooperation and afterwards up through the present day , " says Pate .
" Some of the conversations took place with Nick at the federal prison in Atlanta ; I visited with Nick in prison almost every two weeks . "
He believes he " was aware of each and every time Nick was cooperating with the government during business hours . "
Pate observes that throughout the ongoing meetings and calls with the feds , Bailey " had trouble sleeping ( and needed to take prescription medicine to sleep ) , and was often distracted , anxiety - ridden " and kept " on an emotional roller coaster . "
It was during this period in which Bailey was pressed " to give them ' what they want ' " in exchange for a lighter sentence ... even if it meant " trying to think of things or people that might interest the government in hopes that doing so would help him avoid a prison sentence . "
Says Pate in his declaration :
According to my personal observations and to Nick , the government used both " carrot - and - stick " techniques to convince him to provide more and more cooperation in the various prosecutions in which he was required to participate .
The " carrot " was performance - based : the better Nick 's performance , the less time in his sentence .
Nick expressed to me many times I have to give them " what they want " .
Nick said they continuously encouraged him to cooperate with the promised [ sic ] of a lighter sentence ...
They used the scheduling and the postponement of his sentencing to keep him in line which only added to his psychological burden .
Time after time , Nick 's sentencing would be scheduled and suddenly postponed just a day or two beforehand .
After they " walked him to the gallows , " the government would again offer again the carrot of a light sentence to encourage more and more cooperation .
12 . The " stick " that the government used with Nick was to threaten , expressly or implicitly , action that would profoundly affect his personal life .
...
These comments had a dramatic effect on Nick and , in my observation , added significantly to the pressure he felt to go along with whatever the prosecutors wanted him to say .
At some point , the order came from Washington to begin the Siegelman investigation again from the top , and Asst. U.S. Attorney Stephen Feaga began to take the lead on the case .
At that point , says Pate , there was no criminal activity yet defined against Bailey 's former boss or Scrushy , but that it appeared the feds were on a fishing expedition to find something , anything they could use against Siegelman :
According to Nick , he was called to a meeting with agents and / or prosecutors who wanted him to " tell us all you know about any matters involving Richard Scrushy and / or Don Siegelman . "
He told him this was the first time the government had shown him a significant interest in Scrushy .
According to Nick , the government told him of not potentially criminal activity ; rather , he told me the government appears to be looking for a crime rather than investigating an alleged crime .
As Nick was " trying to think of things or people that might interest the government in hopes that doing so would help him avoid a prison sentence , " he made it clear to Pate " that he was trying to give the government what he thought would ... protect his friends and family as well as reduce his own punishment . "
It was under those circumstances , that the federal agents then began " gradually " suggesting very specific testimony to Bailey , says both Pate and David Richardson , an investigator hired by Scrushy 's team to look into the allegations of prosecutorial misconduct .
The circumstances surrounding the check which Scrushy was said to have given Siegelman as a contribution to a campaign for an Educational Lottery Fund in the state --- supposedly in exchange for Scrushy 's appointment to a state hospital oversight board , a board on which Scrushy had already served under three prior Governors ( this is the supposed " bribe " for which Siegelman was convicted ) --- seem to have been fed very specifically to Bailey by federal investigators .
Pate describes the way in which Bailey was manipulated this way :
Nick has also spoken to me from time to time about how the agents and prosecutors would convince him gradually to modify his testimony .
For instance , when Nick would tell them what he knew in his own words , they would ask " would n't it be all the same if you just said it this way way . "
Nick remembers one example of this particularly well , and that involves the term " absolute agreement . "
Nick said to me , " I do n't use that word that way or they convinced him to say it was an absolute agreement . "
Nick told me that he does n't use that phrase in his everyday speech , but he learned to use it after practicing his testimony over and over in the way the prosecutors wanted him to say it .
His original characterization was that " I thought there was an understanding . "
Nick told me that Louis Franklin [ed note : the one who seems to have lied to the trial judge about documents ] was particularly relentless in trying to get him to answer questions the way he wanted him to , to the point that Nick eventually refused to deal with Franklin any more ...
The key questions about the Siegelman / Scrushy convictions hinge on whether there was actually a quid pro quo agreement to seat Scrushy on the hospital board in exchange for support of Siegelman 's Educational Lottery campaign .
The government presented no evidence of such an explicit quid pro quo , which has always ( at least previously ) been required for a finding that an official was guilty of being bribed .
Richardson 's declaration [ PDF ] also speaks to Bailey 's allegation that his testimony was crafted by government officials , including the " absolute agreement " language :
Mr. Bailey further informed us that it was common , in the course of discussing the language he would finally adopt , for the government representatives to make arguments that , instead of using a word he would normally use , they would tell him , " would n't it be just the same " if he used the words that the government wanted him to use .
One example he clearly recalled was the term " absolute agreement . "
Bailey said that was not a term he would normally use --- that he might have said " understanding , " instead --- and that he did n't understand at the time why they were so determined to get him to use those words .
Nonetheless , Bailey recalled that he was schooled repeatedly on the use of that term , and anytime he talked about an arrangement or understanding with , for example , Lanny Young [ the government 's other key witness , who was also facing his own federal charges at the time ] , the government representatives would say , " Was there an agreement , " and he would say , " yes . "
Then they would ask him , " Would n't it be the same if you said ' absolute agreement ' ? " , and he eventually learned to use the words they wanted him to use .
Similarly , Bailey said that the prosecutors also told him sometimes that his testimony was in conflict with what other witnesses had said or the words they had used to say it --- without telling him who these other witnesses were --- to persuade him to adopt another witness 's view . "
Now we do n't pretend to be attorneys around here , but this testimony strikes us as absolutely extraordinary , and the sort of thing --- from the government 's absolute key witness in this case --- which would seem to be grounds for not only dismissing the entire matter , but also for bringing federal charges against the very investigators and prosecutors who were involved in this kind of manipulation of their supposedly key witness .
If this is the normal , appropriate state of affairs for such investigations , of course , we'd be happy to hear from prosecutors or other attorneys or judges to that end .
We can't imagine that 's the case , however .
And remember , there are said to have been no indications of this kind of manipulation of Bailey 's testimony offered in the discovery documents --- supposedly documenting all the pertinent interviews with Bailey --- as turned over to the defense team before trial .
' Bullshit '
Richardson goes on to detail more of the strong - arming of their star witness by federal prosecutors .
Bailey seems , according to one document mentioned by Richardson , to have believed at least one element of the case he was asked to make against Siegelman was " bullshit " , according to an undisclosed hand - written note by Bailey :
...
He told us that the prosecutors would express their frustration if he forgot from time to time exactly how he was supposed to answer their questions .
He remembers clearly that Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Feaga told him , " We 've got to get some consistency .
When we ask you a question , you 've got to answer the same way every time . "
Mr. Feaga also told him , " You know what the questions are .
Write down the answers and stick with the answers . "
The government 's frustration with Mr. Bailey 's forgetfulness is not mentioned in any 302 that I have seen , nor is Mr. Feaga 's instruction to him to write down his answers so as to answer the same way every time .
10 .
[ After one meeting with federal investigators , Bailey had developed an uncertainty about ] when he had first seen a check for $ 250,000 and he told us that there was been so much discussion about that meeting during his government interviews that it challenged his memory , so that , for example , he could n't even be sure that the people whom he had previously said were there were , actually , there that day .
Baily told us that , in follow - up meetings , the prosecutors began to tell him that the check he saw may not have been cut until after the meeting between Governor Siegelman and Scrushy at the Governor 's office .
He also recalled various explanations that the prosecutors suggested to him , including a theory that Scrushy had driven down from Birmingham " secretly " before the meeting and gave Siegelman a check that was post - dated .
Bailey told us that he through that theory was far - fetched .
I have never seen any reference to this exchange in any 302 .... He told us that the prosecutors would express their frustration if he forgot from time to time exactly how he was supposed to answer their questions .
He remembers clearly that Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Feaga told him , " We 've got to get some consistency .
When we ask you a question , you 've got to answer the same way every time . "
Mr. Feaga also told him , " You know what the questions are .
Write down the answers and stick with the answers . "
The government 's frustration with Mr. Bailey 's forgetfulness is not mentioned in any 302 that I have seen , nor is Mr. Feaga 's instruction to him to write down his answers so as to answer the same way every time .
12 . Mr. Bailey said that , following Mr. Feaga 's direction and to prevent the prosecutors from becoming irritated , he began to make notes so as to remember the key words they wanted him to use , and to study and memorize the right answers and words before his next meeting with the government .
Bailey is confident that the government was aware of this practice .
When Richardson met with Bailey and his attorney , the 3 - ring binder filled with pages of handwritten notes was there , though they were not allowed to review it .
Later , information about additional documents was shared by Bailey 's attorney .
On one page , Richardson says he was told , " there were handwritten answers to some of the questions " , but Bailey and his attorney George Beck " both said that the handwriting was not theirs " .
Whose was it ?
Pate 's declaration also asserts similar allegations of prosecutors becoming " frustrated " that Bailey 's answers to their questions " were inconsistent with previous ones . "
He said that " Written versions of the answers were produced ; Nick would be asked the same questions again and his answers would be compared to the written ones .
This also did not work because Nick still was unable to give consistent answers that satisfied prosecutors . "
Many of Pate 's observations were made , and noted , contemporaneously over the years , as Pate frequently wrote important notes of the day on index cards .
The hand - written , contemporaneous notes from several of those index cards are included with his declaration .
Richardson also describes , in his declaration , " a page from a 302 , which [ Bailey ] recalled as being the 302 dated June 30 , 2003 on which he had handwritten the word ' bullshit' " .
A ' Seal Order ' and ' Embarrassing Details '
Bailey had " also withheld 23 additional documents , " from his meeting with Richardson , " evidently on the theory that handwritten notes made by Mr. Bailey at some point prior to July 2006 are somehow subject to a ' seal ' order covering a document Mr. Beck filed at the time of Bailey 's sentencing . "
That , small point , of course , begs the question as to what " ' seal ' order " could be in effect here , keeping legitimate discovery documents concerning a witness and his cooperation with prosecutors from being shared with defense attorneys ?
" Mr. Bailey recalls that , on a number of occasions , prosecutors and agents asked him questions or made statements that he came to realize were implied threats to disclose potentially embarrassing details about his personal life or to intensify investigations of his friends and relations , " says Richardson .
It 's unclear how any of those " potentially embarrassing details about his personal life " were directly germane to either Bailey 's own case , or that of the Siegelman / Scrushy prosecution .
The suggestion here is that it seems to have been little more than out and out strong - arming by federal prosecutors in hopes of getting still more cooperation from Bailey , as Richardson characterizes threats to Bailey which , he was told , " could come out during the trial " .
Other officials also peppered Bailey with questions about sexual relationships he may have had with " other people who were also under investigation by the government " .
DC Attorney / Reporter Andrew Kreig has more on the sexual aspects of the case , asking whether prosecutors may have been blackmailing Bailey , today at Huffington Post .
The potential prosecution of Bailey 's brother was similarly used to further pressure Bailey , according to Richardson 's declaration .
In another declaration filed by Harrison Hickman [ PDF ] , included with Siegelman 's motion , the friend of Bailey 's and 20 year CBS News consultant corroborates much of the same information from both Pate and Richardson , including Bailey 's modification of testimony over time to fit the expectations of the investigators , and the prosecutors ' use of threats that " frightened " Bailey .
" For example , Nick said the prosecutors told him that his brother , Shane Bailey was in a ' situation ' " , recalls Hickman .
" In my view , this ' tell us all you know about a particular individual ' is part of the government 's ' fishing expedition ' approach to this investigation , " Richardson concludes , " in which they were determined to find some kind of wrongdoing by Governor Siegelman and Richard Scrushy . "
What Next ?
Though he quickly vacated the case against Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens , and other Republican officials from Alaska , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has made no official statements on the disposition of the Siegelman case , though in May , prosecutors in the case --- the same ones appointed by George W. Bush , who remained in their position even then --- argued in reply to Siegelman 's appeal that his original sentencing of more than seven years , should now be extended to 20 years .
As of June 9th , 2009 , according to a press release [ PDF ] , " Justice Department whistleblower , Tamarah Grimes , formerly a member of the prosecution team in the case against former Governor of Alabama , Don Siegelman and former HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy has been terminated by the U.S. Department of Justice . "
Grimes ' dismissal follows on the heels of a June 1 letter she sent to Holder " providing details of the misconduct on the part of the prosecutors in the Siegelman / Scrushy trial " and following a request by Scrushy attorneys to interview her about those allegations .
Grimes is also said to have " provided internal documentation to the Senate Judiciary Committee which contradicted the claims of U.S. Attorney Leura Canary and Acting U.S. Attorney Louis Franklin regarding the recusal of Leura Canary , " who , apparently , never actually recused herself from the case against Siegelman , despite the conflict of interest in her husband 's role as campaign chair to Siegelman 's opponent , and his close ties to Karl Rove .
The agency claims Grimes ' termination was unrelated to her whistleblower disclosures .
Grimes , however , says the dismissal was a case of " whistleblower retaliation " .
In 2008 , 52 former state attorneys - general , both Republican and Democratic , asked Congress to investigate the dubious prosecution of Siegelman .
Last month , Karl Rove testified to the U.S. House Judiciary Committee behind closed doors , about this case , and others related to the U.S. Attorney Purge scandal .
The information from that lengthy interview has not yet been released .
The government is required to file their brief in reply to Siegelman 's new motion next week .
He is currently free on probation , pending his ongoing appeal and now , potentially , new trial .

Burger King to Harness Kinetic Energy from Speed Bumps
July 7th , 2009 by Timothy B. Hurst
Stopping for cheeseburgers to bring new energy to New Jersey drive - thru
On the same day that Coulomb Technologies announced it would be rolling out an electric vehicle charging station at a McDonald ‚Äôs in Cary , N.C. , a Burger King franchise in New Jersey said it would be testing speed bumps that harness kinetic energy in the location ‚Äôs busy drive - thru lane .
[ social_buttons ]
If the kinetic energy generated by moving vehicles was captured by New Energy Technology ‚Äôs MotionPower speed bumps twice per day , then it could produce enough electricity to power over half a million homes each day , according to company officials .
The technology is similar to the regenerative technology used to power hybrid cars , but instead of being installed in each vehicle , it is installed in the roadways , capturing the friction energy that is otherwise dissipated as heat .
‚Äú More than 150,000 cars drive through our Hillside store alone each year , and I think it would be great to capture the wasted kinetic energy of these hundreds of thousands of cars to generate clean electricity , ‚Äù said Andrew Paterno .
Paterno and his business partner , Michael Wallstein own and operate twelve Burger Kings in the New York Metro area .
New Energy ‚Äôs latest MotionPower prototype is a modular device which can be customized to varying lengths based on site requirements .
Engineers envision the device could being installed at high traffic locations such as toll booths , traffic intersections , rest areas , travel plazas , border crossings , neighborhoods with traffic calming zones , and drive - thrus similar to the New Jersey Burger King test site .
‚Äú We ‚Äôre eager to field test the device in a real world setting as part of our ongoing efforts to aggressively engineer , test , refine , and ultimately , commercially launch America ‚Äôs first active roadway energy capture system of its kind , ‚Äù explained Mr. Meetesh V. Patel , Esq. , President and CEO of New Energy Technologies , Inc .
New Energy
Technologies is not the first to field - test the energy - harnessing capacity of speed bumps .
Similar pilot projects are already being tested on roads and in supermarket parking lots in the U.K .
Twenty percent of methane emissions in the United States comes from bovine husbandry .
And while burger giants McDonald ‚Äôs and Burger King are not falling over themselves to slash beef production , some franchise owners are taking matters into their own hands to cut greenhouse gas emissions in other innovative ways .
Investors welcomed the Monday announcement .
Shares of New Energy Technologies , Inc. ( NENE.OB ) rose more than 27 % on Monday after news of the new prototype testing project in New Jersey .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
A California woman sued Pepsi after finding out that Crunchberries contained no real fruit , but a judge ruled any reasonable person could have figured that out .
The case of Janine Sugawawa does provide a modicum of hope that the justice system is n't running on four flats -- this one was nipped in the bud quickly .
Judge Morrison England Jr. of the U.S. District Court of Eastern California approved Pepsi's motion to dismiss on May 21 , noting that the Sugawawa 's attorneys were the same hillbillies who tried to sue because Froot Loops had no real fruit .
Nobody 's really this stupid , we 're sure -- this is just attempted litigation for fun and profit .
Qigong ( pronounced chee - gong ) is an ancient Chinese mind - body discipline , practiced by millions of people of all ages and physical conditions to promote health , happiness , and long - life .
Like Yoga , qigong is a very broad umbrella , including many different traditions and types of exercises .
It can be done for at least five purposes - - ( 1 ) exercise , ( 2 ) relaxation , ( 3 ) healing , ( 4 ) martial arts conditioning , and ( 5 ) spiritual development .
Some readers may have heard that qigong is associated with some religious groups , such as the well known , Falun Gong cult .
This is a misunderstanding ; Falun Gong is a religious cult that uses qigong , but qigong itself is not religious , and can be practiced by anyone , regardless of their spiritual beliefs .
There are many well - documented medical benefits from practicing qi gong , including improvements in circulation , the immune - system , digestion , arthritis , asthma , and emotional well - being .
Anecdotally , after I started practicing qigong I lost my seasonal allergies , and have never had a headache since that time .
Chinese people believe that qi gong may be as much as 5,000 years old , dating its invention to the legendary emperor Huang - Di who laid the foundations of Traditional Chinese Medicine .
Both Qi Gong and Traditional Chinese Medicine are founded on the philosophical principles represented in the I Ching , " The Book of Changes , " and best known to Americans through the yin -yang symbol .
Contrary to some popular misconpetions , yin and yang are not supposed to be supernatural forces ; the yin -yang symbol simply represents the profound observation that there are two complementary sides to everything , that everything is always changing , and that harmony arises through a dynamic balance of opposing forces -- just like in High School physics !
Qi Gong is not about beliefs and concepts .
It is about learning how to feel and work with energy -- the natural mechanical , electomagnetic , and chemical energies that move through our bodies and the world around us .
The word " qigong " means " energy work " and qi ( " chee " ) is not , as some people may have heard , a mystical or supernatural energy unrecognized by science .
Qi really just means " energy " ; the Chinese character for qi is comprised of a picture of a bundle of rice , which stands for " food " in general , under a symbol , meaning " air " or " breath " -- in other words , the ultimate sources of all the energy in the human body -- nothing more mysterious than that .
It is true that in traditional Chinese culture , qi is thought of as the source and substance of all things , the force which animates life , and something which can be harnessed to generate great power .
But any modern scientist would say precisely the same thing about " energy . "
At the same time , breath is a metaphor for spirit in Chinese , as in many ancient cultures ( e.g. prana in Sanskrit and ruach in Hebrew ) , and this implies that one 's breath and energy can be vehicles for spiritual experience , if you wish to practice in that way .
The word gong , means " work , " not in the sense of " a job , " but rather in the sense , of labor and discipline ; it implies diligence and perseverance ( it is the same word as the kung in kung - fu ) .
As a practice , every qigong exercise has at least three ingredients - - ( 1 ) something to do with your body , ( 2 ) something to do with your breath , and ( 3 ) something to do with your mind .
My teacher always said you have to be using at least two of these three to be doing qigong , but using all three brings the most powerful benefits .
There is both moving qi gong and still qi gong , and both internal qi gong ( nei gong ) , which benefits your internal organs , glands , and nervous system , and external qi gong ( wai gong ) , which benefits your muscles , tendons , and joints .
Both kinds of qi gong activate the " energy meridians " used in accupuncture , and most qi gong exercises combine internal and external benefits to varying degrees .
The movements are generally circular and remind people of wind and water .
The mind is usually counting and paying attention to the feelings of the energies in one 's body .
The exercises can range from the most general to the most strenuous , and a good teacher will help you learn how to do them in the right way for your curent physical condition and goals .
Often in qi gong , the same exercise can be used for relaxation or to develop great strength for the martial arts , depending on how you do it !
It is fun to be doing qi gong and realize that you could be on the road to developing all those supernatural fighting abilities seen in the classic kung - fu movies , like flying and shooting lightning bolts out your fingertips !
And although these are just entertaining stories , I have seen with my own eyes that qi gong can enable people to retain great strength and agility into their nineties , which should be enough of a miracle for any of us !
What is the difference between qi gong and yoga ?
One qi gong master once joked , " the difference is in qi gong , when someone tries to knock you off your mat , you do n't have to move . "
And this joke contains a lot of truth .
Qi Gong , like Tai Chi , emphasizes " rooting " even more than Yoga does .
In fact , nearly all qi gong exercises are done on your feet , with relatively few sitting or lying positions , and the ability to " root " so well that no push can move you is one of the first you will develop if you practice qi gong for strength .
Yoga emphasizes flexibility a little more than qi gong ; there are few qi gong positions that anyone will have any trouble getting into , approximately anyway .
But the biggest difference to me has to do with the fact that qi gong has healing and fighting applications .
Classes can be more interactive than yoga classes , often including a wide range of activities , and this tends to foster a playful light - hearted atmosphere .
This brings us to the last points to know about qi gong ; it will make you calmer , happier , and more confident .
It will teach you a lot about yourself and how to deal with other people , and other external forces in your life .
It will prevent or alleviate many physical disorders and generally anable you to make yourself feel better on your own terms .
It is something you can do every day with ease , without equipment , and which you can continue to do up to any age .
Personally , I feel it is the best thing I have ever learned ( and I have a Ph.d. ! ) and I am happy that I can share this knowledge with you .
Here is the full email :
Dear Fellow American ,
Democrats did n't like their plans being exposed like that and tried to shut me down .
Now I need your help to shut them down .
The national energy tax Speaker Pelosi forced her party to support is " likely to be the biggest tax in American history , " according to The Wall Street Journal .
President Obama himself said energy costs will " skyrocket " for families and small businesses under a " cap and trade " plan .
We have to stop it .
Please make an immediate contribution of $ 10 , $ 25 , or $ 50 to help me fight the national energy tax and deliver a common sense " all of the above " energy plan that lowers gas prices and creates new jobs .
Every dollar you can spare will help me wage a sustained , public campaign against the national energy tax and in support of my " all of the above " energy plan .
Remember , this is n't just about energy - it 's about American jobs .
Speaker Pelosi 's national energy tax will ship millions of jobs overseas to countries like China and India .
It will devastate American manufacturing and raise prices for anyone who drives to work or dares to flip on a light switch .
And make no mistake : Democrats will use this massive tax hike for more of the same wasteful Washington spending that 's burying our children and grandchildren in debt .
American families can't afford a new jobs - killing tax .
So please make a generous contribution of $ 10 , $ 25 , or $ 50 today and help me make sure Democrats come to regret this vote .
We can create new jobs , keep energy costs low , and promote a healthy environment without raising taxes .
I hope I can count on your help today !
Sincerely ,
John Boehner ( R - OH )
P.S. A national energy tax is a big part of President Obama and Speaker Pelosi 's jobs - killing agenda and it needs to be stopped .
So please make an immediate contribution to help me alert Americans to the dangers of " cap and trade " and promote our better " all of the above " solution .
Thank you in advance !
The traditional media is all geared up to declare healthcare dead , or at the very least on life - support , and President Obama 's first term doomed to failure because of this .
It 's an easy template for them -- if they talk about the politics then they do n't have to bother learning the policy and reporting on the stuff that really matters -- how the various policy options would work , what it would mean to average families , or even what happens if reform is n't done .
What they 're forgetting is that two out of the three most important people in making this happen -- Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi -- are committed to getting it done .
Here 's Pelosi , yesterday .
PELOSI : When take this bill to the floor , it will win .
But we will move forward .
This will happen .
Americans , again , with preexisting medical conditions or concern about losing their jobs or changing their jobs or the health care that is available for their children and their families with a big dose of prevention and the rest can take heart and comfort in knowing that this bill will pass .
KING :
When we spoke a few weeks back , you were adamant that the final bill would include a public option .
PELOSI : Definitely .
KING :
You gave an interview this week where you were asked if you could support a bill that did n‚Äôt have one in the end , and you said , I do n‚Äôt think so .
Is that some softening ?
PELOSI : No , no , no , no , the president has said he believes the public option is a way to keep the private insurance companies honest .
But he said , if you can find another way to do this , show it to me .
KING : So is that non-negotiable ?
If the Senate passed a bill that did not have a public option or that had a public option that , say , had a three - or five - year trigger , let ‚Äôs see what happens , see if we can make reforms , and if we do n‚Äôt , then a public option would kick in , is that non-negotiable with the speaker ?
PELOSI : I think the private insurance industry has had a long enough time to have a trigger .
We know what happens left to their own devices .
This is about having an alternative , to give much more leverage to the individual .
And the president has said , if you like the insurance that you have , you like your doctor , you can keep them .
Well , most people , many people feel good about all of that , but they do n‚Äôt know what ‚Äôs going to happen to the cost .
And the cost , that ‚Äôs an accessibility issue .
And we know that a family of four ‚Äî average family of four , their health insurance costs will increase by $ 1,800 a year , that would be $ 18,000 by 2020 .
It ‚Äôs just not affordable .
And therefore not accessible .
There 's also President Obama , who will be back on the bully pulpit this week with townhall meetings in North Carolina and Virginia .
And the other thing they keep overlooking ?
The American public still trusts Obama on the issue , and still wants major reform .
Max Baucus needs to keep all this in mind .
On June 8th the Santa Barbara Zoo welcomed its first ever Humboldt penguin chick .
In this series of pictures you can watch the chick over the course of its first few weeks as veterinarians inspect it and then drop it in the bowl to be weighed , kind of like a safety seat for penguin chicks .
Santa Barbara , CA , June 23 , 2009 ‚Äì The first Humboldt penguin ever born at the Santa Barbara
Zoo was hatched on Monday , June 8 and is now being fostered - reared on exhibit at the Crawford
Family Penguin House .
Humboldt penguins are threatened in their native habit along the Pacific
Coast of South America , from Peru to Chile .
The two - week old chick can sometimes be spotted
in its nesting burrow with one of its foster parents .
Only two of the Zoo ‚Äôs 15 adult Humboldt penguins have a recommendation to breed
under the Species Survival Plan of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums ( AZA ) , which
oversees management of the species .
The pair arrived at the Zoo last year Woodland Park Zoo in
Seattle .
‚Äú They had laid fertile eggs in the past , but had never been successful in rearing their
young , ‚Äù says Sheri Horiszny , Director of Animal Programs .
‚Äú As a result , we researched the
histories of all of our penguins to find one with parenting success .
We have a male that had
successfully fostered eggs before , and we placed the egg with him and his partner , also a male .
The foster pair were dedicated incubators , and now are feeding the chick well . ‚Äù
The chick weighed 90 grams when it was weighed the day after hatch , and weighed 501
grams on June 18 .
[ do we have a new weight ?
Do we know its sex ? ]
‚Äú We will take over care of the chick when it is around four to six weeks old , when it
would naturally begin to gain independence and fledge in the wild , ‚Äù added Horiszny .
Male - bonded penguin couples have been documented in Zoos in Japan , Germany and the
United States .
In 2004 , a male pair of chinstrap penguins in the Central Park Zoo in New York
City partnered and successfully hatched a female chick from an egg , which was the basis for the
children ‚Äôs picture book And Tango Makes Three .
About Humboldt Penguins
The Crawford Family Penguin House offers both above - ground and underwater viewing
of these active birds .
The exhibit , featuring a 5,670 cubic foot pond , opened in June 2006 .
There
are a total of 15 adults birds on view , but only one pair has been recommended for breeding by
the AZA .
This species of penguins like it ‚Äú Chile , not chilly ‚Äù as they hail from coastal desert
regions along the Pacific Coast of South America from Peru to Chile .
They are highly threatened
in their native regions and the Santa Barbara Zoo has made a financial commitment to assist
conservation efforts by Acorema in Peru .
This species is considered threatened by the World Conservation Union , an international
body of thousands of scientists who assess the status of the world ‚Äôs plants and animals .
The total
world population of Humboldt penguins is around 12,000 breeding pairs and is currently in
serious decline .
The causes include over - fishing of their food supply , entanglement in fishing
nets , commercial removal of the guano they use for burrows , and predation .
There are worries
that the species could become extinct within decades .
Bizarre Belt Helps Japanese Lose Weight
People will go a long way to lose weight , making themselves look very silly for a slightly slimmer waist .
Evidence of this can be found ‚Äì where else ‚Äì in Japan , where Boneless Belts help to lift and separate your fat to target problem areas .
These rubber mesh grids split the wearer ‚Äôs abdomen into small blobs , allowing for increased metabolic consumption of calories and a high rate of fat burned .
The bulge - inducing belt comes in two and three - row versions , and even come in scents such as lavender .
Westerners interested in this original way of losing weight can order the device online from Yahoo Japan .

meet the ray comfort of astronomy
Introducing Spike Psarris , junk scientist and nonsense regurgitator extraordinaire ...
Just a few weeks ago , in a guest post on The Panda ‚Äôs Thumb , I warned that creationists are trying to assault astronomy and physics .
And now ladies and gentlemen , I present to you Spike Psarris , an electrical engineer who ‚Äôs tackling ‚Äú the intellectual bankruptcy of evolution ‚Äù with movies about astronomy which are a bargain at just $ 19 per DVD .
Between his videos , interviews and his website , he repeats only ten or twenty times how he went to work in space programs as an ‚Äú atheist and evolutionist ‚Äù only to emerge a Christian creationist after he was swayed by overwhelming evidence of something or other .
Hence , he obviously has the authority to put all of modern astronomy and biology in its place and he ‚Äôll start with a 105 minute trip through our solar system .
The short previews he provides have an absolutely alarming stupidity per statement quotient , as if Psarris is on a mission to compete with Ray Comfort in ignorance .
Every other sentence he utters either starts or ends with how some piece of evidence about our observations of the solar system either prove evolution wrong or come up with results that are ‚Äú devastating to the evolutionary model . ‚Äù
Now , even ignoring the obvious fact that evolution has nothing to do with planetary formation or astronomy in general , only the changes seen in active biospheres over long periods of time , and focusing only on the supposed evidence he tries to present , even an amateur astronomer can point out that for someone who worked in a space program , he does n‚Äôt seem to know an awful lot about space .
For example , one of Psarris ‚Äô assertions is that the evolutionary model predicts that Jupiter has to have a large core but Galileo supposedly found that this core was no more than three Earth masses .
Really ?
You do n‚Äôt say , huh ?
Because astronomers estimate that its mass is between 14 and 18 Earths .
He also claims that there was some sort of evolutionary prediction that Jupiter ‚Äôs atmosphere should n‚Äôt have argon or an entire host of other gasses .
And come to think of it , I ‚Äôm sure there ‚Äôs something about it in On The Origin of Species .
Oh no , wait , he means in our universe , not some parallel astrophysical realm .
Never mind .
After asserting that a non- existent model has been proven false , he also whips out a bit of purple prose from a study ‚Äôs abstract about a gap in our knowledge of Jupiter ‚Äôs formation , written decades ago as proof that astronomers just make it up as they go along , feeding you lies and half - baked guesses .
Psarris repeats that trick whenever he can .
Make a false or non-existent assertion , whip out some obscure , out of context quote , rinse and repeat , all the while chanting about the evolutionary model being wrong or an evolutionary prediction failing or how evolution is false , paying no attention that he ‚Äôs miserably failing at trying to use physics to discard astronomy rather than actually dealing with the theory ‚Äôs realm .
After about five or six minutes , his anti-scientific mantra is like moaning in a porn flick , there for no other reason than as a repetitive background noise for viewers to enjoy .
What exactly was he doing in a space program if he ‚Äôs unable to tell the difference between biology and physics ?
How is his degree in electrical engineering in any way a qualification to spout inanities about observable and well known scientific facts ?
And why does he think people will really be willing to spend $ 19 on this absurd bit of space themed creation erotica ?

Mysterious Giant Mushrooms
Can someone please identify these mushrooms ?
They were found in Florida , after a very rainy weekend .
The biggest mushroom ( next to my foot ) is about 6 - 7 inches tall and about 10 inches wide in diameter .
I would like to know exactly what species are these mushrooms , and if these mushrooms are edible or not .
And if they taste good .
Here is an unrelated joke about mushrooms .
A mushroom walks into a bar , and the bartender says , " Hey !
We do n't serve your kind here . "
The mushroom replies , " Why not ?
I am a fungi . "
If you do n't understand the joke , read it aloud .
I just found out that these mushrooms are edible and are called Parasol Mushrooms .
Thank you to everyone who helped me identify these giant mushrooms !

ACLU Welcomes Announcement On The ADA 's 19th Anniversary
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
WASHINGTON ‚Äì At a celebration today of the 19th anniversary of the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act ( ADA ) , President Obama will announce that the U.S. will sign the most comprehensive international treaty on the rights of persons with disabilities .
If ratified by the Senate , the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ( CRPD ) will be the fourth major human rights treaty ever adopted by the U.S. and the first it has adopted in the 21st century .
The American Civil Liberties Union welcomes President Obama 's reengagement of the United States in international human rights efforts .
" This is a great day for the rights of people with disabilities and a step forward for the U.S. human rights movement , " said Jamil Dakwar , Director of the ACLU Human Rights Program .
" In signing the CRPD , President Obama will place the U.S. back into a leading role in the promotion and stewardship of human rights at home and abroad .
The United States is far too important a country to remain on the sidelines of such vital work . "
Susan Rice , United States Ambassador to the United Nations , will sign the CRPD next week at the United Nations headquarters in New York City .
The Convention , signed by 140 nations since May 2008 , has significant overlap with the ADA and the other U.S. laws protecting disability rights .
However , the Convention provides a holistic and inclusive framework around which disability is defined .
It also addresses the problems individuals with disabilities encounter in society by accounting for past discrimination and includes specific articles related to the rights of women and children with disabilities .
Under the Convention , ratifying countries are obligated to prevent discrimination against , promote accessibility for and work to achieve the full realization of economic , social and cultural rights for persons with disabilities .
" Nothing could make today 's celebration of the ADA ‚Äì one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation ever passed ‚Äì more complete than President Obama 's announcement that he will sign the Convention , " said Deborah J. Vagins , Legislative Counsel for the ACLU .
" Every one of us in America and around the world deserves equal opportunity , economic independence and full participation in society . "
During his campaign , then - Senator Obama promised that he would sign the CRPD .
The Bush administration had chosen not to sign the CRPD , although it did participate in the negotiating sessions of the Convention .
Under the U.S. Constitution , after the Senate gives its advice and consent to ratification , a treaty becomes law .
" If adopted by the United States , the CRPD would inspire a more vigorous and comprehensive approach within the U.S. to address the myriad injustices still suffered by persons with disabilities , " said James Felakos , a Disability Rights Fellow with the ACLU .
" We look forward to the Senate 's ratification of the CRPD . "
Felakos ' essay on the CRPD is available at : www.udhr60.org/enabling_everyone.pdf

URUMQI , China ¬ó
Some women glared through their black veils at the paramilitary troops encircling them .
Others held identity cards of missing relatives in the air .
Fists raised , tears in their eyes , they demanded the release of sons and husbands seized by the police after Muslim Uighurs rioted in this western regional capital days earlier .
And as the group of several hundred Uighur women beseeched journalists on a government - sponsored tour here on Tuesday , they gave voice to broader concerns at the heart of the deadliest ethnic violence to strike China in decades .
‚Äú They do n‚Äôt respect our lifestyle , ‚Äù said one woman , a 26 - year - old who gave her name as Guli .
‚Äú We want our dignity .
We just want fairness , and we want equality . ‚Äù
A wide variety of government policies here in the western desert region of Xinjiang , a lightly populated area that covers about a sixth of China ‚Äôs total landmass , has for years led many of the area ‚Äôs 10 million Uighurs to believe their culture and livelihoods were under assault by the Han Chinese , the dominant ethnic group in China , according to local residents , foreign scholars and recent studies of the area .

If you want to make your E - commerce site or want to make an E - commerce application , you should use the PHP framework .
Generally , people start coding from scratch but if you know how to implement the framework of PHP , you can go with it .
These days you will find many people who are looking for different types of E - commerce sites for their business .
As E - commerce sites can drive huge profit and business , resulting in a more online income .
So , if you are pro in PHP language , you can make use of it in building these E - commerce sites .
For building online community or forums ‚Äì
These days most of the websites which provide any kind of services or are selling any products or if they are the entertainment websites , they want their customers and users to interact with each other and to stay connected with the business too .
There are some websites which are made with the purpose of discussions only and you will find different forums where people are discussing their problems or the brand or the website .
This not just promotes interaction between the users of the website , but it also helps in promoting the business , when the users discuss about one or the other product .
And this all can be made possible with the help of PHP .
Most of the web developers who create such forums and start the work from scratch , they prefer to use PHP framework only .
A website like social meeting website like POF would be a good
For creating or modifying cookies ‚Äì
If you are using the internet or web from a long time , you must be aware of the cookies .
Whenever we visit any website , the cookies are being used .
Large websites such as Amazon to smaller one person operated websites use cookies .
Sometimes they are being used for identifying the user , sometimes they are being used for storing the user ‚Äôs data and preferences .
This is helpful , as it stores the information and the next time the user will visit the website , there will be no requirement of entering the date again until and unless it is not deleted .
Be it creating the cookies or modifying them or deleting them , PHP helps in doing all these things .
For collecting information from user ‚Äì PHP is very helpful when it comes to collecting any kind of information from the user , as it can help the user in direct interaction with the script .
It can be collecting a text which the user wants to translate from one language to another or it can be collecting the mathematic unit which the user wants to convert into another unit .
All these tasks can be performed easily with the help of PHP .
A dating app which is designed to help people meet and fuck must collect user information to pair people up locally and by their preferences which were previously collected .
PHP can be valuable for this .
For Content Management Systems ‚Äì PHP is one such language that can be used for creating a Content Management System .
It also makes helpful for a user or a website owner to make use of the content management system easily .
Even if the user does n‚Äôt have knowledge about the programming languages or HTML or CSS , with a good content management system , they can still add new content to their website or can update it .
For creating WordPress plugins ‚Äì
If you have used the WordPress , and you are well aware of how it works , then you must be aware of the different plugins that are used for different types of blogs and content management .
So , if you know PHP , you can easily create different plugins for WordPress .
There are many tutorials also available over the internet , which helps people in developing or creating WordPress Plugins using PHP language .‚Ä¶

where the sasquatches roam ‚Ä¶
Bigfoot sightings meet climate change for some serious research into the habitats of wildlife in the Pacific Northwest .
When a scientist sends you commentary involving the crypto-zoological sasquatch , you have to make a post about it .
By itself , his paper is actually a commentary on electronic modeling of ecological niches , a warning to make sure that you ‚Äôre putting in complete and high quality data to get a reliable model .
However , it shows a possible explanation for literally hundreds of bigfoot sightings by overlaying the cryptid ‚Äôs hypothetical habitats over the habitat of another well known large mammal prominent in the area , one often confused for hairy , two legged monsters walking around in dense forests and inadvertently scaring people out of their wits .
Dr. Lozier and his co-authors plugged in the locations of 551 bigfoot sightings and 95 footprint sites reported from 1944 to 2005 using a software package called MAXENT and came up with a possible range that spans from California to Washington , following major mountain chains .
At the same time , they plugged in the range data for black bears and found that their habitat and the hypothetical distribution of sasquatches overlaps just about 85 % of the time .
So either bigfoot and black bears intensely compete for resources or there are a lot of huge black bears doing something while standing upright and scaring campers who reported them as giant , humanoid ape creatures to the local authorities .
And if there are really sasquatches there , at least one or two of the hikers , campers or hunters should ‚Äôve found the two species either fighting over food or the dead body of a smaller bigfoot mauled to death by its huge competitor .
But wait a second , what about the same hunters , campers and hikers who insist that what they saw was n‚Äôt a bear and are sure they can tell the difference ?
What about reports from people who swear they were chased by one ?
The problem with eyewitness testimony under extreme stress and fear is that memories are shaped by that traumatic experience and recall can be very unreliable .
Courts know this very well which is why it takes corroborating testimony from others involved in the events of the case and forensic evidence to get successful convictions rather than just a victim naming an attacker .
With all my due respect to experienced outdoorsmen and women , having a huge bear sneak up on you , rear up and growl menacingly in the middle of the night is going to play tricks with your mind as it goes into overdrive and activates the fight - or - flight response .
Humans may be smart creatures but we ‚Äôre not immune to fear .
Still , there are stories that are very difficult to explain and the paper does n‚Äôt even try to pigeonhole all sightings of sasquatches as mistaken identities .
In fact , according to the data , 15 % of them happen where a black bear usually does n‚Äôt venture .
So how do we make heads or tails of sightings that do n‚Äôt fit the natural pattern ?
Well , here Dr. Lozier and his colleagues have a possible solution .
According to their model , as the current climate change patterns continue , sasquatch populations should start moving away from the coastline and head into the mountain areas of Utah , Arizona and Nevada .
If those strangest of sightings closely follow the changes in what ‚Äôs thought to be bigfoot habitats , there might be something to them .
And since today we can track down a species of flower that grows only on a certain hill in South Africa , surely we could track down the kind of active , extensive population needed to maintain a species of enormous , hominid apes ‚Ä¶

We have n't heard much recently about so - called virtual worlds such as Second Life , in which you move around with your own avatar .
Critics must be hoping they have disappeared up their own ether .
Actually , they are booming .
The consultancy kzero.co.uk reports that membership of virtual worlds grew by 39 % in the second quarter of 2009 to an estimated 579 million .
Not all these members are active but I can't think of anything , anywhere , that has grown so fast in the recession this side of Goldman Sachs bonuses .
There 's another curious thing : Facebook and Twitter are lauded to the skies , but neither has found a way to make money ‚Äì whereas virtual worlds such as World of Warcraft , Entropia Universe , Habbo Hotel , Club Penguin and Second Life are all profitable because their business models are based on the digital elixir of subscriptions and micropayments , a formula that other websites , including newspapers , would die for .
Twitter makes the noise , Second Life makes the money .
If you think virtual worlds are a passing fad , look at the figures .
Almost all of the 39 % growth came from children .
Girls used to grow up with their dolls ; now they are growing up with their avatars .
This goes largely unreported because the users do n't read newspapers , but as Kzero reports , poptropica.com ‚Äì aimed at five - to 10 - year - olds ‚Äì has 76 million registered users .
If you move up to 10 - to 15 - year - olds , users rival the populations of countries ‚Äì led by Habbo ( 135 million ) , Neopets ( 54 million ) , Star Dolls ( 34 million ) and Club Penguin ( 28 million ) .
It starts tailing off among 15 - to 25 - year - olds ‚Äì apart from Poptropica ( 35 million ) ‚Äì but it underlines the likelihood that as youngsters get older they will be looking for more sophisticated outlets and for ways to link existing social networks such as Facebook or MySpace to more immersive virtual worlds .
The telephone was a one - to - one experience ; email linked friends and colleagues ; Facebook extended this to friends of friends but virtual worlds offer ‚Äì as Twitter does in a more constrained context ‚Äì the opportunity to link with anyone on the planet sharing similar interests .
Second Life , once the posterboy of virtual worlds , is consolidating as it tries to make the experience easier and less crash - prone while moving adult content to a separate zone .
Only a small fraction of its 19 million registered users are active , but it is still the creative laboratory of the genre .
Corporations find it useful for holding international meetings or to recruit staff and educationalists are doing lots of interesting things including language teaching .
But Second
Life may not end up as the preferred platform as new business models take advantage of the rapidly improving technological developments elsewhere .
In order to get a more streamlined experience , most of the new virtual worlds do n't allow users to make their own content .
Twinity , which has just raised ‚Ç¨ 4.5 m in new funding , has a virtual version of Berlin and Singapore ( with London still in the pipeline ) : you buy existing apartments or rent shops but can't build yourself .
Bluemarsonline.com ‚Äì still in testing mode ‚Äì promises much better graphics and more realistic avatars at the expense of not allowing members ( as opposed to developers ) to create their own content .
One problem of virtual worlds is that you can't go from one to another .
But evolver.com enables users to move creations across worlds and OpenSimulator lets you create a virtual world on the hard drive of your own computer , linking to other compatible ones , such as Second Life , if you choose .
With technology moving so fast and a whole generation growing up for whom having an avatar is second nature , virtual worlds have nowhere to go but up .
Only they wo n't be virtual worlds ‚Äì just a part of normal life .

A day after his chance at wearing the yellow leader ‚Äôs jersey at the Tour de France slipped away , George Hincapie was still crushed .
‚Äú It ‚Äôs one of the biggest disappointments of my career , ‚Äù Hincapie said from the steps of his Team Columbia - HTC bus Sunday morning .
Hincapie , who rode with Lance Armstrong to help him win the Tour seven times , did not speak to reporters after Stage 14 on Saturday , when he was in a breakaway group and looked bound for the overall lead ¬ó until the peloton sped up and narrowed the time gap .
He finished five seconds behind the race leader Rinaldo Nocentini , of Italy , in the overall rankings .
Some of Hincapie ‚Äôs closest friends on other teams ¬ó including Armstrong of Astana and riders on Team Garmin - Slipstream ¬ó were among those who rode at the front to reel in Hincapie and his breakaway group .
The 36 - year - old Hincapie , in his 14th Tour , had worn the yellow jersey only once in his career .
Somebody emailed me the other day , asking about how to go about learning Emacs .
This is my ( edited and rearranged ) reply .
I know you ‚Äôre something of an emacs wizard , so I thought I might as well ask you : how should I learn emacs ? ‚Ä¶
I ‚Äôve used emacs for several years now but have not added very much emacs skill to my repertoire .
Well , the short answer is , you should learn Emacs by using it for about a decade .
That ‚Äôs a pretty lame non-answer , so let me try to elaborate .
I started using Emacs in the fall of 1997 , as a freshman in college .
For at least the first year or so of using Emacs , my Emacs repertoire probably consisted of tens of key bindings ( not counting the myriad bindings of self - insert - command , of course ) , and only a handfull of major modes ( c- mode , java - mode , makefile - mode , that might be about it ) .
So basically , for at least a year , my use of Emacs did n‚Äôt differ substantially from the average user of , say , Notepad .
I distinctly remember a moment during my sophomore year , while in a professor ‚Äôs office talking about some assignment or some such , being amazed by some crazy magic he worked in an Emacs buffer , making seemingly very complex edits in a dizzyingly short amount of time .
I remember asking what the hell he had just done .
He had a good laugh ‚Äî at this point , I was known among other students as ‚Äú the Emacs guy , ‚Äù and yet I did n‚Äôt even know how to record or use keyboard macros .
This was pretty embarrassing .
I ‚Äôve continued to use Emacs this whole time , and it turns out that I ‚Äôve learned a lot about it since then .
I continue to learn about it every day .
The thing is , this is n‚Äôt even about Emacs specifically .
It takes about ten years of such practice to learn anything well .
From Norvig ( emphasis his ) :
Researchers ( Bloom ( 1985 ) , Bryan & Harter ( 1899 ) , Hayes ( 1989 ) , Simmon & Chase ( 1973 ) ) have shown it takes about ten years to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of areas , including chess playing , music composition , telegraph operation , painting , piano playing , swimming , tennis , and research in neuropsychology and topology .
The key is deliberative practice : not just doing it again and again , but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability , trying it , analyzing your performance while and after doing it , and correcting any mistakes .
Then repeat .
And repeat again .
There appear to be no real shortcuts : even Mozart , who was a musical prodigy at age 4 , took 13 more years before he began to produce world - class music .
In another genre , the Beatles seemed to burst onto the scene with a string of # 1 hits and an appearance on the Ed Sullivan show in 1964 .
But they had been playing small clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg since 1957 , and while they had mass appeal early on , their first great critical success , Sgt. Peppers , was released in 1967 .
So how do you get from where you are to using Emacs so much you spend your spare time hacking on various Emacs libraries for fun ?
Mostly by making a point of using Emacs for all of your editing needs , and allowing Emacs to slowly take over your other computings tasks as well .
For instance , the big application that people typically expand their Emacs - fu with is using Emacs to read mail ( see also Zawinski ‚Äôs Law of Software Envelopment ) .
I recommend trying Gnus .
The several weeks you waste trying to figure out how to point Gnus at your mail server more than pays for itself by the amount you learn while driving yourself mad .
Emacs is called ‚Äú the extensible , customizable , self - documenting real - time display editor . ‚Äù
I want to draw your attention to the self - documenting part .
Perhaps the most critical Emacs skills to develop early on is how to navigate and interrogate Emacs ‚Äô help features , which are extensive .
Type C-h C-h to get started down that path .
( related : what is the best tutorial / book on emacs lisp ? )
IIRC I learned elisp via a combination of bumbling , Usenet , and Glickstein but , honestly , I think the elisp manual & tutorial ( combined with the Emacs manual itself ) are much better than muddling through like I did .
( Though , if you ‚Äôd like , you can borrow my ancient and increasingly - inaccurate copy of Glickstein . )
You can get to the elisp tutorial within emacs by typing the following : C-h i d m emacs lisp intro RET
You can get to the elisp manual within Emacs by typing the following : C-h i d m elisp RET
You can get to the Emacs manual within Emacs by typing the following : C-h i d m emacs RET
Here ‚Äôs a breakdown of the above commands so you know what each part is about :
C-h i brings up the Emacs interface to Info , the GNU documentation system d goes to the Info root menu ( in case you were already somewhere else in Info ) m emacs RET opens the Info menu item named emacs
For real - time help from friendly experts , try the #emacs IRC channel on Freenode .
Eventually , you might try IRCing from within Emacs ; there are several IRC clients , including two which ship with Emacs itself .
This photo shows a female - female pair of Laysan Albatross .
Females cooperatively build nests and rear young when males are scarce .
Scientists said nearly all animal species exhibit same - sex behavior .
Examples of same - sex behavior can be found in almost all species in the animal kingdom ‚Äî from worms to frogs to birds ‚Äî making the practice nearly universal among animals , according to a new review of research on the topic .
" It 's clear that same - sex sexual behavior extends far beyond the well - known examples that dominate both the scientific and popular literature : for example , bonobos , dolphins , penguins and fruit flies , " said Nathan Bailey , a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California , Riverside .
Same - sex behaviors in different species are not all equivalent , the review finds .
For instance , male fruit flies sometimes court other male flies , but this behavior is due to a missing gene that gives the flies the ability to distinguish between sexes , said Bailey , a co-author of the review .
" That is very different from male bottlenose dolphins , who engage in same - sex interactions to facilitate group bonding , or female Laysan Albatross that can remain pair - bonded for life , " he added .
The review also found a gap in the literature :
While many studies have tried to understand why same - sex coupling exists and why it might make sense in terms of evolution , few have looked at what the evolutionary consequences of this behavior might be .
" Like any other behavior that does n't lead directly to reproduction ‚Äî such as aggression or altruism ‚Äî same - sex behavior can have evolutionary consequences that are just now beginning to be considered , " Bailey said .
" For example , male - male copulations in locusts can be costly for the mounted male " and this cost may put evolutionary pressure on the locusts , he said .
As a result , a larger number of males may secrete a particular chemical that discourages the mounting behavior , he added .
In their future research , Bailey and Marlene Zuk , a biology professor at UCR , plan to try and address questions about the evolutionary outcomes of same - sex couplings , focusing on the Laysan Albatrosses .
The review article was published in the June 16 issue of the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution , and the study was funded by the UCR Academia Senate .

It can take a long time for hot coffee to get cold in the fridge , or even the freezer , if you 're in a real hurry for it .
Try to rush it , and you get watered - down , bean - flavored water .
Cold - brewing coffee , though , with just grounds , water , a fine filter , and ( optional ) milk , is something you can start right before you go to bed , then finish on a hot morning for a rejuvenating ride to work ( or walk to the laptop , in your editors ' cases ) .

Some bags of beans or pre-ground coffee offer a very rough guide to how much caffeine they 're packing , but most do n't .
Starbucks co-founder Jerry Baldwin explains in a blog post the myths and realities of caffeine levels .
A few short pull - outs : " Robusta " beans pack twice as much caffeine as " Arabica , " " dark roast " means effectively nothing in terms of caffeine , and drip coffee can actually pack more caffeine than espresso , depending on the beans and amounts used .

This is advice best taken if you already hydrate well with water or exercise far ahead of bedtime , but it does n't take downing a pot of the hot stuff to see a performance boost in your exercise or running routines .
According to Australian researchers , a 176 - pound man could drink four ounces of coffee , or two 12 - ounce cans of soda , and " get the full caffeine effect " on their run .
It 's not how you 'll get the edge in a 10 K , but it might just give you the boost you need to make a hard - to - keep commitment going for one more day .

Not all coffee should go in the freezer .
In fact , if you 're going to actually use the coffee right away , you do n't want it going straight from the icebox to under steaming water .
Find a local coffee seller that roasts their own beans , or at least offers honest details on when their stuff was roasted , then divide your stash into weekly amounts .
Keep the current week 's stash in an airtight container at room temperature , or sealed in the refrigerator , and keep the other weeks ' portions in the freezer .

Drip coffee has its limitations , but it can be made better .
Newsweek 's Budget Travel blog points out that one such limitation is that drip models ‚Äî the kind at work in hotel rooms and maybe in your kitchen ‚Äî take a long time to heat up to proper flavor - releasing temperatures .
Run just a pot of water through the machine first to heat it up , then pour that heated water right back in to actually brew .
Assuming you 're not running out the door , this definitely seems worth the effort , and might save you the time and money spent at a coffee shop .

Our weekend editor got crazy - obsessive about turning out a good cup of Joe recently , researching the best practices from bean to brew .
One notable , practical discovery was that it comes out better when you use a French press , even a cheap one .
Here 's why :
One of the primary benefits of making coffee in a French press over a standard drip pot is that more of the coffee oils end up in your cup instead of in the machine 's filter .
More oils means better taste !
As a bonus , a carefully cleaned French press can also double as an excellent pot for loose leaf tea .

Almost exactly a year ago I wrote here about giving Python a try as my main programming language .
Before that I was mainly writing in Perl , and eying Ruby from time to time as the replacement .
Well , it will come as no surprise to the readers of this blog that Python won big - time .
In the past year I 've posted more than 30 posts in the Python category of this blog , and it's clear than Python has indeed become my main programming language .
In this post I want to summarize what I 've done with Python over the last year , and my general thoughts about the language .
General impression
My thoughts on Python are not much different from the short summary I posted just a few weeks after starting with the language .
If anything , the small deficiencies " grew on me " - I got used to the couple little quirks in the syntax , and found out that the other things are not so bad .
For example , although Python does n't have CPAN , I have n't yet encountered a need for which no Python library has been written .
In this aspect the last year , at least in my view , has shown a trend towards Python from other languages .
Google and other companies are releasing Python - only APIs , for instance .
And I think it 's hard to find another language with two such great bindings to complete GUI frameworks like PyQt and wxPython .
I also lamented the clutter in Python 's standard library .
Well , that is being fixed with Python 2.6 and especially 3.0 , which will become mainstream in a few months .
Regarding Python 's pluses , the significant whitespace turned out to be a much bigger one than I 've ever expected .
Over the last year I 've read the code of many libraries , and almost always found it quite readable and simple to follow .
Python 's PEP - 8 is a good set of rules that 's followed to some extent by virtually everyone in the community , which adds a lot .
Company - wide coding standards exist for a reason , and PEP - 8 is a community - wide coding standard .
Moreover , I 've taught Python to a few junior engineers and interns at work - people with little programming experience .
I was amazed at how easy their code was to understand .
I 've had the " pleasure " to read Perl code written by programming newbies , and it's a painful experience I would never want to go through again .
Python is different .
Python - mania
Python is taking over practically all my programming .
Over the past year , it has completely replaced Perl and Ruby .
It has also somewhat shoved C and C++ out of the picture , because Python has such great bindings to existing C code ( ctypes ) , and also because it has great libraries for practically everything .
But the most surprising effect of Python on me is that it 's slowly but surely pushing Lisp out of my mind .
Back when I was programming in Perl , I kept coming back to Lisp from time to time , trying to make the shift , not succeeding and going back .
I guess I just felt unsatisfied with what I had .
With Python , this is just gone .
I 'm fully satisfied with this language .
I 've very glad that I learned the functional programming paradigms from Lisp , and I use them daily in Python .
But overall , Python is simply a better language .
Moreover , it has a much larger ecosystem - libraries , development community , bindings , and support from large companies .
Getting things done I did a rough count of the amount of Python code I 've written this year .
I count commented , tested lines of code , meaning that comments and unit tests are included in the count .
The result is roughly 40 KLOC , which is n't bad at all .
Here 's a partial list of stuff I 've implemented with Python so far .
Some of it at work , some at home : A couple of simple web - applications for my own use .
One using plain CGI , and the other using the TurboGears web framework .
pycparser - a complete parser for ANSI C90 .
Parts of a VHDL parser .
This is still work in progress .
A converter between binary data description formats , such as Intel HEX .
Several versions of a recursive - descent parser for a simple language
Many scripts for Scite
At work I 've developed a framework for using Python for verification of VHDL models .
Python is used to write the test scenarios and generate VHDL testbenches from them .
A few applications for controlling embedded hardware via the serial port ( with elaborate wxPython & PyQt GUIs )
A few applications for analyzing test reports and building summaries in a user - friendly format
A complex multi-threaded web - page download and analysis program for my own use
A couple of games : a Tetris clone with wxPython and a small game with Pygame as part of a tutorial
Analysis of numeric data with matplotlib
Parts of an assembler and linker for a synthetic language
Solved dozens of Project Euler problems , all in Python .
Most of these projects were covered at least to some extent in this blog , and can be found by searching .
If something interests you and you can't find it in the blog search box , drop me an email .
It took me a while to figure out why everybody was nagging me to do a column on the Iranian elections .
Everybody seemed to think it was all mysterious and world - shaking .
Finally I realized , you ‚Äôre all het up because every news service in the US and England has been selling these riots like a new Star Wars episode , and people are just trying to figure out what ‚Äôs going on and what it all means .
Well , I can answer that in one note : nothing much is going on , just letting off steam ; and what little is happening is n‚Äôt mysterious at all .
Basically , this is simple steam release , something the Mullahs have to allow now and then when the kids , and there are a lot of young adults in Iran , need to remind everybody they ‚Äôre tired of being bossed around .
There ‚Äôs a huge , huge difference between that kind of ‚Äú revolution ‚Äù and the kind that has a real foundation in tribal differences or religion or city / country , the real fault lines .
What ‚Äôs going on in Iran now is a lot like the big fizzle in Lebanon after Hariri ‚Äôs assassination in 2005 .
So if y‚Äôall will permit me to digress , let me take you back to the Cedar Revolution that supposedly ‚Äú gripped ‚Äù Lebanon .
All that really happened was that some of the few Christian / Sunni elite Lebanese kids who had n‚Äôt emigrated yet got so pissed off at the Syrians for just blowing Hariri away in broad daylight that they came out and waved the Lebanese flag‚Äìthe one with the Cedar tree on it .
Well , you ‚Äôd have thought the Berlin Wall had fallen all over again .
The same Anglo news networks that are declaring an outbreak of democracy in Iran now were screaming into microphones all over Lebanon , just so touched by these rich Christian / ‚Äù Phoenician ‚Äù Lebanese kids announcing that no durn Hezbollah Iranian - puppet thugs were gonna repress their craving for freedom ‚Ä¶ and discos , and wearing about a quart of perfume , and all the other accessories that go with what they call a Western orientation in the Middle East .
These are the kind of people Anglo news crews glom onto like horny refrigerator magnets : young , well - dressed , a lot of them speak English , and they talk about nice familiar stuff like ‚Äú freedom ‚Äù and ‚Äú democracy . ‚Äù
They make great TV .
But they ca n‚Äôt win a war .
You win wars with poor people , numbers and toughness and discipline .
Hezbollah proved it had the numbers by producing counter - demos with a million people cheering the Syrians and asking Allah to zap the West and Democracy and that Cedar Tree .
If democracy means ‚Äú we got more people with us than you do , ‚Äù that should ‚Äôve proved Hezbollah beat the Cedar All - Stars , but that story never came out much .
Hezbollah ‚Äôs demonstrators were n‚Äôt the kind of people the BBC or CNN really felt comfortable around .
It ‚Äôs hard for a Western news crew to relax with a huge crowd of agitated lower - class Shia .
Their way of making a point is by getting bloody , showing off wounds and cuts and shaving nicks , whatever they ‚Äôve got .
Nobody at CNN wants that to be the future ; nobody wants to go to commercial with a bunch of shrieking Shia mothers like hysterical Hefty Bags proudly saying they hope their 14 or so sons become martyrs , and the sooner the better .
No , what you want for an upbeat TV story is a bunch of taller , skinnier , paler , English - speaking rich kids .
Which brings us to Iran .
Iranians are n‚Äôt Arab , but they are Shia , and excitable .
Keep that in mind .
Different countries explode at different temperatures .
There are places where yelling is a declaration of war .
If a Norwegian raises his voice , Hell is about to break loose .
If a Canadian yells at you , get a restraining order .
But Iranians will scream at each other over how to cook an egg , and be all chummy and laughing the next minute .
They used to keep that hysterical side in control with opium ‚Äìthe whole country was on the pipe until the sixties ‚Äì but it ‚Äôs harder to get now , so they just keep yelling .
So when Iran has a national election , it ‚Äôs going to be loud .
People are going to yell in the streets , people are going to shoot guns off , sometimes in the general direction of the opposition , and anybody who gets hit is going to tweet his bloodstains , youtube his bulletholes , and send it all over the world .
And if the people doing the demonstrating are mostly that same Cedar - Rev demographic : rich young city kids‚Äìthen duh , they ‚Äôre also the ones who are going to be web - savvy tweet freaks .
In fact , Iran has probably the biggest dissident blog network in the world .
I do n‚Äôt read Farsi‚ÄìI wish I did‚Äìbut I read this pretty decent book , I Am Iran , about the anti-mullah blog scene there .
Check it out if you want a better idea of who the opposition is , the people flooding the streets in Tehran .
They ‚Äôre sick of it , which is easy to understand ; living in the Islamic Republic of Iran must be a lot like going to a Catholic school where you never , ever graduate , where kissing is a felony and not wearing the uniform is a crime against God .
Hell yes , they ‚Äôre sick of it , and they have every right to be .
But , to get coldblooded about it , so what ?
They ‚Äôre not going to overthrow the state .
I do n‚Äôt usually like that word , ‚Äú the state , ‚Äù but I ‚Äôm using it here because it works better than ‚Äú Ahmedinajad . ‚Äù
He ‚Äôs the official bad guy here , the classic bigmouth runt who wants Israel turned into a gravel pit and America turned into a colony of Venezuela .
Hell , he ‚Äôs all kinds of obnoxious , down to the ratty beard and beady eyes and the way he dresses like a hungover Soviet janitor .
But he ‚Äôs not the Islamic Republic of Iran .
He ‚Äôs only the president .
The way the Iranian government is put together , the Prez is more like a noisemaker , official annoyer - of - the - Anglos , than a decider .
Way , way above him is the ‚Äú Supreme Leader , ‚Äù sort of an Ayatollah version of the Pope , Khomeini ‚Äôs official successors .
Right now the Supreme Leader is Ali Khamenei .
He does n‚Äôt talk to the press , or make official trips to hug Chavez .
He just sits there in his big black turban and says ‚Äú No ‚Äù every time somebody asks for a little relaxation of all this pious crap .
He ‚Äôs seen ‚Äôem come and go , these reformer types ; he crushed Rafsanjani , Khatami , anybody who even suggested that the way Khomeini laid it down in 1979 might not be good enough for all eternity .
See , that ‚Äôs the pattern I ‚Äôm talking about : the people who matter in Iran wo n‚Äôt talk to foreign news crews , and the people who will , the ones in the streets right now ‚Ä¶well , they may be brave , noble people , but they do n‚Äôt have a chance in Hell .
That ‚Äôs because the IRI government is a bunch of rival militias , intelligence agencies , and religious committees .
There ‚Äôs even a legislature , although nobody takes that seriously .
If you remember the way the Iranian side was organized in the Iran / Iraq war , you might have a better idea how the people at the top like things to run : always with rival forces competing for power .
That ‚Äôs because Khomeini was thinking coups in 1979 .
So alongside the regular Army he set up the Revolutionary Guards , hardcore jihadis loyal to the Supreme Leader , not the Army Brass .
To make sure the Revolutionary Guards were n‚Äôt vulnerable to a sudden decapitation by the army or anyone else , their cadres were placed with every agency , like Islamist commissars , and they set up militias in every city in Iran .
You get the same thing in any new militarized state , even tiny Hellholes like Duvalier ‚Äôs Haiti , with the Ton=ton Macoutes balancing the army , bypassing the official channels so they could kill at Duvalier ‚Äôs command .
When Fight Night Round 3 released in December of ‚Äô06 for the PS3 , the graphics were almost lifelike .
I actually had friends walk in when I was playing and they thought it was an actual fight ( for a few seconds anyway ) .
The game play was a little stiff , and the wall between the fighters seemed a bit corny , but it was still the greatest boxing game I had ever played , and I continued to play it until EA released it ‚Äôs Fight Night Round 4 demo .
Now that Fight Night Round 4 has released , and I ‚Äôve taken over the Legacy mode by retiring as the Greatest of All Time , I wanted to share my thoughts on the game with our valued readers .
Fight Now will allow you to go toe - to - toe with some of the Greatest of all Time , and if you really feel cocky , make sure to set the difficulty to that level as well .
Beating Ali on the G.O.A.T. setting felt great and gives you one of the best looking trophies I ‚Äôve seen in any game .
While Ali was a tough fight , he turned out to be no match for George Foreman and a steady dose of straight rights .

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RvJkOLvx_E[/youtube]
In order to fully enjoy the Legacy mode , I had to take the time to upload my own mug and ‚Äò Get in the Game ‚Äô myself :
It is definitely not a spot on reproduction of me , but if you are looking for a specific fighter that is n‚Äôt on the official roster , you can head over to the ‚Äò Share - a - Boxer ‚Äô page at EASportsWorld.com to find your guy .
The training modes are a definite step up from Round 3 and really help to improve your overall understanding of how the actual boxing matches should work .
Leaning , foot work , counters , precision punching , and moving your head each have their own training game and make sure you do n‚Äôt pay too much attention to any one area .
A well balanced boxer is much better than a guy that can hit like Tyson , but move like a snail .
The training games can be very difficult , and there were times that I would have earned more points using auto train and not playing the games myself .
By far , my best game was open sparring .
Scheduling your next fight might take a little more thought than you might actually think .
At first I was just taking on the lowest possible ranked fighter I could , but after my first 10 fights , the lowest ranked available fighter turned out to be a monster that wanted to take my head off ( and nearly did ) .
You never know when you ‚Äôll face a fighter that has the numbers to make them a beast , so be sure to check their stats before signing your death warrant next contract .
Custom entrances do not allow for custom music on the PS3 , and I was disappointed by that , but it only takes 20 seconds or so to get to the ring , so no big loss there .
You can still choose for your fighter to be cocky , composed , or neutral , and the lasers and fog are a cool addition as well .
All of that leads up to what was anticipated to be the fight of the year , and the game play does n‚Äôt disappoint .
The wall between the boxers from Round 3 has not only be taken down , but completely destroyed .
My boxer was a tall heavyweight ( 6 ‚Äô8 ‚Ä≥ 260 lbs ) , so inside boxing was n‚Äôt my specialty .
If I allowed a shorter boxer to get on the inside though , my chin would take a beating , and my punches would sail behind the guy .
Just so you know , punching a guy with the inside of your arm does little damage .
In Round 3 , almost every punch connected solidly .
In Round 4 , glancing blows are landed more often than solid hits .
If your guy has a long reach , inside fighting can be a lost cause .
Going toe to toe with Tyson when you are 6 ‚Äô 8 ‚Ä≥ and he ‚Äôs only 5 ‚Äô 11 ‚Äù is not a smart choice .
Staying back and using your jab to keep the mini monster at bay is the wiser choice .
In the course of your career , be careful of the guys that want to test your reputation and challenge you .
They seem to be some of the toughest fighters in the game , and can be almost impossible to keep down .
They seem to all have high ‚Äò Heart ‚Äô ratings and that means they can get back up many times after being knocked down .
Moving up the ‚Äò Legacy Ladder ‚Äô , the rankings , and the ‚Äò Pound for Pound ‚Äô rankings really adds to an incredible experience that is currently unmatched .
The online area actually has 2 different modes .
You can just go at it in a ‚Äò Fight Now ‚Äô type of mode where you can be any one rostered fighter in either a ranked or unranked match , or you can go for your online belts in the ‚Äò Online Championship ‚Äô mode ( OC ) .
The OC has a ranking system of it ‚Äôs own in 3 seperate weight classes .
You can fight as a lightweight , middleweight , or heavy weight and you can use your own created boxer from Legacy mode .
My first online fight as a lightweight did n‚Äôt seem too fair to me since the system matched me up with the # 3 guy and I was ranked somewhere around 10 K .
That was a painful 30 seconds .
I ‚Äôm still trying to climb my way up the online ladder , so the replayability of this game should keep me as busy as Round 3 did , and that was 2 + years worth of play time .
Round 4 takes the boxing genre to a whole new level .
Where Round 3 ruled the ring , Round 4 continued that greatness .
Where Round 3 was lacking , Round 4 exceeded my expectations .
The game has clearly reset the bar from Round 3 .
Midstaters wanting Pennsylvania to become the 14th state to legalize medical marijuana rallied on the steps of the state Capitol on Saturday .
About 20 people marched from the Capitol to the corner of Market and 2nd streets , holding signs and handing out literature highlighting marijuana 's benefits to those suffering from cancer treatments , glaucoma and depression .
Chuck Homan , the York - area man who organized the event , said a bill is pending before the state Legislature -- the most restrictive proposed to date -- that would allow Pennsylvanians to purchase small amounts of marijuana for treatment purposes .
" When you 're suffering with long - term , chronic pain , you just can't be on pills a long time , " Homan said .
" The side effects are horrific -- it 's unreal .
" As the group progressed toward Market Street , honks of support , and the occasional " Go home , hippies , " followed them down the city blocks .
A stop on the street outside the Whitaker Center for Science and the Arts -- where a home - school graduation was just letting out -- led to a security guard politely asking them to move along .
There will be a candlelight vigil in memory of the Philadelphia man , Barry Bush , who first pushed for medical legalization , at 8:30 p.m .
Fail and Googasm Google has announced the Google Chrome Operating System , which is the Chrome browser bundled with a Linux kernel and a handful of hardware drivers , targeted at netbooks .
Yes , this time it 's actually an operating system , but do n't cream yourself .
Yet again , there is a severe case of the media not knowing what the fuck it 's talking about .
When Google Chrome was released last year , pundits completely lost their shit over it , claiming that Chrome was a new web operating system .
Meanwhile , I pointed out that in fact it's a web browser and that an operating system is a very complicated piece of software that can't really be written off as " implementation details . "
Now , I guess Chrome is going to be even more operating - systemy , by way of including , uh , an operating system .
Journalistic logic rocks .
The pundits are losing their shit all over again , which is fairly impressive , because multiple Googasms from a single product are very rare .
Last year , I highlighted the glorious incompetence of writers who fancy themselves tech journalists .
Much in the way that everybody who saw Sideways is now an expert on wine , the tragedy of blogging is that anybody with a laptop and a Gmail account is an expert on technology .
So now that Chrome will actually be a full - fledged operating system , let 's see what the experts have to say .
The canonical example of failure in tech journalism is TechCrunch , a blog that once declared Google 's MapReduce to be a system that " reduced the links found on the web into a map that search algorithms could run over . "
Yes , this will do nicely .
TechCrunch embodies all that is wrong with blogging as journalism : shoddy fact checking , writing that would fail a high school English class , and a pre-adolescent in - the - brain - out - the - mouth reporting style .
TechCrunch , um , editor Michael Arrington quotes my previous El Reg article about Chrome not being an operating system and goes on to explain :
Purists complained that a browser is n‚Äôt actually an operating system , and brought up mundane issues about hardware drivers , memory , and processor management and other red herrings .
Sure , they were right - the Chrome browser is n‚Äôt an operating system ...
Google just bolted a big ol ‚Äô bag of drivers ( also known as the Linux kernel ) to Chrome and are calling it the Google Chrome Operating System .
It ‚Äôs going to be hard for people to continue to deny its operating systemness now .
Proof that you can lead a horse to water , but you can't punch him in the dick without being brought up on assault and battery charges .
I 'm sure that Linus is pleased to see that his decades of research into operating systems amounts to nothing more than a big ol ' bag of drivers for getting people to Twitter faster .
When Chrome was first released , journalists loved the idea that Google was taking on Microsoft , but it just was n't so .
Now that Google will be releasing an operating system , the Goliath vs. Goliath story gets a little clearer .
Yes , Chrome OS will be competing with Windows in the netbook market , which is the a tiny sliver of the PC market .
No , Chrome will not replace Windows in the years to come .
Let 's all just calm down .
TechCrunch goes on to report : " Do n‚Äôt worry about those desktop apps you think you need .
Office ?
Meh .
You ‚Äôve got Zoho and Google Apps .
You wo n‚Äôt miss Office . "
Ah , yes .
Corporate IT workers everywhere have to port decades of esoteric business logic codified into Excel macros to Google Spreadsheets , but the real problem is , what are they going to do after lunch ?
Have you ever tried to use Google Docs for any serious task ?
In the words of a true hacker , it 's like trying to build a bookcase out of mashed potatoes .
The Microsoft Office institution will not easily be overthrown by a bunch of jokers writing JavaScript .
But it 's not just Office that will keep Microsoft 's hold on the PC market .
Can you replace Active Directory with a web app ?
Is there a site I can visit to connect to my office 's shared printer ?
What do you mean World of Warcraft does n't run in the browser ?
How do I play a DVD in Google Chrome ?
Keep whackin ' away on that Pareto Principle and let us all know how it turns out .
In the meantime , I 'm going to go play a few rounds of Counterstrike on my Windows - based PC , because the best that my browser can do is Tetris .
I 'm sure that HTML5 will bridge that gap any day now .
The notion that Google Chrome OS is going to take any serious market share away from Windows is a product of the pathological Silicon Valley attitude that newer is always better , even if nothing has changed .
In terms of functionality , web apps have been a regression from their desktop counterparts .
Run business apps over a faulty network instead of from your hard disk ?
What could possibly go wrong ?
Can I buy an extended warranty with that ?
As Mike Arrington says : " The Internet Is Everything .
All the OS has to do is boot the damn computer , get me to a browser as fast as possible and then stay the hell out of the way . "
Indeed .
That 's probably why desktop Linux machines with Firefox have already taken such a foothold in the consumer market .
Oh , wait . ¬Æ

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Where were you on the night of July 15 ?
You may not even remember , but for me it was an extraordinary evening , an evening of unimaginable triumph and unbearable tragedy .
Andrew Kinard testifies before a Senate Armed Services subcommittee on April 29 , 2009 .
But I would not actually know everything that happened until the night was long over .
A couple of weeks before July 15 , a friend who works with injured troops emailed me to say it was time for Andrew 's going away party .
Andrew Kinard is a young Marine I first met a few years ago at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington where he was recovering from a devastating IED attack in Iraq .
He had stepped on the roadside bomb and lost his entire body below the hips .
The party being arranged was Andrew 's farewell to D.C. Andrew is off to the rigors of Harvard Law School .
He 's says he 's itching to get into a courtroom .
You need to remember the name Andrew Kinard .
Many of his friends believe Andrew is such an amazing man that he will become president of the United States .
If I had to bet , I 'd say it could happen .
I would n't have missed the party for the world .
I was touched that this tight - knit community of wounded warriors had included me in this very special , very intimate evening .
The Situation Room See what may have driven an army officer to take his own life today in The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer
Today , 4 pm ET see full schedule ¬ª
There was a display of photos of Andrew serving in Iraq .
I suddenly realized I never knew how tall he was before the war .
There were a few sniffles and wiping of eyes in the room for a Marine whose dream of service to his country ended within a few months of getting to Iraq .
But sniffles did n't last long and the evening became one of hugs , laughter and good wishes ( and more than a few beers ) for a young Marine who had triumphed over what the war had dealt him .
But my warm feelings did n't last long .
The next day another source in the wounded troop community came to me in the Pentagon hallway with another tale .
" You have to do something about the story of Ray Rivas , " he said .
In the very hours we were celebrating Andrew in Washington , tragedy was unfolding in Texas .
Lt. Col. Raymond Rivas , a 53 - year old civil affairs officer who had dedicated his career to rebuilding war torn countries , was found dead in his car in the parking lot of Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio Texas .
Colleagues of Ray 's said prescription pills and notes he wrote to his family and wife , Colleen , were found .
A military source told me all indications are Ray took his own life .
His devastated family understandably declined to talk publicly , and the military wo n't discuss the case citing privacy concerns .
But friends and colleagues I spoke to confirmed that Ray had suffered multiple blast injuries to his brain from bomb attacks during several deployments over the years .
Watch Ray Rivas 's struggle with his brain injuries ¬ª
In October 2006 , Ray survived an attack in Iraq that rendered him briefly unconscious .
He was transferred to Europe but somehow talked the doctors into sending him back to the war zone .
A week later , ill and confused , he was sent back to the United States .
A close associate tells me that at first , despite being diagnosed with traumatic brain injury in Iraq , some doctors thought Ray might be suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder .
They did n't realize he had all the symptoms of traumatic brain injury .
He had trouble talking , reasoning and remembering .
He was sent to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio so he could be near his family , but for the first few months he just sat in his room .
Fellow soldiers helped him with his bathing , dressing and eating .
Finally , Ray was assigned a case manager , and things began to move rapidly .
He got therapy and was able to go home .
But by all accounts from his friends , Ray had become seriously debilitated by the injuries to his brain .
A private email shown to CNN revealed that Ray had been diagnosed with rapidly emerging Alzheimer 's disease .
The cumulative impact of all those bomb blasts were destroying his brain .
Colleagues say Ray knew he might have to move to an assisted living facility .
Ray 's doctors are not discussing his treatment because of privacy concerns .
A colleague told me Ray was tired and in pain on the night of July 15 .
He was found in his car in the parking lot at the army hospital where he had spent so long trying to get better .
But Ray will be remembered for all he did for others .
Even with all his suffering , he wanted to make sure other injured troops were helped .
In April he and his wife Colleen went to Capitol Hill to testify with other wounded warriors about their needs .
Sitting on that panel with Ray was Andrew Kinard .

PROFESSIONAL COMMENT ON TODAY‚ÄôS BUDGET
Advertisement
An injection of ¬£ 500 m into stalled development seems to be just a market headline grabber !
The money is mainly going to come from savings on government property costs which are some years away .
The singular difference between the Government ‚Äôs approach to resolving the economic crisis and the market ‚Äôs , is the Government is just trying to resolve the situation through Keynesian economics .
The market is looking for tax incentives which are seriously lacking !
Increasing tax for people earning more than ¬£ 150,000 is totally counterproductive as it will be the country ‚Äôs entrepreneurs that lead us out of recession and not the Government .
AukettFitzroyRobinson Chief Executive Nicholas Thompson
The 2009 budget carries little positive news for the industry amidst a global economic crisis .
Regretfully , the Government in the current economic climate has found it impossible to make a significant investment in the long - term future , whether in housing or infrastructure .
Amongst the few chinks of light is the stimulus for housing , but the 10,000 homes is a fraction of what is needed .
RIBA President Sunand Prasad
The Chancellor has missed a golden opportunity to help build Britain out of the recession .
A ¬£ 5 billion package would have created 55,000 new jobs as well as help increase the supply of much needed homes .
A cut in VAT to five percent would have helped to bring the 300,000 empty homes back into use .
Instead the Chancellor has let the opportunity slip by and those wanting an affordable home will be forced to wait even longer .
The Federation of Master Builders
The Chancellor ‚Äôs announcement that carbon emissions will be cut by 34 % by 2020 is a historic commitment .
But targets need to be backed up by action .
It ‚Äôs good to see extra money for cutting carbon in social housing , additional investment in low carbon new homes and some funding of green refurbishment in public sector buildings .
But this falls short of a comprehensive strategy to put low carbon buildings at the heart of economic recovery .
More could have been done to really make green refurbishment affordable and attractive to both home owners and businesses , in order to both cut carbon emissions and create green - collar jobs .
Paul King , Chief Executive of the UK Green Building Council
Extending the stamp duty holiday may help some buyers who do now seem to be entering the market but will only have a major impact if steps to increase levels of mortgage lending are also effective .
The end of the holiday needs to be well managed and one possibility would be to reform stamp duty from the current slab structure to a marginal system like income tax .
Without changes to the system the end of the holiday could cause serious distortions to any upturn in the housing market .
RICS response to extended stamp duty
The Chancellor has recognised the need for assistance to the housing market as essential to helping Britain ‚Äôs economic recovery .
Government action to support mortgage lending should help translate buyer interest , which has picked up in recent months , into actual sales .
Additional funding for HomeBuy Direct and extending the stamp duty holiday should also encourage those wishing to get on the housing ladder .
Measures announced by the Chancellor will help move towards a sustainable and vibrant housing market for the future .
RICS general response
The RIBA has expressed its disappointment after a widely demanded cut in VAT on domestic refurbishment and repairs - down to 5 per cent - failed to emerge .
Anna Scott - Marshall , the RIBA ‚Äôs head of public affairs , said : ‚Äò We argued this measure was cost neutral and was something the government should seriously have considered .
We are now hoping to see it in the next pre-budget review in November . ‚Äô
RIBA response to lack of VAT cut
LOS ANGELES - Two major advocacy groups for the homeless on Tuesday ranked Los Angeles as the " meanest " city in the United States , citing a Skid Row police crackdown they say has criminalized poverty and homelessness there .
L.A. 's so - called Safer City Initiative was singled out in the groups ' report as the most egregious example of policies and practices nationwide that essentially punish people for failing to have a roof over their heads .
Others include making it illegal to sleep , sit or store personal belongings on sidewalks and other public spaces ; prohibitions against panhandling or begging ; and selective enforcement of petty offenses like jaywalking and loitering .
Such measures are widespread in the face of a deep economic recession and foreclosure crisis that have increased homelessness over the past two years , according to the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty and the National Coalition for the Homeless .
Their report examined laws and practices in 273 cities across the country , with Los Angeles topping the list of the 10 " meanest cities " for what the study called inhumane treatment of homeless .
A previous report , issued in early 2006 before the crackdown began , ranked L.A. as the 18th meanest .
According to " Homes Not Handcuffs : The Criminalization of Homelessness
in U.S. Cities , " the 10 Meanest Cities in 2009 are :
1. Los Angeles
2. St. Petersburg , FL
3. Orlando , FL
4. Atlanta , GA
5. Gainesville , FL
6. Kalamazoo , MI
7. San Francisco
8. Honolulu , HI
9. Bradenton , FL
10 . Berkeley
Under the Safer City effort , thousands of L.A. 's most destitute residents have been targeted for harsh police enforcement , routinely receiving tickets for minor infractions such as the failure to obey crossing signals .

As a result , the study says , many are jailed and end up with a criminal record that makes it more difficult for them to find a job or gain access to housing .
A spokesman for Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa issued a statement dismissing the report as " short - sighted and misleading . "
Los Angeles officials have touted their Safer City effort for sharply curbing serious crime in Skid Row , a 50 - block downtown area inhabited by the biggest concentration of homeless people in the country .
" The city 's first priority is to protect our most vulnerable residents from violent crime , " the mayor 's statement said .
But homeless advocates say a promised strategy to ease homelessness there , including new housing and services to go with the Skid Row cleanup , have largely failed to materialize .
An estimated 40,000 people live on the streets , in abandoned buildings or in temporary shelters throughout Los Angeles , more than 5,000 of them in Skid Row .
Another 8,000 make their home in that area 's short - term residential hotels , or flop houses as they were once called .
Becky Dennison , co-director of the Los Angeles Community Action Network , said the homeless population in Los Angeles has ballooned due to a lack of affordable housing , a high poverty rate and " long - standing lack of local resources . "
Tuesday 's report cited a 2007 University of California study that found L.A. was spending $ 6 million a year to pay for the 50 extra police officers who patrol Skid Row while budgeting just $ 5.7 million for homeless services .
By comparison , Dennison said , New York City has a " right to shelter " policy and invests about $ 200 million a year in housing and other services for the needy , resulting in a homeless population half that of Los Angeles .
This post is n‚Äôt for confirmed atheists , nor for confirmed theists .
It ‚Äôs not for people who ‚Äôve already made up their minds , one way or the other .
No , this post is for the seekers , the in - betweeners , the tormented doubters .
It ‚Äôs for the uncertain agnostics , people who are n‚Äôt certain what they believe ; it ‚Äôs for people who feel like they no longer belong in their church , but do n‚Äôt know of an alternative ; and it ‚Äôs for people who are experiencing a full - blown crisis of faith and do n‚Äôt know where to turn .
If you found this post through a web search , it ‚Äôs probably for you .
There are countless reasons why you might have come to this point .
You may feel rejected or unwelcome at your church or your religious community , perhaps because you hold some views that are different from the orthodoxy .
You may feel betrayed by a religious leader who turned out to be a hypocrite , or who abused the trust he was given .
Or you may feel disappointed with God himself , perhaps because faith does n‚Äôt offer the comfort you thought it would , or because promised miraculous help did n‚Äôt come when you needed it most .
You may feel that your prayers are n‚Äôt being listened to , that there ‚Äôs no one on the other end of the line .
But however you came to this point , I ‚Äôm almost certain that you feel like the only one who ‚Äôs different , the only one who does n‚Äôt fit in .
If you ‚Äôre one of these people , I have a message for you : Atheism is an option .
You do n‚Äôt have to believe .
You do n‚Äôt need to belong to a religion to lead a fulfilling , moral , and happy life .
You can be an atheist , and you do n‚Äôt need to feel guilty about it .
On the contrary , being an atheist can be a positive achievement to celebrate and take pride in .
The second most important thing I want to say to you , the seekers and the doubters , is this :
You are not alone .
There are others like you .
In fact , there are more of us than you probably think .
I ‚Äôve heard from other people who feel the same way , and nearly every prominent atheist I know can say the same .
There are people in the pews and even behind the pulpits who no longer believe , but ca n‚Äôt say so because they do n‚Äôt want to lose their major source of community , because they fear reprisal , or because they know no other way of making a living .
I ‚Äôd wager it ‚Äôs more common than people think .
Like an iceberg whose depths lie below the surface , the number of visible , outspoken atheists might well be dwarfed by the number of those who are still counted as religious only by default .
I have no doubt that you ‚Äôve heard plenty of gloomy and frightening stereotypes about atheists , and I can assure you that they are not true .
Atheism is not incompatible with morality , nor does it require hating religious people , nor does it mean a life lacking happiness or meaning .
In fact , the journey to atheism can be a wonderful , exhilarating liberation , as many who ‚Äôve walked that road can tell .
The only thing being an atheist means is that you do n‚Äôt believe in any gods .
In every other respect , you can live your life however you want and be the same person you have always been .
If you ‚Äôre intrigued by these words , or if you ‚Äôre merely curious , there are plenty of resources where you can read and learn more , and numerous online communities ‚Äì such as this one !
‚Äì where you can participate .
If you choose to take the plunge and become an atheist , I ca n‚Äôt promise that you ‚Äôll never face misunderstanding , hatred , or prejudice .
In fact , depending on where you live and how open you are about it , it ‚Äôs likely that you will .
But I and many others can testify that , in the long run , being true to yourself is far more satisfying than trying to live a lie .
You do n‚Äôt have to shout your nonbelief to the rooftops , but if you ‚Äôre doubting your religion , consider atheism .
You may find it far more fulfilling and liberating than you expect .

‚Äú I strongly urge members of Congress to stand strong in favor of the more than 50 million individuals and families who now lack access to health care , because they have no health insurance of any form .
Health care is a basic right , and the choice of a public or private plan ensures all have access to the type of health care they need ... Consumers ‚Äô choices are dwindling as health insurance premiums soar .
Small businesses , labor unions , and companies with large numbers of retirees struggle to keep the costs of benefits level by increasing employee shares of premiums , deductibles , co-pays and decreasing covered services , especially when there are preexisting medical conditions .
Millions of Americans in need of health care go without proper medical attention , even when they have health insurance .
Our current system of tying health care to a job leaves millions without health care as unemployment rises .
As these uninsured families with children apply to states for their children ‚Äôs health care needs costs to taxpayers escalate .
For those who simply go without , leaving themselves completely vulnerable to catastrophic illnesses or accidents , ultimately , all others pay the price as health care costs rise . "
Now that Dick Cheney has left office he has chosen to become vocal and to opine on issues of the day , presumably as a standard bearer for the ailing Republican Party .
How can he and Rob Portman maintain their oblivion to the tragically large numbers of Americans who are suffering from their previous failure to face the deteriorating circumstances of Americans and their families because of inadequate or no health care ?
In 2007 , the California Nurses Association and the National Nurses Organizing Committee , which represent 80,000 members in 50 states , ran a highly publicized advertisement in support of universal health care .
Its blunt message : ‚Äú If ( Cheney ) were anyone else he ‚Äôd be dead by now . ‚Äù
The advertisement pointed out that Cheney , who has survived four heart attacks and quadruple bypass surgery , benefited from government - financed health care .
‚Äú Our health care system is broken .
Over the last nine years , costs for the average family have doubled even as insurance companies use less and less of premiums for patient care .
We need to provide consumers with real choices to keep costs down and keep insurance companies honest ...
If you like your doctor and you like your insurance , nothing will change for you .
But if you want more options , this bill provides them , while increasing healthy competition that will reduce costs for everyone .
For far too long , insurance companies have been able to set the rules , charge what they like and revoke coverage on the flimsiest of excuses .
The Affordable Health Choices
Act will level the playing field for consumers by providing them with more choices . ‚Äù
No doubt you 've read about Blue America 's Health Care Choice Campaign and later today ( 5 pm , PT ) we 'll be announcing which TV ad got the most votes .
It is n't too late to vote -- just click that link above and view all 3 ads and tell us which one you think will be most effective in helping persuade Conservadem Blanche Lincoln that it 's time to think of the best interests of her constituents -- the working families of Arkansas -- for a change , not the CEOs at the health insurance companies that have funneled so much money into her political career .
I 'm in awe at the number of ads -- on everything from CNN , MSNBC , Fox and ESPN to USA , TNT , the Food Channel and Lifetime -- that will blanket the Little Rock area .
I think we need more spots in Jonesboro though , soconsider adding to our little warchest Meanwhile , it 's looking like the tiny handful of senators who actually see themselves as tribunes of the people -- Sherrod Brown , Sheldon Whitehouse , Jeff Merkley -- are allowing the sworn enemies of working families ( i.e. , the GOP plus the bad Democrats like Baucus , Lincoln , Lieberman , Nelson , Landrieu , all the corrupt , steaming garbage ) -- are allowing themselves to be bamboozled into a weaker reform program in order to satisfy the paid off shills of the insurance companies .
As Ezra Klein pointed out in theyesterday , the new CBO score ( $ 611 billion over the course of a decade ) " is low in part because we 've made some of the policy worse . "
We can thank corrupt shitheads like Lincoln , Baucus , Lieberman and the rest of the senators who are on the Insurance Industry payroll for that .
Anyone who ever votes for any of them deserves exactly what they get from them .
I mean when you have a shill like Kay Hagan now agreeing to vote for the bill , you know there 's got to beplenty wrong with it .
All 13 Democrats on the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee have announced they 're for it .
Presumably the 10 corrupt anti-family Republicans -- Mike Enzi ( WY ) , Judd Gregg ( NH ) , Lamar Alexander ( TN ) , Richard Burr ( Medical - Industrial Complex ) , Johnny Isakson ( GA ) , John McCain ( AZ ) , Orrin Hatch ( UT ) , Lisa Murkowski ( AK ) , Tom Coburn ( OK ) and Pat Roberts ( KS ) -- will all oppose it .
And then there 's the Insurance Industry 's best friend , Max Baucus ' uber - corrupt Senate Finance Committee , which has guaranteed their paymasters that they would kill whatever is beneficial in HELP 's bill .
Burr , Isakson , McCain , Coburn and Murkowski all have to face the voters in 2010 .
Coburn 's voters are as crazy and demonically - possessed as he is and there 's nothing to be done with them at all .
But Isakson , McCain , Burr and Murkowski should all be made to pay the price politically for sticking with the Insurance Industry CEOs and giving the collective finger to the struggling families in their states .
Yesterday one of the best candidates for the Senate running anywhere , Ohio Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , explained to Ohio voters why she is so adamant about a strong and robust public option and why she 's asking all members of the Ohio congressional delegation to " fight for inclusion of a public insurance option rather than bow to pressure from the powerful insurance lobby to keep all payment for universal health care in the hands of private insurers . "
Brunner : She 's running against a left - over Big Business shill from the Bush Regime , Rob Portman , someone who Cheney pointed out this week as a GOP up - and - comer .
He has no position on health care whatsoever .
Brunner pointed out that Cheney and Portman are exactly what has exacerbated the health care crisis in America and that the country needs to move on from their failed policies and catastrophic agenda .
Brunner is n't in the Senate , at least not yet .
Fortunately , Jeff Merkley is -- and a member of the Senate HELP Committee .
He 's a big booster of the Affordable Health Care Choices
Act because it includes , in his words , " a strong , nationwide public health insurance option to lower costs and greatly reduce the number of uninsured Americans . "
He always said that one of the reasons he took on Big Business shill Gordon Smith was to help reform the health care system .
The public option , as he sees it from inside the Committee , will be offered alongside private insurance options in a ‚Äú Health Insurance Gateway , ‚Äù or insurance exchange .
Participation in the public option is completely voluntary , and would assure American families that they will have access to an affordable choice .
Through pooled purchasing power and lower administrative overhead than private insurers , the Community Health Insurance Option will help to lower costs and encourage insurance companies to improve their services .
Merkley : Our campaign looks great in Little Rock , Fayetteville , Ft Smith but it can use some beefing up in Jonesboro and everything south of Pine Bluff .
The good news is that counties like Little River , Drew , Hempstead , Desha , Ashley , Union , Nevada , Calhoun , Clark , Dallas and Lafayette are among the least expensive in the state to saturate .
So , if you want to help us make sure we 're reaching everyone ... this is the place where those $ 5 and $ 10 contributions are going to do some good .
And if you think this is something , we 're just getting started .
Believe me , Medical Industrial Complex servants like Richard Burr ( R- NC ) , Chuck Grassley ( R- IA ) and Jim Bunning ( R - KY ) , all up for re-election next year , and all violently opposed to health care reform , will not be getting off scott free .

Fraud on eBay
I expected selling my computer on eBay to be easy .
Attempt 1 : I listed it .
Within hours , someone bought it ‚Äî from a hacked account , as eBay notified me , cancelling the sale .
Attempt 2 : I listed it again .
Within hours , someone bought it , and asked me to send it to her via FedEx overnight .
The buyer sent payment via PayPal immediately , and then ‚Äî near as I could tell ‚Äî immediately opened a dispute with PayPal so that the funds were put on hold .
And then she sent me an e-mail saying ‚Äú I paid you , now send me the computer . ‚Äù
But PayPal was faster than she expected , I think .
At the same time , I received an e-mail from PayPal saying that I might have received a payment that the account holder did not authorize , and that I should n‚Äôt ship the item until the investigation is complete .
I ‚Äôm willing to make Attempt 3 , if just to see what kind of scam happens this time .
But I still want to sell the computer , and I am pissed off at what is essentially a denial - of - service attack .
The facts from this listing are accurate ; does anyone want it ?
List price is over $ 3 K .
Send me e-mail .
EDITED TO ADD ( 6/19 ) : It ‚Äôs not just me .
EDITED TO ADD ( 6/24 ) :
The computer is sold , to someone who reads my blog .
EDITED TO ADD ( 6/25 ) : I ‚Äôm not entirely sure , but it looks like the payment from the second eBay buyer has gone through PayPal .
I do n‚Äôt trust it ‚Äî just because I can‚Äôt figure out the scam does n‚Äôt mean there is n‚Äôt one .
And , anyway , the computer is sold .
EDITED TO ADD ( 7/3 ) :
For the record : despite articles to the contrary , I was not scammed on eBay .
I was the victim of two scam attempts , both of which I detected and did not fall for .

From Bloomberg : CIT Bond Advisers Said to Push for Bankruptcy After August Swap ( ht Bob_in_MA )
Even if CIT succeeds in getting 90 percent of the $ 1 billion of floating - rate notes due Aug. 17 swapped at a discount , the advisers will seek a so - called pre-packaged bankruptcy ...
Should the CIT offer ... fail , Houlihan ... will recommend the steering committee let CIT file for bankruptcy before paying the August maturity ...
The " Tony Soprano " debt deal was just a delaying tactic .
That appeared clear given the terms .
And this is why the deal required the onerous 5 % upfront fee - and significant overcollaterization - because it was BK if you do , BK if you do n't .
Since Overgrowth mostly takes place outdoors , we put a lot of effort into making the sky look nice .
We 've already talked about the sun placement tools and atmospheric haze , but now I would like to talk about how we achieve smooth transitions between the land and the sky .
Let 's start at the beginning , with the panoramic sky texture :
Here is how that looks when we wrap it around a scene :
As you can see , the bottom half of the sky looks stretched and unrealistic .
It does n't match the terrain at all , so the edge of the terrain is clearly visible .
To make it blend in better , we stretch out the terrain texture onto a large , slightly - indented plane that reaches to the horizon :
Now the scene looks more complete .
However , the horizon still has a harsh line between the land and the sky .
To cover this , we use what I call a ' horizon band ' or ' fog band ' , a fuzzy strip that is colored by a heavily blurred version of the sky texture .
Here is what that looks like by itself .
When we put it all together , it all fits together pretty well , and the process is entirely automated in a fraction of a second !
Here is the final result again :
Here are some other skies using the same technique , to show that it works for a variety of sky types :
This technique allows us to render convincing vistas very efficiently -- in terms of both development time and run-time resources .
Do you have any ideas about how we could make the land and sky fit together even better ?
Racism debate after Russian and Nigerian gas companies combine to form ' Nigaz '
Gazprom has launched a new venture with Nigeria - the unfortunately - named ' Nigaz '
When a $ 2.5 billion international venture is being planned you might expect there to be hours of debate over what to call it .
Yet branding is not the forte of some companies , it seems .
Russian Energy giant Gazprom has inadvertently walked into a racism row with the announcement of its joint venture in Nigeria - Nigaz .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and his Nigerian counterpart Umaru Yar'Adua last week agreed the deal to build refineries , pipelines and gas power stations in Africa 's most populous nation .
The name is meant to be an amalgamation of ' Nigeria ' and ' Gazprom ' , pronounced ' nye - gaz ' , but it can be read phonetically as an offensive term for those of black African origin .
' How more derogatory can it be .
Let 's join forces in making our government rename this , ' said the creator of ' Nigerians No Nigaz ' , a group on Facebook .
Many comments on the blunder were from white bloggers .
But others mocked the mistake - one African - American suggested a playlist of songs from U.S. hip - hop artists for the Nigaz launch party .
One Nigerian in Lagos said : ' White people are making too much of this .
' As long as the Russians pay us , they can call it what they like . '
This animated film about the pesky blackfly is based on the song of the same title , written and sung by Canadian folk singer Wade Hemsworth , with back - up vocals by the McGarrigle sisters .
It recounts Hemsworth 's battles with this quintessential " critter " during a summer of surveying in Northern Ontario .
You heard that right !
What do we want ?
Power .
How do we get it ?
Dynamos !
What we ‚Äôve got here is a public - rental bicycle concept that uses a pretty simple dynamo in the wheel combined with some circuitry in the bike that generates a generous amount of power that ‚Äôs then saved on the bike until it ‚Äôs parked .
Once the bike is returned to its rental spot , parked , hooked up , it provides power to the nearby hybrid bus system !
These bikes are barked in their stalls , locked up right near the public bus station .
This way not only is it easy to transfer power generated by the bikes to the busses , the bikes are easy to access by commuters .
The best part about this is the card .
Your personal ID card allows you to possibly ride the bus for free .
How ?
Generate enough energy !
You gain credit on your card for the amount of energy you ‚Äôve generated on your bike ride .
And you get exercise !
No down side !
Bonus ‚Äì there ‚Äôs also an amazing lock system on the bike .

Bill O'Reilly has been harassing George Tiller , the Kansas abortion doctor murdered at the church where he served as a deacon earlier today , for some time now , both with incendiary rhetoric and by dispatching producers Jesse Watters and Porter Barry to ambush him , his lawyer , and the Governor of Kansas .
O'Reilly began his jihad against Tiller back in 2005 and , according to Salon , Tiller 's been mentioned on 28 separate occasions on his show .
In addition to dubbing him " Tiller the Baby - Killer , " O'Reilly has referred to Tiller 's clinic as a " death mill " and called his work " Nazi stuff " for which he has " blood on his hands . "
On November 3 , 2006 , O'Reilly had women 's rights activist Amy Richards as a guest on his show to discuss Dr. Tiller .
Over the course of the interview , O'Reilly repeated the claim that he had " inside information " and " incontrovertible evidence " that Tiller had been " executing babies about to be born " because the mothers were suffering from depression , which led to rampant specualtion that someone had provided O'Reilly with Tiller 's patient records .
He also made a further quantum leap of logic by saying that because Tiller was performing abortions on young rape victims between the ages of 10 - 15 that he was , in effect , protecting and encouraging rape .
Over the course of the interview Richards remained unflappable despite O'Reilly 's constant badgering , and you can clearly see him growing more and more agitated by the second , eventually blasting Richards , " So you 're okay with this man executing babies about to be born because the woman says she 's depressed ? "
Richards remained remarkably unfazed throughout even after O'Reilly sarcastically remarked , " We 'll let the audience decide who the noble person is here " and then got one last dig in about people like her not caring if babies were being murdered or not .
In July of last year O'Reilly dispatched ace buttboy Jesse Watters , who our John Cook is still hot on the trail of , to ambush Kansas Gov. Katheen Sebelius at a Governor 's Conference in Philadelphia .
The purpose of the " interview " was supposedly to get Sebelius ' opinion of Tiller , noting at the end that Tiller had donated money to her campaign for governor .
In November of 2006 Watters confronted Tiller 's attorney , Pedro Irigonegaray , outside of his law office in another ambush interview .
Then in 2007 , O'Reilly Factor producer Porter Barry caught up with Dr. Tiller himself on his way to work and carried out another ambush interview .
We 've spent a considerable amount of time tonight searching for these videos and have come up empty - handed .
We 're unsure if that 's just a coincidence of if they 've been scrubbed after Tiller 's murder earlier today , but if any of you happen to run across is either of them , please send them along to us .
It will be very interesting to see how O'Reilly handles this whole situation on his show tomorrow .
We 're sure he 'll denounce the violent act against Dr. Tiller and express sympathy for his family , but we doubt anything he says will be enough to pacify the many who will almost certainly claim that O'Reilly is now the one with " blood on his hands . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that police , under certain circumstances , can initiate an interrogation of a suspect without the defendant ‚Äôs lawyer being present .

By a 5 - 4 vote , the conservative majority overruled a 23 - year - old Supreme Court decision that barred the police from initiating questioning after a defendant asserted the right to an attorney at an arraignment or similar proceeding .
The 1986 decision held that once a defendant invoked the right to counsel , only the suspect , and not the police , can initiate the contact .
The ruling was the latest in a recent string by conservative justices expanding the power of police to question suspects , but it does not change the landmark 1966 ruling barring the police from questioning a suspect who invoked the right to remain silent or have a lawyer present .
The decision was a defeat for Jesse Jay Montejo , a Louisiana death row inmate .
He was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of a dry- cleaning operator during a robbery in 2002 .
He initially waived his right to a lawyer and was questioned by the police .
He told several conflicting stories .
Several days later , he appeared in court for a preliminary hearing and a local judge appointed a lawyer to represent Montejo , who could not afford an attorney .
Later that day , police investigators approached Montejo in prison and he again waived his right to a lawyer .
But Montejo later claimed the police had violated his constitutional right to counsel by interrogating him without his lawyer being present and pressuring him to write a letter confessing and apologizing to the victim ‚Äôs wife .
That letter was later introduced as evidence against him at his trial .
The Louisiana Supreme Court and then the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Montejo ‚Äôs appeal .
Writing for the court majority , Justice Antonin Scalia said there was little if any chance a defendant will be badgered into waiving the right to have counsel present during police - initiated questioning .
In overruling the 1986 decision , Scalia said , ‚Äú The considerable adverse effect of this rule upon society ‚Äôs ability to solve crimes and bring criminals to justice far outweighs its capacity to prevent a genuinely coerced agreement to speak without counsel present . ‚Äù
Liberal Justice John Paul Stevens , the author of the 1986 decision , disagreed .
In dissent , Stevens said the dubious benefits of overruling the decision are far outweighed by damage to the rule of law and the integrity of the constitutional right to an attorney .
EMC has extended its offer for Data Domain in a further attempt to outdo rival bidder NetApp .
The cash offer made by EMC in early June was due to expire tonight but it has extended the offer until midnight on 10 July .
In a statement released today Joe Tucci , EMC 's chief executive , said : " EMC's $ 30 ( 18 ) per share all - cash offer remains superior to NetA pp 's stock and cash offer and , very importantly , delivers to Data Domain stockholders the price certainty and price protection its management team and board stated as important priorities during their negotiations with NetApp . "
" We look forward to the execution of the definitive agreement and closing of the transaction with EMC . "
NetApp made an initial deal with Data Domain for 1.5 billion in a mixture of cash and stocks in May this year but EMC upped the offer to 1.8 billion in cash two weeks later .
This led to a bidding war with NetApp raising its offer once again and EMC holding firm that its proposal was superior .
Data Domain released a statement earlier this month confirming it was considering EMC 's offer but it has not made any comment on this extension .
IT PRO also contacted NetA pp but it declined to comment .
This guide should help you get on the way with using Windows 3.1 x in DOSBox .
- DO NOT ASK FOR A COPY OF WINDOWS 3.x Even though Windows 3.x is really old now , it is not freeware .
But cheap copies can sometimes be found on ebay or thrift shops .
- I am not substituting the DOSBox README .
If you have n't worked with DOSBox before and you just want to have a quick Windows 3.x fix , please read the README .
- DON'T mount your actual c:\ drive root as c in DOSBox when you are doing this , or chances are you are going to mess with your regular Windows when you try to install Windows 3.x.
YOU'VE BEEN WARNED !
( never do ' mount c C:\ ' - it 's okay to ' mount c C:\doswin ' )
- DOSBox supports Windows 3.x since DOSBox version 0.65 , but the latest version is recommended for enjoying Windows 3.x on DOSBox .
----- Graphics / Video drivers -----
By default DOSBox emulates a S3 graphics card , for running Windows 3.x you will need to download the S3 drivers at https://www.dropbox.com/s/w3o4v5e7alm1zg5/s3drivers.zip?dl=1 ( version 1.70.04 ) .
With these drivers you can run Windows at 1024x768 with 64 k colours ( large or small fonts ) .
DOSBox can also emulate three other graphics cards ( among others ) which can be used with Windows 3.x .
To use those you need to change the machine setting in dosbox .conf .
You can use the following " graphics cards " :
- Tseng 3000 ( machine=svga_et3000 ) , download the drivers from https://www.dropbox.com/s/48on8o3004uujt1/et4win31.zip?dl=1
- Tseng 4000 ( machine=svga_et4000 ) , download the drivers from https://www.dropbox.com/s/au1z5t2ypj6mvj2/ET40001.zip?dl=1
- Paradise graphics card , download the drivers from https://www.dropbox.com/s/c5fw2a4cglo8w0f/paradise.zip?dl=1
You can also choose the generic SVGA drivers that come with Windows 3.1 x .
I advise to use the generic VGA driver on Windows setup and change to the S3 ( or other " cards " ) afterwards .
----- other drivers -----
- Soundblaster drivers can be found at http://www.soundblaster.com
( or you can download the package that worked for me so far at https://www.dropbox.com/s/0ve3ohhtks0wrnf/SB16W3x.zip?dl=1)
Best use this driver , other drivers may not work correctly .
- for Joystick support download and install https://www.dropbox.com/s/e4c8jpwldxjv6zj/IBMJOY.zip?dl=1
- Win32s ( Win32 Subset ) 1.30 c can be downloaded at https://www.dropbox.com/s/jhhac2b5lmv046f/Win32s.zip?dl=1
it is not necessary , but interesting üòÄ
Lets some few 32 - bit programs run on Windows 3.1 x .
Comes with Freecell .
- VfW Video for Windows 3.1 x at https://www.dropbox.com/s/7nz3ohvc16gg68q/VFW11E.zip?dl=1

- Quicktime seems to work best when you install Quicktime 2.1.2 .
Also note that DOSBox 0.74 and earlier releases did n't handle CD - ROMs well that have both the Windows and Mac version on it .
You will need to either wait for the next release of DOSBox or download and install a SVN built .
- a site with downloads , tips and tricks to Windows 3.1x : http://www.win31.de/eindex.htm
-----Installation-----
Windows 3.1 , 3.11 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11 run ok in DOSBox when running from a mounted folder and that 's what I 'm advising .
For actually installing Windows 3.1x , I did copy all of the files from the original 3.5 " floppies into a folder called win31 and installed from that .
Some generic instructions :
On your computer make a folder called " C:/ doswin " .
Copy all the files on your Windows 3.1 x floppies to " C:\doswin\win31 " .
Extract the drivers to " C:\doswin\drivers \ " ( for example the S3 drivers to " c:\doswin\drivers\s3 " or " C:\doswin\drivers\tseng " for the Tseng drivers ) .
Start DOSBox .
At the prompt enter :
mount c c:\doswin
c :
cd c:\win31
setup.exe
And off you go .
The settings that setup chooses should be ok and left at default .
If you want to have control over which programs get installed with Windows choose the " Customized Setup " and not the " Express Setup " .
When Windows asks which printer to install , choose the generic / text printer .
When Setup finishes and offers you to either reboot or return to dos , you can either choose return to dos AND then close DOSBox or you can just skip the return part close DOSBox right away .
Before you start DOSBox again to test Windows 3.x I recommend editing dosbox .conf to make it easier to work with Windows 3.x .
Edit the end of dosbox .
conf like this :
Copy code to clipboard 1 [ autoexec ]
2 # Lines in this section will be run at startup .
3 mount c c:\doswin
4 c :
5 SET PATH=%PATH %;C:\WINDOWS ;
6 SET TEMP=C : \WINDOWS \TEMP
Now to install the S3 graphics driver , start DOSBox again , type
cd windows
setup
You get a screen similar to the initial setup of Windows 3.x. Scroll up to the Display driver and hit enter .
Now scroll all the way down to " Other ( requires disk .... ) " and hit enter again .
Enter the path to the S3 drivers " c:\drivers\s3 " and hit enter .
You can now choose on of the S3 drivers .
The highest working resolution is 1024x768 at 64 k colors .
For playing games a much lower resolution is enough .
Some can't even handle more than 256 colors and will look odd .
After installation of the driver you can start Windows by entering " win " .
To install the Soundblaster driver , exit Windows 3.x again .
At the prompt type
cd c:\drivers\sb16w3x
install
This pretty much runs on its own , just make sure
- that the path to Windows is correct ( c : \Windows )
- that the interrupt setting is correct .
The installer wants to use Interrupt 5 by default , but DOSBox uses 7 by default , so change that .
- to let the installer overwrite files if it want to .
When the installer asks whether you want to load Dos drivers select " No " since DOSBox wo n't use those drivers in any way .
After the installer finishes you can run Windows right away , no need to " reboot " .
NOTE : Best use the driver I link to .
Other drivers may give you headaches .
To install the joystick driver you have to have started Windows .
Open the main group in Program Manager and start Control Panel .
In Control Panel start Drivers .
Click on " Add... " , select " Unlisted or Updated Driver " , in the next dialog enter " c:\drivers\ibmjoy\ " as the location of the driver .
The next dialog lets you install " Driver for Joystick " and then asks you whether you want to setup the driver for " one or two 2 - Dimensional " or a " single 3 - Dimensional Joystick " .
I recommend using the first option .
It seems that most games will recognize if the joystick has four buttons , even though the IBM joystick control panel shows only two working buttons .
The latter option is only advisable if you use a joystick with a throttle .
You need to restart Windows after this .
My advice for using the joystick with Windows 3.1 x games is to edit dosbox .conf again and in the [ joystick ] section set the option
timed=false
One game ( Microsoft Fury¬≥ ) gave me problems with timed enabled .
If you have calibrating problems , change this again .
Also take not that most games require you to calibrate the joystick again , after a Windows 3.x restart .
-----Troubleshooting -----
- to change graphics drivers , I 'd advise exiting Windows 3.x and then change directory to the Windows directory ( cd windows ) and run setup.exe .
But beware !
Windows 3.x does n't like it when you change drivers too often and then Setup crashes when you want to load other video drivers .
In this case , got the Windows 3.x system directory ( \windows\system ) and get rid of the " oemX.inf " files ( for example " oem0.inf " or " oem1.inf " ) you do n't need .
- In some applications the font looks strange .
It seems to get better if you install * any * printer in Windows 3.x ( no matter that you can't use it ) .
Some of you might remember that Windows 3.x did n't let you use most fonts unless you did that back in the days üòÄ
- When you mount a floppy drive to a :\ it does n't show in the Windows file manager and in the " run " dialog you can't select it either .
But you can enter the path ( for example " a:\setup.exe " ) and it works ok .
When you do n't have anything mounted to a :\ the a:\ drive shows up in Windows 3.1 x .
Strange but true .
- When you choose the Tseng drivers when you install Windows , the mouse pointer might not be visible .
To fix this go back to the DOSBox prompt , change dir to the Windows directory ( " cd windows " ) , run setup again and then choose the VGA or SVGA drivers that come with Windows 3.1 x .
Start Windows again ( your mouse pointer should be visible now ) and then run setup from inside Windows to choose the Tseng drivers .
- 32 - bit file and disk access does n't work in DOSBox
Here is an article that gives a lot of information on how 32 - bit disk access worked ( and that explains why it does n't in DOSBox ) .

- Windows programs that rely on share .exe or the later Windows 3.x driver vshare .386 will crash on starting with an error message that share .
exe has not been loaded .
This affects mostly office programs , e.g. Microsoft Office , Works , Publisher , Lotus Office programs ...
DOSBox is not emulating something that is needed for share .
exe or vshare .386 to correctly work and since it is n't needed for games chances are slim that this will ever be emulated .
HOWEVER there are two workarounds .
1. Run Windows 3.x on a boot image ( see below on how to ) , this is the safe way since when you boot an image in DOSBox the needed functionality is working .
2. Download and run fakeshar https://www.dropbox.com/s/ewd6rf8vndqs5b0/fakeshar.zip?dl=1 before starting Windows in DOSBox .
THIS IS NOT SAFE since it only fakes that share is running even though it does n't .
When you insist on actually working with the affected programs in Windows you will experience data loss .
-----Running Windows 3.x on a boot image -----
You can also mount an image , boot from that , install Dos and then install Windows on that .
The guide on boot images is at Sample usage of a harddisc image in DOSBOX , when you are done with that , use Disk Explorer ( link is in the guide ) to copy the install folders to the image , boot from the image ( see the guise again ) and begin installing .
In dosbox .conf both xms and ems must be set to false .
For most uses a boot image is not worth the hassle , though .
One of my registered shareware games ( Inner Space ) only installs as registered version on a boot image , so if all else fails a boot image install might be the last resort .
Another Problem with using a boot image is that you can only use mounted images not mounted real drives ( floppy , cd-rom ) .
Note 1 : using an image is mostly overkill now for running Windows 3.11
Note 2 : Share and 32 bit disk and file access works when you boot from an image
-----Mirrors-----
See Dosfreaks first post for mirrors of the drivers and the utilities .

P.S. : If you think that Windows95 might work as easily and good , you are wrong üòÄ
Edit : mentioned Ian 's soundblaster driver guide and another boot image problem / shortcoming .
Edit : Mentioned problems with mouse when setting up Windows from the start with the Tseng drivers .
Edit : Little adjustment for the 0.65 version
Edit : Uploaded drivers and other useful stuff to badongo.com .
Those files were uploaded by me and * should * be okay .
Edit : did some layouting
Edit :
The guide is now for the upcoming DOSBox 0.70 but I kept the 0.65 specific instructions
Edit : SET PATH= does not like spaces , so SET PATH= %PATH %;C:\WINDOWS ; works .
SET PATH=%PATH % ; C: \WINDOWS does NOT üòÄ
Edit : fixed joystick driver section
Edit : deleted 0.65 instructions
Edit : updated the guide since Vasyls patches have been integrated ages ago , removed Ian 's soundblaster drivers installation guide since it was n't necesary for quite some time now .
Fixed download links and put the files and guide pictures onto a dropbox account .
Added the share issue and two workarounds to Troubleshooting .
Added little mirror message
Edit : added a note about Quicktime and uploaded the 2.1.2 version of it to the dropbox account .
Linked to the 32bit disk access article that Dosfreak posted .
Share / 32 bit disk / file access works when you boot from an image .
Edit : Reshuffled stuff a bit ( quicktime moved up to the other drivers ) , S3 driver version number
Edit : Dropbox disabled their public folder and thus the guide was left without pictures and downloads
With all of the shoot - 'em - ups out there , it can be tough to find one that does something new and interesting .
After a few decades of existence , the genre has pretty much seen it all .
But 24 Caret Games is trying to bring something unique to shmup fans out there , with an upcoming PlayStation Network game called Retro / Grade that is played entirely in reverse .
It sounds a little bit confusing , and the best way to get an idea of how Retro / Grade plays is to watch the debut trailer ( below ) .
Players have to avoid enemy shots as they go back into their weapons , and get in front of their own shots that have been fired in the past .
Yeah , watch the video .
As you can see , while it has the appearance of a shooter , things play out a lot like a rhythm game , with a strong focus on timing .
This has n't escaped the notice of 24 Caret , who has included support for guitar controllers .
Plus , the game will feature an original retro- themed soundtrack .
Unfortunately , the game is n't expected to hit the PSN until sometime next year , and no price has been set yet .
But if the video did n't give you a clear enough picture of how Retro / Grade plays , there is currently a PC demo available for download , which does a great job of showing how the game actually works .
Any customers with queries are advised to contact their local store
Allied Carpets has gone into administration , as the stagnating housing market led to a fall in demand for carpets and flooring .
But 51 of its 217 stores and its insurance inspection business have been sold immediately , saving 400 jobs , administrator BDO Stoy Hayward said .
All stores are trading normally and outstanding customer orders will be fulfilled in all stores , it said .
Deposits are safe but anyone with queries should contact a local store .
All staff wages will be paid on the normal payment dates , the administrators said .
About 1,100 staff work in the stores that have gone into administration .
Falling sales
Dermot Power , business restructuring partner at BDO , said that , like many companies , Allied Carpets had suffered in difficult trading conditions .
" The stagnation of the housing market has meant that fewer people are buying carpets and flooring , " he said .
" We are currently working to secure a going - concern sale of the remaining stores in the Allied Carpets portfolio . "
Allied Carpets is the second biggest carpet retailer in the UK , behind Carpetright .
BDO sold the 51 stores and the Allied Carpets brand to a new firm , Allied Carpets Retail Limited , set up by Allied chief executive Clive Hutchings .
Allied is not alone in having seen sales slump as demand for big - ticket homeware goods has fallen in the recession .
Last month , rival Carpetright reported a 72 % drop in profits after sales fell 7.4 % compared with the previous year .
The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) show that sales in the last two months have seen the biggest declines since the ONS started keeping records in 1988 .
According to the most recent figures , sales from household goods stores in the three months to May fell 7.3 % compared with a year earlier .

Two of the astronauts who took part in the first Moon landing 40 years ago have called for renewed efforts to send a manned mission to Mars .
At a rare public reunion of the Apollo 11 crew , Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins said Mars instead of the Moon should be the focus of exploration .
Neil Armstrong , the first man on the Moon , said the race to get to the Moon had been the ultimate peaceful contest .
He said it was an " exceptional national investment " for the US and ex-USSR .
The trio spoke at an event at Washington DC's National Air and Space Museum to mark the 40th anniversary of their mission .
Sometimes I think I flew to the wrong place .
Mars was always my favourite as a kid and it still is today
Michael Collins
Apollo 11 crew
They are due to meet President Obama at the White House on Monday .
Mr Armstrong told the audience : " It was the ultimate peaceful competition : USA vs USSR .
" I 'll not assert that it was a diversion which prevented a war , nevertheless it was a diversion .
" Eventually , it provided a mechanism for engendering co-operation between former adversaries .
In that sense , among others , it was an exceptional national investment for both sides . "
Fellow astronaut Mr Aldrin spoke of the inspiration provided by then - President John F Kennedy which led to the " betterment of America , and ultimately the ending of the Cold War " .
" Apollo 11 is a symbol of what a great nation and a great people can do if we work hard , work together and have strong leaders with vision and determination , " he said .
HAVE YOUR SAY Man's first crossing to the Red Planet should be undertaken as a team effort Yvonne Miranthis , Cyprus But he also pushed for a mission to Mars : " The best way to honour and remember all those who were part of the Apollo programme is to follow in our footsteps ; to boldly go again on a new mission of exploration . "
Mr Collins , who circled the Moon alone while Mr Armstrong and Mr Aldrin walked on it , said Mars was more interesting than the Moon .
" Sometimes I think I flew to the wrong place .
Mars was always my favourite as a kid and it still is today . "
He urged further exploration , saying : " I worry that the current emphasis on returning to the Moon will cause us to become ensnared in a technological briar patch needlessly delaying for decades the exploration of Mars - a much more worthwhile destination . "
Other Nasa astronauts gave a news conference at Nasa headquarters in Washington DC on Monday .
Eugene Cernan , who was the last astronaut to step off the Moon , concurred with the Apollo 11 astronauts urging a new focus on Mars .
My glass has been half empty for three decades at least .
Hopefully , we can turn that around because what we did then is do - able again
Eugene Cernan , former Nasa astronaut " We need to go back to the Moon , we need to learn a little bit more about what we think we know already , we need to establish bases , put new telescopes there , get prepared to go to Mars .
The ultimate goal , truly , is to go to Mars , " he told journalists .
Mr Cernan said that when he came back from the Moon in 1972 , he believed that Nasa would mount a return mission to the lunar surface by 1980 and a manned mission to Mars by the turn of the century .
" My glass has been half empty for three decades at least .
Hopefully , we can turn that around because what we did then is do - able again , " he said .
" I think the next major goal is not to spend three days , or three weeks or three months on the Moon , but to have you folks , or your kids , or your grand - kids sit here and talk to a group of guys who can tell you what it was like to go to Mars . "
Buzz Aldrin said the Moon should not be used as a testing ground for Mars But Mr Aldrin disagreed with the view that astronauts should test capabilities for a long - duration flight on the Moon before attempting a journey to Mars .
" Why go to the most difficult place to do that ?
Why not do it on the International Space Station , " he said .
Mr Aldrin added : " One day , we are going to send some people to the surface of Mars .
And if we think we 're going to send them there for a year - and - a - half and then bring them back , and then send another group there for a year - and - a - half and bring them back , Washington will find another way to spend that money .
" That 's unless we have declared our objective is an increasing , permanent space settlement . "
The US space agency 's currently stated aim is to return astronauts to the Moon by 2020 .
But that vision is under review , along with the space vehicles that would get them there .
Nasa is due to retire its space shuttles next year and replace them with the Orion spacecraft , an Apollo - like capsule that would launch on a new rocket called Ares 1 .
Another rocket , Ares V , would have the capability to launch heavy payloads - service and cargo modules - that would be needed to service Moon missions .

She took the box and promised to put it in the crew ‚Äôs refrigerator .
He advised her that he was holding her personally responsible for them staying frozen , mentioning in a very haughty manner that he was a lawyer , and proceeded to rant at her about what would happen if she let them thaw out .
Needless to say , she was annoyed by his behavior .
Shortly before landing in New York , she used the intercom to announce to the entire cabin , " Would the gentleman who gave me the crabs in New Orleans , please raise your hand ? "
Not one hand went up ‚Ä¶ so she took them home and ate them .
Two lessons here :
1. Lawyers are n‚Äôt as smart as they think they are .
2. Blonds are n‚Äôt as dumb as most folks think .
Buzz is generated during E3 when writers hang out between meetings , or in dark corners of rented - out clubs drinking free drinks and discussing the day 's games .
One title kept coming up in conversation this year : Scribblenauts .
Everyone repeated that this was a game that had to be played , one that was going to make waves in the industry .
The game was being shown in the back of Warner Bros . ' booth at the show , and always enjoyed a large crowd .
We caught up with Jeremiah Slaczka , the co-founder and creative director of 5TH Cell , to talk about what made the game so special .
The game is a puzzle title where you type in the name of objects to use to achieve your goals , and that 's where the creativity comes in .
To get a cat from a tree you can type in " catfood " and entice it to jump down .
You can type in " giraffe " and have the kitty jump onto the animal 's head and slide down its neck .
You can type " trampoline " to jump up and grab it yourself .
This is just scratching the surface of the insanity of the game , and Slaczka was evasive when we asked for an idea of how many objects were included in the game .
" More than you 'll ever be able to use ! " he told Ars .
" The core rules are nothing copyrighted or trademarked , nothing vulgar , and nothing proper , " he went on to explain .
" Although we did bend the rules with some well - known individuals like Santa Claus and Einstein . "
You wo n't be able to type in " Pepsi , " for instance , but " soda " would work fine .
This type of expansive gameplay does n't come easy , nor is it easy to produce .
" The core team for Scribblenauts was around 15 , plus outsourced help , " Slaczka said .
" We had five people , over about six months , research and come up with the tens of thousands of words present on the Scribblenauts dictionary .
Word content was updated in Microsoft Excel , and imported and tracked using custom tools . "
Just think about that for a while : before the game amazed those of us who tried to " break " it by guessing items that may not be included , there was a team of people whose only job was to come up with items that people may want to use to solve the puzzles , code them in , and then code in the seemingly endless amounts of interactions .
It 's not enough to include an idea of what can be done with a blanket ; you have to understand what that blanket would do when matched with every other item in the game .
The trick is to believe in the idea , and move slowly
" The complete game does n‚Äôt usually come to me at once , it takes time , and over that period of time I ‚Äôm fleshing out the idea in my head , " Slaczka told Ars .
" Once I feel the idea is worth pursuing , I generally involve our Technical Director , and start to jot down aspects of the idea on paper . "
Scribblenauts was completely self - funded , meaning 5th Cell had the freedom to create the game they wanted .
" We focused on tools first , spending several months just laying the framework for the product .
Our core tool , Objectnaut , controls the behaviors and properties of all Objects .
There were some cases that we refined in code ( aka brute force ) , but for the most part we followed the original design , which called for a completely data - driven hierarchical object system . "
This game was begging to be shared , and of course the more people that played it , the more words and objects they had to add to the game .
" Once the core systems were in place , we built the Tree Level , and let people at it .
From day one , everyone was amazed at seeing what they write appear , and it helped us find some obvious words we missed . "
With such a high - concept game , 5th Cell made sure that testing was used only to make the experience better , not change what made the game so special .
" Focus testing is valuable to us , but we reject the concept of focus testing an idea into existence , " he explained .
" If I ‚Äôm happy with a concept , we ‚Äôll develop it until the point where we ‚Äôre comfortable with receiving feedback .
At that point , we get it out to a mix of friends and strangers , and see if there are overriding issues that occur .
We then tweak the game to be accessible to as many users as possible . "
For now , only on the DS
With the game enjoying such a high level of interest , the question of ports was inevitable .
" Right now , we are focused on bringing Scribblenauts to the DS .
We designed the game specifically for this system because we want it to be fun for all types of gamers ‚Äî and the touch screen and stylus makes it easy and intuitive for anyone to pick up and play , " Slaczka said .
" If we look at other systems , it wo n‚Äôt be for a while . "
It does n't hurt that the DS is relatively inexpensive to develop for , and remains one of the most popular systems around the world .
It 's impossible to play Scribblenauts and not have a huge smile on your face due to the sheer number of items included in the game , and the creativity involved in playing .
Some levels feel almost like a gentle IQ test ... anyone can think of one or two ways to do the simpler tasks , but coming up with something off the wall takes wits .
The hype and post - E3 awards are well - earned : this is one of the few games at the show that truly brought something new to gaming .
We 'll wait until we have the full game to offer our final verdict , but after playing the game at E3 and talking to one of the minds behind the project , we 're very optimistic about this game .
Scribblenauts is coming to the Nintendo DS this September .
If the S&P 500 is n't enough for you , maybe you just need to juice it up .
ProFunds Group is expanding its already massive portfolio of ProShares exchange - traded funds , including yesterday 's debut of UltraPro S&P500 ( NYSE : UPRO ) .
The ETF aims to deliver 300 % of the S&P 500's daily gains .
But cheer up , bears : UltraPro Short S&P500 ( NYSE : SPXU ) targets triple the daily results of shorting the same index .
If this sounds like the kind of high - octane pizzazz that your portfolio is longing for , do the math .
These ETFs - on - steroids that hit the market may sound great in theory , but reality has n't been kind to them .
ProShares already has a pair of ETFs that promise to double the daily performance of the S&P 500 .
How are they holding up against the SPDR Trust ( NYSE : SPY ) , which simply mirrors the popular index ?
2009 Return SPDR Trust 2.0 % Ultra S&P 500 ( NYSE : SSO ) ( 0.5 % ) UltraShort S&P 500 ( NYSE : SDS ) ( 22.1 % )
Returns exclude dividends .
See the problem ?
The doubled - up long fund has n't delivered a 4 % gain year to date .
The jacked - up short fund is off by far more than 4 % .
These vehicles may be great for nailing a single day 's return , or occasionally landing within the ballpark of an entire week 's run .
But they can be catastrophic over the long haul , particularly if they get whipsawed during volatile markets .
Go figure :
These magnets of speculation can ironically crumble at the first signs of volatility .
Need a little more proof ?
Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3 x Shares ( NYSE : FAS ) and Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3 x Shares ( NYSE : FAZ ) play both sides of the financial - service stocks within the Russell 1000 index -- they swing for 300 % of the movements .
At least one of them has to be a big winner in this roller - coaster market for banking stocks , right ?
Wrong .
The bullish fund is trading 64.6 % lower than it was when the year began .
If you think that 's bad , the bearish fund is off by a whopping 86.5 % .
If you 're a speculator looking for a day - trade gamble , these may be your lottery tickets .
However , if you 're a serious long - term investor , you do n't want to get anywhere near these funds .
The numbers say it all .
You 'll triple your trouble before you triple the market 's returns .
Some other reads that may double -- or triple -- your ETF knowhow :
The App Store approval process has always been mysterious , slightly ridiculous and mildly infuriating .
But with the summary execution of Google Latitude as well as every Google Voice app , it 's finally gone too far .
Advertisement
Until this past week , Google 's been the most privileged developer for the iPhone outside of Apple itself .
I mean , Google Maps and YouTube come baked into the phone .
Hell , Google even gave the iPhone voice search ‚Äî a more powerful version , no less ‚Äî before it delivered the feature to its own OS , very obviously using private APIs that would 've likely resulted in a swift kick in the ass for any other developer .
Yet here we are , Apple has rejected not one , but two Google apps that would deliver major new features to the iPhone , for reasons that are so obviously tripe it 's insulting to even our non-exceptional intelligence .
A Google Latitude app would confuse us ?
Really ?
Because it would " use Google to serve maps tiles " ?
Wait .
Is n't one of iPhone 3.0 's major new features that it can use Google Maps inside of other applications ?
So like every app can use Google to serve maps tiles .
I admit , though , Latitude is a really big word .
What does it even mean ?
That is pretty confusing .
Maybe they should call it , like , Google Stalker .

What happened with Google Voice is worse .
Google did n't elaborate on the reason Apple gave for rejecting its official Google Voice app six weeks ago ‚Äî and presumably , Google had more success wringing it out of Apple than most developers .
Hours before Google broke the news , the developer of GV Mobile ‚Äî a solid third - party app for Google Voice ‚Äî said that it was being pulled from the App Store for " duplicating iPhone features . "
Then every other Google Voice application was silently killed too .
Even though , reportedly , Apple 's Phil Schiller personally apologized when GV Mobile initially ran into problems getting approved months ago , and it'd been sitting pretty in the store since then .
Oh , and there are tons of other apps that duplicate the functions of dialing and sending text messages .
John Gruber at Daring Fireball says Google Voice was nuked by AT&T , " it 's that simple . "
It 's not the first time AT&T 's put a hit on apps : NetShare , the tethering app was yanked ( though it clearly never should 've been approved in the first place ) , and Skype and SlingPlayer streaming were crippled so that they only worked over Wi-Fi .
The difference between those situations and this one is that in those cases , there was , at least nominally , a greater good for users :
Limiting those apps protected people from the possibility of AT&T 's fragile , already busted - ass network completely collapsing under the weight of millions of phones streaming tons of data .
And , you can still actually use Skype and Sling apps , albeit in a slightly constrained manner .
Advertisement
Google Voice , on the other hand , poses no such mortal danger to the network .
It only uses a tiny bit of data at the very beginning of a call to set it up , and text messages sent through the service would be infinitesimally small scraps of data ( not to mention , there are other immensely popular apps that already send text messages as data ) .
You still use your AT&T voice minutes when you 're on a call using Google Voice .
And , for whatever reason , AT&T 's fear is about Google Voice on the iPhone , since the app is available for BlackBerry on their network .

The situation crystallizes our worst fears about Apple 's dictatorial App Store .
Users are n't being protected from bad things or from themselves here .
Even though it seemed ridiculous to us , when apps with objectionable content were blocked or booted before the ratings system was in place , it was in the interest of some paradoxically lazy but over - protective parent somewhere out there .
But the only thing being guarded is some ephemeral long - term interest of AT&T against the devaluation of phone numbers and the ability to easily use any phone at will .
( FWIW , AT&T says " AT&T is not involved in the approval process , so we can't speak to this issue . " )
Not only is Apple hurting users in the service of AT&T by denying them innovative new features , they wo n't even bother to come up with a good excuse .
If they 're going to lie about it , they could at least make the rationale believable .
To truly get a sense of the chickenshittniess on Apple 's part , Just read this account of the conversation VoiceCentral 's developer had with Apple when they were told their app was going to be pulled from the store .
It 'd be hilarious if it did n't mean a developer got screwed .

It 's obvious Google 's not happy about it either ‚Äî and not just because Google exec Marissa Mayer 's deleted tweet pointing to a satire piece about Google deleting Apple from its search results , since it " duplicates a lot of the functionality of other sites . "
If everything was copacetic Google would n't tell the world Apple shut down their applications .
( And if the alternative web apps were all that great , Google would n't make native apps to begin with . )
Whatever the causes , there is now definitely a rift between Apple and Google .
It 's a sobering reminder of what Apple 's total control over the iPhone platform really means .
For the first time , it 's denying people exciting new features and possibilities , without even a semblance of benefit or concern for users .
Maybe it's a catfight with Google .
Maybe AT&T finally found a clause in its contract that did n't make them Apple 's bitch .
Either way , it 's just depressing .

A year after we said we still need the iPhone app black market , nothing 's changed .
To wit , GV Mobile 's available on Cydia right now .
We know the App Store is Apple 's exclusive domain , and playing in their space has its tradeoffs , but the implicit trust is that whatever Apple does that might seem ridiculous or weird , it 's ultimately trying to create a better experience for users .
That 's just not the case here , taking the App Store approval process beyond cryptic and infuriating into something that 's actually toxic for users .
Since it 's crossed that line , our App Disapproval Watch starts now ‚Äî it ends when Apple finally cuts this crap out .

The Gaia torus is complete
28 July 2009
The 3 - metre diameter , quasi-octagonal torus , which will support the two Gaia telescopes and the focal plane assembly , is composed of 17 individual custom - built Silicon Carbide segments .
Construction of the individual segments began 15 months ago at BOOSTEC .
In the intervening period the individual segments have been milled , sintered and lapped .
Each element has been subject to stringent quality checks and has undergone static - proof tests to confirm the mechanical integrity of the pieces .
( See " Constructing the Gaia torus " for further details . )
The scientific requirements of the mission ( for example , astrometric measurements accurate to 24 microarcsec ( at V= 15 magnitude ) ) translate to a requirement for a payload platform that is mechanically and thermally ultra stable .
For these reasons all elements of the torus are constructed from Silicon Carbide ( SiC ) , a ceramic material whose physical characteristics make it the material of choice for structures which must be both light - weight and robust .
The low thermal expansion coefficient and high thermal conductivity of SiC mean that it is a very stable material which can quickly dissipate thermal gradients , and with a Young ‚Äôs Modulus of about 420 GPa it is twice as stiff as steel .
Starting on 28 April the torus began to take shape as the individual elements were assembled together and precision aligned using laser trackers and reference points on the torus segments .
A special braze paste was applied to the interface points between each of the segments ( Figure 3 ) .
When heated above 1000 ¬∞C this paste melts and seals the joints by capillary action - the torus then becomes one complete unit .
The completed torus was placed in the brazing furnace at BOOSTEC on Wednesday 24 June and remained there until the morning of Monday 29 June .
After a cooling - down period the torus was removed from the furnace and moved to the laboratories for post - brazing quality control .
This included a thorough visual inspection of external and internal surfaces ‚Äì the latter by means of borescopes - and ultrasonic inspection to confirm the integrity of the structure .
( The furnace at BOOSTEC was built for brazing the Herschel 3.5 - metre diameter primary mirror , and has also been used for the optical bench for the JWST NIRSPEC instrument . )
Once the torus will be delivered to EADS Astrium , the Gaia prime contractor , at Toulouse , the assembly of the Payload Module , including the torus and mirrors , will next begin .
In honor of the passing of Gidget the Taco Bell Chihuahua yesterday , we 've compiled a tribute to the commercial achievements of our favorite animal thespians , from Morris the Cat 's unsuccessful presidential bid to the duck that 's torturing Ben Affleck .
Advertisement
R.I.P. Gidget Gidget , who rose to fame as the " Taco Bell Chihuahua , " has died at 15 .
The cause was a stroke , says Read more
Though Gidget 's Taco Bell commercials only ran from 1997 to 2000 , her work inspired numerous catch - phrases that raised the nation 's spirits during Monica - gate .
Gidget went on to give an unforgettable performance in Legally Blonde 2 : Red , White , and Blonde as Bruiser 's mom , but this Viva Gorditas commercial best captures the mix of strength and pathos that she brought to every role :
In this groundbreaking 1960s commercial Mr. Ed , one of the earliest spokesanimals , informs his owner that his horseback riding days are over .
Mr. Ed has already gone for a test drive in a Studebaker , and from now on he 'll be doing the driving .
Obviously , Mr. Ed's message did n't reach these Clydesdales .
A decade later they 're still hauling around shipments of crappy beer at Ed McMahon 's request .
But some commercial critters had it better than others .
9 Lives spokescat Morris rose to fame in the ' 70s and even starred in the 1973 film Shamus opposite Burt Reynolds .
In the ' 80s , he ran for president against fellow actor Ronald Reagan , but lost when Americans got a look at his cabinet proposals in the commercial below .
Spuds MacKenzie 's career as the " ultimate party animal " was marred by the discovery that he was actually played by a female dog named Honey Tree Evil Eye .
But nothing can diminish his performance in the 1988 Olympics .
Despite his lack of opposable thumbs , Spuds took home the gold in pole vaulting as the " Spudettes " cheered him on .
The Aflac Duck is smart enough to compare various insurance policies , but his biggest achievement is being the bane of Ben Affleck 's existence .
Ben has said that after these commercials aired people started walking up to him and screaming " Aflac " all the time .
Duke from the Bush 's Baked Beans commercials seems pretty intelligent too , as he has taught himself to talk .
But if he 's so smart why does he live with an adult man who uses a baked bean bedspread ?
Technically David Duchovny does n't qualify for this list , but he deserves an honorable mention for his voiceover work in the Pedigree commercials .
Even though for years , talking about dog food was the only post - X - Files work he could find , he demonstrated an utter lack of shame .
We'd be happy to rub your belly , Mulder .
Toby may not be that well known yet , but every time we see the mom in this Stanley Steemer commercial roll her eyes and ignore her child , we can't help but applaud Toby 's new trick .
Earlier : R.I.P. Gidget
We ‚Äôve known for years that the Bush administration ignored and broke the law repeatedly in the name of national security .
It is now clear that many of those programs could have been conducted just as easily within the law ¬ó perhaps more effectively and certainly with far less damage to the justice system and to Americans ‚Äô faith in their government .
That is the inescapable conclusion from a devastating report by the inspectors general of the intelligence and law - enforcement community on President George W. Bush ‚Äôs warrantless wiretapping program .
The report shows that the longstanding requirement that the government obtain a warrant was not hindering efforts to gather intelligence on terrorists after the 9/11 attacks .
In fact , the argument that the law was an impediment was concocted by White House and Justice Department lawyers after Mr. Bush authorized spying on Americans ‚Äô international communications .
We know less , so far , about the Bush administration ‚Äôs plan to send covert paramilitary teams to assassinate Al Qaeda leaders .
But what is overwhelmingly clear is that there was no legal or rational justification for Vice President Dick Cheney ‚Äôs order to conceal the program from Congress .
The plan was never put into effect , apparently because it was unworkable .
But it ‚Äôs hard to imagine Congress balking at killing terrorists .
So why break the law , again and again ?
Two things seem disturbingly clear .
First , President Bush and his top aides panicked after the Sept. 11 attacks .
And second , Mr. Cheney and his ideologues , who had long chafed at any legal constraints on executive power , preyed on that panic to advance their agenda .
Virgin Mobile unveiled a mobile broadband plan earlier this week that 's surprising in its rarity : prepaid broadband in increments of 100MB , 250MB , 600MB , and 1GB .
The plan requires a $ 150 Broadband2 Go USB dongle , which will only be available at Best Buy .
Only drivers for Windows XP and Vista were announced .
The service requires no contract commitment .
A 10 - day , 100 MB plan is $ 10 ; all other plans last 30 days and cost $ 20 for 250 MB , $ 40 for 600MB , and $ 60 for 1GB .
While these prices are steep relative to the amount of bandwidth offered , the lack of contract commitment may make this an affordable option for a regular , but not constant , traveler who needs ubiquitous access .
All four major US cell carriers offer bandwidth - capped monthly service plans that require a 2 - year contract , and cost $ 60 per month for a maximum of 5 GB of use .
Some carriers allow overages , typically at $ 50 / GB billed in MB increments .
Early cancellation comes with some hefty fees .
Verizon Wireless offers the only moderately comparable offering , a $ 15 one - day pass with no specific data limits noted .
Customers have to supply a Verizon network modem , such as one built into certain laptops or purchased separately at full price .
Virgin Mobile is a MVNO ( mobile virtual network operator ) , using Sprint Nextel 's network for voice and data .
Sprint is a minority investor in the service .
The USB modem , a Novatel Wireless Ovation MC760 , includes a slot for microSD cards .
Pictured : Incredible watercolour paintings by boy aged just SIX
A street scene from the paintbrush of a child usually involves triangle - topped boxes for houses .
And often an unnaturally large dog .
But Kieron Williamson 's attempts are so beautifully rendered that artists ten times his age will be filled with envy .
Experts have said that the six - year - old 's atmospheric paintings , which began with harbour scenes and expanded to include rural vistas , animal portraits and landmarks , have perspective , shadow and reflections that demonstrate an ability well beyond his years .
Streets ahead :
One of the stunning watercolours by six - year - old Kieron Williamson .
The only hint that this is a child 's work is the slightly wobbly signature
He is even preparing for his first exhibition in a gallery near his home in Holt , Norfolk .
His mother , Michelle , said : ' Until last year he did n't draw anything and in fact we had to draw dinosaurs for him to colour in .
' The turning point was when we took our first family holiday to Devon and Cornwall last May and he liked the boats and scenery .
He asked for some plain paper and started drawing his own stuff .
Prodigy : Kieron was inspired to start drawing boats on a family holiday in Devon and Cornwall
Sunday art school : Kieron 's watercolour of a local church
' At the time , they were like the drawings of most five - year - olds but he really took off after going to some art classes . '
Mrs Williamson , 36 , a nutritional therapist , is married to art dealer Keith , 43 .
The couple also have a daughter , Billie - Jo , five .
' We often think about why Kieron has chosen art in this way and I think it 's because we live in a top - floor flat and we have no garden or outside space , so perhaps he's had to create his own scenery , ' she said .
' Faultless ' : One of Kieron watercolours captures weathered cottages in a Norfolk street with a tremendous sense of perspective
A walk in the park :
One of his many atmospheric rural scenes
Kieron appears to agree .
' I like painting because it 's fun and inspiring .
It makes me think of places I can't see , ' he said .
His talent was recognised by a family friend , artist Carol Ann Pennington , who offered to give him lessons .
She said : ' I have known Kieron since he was a baby but I had no idea he had it in him . '
His hero is Norfolk landscape artist Edward Seago , who died in 1974 .
The late Queen Mother was an avid fan , and bought many of his paintings .
Evocative : Another of Kieron 's paintings captures light , reflections and a flight of birds above beached boats
Compare and contrast : A windmill , as committed to canvas by Kieron
Obviously keen to follow in his footsteps by courting royal patronage , Kieron said : ' I 'm going to send one of my pictures to Prince Charles .
I 've already sent one to the Queen but I have n't had a reply yet . '
An exhibition of his work will go on display on Sunday - two days before his seventh birthday - at Mrs Pennington 's gallery , The Last Picture Show In Town .
Light touch :
Washes of colour say it all in this landscape by the dedicated artist
Country scene : River marshes are brought to life with careful brush strokes
Art expert Jeremy Green , owner of The Canon Gallery in Huntingdon , Cambridgeshire , said of Kieron 's work : ' It is unusual to see someone of that age painting with such definition and in such a stylistic way .
Normally they would be splashing colour all over the place .
' Some of these watercolours have a very rigid structure as if he has been painting in that style for some time .
They are very good , there 's no doubt about it . '
‚Ä¢ Kieron 's work is on show at the Last Picture Show In Town , Cromer Road , Holt , Norfolk , from Sunday .

The BBC has increased the number of satellites that carry its BBC Persian television service for Farsi- speakers in Iran , Afghanistan and Tajikistan .
This follows persistent interference of the Hotbird 6 satellite which carries the BBC 's international television and radio services in various languages as well as services from other broadcasters .
From now on , BBC Persian television will now be additionally available on the Eutelsat W2 M satellite and continues un-interrupted on the Telstar 12 satellite .
BBC Persian is also expected to be available on Nilesat soon .
They will serve Farsi - speaking audiences across the Middle East , Europe and Asia .
Since Friday 12
June the BBC Persian service , other BBC services , and the services of other broadcasters on Hotbird 6 have been subject to deliberate interference .
BBC Arabic television and various language services have also been experiencing transmission problems including being off the air at various points .
The satellite operator has traced the interference and has confirmed it is coming from within Iran .
This interference is contrary to all international agreements for satellite usage to which Iran is a signatory .
BBC Persian television has extended its broadcast hours .
There are an extra five hours of programming at Iranian breakfast and lunchtime , in addition to its usual evening broadcasts .
Radio broadcasts have also been extended .
BBC World Service Director Peter Horrocks said : " This is an important time for Iran and many Iranians are turning to the BBC for impartial and independent news and information during this crisis .
" We hope that by adding more ways to access BBC Persian television , Farsi - speaking audiences can get the high - quality news , analysis and debate they clearly desire .
" We also hope this will lessen the impact on other broadcasters who have been affected by the interference . "
BBC Persian will be available on :
Eutelsat W2 M at 3.1¬∞ East ( 11 . 473 GHz ‚Äì vertical polarised ) .
This is only 10 ¬∫ west of Hotbird 6 and can be found by making a small adjustment to the position of the satellite receiver dish .
Nilesat at 7¬∞ West , 10.757 GHz ( vertically polarised )
Telstar T12 , 15¬∞ West , 12.608 GHz ( horizontally polarised )
BBC Persian 's online services have been partially blocked in Iran since 2006 .
Despite the interference , bbcpersian.com has experienced a huge growth in usage since the current protests began .
Compared to traffic in May , the number of daily page impressions increased seven - fold to more than 3.6 million page impressions earlier this week .
The number of visitors to the website has seen a four - fold increase .
Online users streaming BBC Persian television through bbcpersian.com have also increased .
On Monday 15 June alone the stream was accessed nearly half a million times online ‚Äì this is more video requests than the whole of last May .
The BBC Persian YouTube channel showed an increase in usage until the Iranian authorities blocked the site to those within Iran last weekend .
The huge growth in Iran 's usage of the BBC 's online services means Iran is now second only to the USA as the country which streams the most BBC World Service TV and radio services .
BBC Persian has also been receiving user - generated content , such as videos and eye - witness accounts via email and phone , at a rate of up to eight per minute .

Paul Begala , a Democratic strategist and CNN political contributor , was a political consultant for Bill Clinton 's presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House .
He is an affiliated professor at Georgetown University 's Public Policy Institute .
Paul Begala says Gov. Sarah Palin was an impediment to the hard work Republicans need to do to rebuild the party .
( CNN ) -- I 'm sure Republican strategists look at their bench and think of what Casey Stengel said of the 1962 Mets : " Ca n't anybody here play this game ? "
David Vitter is on the D.C. Madam 's call list .
John Ensign confesses to an affair with a staffer .
Mark Sanford cries for his soul mate in Argentina .
And now Sarah Palin calls it quits .
The Republican Party was once a solid , serious , stable group of people .
It was the party of Eisenhower , of Ford -- and not too long ago , the party of Colin Powell .
Now it 's got more flakes than Post Toasties .
For all her whining about the ethics complaints brought against her , Sarah Palin is not the victim of the politics of personal destruction .
She 's the victim of the politics of self destruction .
I have no idea why Palin decided to quit , so let 's just pretend she was telling the truth :
She believes she can make more of a difference on the issues she cares about as a private citizen than as the chief executive of the Last Frontier .
My guess is a lot of Alaskans wish she 'd said that when she was trying to become governor , but what the heck .
It is a paradox of the modern Republican Party :
If they hate government so much , why do n't they leave it to those who can use it as a tool for national renewal ?
Republicans say government would screw up a one - car parade , and then when they get into government , they set about proving their theory right ( e.g. , Katrina , Iraq , the economy , etc. ) .
The speculation is that , rather than returning to being a private citizen , Palin aspires to the presidency .
Good luck .
She quit her job as city councilwoman to run for mayor of Wasilla .
She quit her job as mayor of Wasilla to run for lieutenant governor .
She quit her job as the head of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to run for governor .
And now she 's quitting her job as governor to ... be a private citizen ?
Right .
Part of the GOP 's problem is that conservatism has been discredited by George W. Bush and the Republicans who controlled Congress for most of his presidency .
Fiscal restraint , once a hallmark of the GOP , is history .
It was Bill Clinton who balanced the budget , and Republicans who ran up trillions in debt .
National security , a GOP strength since Vietnam , has been squandered .
A recent Democracy Corps poll shows that by almost 2 - to - 1 , Americans prefer President Obama 's approach on national security to the Bush - Cheney approach .
Economic stewardship ?
Please .
The Republicans inherited a robust economy , an economy that generated 23 million new jobs -- and left us with a battered , shattered economy that 's shedding jobs at a record pace .
And how about family values ?
If the recent GOP scandals have proved anything , it is that neither party has a monopoly on virtue , but one has planted itself firmly at the corner of sanctimony and hypocrisy .
Republicans need to rebuild , and Palin was an impediment to the hard work they need to do .
Sure , they need a charismatic leader -- and Palin is nothing if not charismatic .
But Ronald Reagan had ideas to match his charisma .
The current crop of Republicans repeat the same disgraced talking points George W. Bush used -- limited government , strong defense , family values .
No one 's buying their snake oil anymore .
The GOP will rebound , to be sure .
Politics is cyclical , but sometimes those cycles take decades .
Republicans can hasten their comeback by following the Clinton model : Challenge established orthodoxies , overturn outdated dogma and modernize their movement .
Clinton committed the heresy of supporting welfare reform , tough anti-crime policies , free trade and fiscal discipline .
In so doing he paved the way for President Obama .
No one today is attacking President Obama on crime or welfare ; Clinton took those Republican - dominated issues off the table .
If the Republicans were smart , they 'd find a principled compromise on health care and energy -- take those two Democratic - dominated issues off the table -- and then work on rebuilding their fiscal credentials .
Instead , the GOP has a strategy of implacable opposition on issues where the country wants action , increasingly wild attacks on a popular president , and a desperate search for a charismatic savior .
That 's no way to rebuild their party .
The bloviations of Limbaugh , the winking of Palin and the dark brooding of Dick Cheney are no substitute for new ideas .
Until Republicans prove they can revive their beleaguered party , no one will trust them to lead our beloved country .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Begala .
All About Sarah Palin ‚Ä¢ Republican Party
I will make a recipe for a number of reasons .
Sometimes , it ‚Äôs because I have tasted something in a restaurant and fallen in love , and then try to recreate it at home .
Sometimes , it ‚Äôs because I have an unfamiliar ingredient in my fridge and a particular recipe seems to be the perfect way to try it out .
Sometimes , it ‚Äôs a desperate attempt to use up some stuff in my overflowing fridge .
And sometimes it ‚Äôs simply because the picture accompanying the recipe is so pretty that I just ca n‚Äôt resist making it .
Most of my cooking falls into the first three categories , but a couple of weeks ago we had people over for lunch and I decided that , in keeping with the lovely weather ( a rarity this summer ! ) , I would make something totally girly and pretty and summery , and I could picture in my mind ‚Äôs eye the old magazine clipping containing the picture of white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake .
I must admit up front that I ‚Äôm a cheescake virgin .
It ‚Äôs one of the cakes I have always enjoyed eating , far more so than , say , chocolate cake .
But it is also the cake that I ‚Äôve always been too intimidated to make .
I remember being brought up as a bit of a cheesecake snob .
Long before my contemporaries had even moved on from messy wedges of chocolate cake , I would be eyeing out the cheesecake on menus and would ask the waitress ‚Äú is it baked or not ?
I do n‚Äôt want it if it ‚Äôs not baked ‚Äù .
Well , excuuuuuse me !
To me , gelatine - based cheesecakes were not really cheesecakes at all .
They were ‚Ä¶ fridge cakes , fridge tarts , whatever ‚Äì but they lacked the consistency that made me fall in love with cheesecakes .
Ordinary cakes had an airy springiness .
Gelatine cheesecakes had a disturbing wobbliness .
But baked cheesecakes just have this incredible airless , wobble - less creamy density that I absolutely loved .
So it should come as no surprise to you that when I embarked on my first - ever cheesecake , it was definitely going to be a baked one .
As I said , the sheer summery exuberance of the picture is what attracted me to the recipe and reading through the recipe I was struck by how simple it seemed .
There were really only two things that marred my cheesecake perfection : firstly , the fact that our crummy local supermarket ( I hate it but it is the closest to our house ‚Ä¶ ) had no fromage frais when we went shopping .
Instead , I guessed at ricotta for a substitute .
Now I do n‚Äôt know what the difference in water content may be between the two , but the centre of the cheesecake never quite set as solidly as the edges and I am left with the sneaking suspicion that this may not have been the best ingredient substitution .
Secondly , the recipe calls for the cheesecake to be allowed to cool naturally in the oven .
Sadly , in my kitchen , there is only one oven and it was needed for making sweet potato wedges that day , so the cake half - cooled in the oven and then spent time in the fridge .
Not sure this was exactly the way forward either ‚Äì next time I will plan my time better .
But those two concerns aside , I must say that this recipe was a total breeze and a big favourite among the guests .
It took all my willpower not to eat the filling mix straight out of the mixing bowl as it was absolutely , decadently delicious .
Although I find white chocolate too sweet , it is offset here by the tartness of the raspberries and the two balance each other perfectly .
If you feel the chocolate curls are too over the top , you can choose to omit the topping and serve the cake uniced ( pictured top left ) ‚Äì it looked equally lovely topless üòâ

WHITE CHOCOLATE AND RASPBERRY CHEESECAKE
( serves 6 - 8 )
Ingredients :
FOR THE BASE :
50g unsalted butter
225g gingernut biscuits ( ginger snaps ) , finely crushed
50g chopped pecan nuts of walnuts
FOR THE FILLING :
275g mascarpone
175g fromage frais
2 eggs , beaten
45 ml caster sugar
250g white chocolate
225g fresh raspberries
FOR THE TOPPING
115g mascarpone
75g fromage frais
white chocolate curls and raspberries to decorate
Method
Preheat the oven to 150C .
Melt the butter in a pan over low heat , then stir in the crushed biscuits and nuts .
Mix well and press the mixture evenly and firmly into the base of a 23 cm springform cake tin .
For the filling , beat together the mascarpone and fromage frais , then beat in the eggs and caster sugar until smooth .
Break the white chocolate into smaller pieces and place in a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water ( or use a double - boiler if you have one ) .
Stir occasionally to check for lumps and remove from the heat when chocolate has melted completely .
Stir the melted chocolate into the mascarpone mixture , then carefully fold in the whole raspberries .
Pour the filling into the springform cake tin and spread it evenly .
Place the springform on a cookie sheet with raised edges ‚Äì my filling seeped out of the join between the sides and base of the springform and made a mess in my oven .
Bake for about 1 hour or until just set ( you can stick a skewer into the centre to check , or just gently shake the tin to see how wobbly things are ) .
Switch off oven , but leave the cheesecake where it is and allow to cool until completely set .
Release the springform tin and lift the cheesecake onto a plate .
Mix the remaining mascarpone and fromage frais in a bowl and spread carefully over the top of the cheesecake .
Decorate with fresh raspberries and chocolate curls ( these are easy to make with a vegetable peeler ) and serve .
