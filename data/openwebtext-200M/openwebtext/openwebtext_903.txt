An unemployed man recently lost his home to foreclosure after refinancing it with a sub - prime mortgage to pay for annual admission to Disneyland for his family of eight .
ANAHEIM , CA —
An unemployed man recently lost his home to foreclosure after refinancing it with a sub - prime mortgage to pay for annual admission to Disneyland for his family of eight .
“ It sounded really good , ” said Tom Schumann , 37 , a lifelong Disney fan .
“ For one price , my family and I could enjoy the Magic Kingdom all year round , any time we want . ”
The premium annual passports he purchased sold for $ 389.00 each .
“ That includes parking , ” noted Schumann .
“ From a financial perspective , it made sense . ”
Lacking the $ 3,112 needed to pay for the tickets , he refinanced his house , taking out enough additional cash to pay for a whole year of “ experiencing the thrill of repeatedly sledding down the snow - capped alps ” and “ enjoying the never - ending escapades of marauding 18th century pirates who ransack New Orleans and force the townspeople to surrender . ”
When their mortgage payments suddenly increased , however , it was Schumann ’s family who was forced to surrender their beloved home to the auctioneers .
The Schumanns now virtually live inside the famed amusement park built by Walt Disney over fifty years ago .
“ It ’s not so bad , ” insisted Schumann .
“ We ’ve learned the lyrics to all the rides , and have discovered the absolute best places to view the nightly fireworks show . ”
His youngest son , Myron Schumann , has a different perspective .
“ I hate this place , ” he said .
“ I ’m sick of watching computerized pirates burn down a make - believe village , sick of soaring down the manufactured slopes of a concrete mountain , while my dad yells , ‘ Watch out for that cliff , fellow mountaineers , ’ and sick of hiding out on that stupid [ Tom Sawyer ] island every night after closing . ”
The Walt Disney Company issued a statement saying they feel their admission fees represent a true value in family entertainment .
“ How our guests come up with the thousands of dollars needed to finance their dream Disney vacations is a personal choice , ” read the statement .
“ And while we never encourage anyone to refinance their homes to pay for a trip to any of our theme parks , we do offer convenient payment plans for those who find themselves cash - strapped in this difficult economy . ”
“ It ’s like we ’ve taken out a year - long lease on this place , ” said the elder Schumann , whose pants were still soaked from his 3,605th ride on Splash Mountain .
“ Sure , we miss our house and our comfy beds and all that .
But there are a lot of families who will never have the opportunity to visit Disneyland , even once ; we get to live the magic every day for an entire year . ”
And what will he do when his family ’s annual passes expire ?
“ Renew them for another year , ” he said .
“ I still have fifty - thousand left over from my refinance . ”
This is what an Epson T088320 magenta color inkjet cartridge looks like from the inside .
It was split open by “ Inkdaddy ” in his effort to ascertain how much ink was in the cartridge .
It contains around 3 ml of ink .
But this is not obvious because the transparent plastic cover that you are seeing is actually masked by the product label .
The cartridge contains a network of multiple intricate sub- compartments , instead of a single compartment .
Ink comes to the nozzle from two separate compartments !
Obviously , Epson does not want you ( or the guy at the mall ) to experiment with poking needles to refill the cartridge .
Nevertheless , there are techniques for the undaunted .
Though not pictured here , the cartridge is also said to contain two chips .
And once the ink dries , they supposedly render the cartridge useless .
This built - in obsolescence in inkjet cartridges is becoming a sad trend these days .

RANKIN INLET , Nunavut – First she gutted it .
Then she had the heart pulled out of its furry , flabby carcass .
Finally , she swallowed a slice of the mammal 's dripping organ .
And when it was all over Gov. Gen.
Michaelle Jean wiped the blood of a freshly slaughtered seal off her crimson - spattered fingertips .
The Governor General made a graphic gesture of solidarity with the country 's beleaguered seal hunters on the first day of a week - long Arctic visit yesterday .
Hundreds of Inuit at a community festival gathered around as Jean knelt above a pair of carcasses and used a traditional ulu blade to slice the meat off the skin .
After eating the dripping chunk , she turned to her daughter , Marie - Eden , to say it tasted good .
She expressed her dismay that anyone would call traditional Inuit hunting practices inhumane .
Jean gestured to the hundreds of people in a packed arena and noted that they would all be fed by the meat laid out on a tarp on the floor .
" It was absolutely delicious , " Jean said .
" These are ancient practices that are part of a way of life .
" If you can't understand that , you 're completely missing the reality of life here . "
The European Union voted earlier this month to impose a ban on seal products .
For years , animal rights groups have intensely lobbied European politicians to implement a ban .
The European Union bill still needs the backing of EU governments .
But officials say that 's only a formality .
The ban , expected to take effect in October , would apply to all products and processed goods derived from seals , including fur , meat , oil blubber and even omega - 3 pills .
Locals here warn it will be one more shock to a region that already suffers from chronic economic woes and a staggering array of social problems .
Jean said the hunt is practiced humanely .
And her snack was " very rich in protein , " she said .
The locals expressed their wish more outsiders would see things that way .
They explained they do n't use the hooked hakapiks that have faced such bitter criticism from environmentalists .
They said they use guns or harpoons , and can't understand why their industry is considered less humane than cattle farming .
BAGHDAD  A series of bombs went off in Baghdad on Wednesday , extending a period of violence that has rattled Iraq ’s government and security forces .
The pattern of Wednesday ’s attacks  including three car bombs in predominantly Shiite areas and two at a Sunni mosque  raised fresh concern that sectarian passions could be inflamed anew .
Accounts of the death toll varied , from at least 17 people to as many as 48 , with dozens wounded .
So far in April , at least 300 Iraqis have been killed in bombing attacks , making it the bloodiest month since the start of the year and reversing the sharp drops in civilian deaths in January and February .
Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki has blamed Sunni insurgents and members of Saddam Hussein ’s ousted Baath Party for the recent violence , including four suicide bombings last week that killed almost 160 people , mostly Shiites .
Mr. Maliki is torn between demands from the United States and some Sunni leaders to reconcile with some former members of the Hussein government and his Shiite partners , who reject an accommodation .
They have conflicts of interest in Swedish judges as well
By Stina Backer April 26 , 2009 The Independant.uk Sunday
A retrial has been demanded by the lawyers for the file - sharing website Pirate Bay after it emerged the judge who sentenced its founders to jail for making copyrighted material available for download has links with pro-copyright organisations .
The judge in the Pirate Bay case , Thomas Norström is reported to be a member of the Swedish Copyright Association ( SFU ) where he is joined by Henrik Pontén , Peter Danowsky and Monique Wadsted , all of whom represented the entertainment industry in the case against the BitTorrent tracker site .
He also sits on the board of the Swedish Association for the Protection of Industrial Property ( SFIR ) , an organisation that lobbies for tougher copyright laws , reports Sveriges Radio ’s P3 news programme today .
Despite today ’s reports judge Norström denied that his involvement with the two copyright organisations constituted a “ conflict of interest ” in his ability to preside over the most high - profile trial involving illegal filesharing in European history .
“ Every time I take on a case I assess the chances for any recusation , but in this case I do n’t believe that my impartiality was affected , ” said Norström .
Peter Althin , the lawyer who represents Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde strongly disagrees and is calling for a retrial .
He argues that the defence should have had an opportunity to review the circumstances before the start of the trial .
“ In the autumn I received information that a lay judge could have similar connections .
I sent these to the court and the judge was excluded in order to prevent a conflict of interest .
It would have been reasonable to then review this situation as well , ” Althin said .
“ I will point this out in my appeal , then the Court of Appeal will decide if the district court decision should be set aside and the case revisited , ” Althin added .
The defendants , Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm , Peter Sunde and Carl Lundström , were found guilty on 33 specific charges of making files accessible for illegal sharing .
They have also been ordered to pay a fine of SEK30 million ( £ 2 m ) and have been sentenced to one year in prison .
Throughout the trail the defendants Twittered their version of events , something for which they received much criticism .
But after hearing the news about judge Norström ’s connections this morning Peter Sunde – aka BrokeP – could n’t resist a cheeky Tweet on the matter : “ Oh how I love the smell of victory in the morning . ”

TARP funds come back to Washington as campaign donations David Edwards and Joe Byrne
Published : Friday March 27 , 2009
Print This Email This
Recent filings in the Federal Election Commission 's database revealed that in the first two months of this year , at least $ 250,000 of bail - out funds returned to Washington in the form of campaign finances .
NBC 's chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd reported yesterday that both Democrats and Republicans have been receiving donations from bail - out firms .
Two of the most vocal opponents of the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) received some of the largest donations .
Representative John Boehner ( R - OH ) received $ 5,000 from Bank of America , $ 5,000 from American Express , and $ 1,500 from U.S. Bancorp , while Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) received a total of $ 21,500 from Citigroup , Bank of America , American Express , Chrysler , and UBS .
Cantor has opposed the TARP program in numerous interviews -  Why is n't it that Washington gets it anymore ?  he asked on MSNBC's Morning Joe earlier this month  but has yet to make a statement concerning the kick - backs from the bailed - out banking firms .
11 of 26 representatives who received donations were on the committee responsible for bail - out oversight .
Corporations can donate to political campaigns through their Political Action Committees ( PAC ) .
Corporate PAC 's ostensibly manage the political donations of all their employees , but the majority of the donations come from a small handful of executive officers .
Corporate funding pays for a large part of Congressional campaigns , but the idea that taxpayer money given to banks through TARP is being donated to politicians for their campaigns is making some observers nervous .
An anonymous bank fundraiser told Newsweek ,  These are treacherous waters . 
In addition to recipients in the House of Representatives , 14 Senators were sent checks in February .
Both sides of the aisle have received bail - out kick - backs .
$ 15,000 was sent to each party 's campaign committee .
Newsweek reported that House Democrats have quietly passed the word that they will be accepting campaign funds from companies like Bank of America , but only after public animosity over the bail - out dies down .
Individually , Senator Harry Reid , Speaker Nancy Pelosi , and Representative Barney Frank have said that they returned checks from firms that received more than $ 1 billion of government money .
 If I , as chairman of this committee , were taking money from these beneficiaries ... it would create the kind of distraction that we do n't need at this time ,  Frank explained to Chuck Todd .

Generally canine freestyle competitions and events are seen as a step up or a much more advanced level of obedience training combined with teamwork and choreography .
Many people equate canine freestyle to equine dressage , where grace , movement and elegance are combined with athletic ability , precision and obedience work .
Of course the challenge all comes in since the dog is completely off - leash for the performance , with the handler rarely making any type of physical contact or verbal commands to the dog .
Rather the dog is cued by body movements and hand signals , plus by keeping direct eye contact with the handler to watch for signs of upcoming commands .
In doggy dancing the handler and the dog develop a routine , typically to a piece of music that has a good beat that the dog can move to .
Basic obedience moves such as heeling , sitting , rolling over , walking on the hind legs and moving the front legs in time with the human 's movements are all included in most routines .
Additional options include sidestepping , weaving through the owner 's legs as he or she walks or dances , spinning in circles , jumping over props or virtually any other movement you can think of .
Tricks can be included in musical freestyle but are not allowed in all classes of doggy dancing .
The following correction was printed in the Observer 's For the record column , Sunday May 31 2009
In the article below we said incorrectly that a debate between Farage and former Europe minister Denis MacShane was " discreetly taped " by the hosts , the Foreign Press Association .
The FPA openly records all its briefings and in most cases puts them on its website after the event .
The leader of the UK Independence party ( Ukip ) , which wants to lead Britain out of the EU , has taken £ 2 m of taxpayers ' money in expenses and allowances as a member of the European Parliament , on top of his £ 64,000 a year salary .
Nigel Farage , who is calling on voters to punish " greedy Labour , Conservative and Lib Dem MPs " at the European elections on 4 June , boasted of his personal expenses haul at a meeting with foreign journalists in London last week .
The admission threatens to flatten a bounce in the polls for Ukip that has seen the party climb to around 17 % over the last fortnight as angry voters flock to smaller parties regarded as untainted by the Westminster expenses scandal .
During a debate about Europe at the Foreign Press Association - which was discreetly taped by the hosts - Farage was asked by former Europe minister Denis MacShane what he had received in non-salary expenses and allowances since becoming an MEP in 1999 .
" It is a vast sum , " Farage said .
" I do n't know what the total amount is but - oh lor - it must be pushing £ 2 million . "
Taken aback , MacShane then joked : " Is it too late to become an MEP ? "
Farage insisted that he had not " pocketed " the money but had used the " very large sum of European taxpayers ' money " to help promote Ukip 's message that the UK should get out of the EU .
When asked later by the Observer to justify how he could claim so much while running a campaign attacking Westminster MPs for their extravagance , Farage was unapologetic , saying that , while MEPs were " very expensive " , he was entirely happy that the money had been used for the best of causes . "
Last night , as Ukip circulated new party literature saying Westminster MPs had " ripped off taxpayers " , Farage , who employs his wife to help run his office and pays her from his allowances , faced a backlash as opponents accused him of hypocrisy .
MacShane suggested that Ukip 's attempt to pose as more honourable on expenses than other parties had been exposed as shameless and hollow .
" Far from being the party of the little man in Europe , Nigel Farage 's astounding £ 2 m raid on the taxpayer shows he is up there with any other politician , happy to line his pockets with gold , " he said .
Ukip 's opponents now hope the admission will halt the party 's advance which Farage 's supporters believe could see it overtake Labour and secure second place in the European poll .
At the last European elections in 2004 , Ukip enjoyed its greatest success , installing 12 MEPs in the European Parliament after securing 16.1 % of the vote .
But the success rapidly turned sour as one of the dozen , Ashley Mote , was expelled from the party - and later jailed - for benefit fraud .
Another , Tom Wise , is now facing prosecution for alleged false accounting and money laundering relating to his EU expenses .
He denies the charges .
Television presenter Robert Kilroy - Silk , who won the East Midlands for Ukip , later left to form another eurosceptic outfit , Veritas .
With the pressure on all parliamentarians mounting , Farage insisted on Friday that from next month all his MEPs would publish their expenses online .
" From the moment any Ukip members get elected , all elected MEPs will provide a clear and traceable quarterly statement of their expense accounts , " he said .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
After several rounds of waivers from creditors and a long struggle to stay afloat , the nation 's second largest mall operator , General Growth Properties , on Thursday filed for bankruptcy protection , saying it could n't reach an out - of - court consensus on how to restructure its $ 27 billion of outstanding debt .
The Chicago - based firm , which operates malls in 44 states , was brought low by an aggressive growth and acquisition strategy funded by debt , and is symbolic of the crisis growing in the commercial real estate market .
And the trouble for firms like General Growth are likely to continue , according to the latest report about U.S. economic conditions released this week in th eso - called Beige Book .
" Nonresidential real estate conditions continued to deteriorate over the past six weeks .
Demand for office , industrial and retail space continued to fall , " the report said .
" Commercial real estate investment activity weakened further .
Contacts said a decline in credit availability and markdowns on commercial property were keeping buyers and sellers on the sidelines , " it concluded .
As the credit crisis hit and the U.S. consumer started saving more and spending less , the company 's retail clients felt the pinch , which flowed through to General Growth in the form of retail store closings and bankruptcies .
The company was ultimately unable to refinance much of its debt , and was forced to file bankruptcy .
A Citigroup research report in February described the company by saying , " General Growth is a good company with good assets , just an unfortunate capital structure that has too much debt coming due too soon . "
According to the firm 's filing , the New York branch of Germany 's EuroHypo AG , Wilmington Trust , and Bank of New York Mellon are among its largest unsecured creditors .
See General Growth 's bankruptcy filing .
For its retail tenants still in place at malls like Boston 's Faneuil Hall and New York 's South Street Seaport the bankruptcy is expected to have limited impact , analysts said .
" The bankruptcy will prevent renegotiation with creditors from disrupting day to day management of properties and relationships with retail partners - so no precipitous actions in the short term , " said Dave Sievers , a partner at Archstone Consulting , in an email .
" In the medium to long term , bankruptcy , and new credit agreements will require ( General Growth ) properties to be economically viable .
Retail lease agreements will have to make economic sense otherwise the properties and the leases will have to be reorganized , " Seivers said .
For consumers , it 's also likely business as usual
" I cannot imagine it having any ( impact ) on tenants or tenant leases , " said Michael Niemira , chief economist of International Council of Shopping Centers .
" I doubt many consumers care or even know who owns the property that they are shopping at . "
Even in the event of a possible liquidation , the property goes to the creditors , either a bank or another lender , which will still own the property , Niemira said .
General Growth GGP , +0.87 % said it filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York .
In addition , approximately 158 regional shopping centers also filed for protection .
In February , the company reported $ 1.18 billion of past due debt and another $ 4.1 billion of debt that could be accelerated .
All day - to - day operations and business of all of the company 's shopping centers and other properties will continue as usual , the Chicago firm said .
The company intends to pursue a plan of reorganization that extends mortgage maturities and reduces its corporate debt and overall leverage .
It has received a commitment for a debtor - in - possession financing facility of approximately $ 375 million from Pershing Square Capital Management .
" Our core business remains sound and is performing well with stable cash flows .
We believe that chapter 11 is the best process for restructuring maturing mortgage loans , reducing the company 's corporate debt , and establishing a sustainable , long - term capital structure for the company , " said Adam Metz , chief executive .
" While we have worked tirelessly in the past several months to address our maturing debts , the collapse of the credit markets has made it impossible for us to refinance maturing debt outside of chapter 11 , " he said .
The company 's portfolio totals approximately 200 million square feet of retail space and includes over 24,000 retail stores nationwide .
Shares of General Growth Properties closed Wednesday at $ 1.05 , down from its 52 - week high of $ 44.23 .
Vows to take petition “ straight to the to p ”

Ron Paul ’s Campaign For Liberty group has responded to a report compiled for law officials in Missouri that equates supporters of the Texas Congressman with radical race hate groups and terrorists .
As we detailed last week , the report , which has been handed out to Missouri police officers , specifically describes supporters of presidential candidates Ron Paul , Chuck Baldwin , and Bob Barr as “ militia ” influenced terrorists .
The report , distributed by the Missouri Information Analysis Center , also instructs the Missouri police to be on the lookout for supporters displaying bumper stickers and other paraphernalia associated with the Constitutional , Campaign for Liberty , and Libertarian parties .
Now the Campaign For Liberty group intends to deliver a Citizen ’s Petition to the Missouri Governor and Attorney General , which will highlight the offensive and inflammatory content contained within the MIAC report .
“ Here at Campaign for Liberty we are going to give this foolishness the treatment it deserves . ” writes John Tate , the group ’s President in an email to members .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
“ It is important that we respond in the right way when faced with such a government labeling , and the proper way is to go straight to the top in Missouri . ”
“ The ‘ study ’ was undoubtedly written by some university liberal who knows nothing of the hundreds of thousands of Missourians who share our values .
I can only imagine how many hundreds of thousands of Missouri tax dollars funded this . ”
Tate adds .
The Missouri report is the latest in a long line of documents and literature intended to train police nationwide that supporters of Constitutionally - limited government must be labeled and targeted as potential security threats .
We urge our readers to sign the Campaign for Liberty ’s Citizen ’s Petition and help the group expose such freedom stripping activity .
( Article continues below )
Below is The Campaign For Liberty ’s response in full .
March 17 , 2009
Dear Friend of Liberty ,
Maybe you ’ve heard , or maybe not , but the Missouri State Police think you might be a security threat .
Why ?
Because you support Ron Paul and the Campaign for Liberty .
Also , because maybe you own guns , oppose abortion or homeschool .
Even , and I ’m serious , because you support the U.S. Constitution .
I know , it ’s ridiculous … and probably steams you a bit .
But here at Campaign for Liberty we are going to give this foolishness the treatment it deserves .
More on that in a moment .
Let me give you a bit more background .
As you may be aware by now , the Missouri Information Analysis Center ( MIAC ) recently released a report titled , “ The Modern Militia Movement ” to over one thousand Missouri law enforcement officers .
What is the Missouri Information Analysis Center ?
According to its website ,
“ MIAC is the mechanism to collect incident reports of suspicious activities to be evaluated and analyzed in an effort to identify potential trends or patterns of terrorist or criminal operations within the state of Missouri .
MIAC will also function as a vehicle for two - way communication between federal , state and local law enforcement community within our region . ”
The MIAC warned officers that violent militia members are “ usually ” supporters of presidential candidates like Ron Paul and are also known for opposition to things like the Federal Reserve and the income tax .
The “ study ” was undoubtedly written by some university liberal who knows nothing of the hundreds of thousands of Missourians who share our values .
I can only imagine how many hundreds of thousands of Missouri tax dollars funded this .
Both Ron Paul and Campaign for Liberty champion principles of freedom , peace , and prosperity .
We believe that the Founder ’s vision for America can be reclaimed through education and peaceful activism .
It is a common practice of elitist intellectuals and backroom bureaucrats to attempt to crowd everyone into groups and stick labels on them , especially when it involves those who support a Constitutionally - limited government .
Anthony Gregory , editor - in - chief at Campaign for Liberty , has posted an excellent new article on our site concerning government broad - brush fear campaigns .
It is important that we respond in the right way when faced with such a government labeling , and the proper way is to go straight to the top in Missouri .
The way to fight thugs and ignorant people in authority is not to cower or rage , but to proudly proclaim who you are and what you believe .
That ’s why I urge you to sign our Citizen ’s Petition here today .
Our petition spells out in no uncertain terms who we are and what we believe .
And it reminds those in charge of enforcing Missouri ’s laws that we are citizen activists who will not be intimidated nor embarrassed into silence .
Simply owning a gun does not make you a threat .
It means you are a free citizen .
Supporting our Constitution does not make you worthy of a watchlist , it makes you a Patriot .
So please , sign our Citizen ’s Petition today .
Be sure to stay tuned for more information on how we plan to respond to the MIAC .
Finally , I want to ask you a final favor .
If you can , please join us next week as we gather in St. Louis for the first Campaign for Liberty Regional Conference and show the people of Missouri what Campaign for Liberty truly stands for and represents .
We will be hosting a free event on Friday Night with Ron Paul and Judge Andrew Napolitano that is open to the public , and the conference will be highlighted by grassroots training on Saturday , March 28 .
Learning how to properly mobilize in order to implement liberty - based legislation is absolutely critical to our success as a movement , and our Regional Conference will provide you with the tools you need as we move forward .
For more information on our Conference , check out our Regional Conference page .
For special travel and hotel information , click here .
Liberty is never free , and demands vigilance .
I look forward to seeing you in St. Louis for an exciting weekend of celebration and training !
In Liberty ,
John Tate
President , Campaign for Liberty
P.S. And do n’t forget to fill out our Citizen ’s Petition , which we will deliver to the Missouri Governor and Attorney General .

April 1 , 2009 --
The active chemical in marijuana promotes the death of brain cancer cells by essentially helping them feed upon themselves , researchers in Spain report .
Guillermo Velasco and colleagues at Complutense University in Spain have found that the active ingredient in marijuana , THC , causes brain cancer cells to undergo a process called autophagy .
Autophagy is the breakdown of a cell that occurs when the cell essentially self - digests .
The team discovered that cannabinoids such as THC had anticancer effects in mice with human brain cancer cells and people with brain tumors .
When mice with the human brain cancer cells received the THC , the tumor growth shrank .
Two patients enrolled in a clinical trial received THC directly to the brain as an experimental treatment for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme , a highly aggressive brain tumor .
Biopsies taken before and after treatment helped track their progress .
After receiving the THC , there was evidence of increased autophagy activity .
The findings appear in the April 1 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation .
The patients did not have any toxic effects from the treatment .
Previous studies of THC for the treatment of cancer have also found the therapy to be well tolerated , according to background information in journal article .
Study authors say their findings could lead to new strategies for preventing tumor growth .

Advertisement A demonstration has been held in support of parents who have occupied two closure - threatened schools .
More than 20 parents barricaded themselves inside Wyndford Primary and St Gregory 's Primary in the Maryhill area of Glasgow on Friday afternoon .
The city - wide Save Our Schools Campaign held a rally outside the premises in a show of solidarity .
Glasgow City Council has proposed closing or merging 13 primary schools and 12 nurseries across the city .
Parent Debbie Watson is one of those occupying the school .
She said : " We are fighting against the closure of our schools .
" If our schools close within the Wyndford community , our community dies .
The support we 've been getting has been amazing .
I 've had about 300 texts from all over Britain and even one from Italy
Nikki Rathmill
Protestor " It 's already in a bad state as it is , but our community will fight to the bitter end to keep our schools open .
" We will be here until the very end until Glasgow City Council and the Labour councillors wake up . "
The protest at the two schools , which back on to each other , began at 1430 BST on Friday after parents attending a balloon launch in the school grounds locked themselves inside the assembly halls .
The campaigners refused police requests to leave , and said they were willing to remain in the schools over the two - week Easter holiday period , which started on Friday , if necessary .
Officers have made no attempt to force the protestors out , and there have been no arrests made .
Parents inside the buildings have been using the school kitchen facilities to make themselves tea and food .
Occupant Nikki Rathmill , whose five - year - old son Ross attends Wyndford , said there were 11 parents and friends inside the school , with a further 11 in St Gregory 's .
" We are trying to save our children 's education and their safety , " she explained .
" The support we 've been getting has been amazing .
I 've had about 300 texts from all over Britain and even one from Italy since this started .
" We 're determined to stay for as long as it takes . "
A demonstration was held in support of the occupying parents
Under the local authority proposals , Wyndford Primary would close and pupils would be transferred to Parkview Primary .
St Gregory 's would also shut with pupils moving to St Mary 's Primary .
Some parents have claimed the plans would have a negative impact on children 's education , and have suggested a better solution would be to merge Wyndford , which is non-denominational , with St Gregory 's , a Roman Catholic school .
A decision will be taken later this month after a consultation closed in March .
Ms Rathmill said the proposals would mean her son travelling 1.4 miles to Parkview school every morning .
She added : " They are saying they will give him a travel card , but he 's only five and there 's no way he can get on a bus himself .
" This is a peaceful protest .
We just want to highlight the fact that the council have taken everything away from this area . "
Demonstrations have previously been held outside the City Chambers and at the schools involved .
The parents who have staged these school occupations have shown tremendous courage and principle
Richie Venton
Save Our Schools Save Our Schools campaign organiser Richie Venton praised the parents for the action .
" The parents who have staged these school occupations have shown tremendous courage and principle , " Mr Venton said .
" Parents are fighting for the future of kids across the city , and deserve a huge show of support from the rest of us , not just from the Maryhill community but beyond . "
A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said it held a six - week consultation exercise on its school estate strategy , which included 46 public meetings , and resulted in more than 8,000 formal responses .
" These are currently being collated and councillors will receive a comprehensive report for them to make informed decisions on all the proposals at a meeting of the council on 23 April , " the spokesman added .

The creation of large - area graphene using copper may enable the manufacture of new graphene - based devices that meet the scaling requirements of the semiconductor industry , leading to faster computers and electronics , according to a team of scientists and engineers at The University of Texas at Austin .
" Graphene could lead to faster computers that use less power , and to other sorts of devices for communications such as very high - frequency ( radio - frequency - millimeter wave ) devices , " said Professor and physical chemist Rod Ruoff , one of the corresponding authors on the Science article .
" Graphene might also find use as optically transparent and electrically conductive films for image display technology and for use in solar photovoltaic electrical power generation . "
Graphene , an atom - thick layer of carbon atoms bonded to one another in a " chickenwire " arrangement of hexagons , holds great potential for nanoelectronics , including memory , logic , analog , opto-electronic devices and potentially many others .
It also shows promise for electrical energy storage for supercapacitors and batteries , for use in composites , for thermal management , in chemical - biological sensing and as a new sensing material for ultra-sensitive pressure sensors .
" There is a critical need to synthesize graphene on silicon wafers with methods that are compatible with the existing semiconductor industry processes , " Ruoff said .
" Doing so will enable nanoelectronic circuits to be made with the exceptional efficiencies that the semiconductor industry is well known for . "
Graphene can show very high electron - and hole - mobility ; as a result , the switching speed of nanoelectronic devices based on graphene can in principle be extremely high .
Also , graphene is " flat " when placed on a substrate ( or base material ) such as a silicon wafer and , thus , is compatible with the wafer - processing approaches of the semiconductor industry .
The exceptional mechanical properties of graphene may also enable it to be used as a membrane material in nanoelectromechanical systems , as a sensitive pressure sensor and as a detector for chemical or biological molecules or cells .
The university researchers , including post - doctoral fellow Xuesong Li , and Luigi Colombo , a TI Fellow from Texas Instruments , Inc. , grew graphene on copper foils whose area is limited only by the furnace used .
They demonstrated for the first time that centimeter - square areas could be covered almost entirely with mono - layer graphene , with a small percentage ( less than five percent ) of the area being bi-layer or tri-layer flakes .
The team then created dual - gated field effect transistors with the top gate electrically isolated from the graphene by a very thin layer of alumina , to determine the carrier mobility .
The devices showed that the mobility , a key metric for electronic devices , is significantly higher than that of silicon , the principal semiconductor of most electronic devices , and comparable to natural graphite .
" We used chemical - vapor deposition from a mixture of methane and hydrogen to grow graphene on the copper foils , " said Ruoff .
" The solubility of carbon in copper being very low , and the ability to achieve large grain size in the polycrystalline copper substrate are appealing factors for its use as a substrate -- along with the fact that the semiconductor industry has extensive experience with the use of thin copper films on silicon wafers .
By using a variety of characterization methods we were able to conclude that growth on copper shows significant promise as a potential path for high quality graphene on 300 - millimeter silicon wafers . "
The university 's effort was funded in part by the state of Texas , the South West Academy for Nanoelectronics ( SWAN ) and the DARPA CERA Center .
Electrical and computer engineering Professor Sanjay Banerjee , a co-author of the Science paper , directs both SWAN and the DARPA Center .
" By having a materials scientist of Colombo 's caliber with such extensive knowledge about all aspects of semiconductor processing and now co-developing the materials science of graphene with us , I think our team exemplifies what collaboration between industrial scientists and engineers with university personnel can be , " said Ruoff , who holds the Cockrell Family Regents Chair # 7 .
" This industry - university collaboration supports both the understanding of the fundamental science as well its application . "
Other co-authors of the work not previously mentioned include : research associate Richard Piner of the Department of Mechanical Engineering ; Assistant Professor Emanuel Tutuc of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering ; post - doctoral fellows Jinho An , Weiwei Cai , Inhwa Jung , Aruna Velamakanni and Dongxing Yang in the Department of Mechanical Engineering ; and graduate students Seyoung Kim and Junghyo Nah in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering .
The Mythical Freedom of Ron Paulism
I was a supporter of Ron Paul ’s last year till the summer .
I believed more in him than I did any of the remaining candidates the Republican and Democratic parties offered up .
Stridently anti-war without sounding like Cindy Sheehan ; anti-drug war without sounding like a stoner hippie ; anti-federal death penalty without equivocation ; and a critic of moron Mike Huckabee ’s advertisement brazenly using Christian imagery .
However as I delved deeper into Mr. Paul ’s politics as the summer moved , and encountered more and more of his supporters ( working as the computer guy for two Libertarian candidates in the state , there were encounters with the Ron Paul fan - club ) , it became evident that Ron Paul was preaching a gospel wholly devoid of realism , but that he was consciously creating a cult of personality .
Then he came out and endorsed Charles “ Chuck ” Baldwin of the stupidly named “ Constitution Party . ”
Others who ’ve endorsed Mr. Baldwin include Jerome Corsi , a man totally lacking any principles whatsoever who wrote a book on Obama based entirely on speculation and whatever fantasies result from curing one ’s hat with too much mercury .
Jerome Corsi also appears on media run by Holocaust deniers and white supremacists , writes for the anti-Semitic conspiracy site World Net Daily , and has opinions regarding 9/11 which border on the “ sublimely retarded . ”
This is who Chuck Baldwin appealed to , and Ron Paul apparently felt that this was cool .
Now what attracted many around my age ( I ’m 26 ) to Ron Paul was this gospel of freedom he was promoting .
Economic freedom !
Social freedom !
Freedom from religion even !
To someone who identified not at all with the Roman Catholic faith he was raised , this was an exciting prospect .
Awesome , Ron Paul was going to let me keep the income I was earning , and let me spend it on pot if I was so inclined !
I wo n’t be worried about the government knocking down my door , demanding 30 % of what I earned and then throwing me in jail for whatever I decided to add to my personal hookah .
After careful studying , this was pure idiocy on my part .
What Ron Paul preaches superficially is “ freedom , ” what goes on below the surface of his gospel is something entirely different .
For individuals who think Ron Paul is the Messiah of Liberty , ask yourself this : he had a choice to endorse the Libertarian Party candidate for President , a man who regretted ( most likely dishonestly , but regretted it nonetheless ) his creation the Defense of Marriage Act ( an act which eliminated freedom ) , one who believed in social sovereignty ( most likely superficial , but who knows ) , and the like .
Instead he endorsed someone from the Constitution Party .
The Constitution Party is as much about liberty as the Bolshevik Party .
Here is their party platform .
Let ’s look at the amount of liberty they wish to extend to people .
Gambling :
Gambling promotes an increase in crime , destruction of family values , and a decline in the moral fiber of our country .
We are opposed to government sponsorship , involvement in , or promotion of gambling , such as lotteries , or subsidization of Native American casinos in the name of economic development .
Pornography :
Pornography , at best , is a distortion of the true nature of sex created by God for the procreative union between one man and one woman in the holy bonds of matrimony , and at worst , is a destructive element of society resulting in significant and real emotional , physical , spiritual and financial costs to individuals , families and communities .
We call on our local , state and federal governments to uphold our cherished First Amendment right to free speech by vigorously enforcing our laws against obscenity to maintain a degree of separation between that which is truly speech and that which only seeks to distort and destroy .
Family :
The law of our Creator defines marriage as the union between one man and one woman .
The marriage covenant is the foundation of the family , and the family is fundamental in the maintenance of a stable , healthy and prosperous social order .
No government may legitimately authorize or define marriage or family relations contrary to what God has instituted .
We are opposed to amending the U.S. Constitution for the purpose of defining marriage .
We reject the notion that sexual offenders are deserving of legal favor or special protection , and affirm the rights of states and localities to proscribe offensive sexual behavior .
We oppose all efforts to impose a new sexual legal order through the federal court system .
[ note : criminalize homosexuality ]
We stand against so - called “ sexual orientation ” and “ hate crime ” statutes that attempt to legitimize inappropriate sexual behavior and to stifle public resistance to its expression .
We oppose government funding of “ partner ” benefits for unmarried individuals .
Finally , we oppose any legal recognition of homosexual unions .
We recognize that parents have the fundamental right and responsibility to nurture , educate , and discipline their children .
We oppose the assumption of any of these responsibilities by any governmental agency without the express delegation of the parents or legal due process .
We affirm the value of the father and the mother in the home , and we oppose efforts to legalize adoption of children by homosexual singles or couples .
And there ’s a lot more .
The Constitution Party is explicitly a religious party like Hamas , Hez’bollah , the Muslim Brotherhood , and the Taliban only missing the militant aspect .
The webpage of their platform mentions “ God ” or “ Creator ” 19 times .
This theocratic party is who Ron Paul believed would best be in charge of this country ( after himself of course ) .
In what sense does Ron Paul ’s advocacy of what is a brazenly theocratic / authoritarian mindset even remotely similar to the notion of “ freedom ? ”
Ron Paul = freedom is a myth that ’s becoming far too widespread .
Some people feel that advertising is garbage .
London based Curb advertises with garbage .
And sea water .
And snow .
Calling themselves “ The Natural Media Company , ” Curb create advertising based on natural elements , the most recent being for the London Aquarium utilizing “ sea tagging , ” which is using sea water and a stencil to create temporary ads on the sidewalk .
Sea water evaporates more slowly then water , but being a completely natural substance , no permit is needed to do it .
Another water based innovation is what they call H2 Show , where a waterfall is somehow able to be manipulated to display words , logos , and images , and even accept text messages to display different words .
Crop carving , once the province of aliens and pranksters , is now being put to use in a smart way , as in their Shredded Wheat logo carved out of , yes , a wheat field .
In the clearest example of green marketing I ’ve heard of ,
[ social_buttons ]
they do snow tagging , which as it sounds is making designs in the snow , which leaves no trace once gone , and I would imagine while it ’s there would be quite noticeable and memorable .
Especially if it were for a snow / sport related brand .
Not some gimmick division of a larger agency , Curb “ … are committed to only ever using natural earth elements in our media portfolio and providing a range of media which are not only sustainable and effective but can also generate substantial return on investment for our clients . ”
In a world where things continue to speed up and the window of opportunity to making an impression on consumers is increasingly small , utilizing tactics such as Curb ’s is both more likely to have a bigger impact , and a smaller ( or nonexistent ) footprint when it ’s done .
Beyond the initial impression it makes on those there , the media coverage it likely generates ( like this for example ) extends the value of the work .
Readers :
What other innovative sustainability minded marketing are you seeing out there ?

So I had this silly idea to isolate the backgrounds from famous Internet memes , removing all the subjects from every photo or video .
I ’m pretty happy with the results .

A couple of years ago if you had asked me what I would do if an emergency presented itself and I needed some money quickly , I would probably have told you , “ That ’s what credit cards are for ! ” .
Just put it on the card and pay it off when you can !
Emergencies are n’t really something you can plan for , so why try to plan for them , right ?
Emergencies do have a way of coming up at the most inopportune times , but the fact is that you CAN plan for emergencies .
You may not know when they ’ll hit , or how hard they ’ll hit .
But you do know that they will happen .
So it ’s best to plan for them while you can .
Since we started our financial plan a year or two ago and saved up an emergency fund we have seen many family emergencies pop up .
We have gone through an emergency hospitalization where my wife was in the hospital for a month with a blood clot .
We had a car accident .
We had a car broken into and had a lot of stuff stolen from us .
And now we ’re preparing for another medical emergency where my wife will be having another unplanned surgery next week .
If this does n’t prove it to you , nothing will .
You WILL have emergencies pop up in your life , so get ready !
Reasons To Set Up Your Emergency Fund
Emergencies Happen :
The more time goes on , the more you realize that things do come up that you had n’t planned for , and you ’re going to have to pay for them .
You ’ll be on vacation and get a bad case of the flu .
Traveling to grandma ’s house when the tire blows out .
Things happen , and they wo n’t happen at a convenient time .

It Relieves Stress :
When you have an emergency fund saved , it has an added built in bonus .
Peace of mind !
You ’ll feel the weight lifted off your shoulders because you no longer have to worry about most small emergencies .
Once you get your larger emergency fund saved , you wo n’t have to worry about paying for most large ones either .
: When you have an emergency fund saved , it has an You ’ll feel the weight lifted off your shoulders because you no longer have to worry about most small emergencies .
Once you get your larger emergency fund saved , you wo n’t have to worry about paying for most large ones either .
It Reduces Risk :
When you have an emergency fund ( along with other things like health insurance , disability insurance and life insurance ) , you have a lot less risk of bad things happening .
You ’re much less likely to go into bankruptcy , foreclosure or to start accumulating large amounts of debt .
In other words you ’re making sound decisions to plan for problems , before they happen .
Where Should I Save My Emergency Fund ?
One question that always comes up every time you talk about emergency funds is , “ where you should I put this money ? ” .
Put it in CDs ?
Bonds ?
Money market account ?
High - yield online savings ?
Personally , I think it ’s first and foremost important that you keep your money as liquid as possible .
You want to be able to access it when an emergency comes up !
You do n’t want to be scrambling trying to convert your bonds back to cash , or waiting 3 months for your CDs to mature .
Put it in a good high yield ( not as high these days ) savings account where you can get at it ASAP !
Some good account options that I would suggest :
There are other good options out there of places to keep your savings , but just make sure that the account is readily accessible , and your money liquid .
How Much Money Should I Be Saving In My Emergency Fund ?
When we started saving our emergency fund we followed Dave Ramsey ’s 7 Baby Steps plan found in his “ Financial Peace University ” class .
I think it ’s a good plan to follow so I ’ll outline the steps a bit here .
The first step in his plan is to save $ 1000 for a baby emergency fund .
The idea is to have a small buffer for most emergencies that come up , so you do n’t have to go further into debt ( if you have debt ) .
Most small emergencies like flat tires , needing a new alternator or a doctor ’s office visit will be covered by this small emergency fund .
The second step in the Dave Ramsey ’s plan is to get out of debt using the debt snowball .
Getting rid of your debt is integral to improving your situation , and in this step you get intense about finding extra work , doing a budget and living on less than you make so that you can cut into your debt .
The third step is to build up your emergency fund from your starting position of $ 1000 , all the way up to 3 - 6 months of expenses .
To figure out how much that is you ’ll need to do a family budget , figure out how much money NEEDS to be spent every month , and use number to figure out how much 3 - 6 months of savings will be .
For some people 6 months of expenses will be $ 18,000 .
For others it might be closer to $ 30,000 .
It all depends on your personal situation .
So how much money should I save , and when ?
Start a $ 1000 baby emergency fund .
Pay off all debts .
Save 3 - 6 months of expenses .
( $ 15,000 - $ 30,000 in most cases ? )
In our current economic climate some people are even suggesting that you save 8 - 12 months of expenses .
This would be especially pertinent if your job situation is a bit unstable , and you ’re expecting a layoff soon .
I would certainly have no problem with that , and would even encourage it if you really do feel like you ’re in imminent danger of losing a job .
When Should We Spend Our Emergency Savings ?
Another question that often comes up is , “ What constitutes an emergency , and when should we spend our money in our emergency fund ? ” .
This is a question that you ’ll need to answer for your own family at your family budget meeting .
Generally , however , an emergency fund should be used for large unplanned expenses that you would otherwise have to go into debt for .
Things like replacing blown tires on your car , or fixing your furnace in the dead of winter or paying for an emergency room visit .
Things you should n’t use your emergency fund for include things like a vacation to Hawaii , that diamond ring you ’ve been coveting , and that awesome new game system that all your friends have .
Things that you do n’t really need should not be paid for by emergency funds .
The Emergency Fund Is Only The Beginning
Remember , an emergency fund is only the start of a sound financial plan .
Do n’t forget to also start doing a budget , planning for insurance needs ( to remove further risk ) , investing for your future , and giving to others in need !
Do you have an emergency fund ?
If so , what sorts of things have you used your emergency fund to pay for ?
What amount do you think should be saved in an emergency fund ?

Homophone corner : " Round a corner peddled the mayor and the minister , enjoying the ride , until a large lorry overtook them " .
One of Boris Johnson 's missions as Mayor of London is to get more people out of their cars and on to their bikes .
But anyone who watches CCTV footage of the mayor 's last outing on his own bicycle is likely to be put off for life .
On Friday morning Johnson headed out in London with transport minister Lord Adonis and Kulveer Ranger , his director of transport , to look at potential sites for new cycle " super highways " .
The routes are part of his plan for a " cycling revolution " in the capital .
Round a corner peddled the mayor and the minister , enjoying the ride , until a large lorry overtook them .
In what is being described as the mayor 's " near - death experience " , the lorry 's back door then suddenly flew open , dragged a parked car into the street and smashed into another – just feet from Johnson , Adonis and Ranger .
A CCTV camera which caught the drama obscures the cyclists during the collision until 30 seconds later a figure that is unmistakably Johnson emerges , helmet in hand , scratching his head and lucky to be alive .
An aide to the mayor said : " It was pretty awful .
They were shaken up and Boris was shocked .
But it makes the case even more for his super highways . "

Functional Testing of Desktop Applications Video
The video of my PyCon talking on testing GUI applications is up .
The talk went well , with a surprisingly high number of attendees for what I expected to be a ' niche ' subject .
Functional Testing of Desktop Applications ( 45 mins )
Many advocates of unit testing believe that testing desktop ( GUI ) applications is so difficult as to not be worth it .
Not only is it possible , but ' functional testing ' ( testing an application from the point of view of the user ) is an important part of an agile development process .
The talk is also available as a series of articles if you prefer to read than watch .
The video quality is great , well worth watching .
My lightning talk ( Metaclasses in Five Minutes ) is also on video ; 11 minutes into this video of Friday 's lightning talks .
As many others have said , kudos to the awesome video team who got a huge number of the talks up within days of the conference finishing .
A lot of excellent stuff if you have n't already taken a look .
The tutorials are n't posted yet , hopefully they 'll follow soon .
PyCon 2009 : Language summit
As I start to write this blog entry I 'm one of the last few sprinters left in Chicago in the aftermath of the PyCon 2009 international Python conference .
In fact it is only moments before I have to catch the shuttle bus to the airport , so the rest of this entry will have to be composed from home ( and quite a long time later after I recover as it happens ) .
I 've been away from home now for eight days , the longest I 've been away from my wife in the five years we 've been married .
The conference was awesome , and part of the reason I was away for so long was that I gave an IronPython tutorial on the Wednesday before the conference followed by the Python Language Summit on the Thursday .
I took the IronPython tutorial with my colleague Jonathan Hartley .
We had 15 people , which is more than we expected but still just less than the number who attended when we gave the IronPython tutorial at PyCon UK 2008 which is 1/3 the size of PyCon .
It went very well ; the network worked flawlessly which was a bonus as the tutorial worked through creating a Twitter client in IronPython .
Hopefully a video will appear at some point and I 'll also turn the tutorial into a series of articles as it is a great introduction to IronPython for Python developers .
The conference started this year with a VM summit for developers of dynamic language VMs .
This was where google made the announcement about Unladen Swallow ; the branch of CPython that will attempt to gain substantial performance improvements by using the LLVM to add a JIT , remove the GIL and switch away from reference counting for garbage collection .
They aim to do all this whilst remaining binary compatible with the existing CPython implementation .
In order to be compatible with existing extensions they will have to simulate the GIL for third - party extensions ; presumably with a new - API for extensions that want to take advantage of the new capabilities .
There are many hurdles for the team to get past ( including making the Python basic data structures threadsafe if they remove the GIL ) , but it is exciting and is inspiring the PyPy team to race them for major performance improvements .
We 'll see how far they get , but this is n't vaporware - Unladen Swallow is already serving YouTube traffic !
( In fact a native Kindle app written in Python and built on Unladen Swallow was just released . )
Allison Randall was at the VM summit representing the Parrot VM , which recently released version 1.0 .
She is pushing forward the development of Pynie - Python on Parrot .
The good news is that they are going to target Python 3 immediately .
It would be ironic ( although unlikely ) if Python 3 on Parrot was completed before Perl 6 on Parrot ...
I was n't at the VM summit , but I was at the language summit .
Various topics were discussed , including how to goad and entice developers into switching to Python 3 ( 2.7 may or may not be the last release in the 2.X series ) , how the main Python project can make life easier for the alternative implementations of Python , plus a discussion of the future direction of packaging in Python .
Tarek Ziade is making real progress on the various issues around packaging and he has real momentum .
As for the discussion around alternative implementations ; the most concrete decision was to give checkin privileges to key contributors to the major implementations so that the Python tests can be improved and made more useful .
For example , both IronPython and Jython have identical modifications to several Python tests that currently depend on reference counting and deterministic finalization .
The goal is to get to the point where IronPython , Jython , and PyPy ( etc ) do n't have to maintain their own ( different ) versions of the Python tests .
As the IronPython team are currently unable to contribute their test changes back to CPython I was given commit privileges on behalf of IronPython ( although as a result of the summit they are pushing heavily to get this approved by the Microsoft lawyers ) .
I promise to only use these new powers for good , bwuahahahaha ...
As part of this the Unladen Swallow guys are intending to contribute their benchmarks to core Python , so that we can have a standard set of benchmarks for measuring the performance of Python implementations .
The discussion around this is happening on the previously unused stdlib - sig mailing list .
IronPython in Action is Available !
Nearly two and a half years after I started work on it IronPython in Action is finally available .
I can prove it too :
IronPython in Action is the first book ( in English anyway ... ) on IronPython .
It is written by myself and my colleague Christian Muirhead , with a foreword by Jim Hugunin ( the original creator of IronPython ) .
The technical editor is Dino Viehland , core IronPython developer .
Two of the chapters are available for free download :
IronPython in Action is available from :
The book is already in stock with Manning , but it will still be a few days before it arrives with Amazon .
You can find a full table of contents at About IronPython in Action .
Every dead tree version of the book comes with a free e-book ( pdf ) .
Soon I 'll write up a blog post explaining why it took so long and what it is like writing a book .
Reading through the book is a strange experience , but there really is some good stuff in there .

Sikh police officers in Britain are pushing for the development of bulletproof turbans , which they say would allow them to work as firearms officers or riot police .
To work in those units , officers are required to wear bulletproof helmets .
Due to religious rules , many Sikhs do not remove their turbans , and therefore cannot comply with the regulations , says the British Sikh Police Association .
" We are looking at the issue because it stops Sikh officers serving in all roles , " Sgt. Kashmira Singh Mann , the chairman of the association , told the BBC on Friday .
" It is a frustration for them — we see our colleagues putting their lives on the line and we want to serve alongside them . "
Research into developing ballistic turban material has already begun , he said .
He told the BBC that it is up to Britain 's Home Office to allow British officers to wear the turbans once they are developed .
" The government wants a police service that reflects the diverse communities it serves , " the Daily Telegraph quoted a Home Office spokesman as saying .
" It is down to individual forces to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate the religion or beliefs of individual officers , as far as operational requirements permit . "
There are currently around 2,000 Sikh officers serving in Britain .
WASHINGTON - Medical marijuana advocates issued a
report today aimed at drawing attention to the federal government 's
monopoly on the production of marijuana for medical research .
The
14 - page report , entitled " Obstruction of Medical Cannabis Research in
the U.S. , " highlights the federal effort to impede therapeutic research
on marijuana and exposes a conflict of interest for University of
Mississippi professor Mahmoud ElSohly , who holds an exclusive
cultivation license issued by the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) .
Americans for Safe Access ( ASA ) , the national medical marijuana
advocacy group that issued the report , draws attention to the ways in
which the federal monopoly impedes meaningful research and points to
the need for a new policy that can be implemented under the Obama
Administration .
" In the United States , research is stalled , " said Caren
Woodson , ASA 's Government Affairs Director .
" And , in some cases ,
research is blocked by a complicated federal approval process , which
restricts access to research - grade marijuana . "
Specifically , the report emphasizes the way in which government
agencies -- namely the DEA and the National Institute on Drug Abuse
( NIDA ) -- selectively delay the process by which researchers obtain
marijuana for FDA - approved studies .
The report also highlights a
federal " double standard " on medical marijuana illustrated by testimony
from public officials who concede to marijuana 's therapeutic efficacy
as long as it is produced in pill .
The report also emphasizes a 2007 ruling by the DEA 's own
Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner that " the existing supply
of marijuana [ for research ] is not adequate " and that an expansion of
such research is " in the public interest . "
Judge Bittner's
recommendations were in response to an application by University of
Massachusetts at Amherst professor Lyle Craker to be another cultivator
of marijuana for FDA - approved studies .
The application was denied by
the DEA in the final weeks of the Bush Administration and is currently
being appealed .
In March 2009 , the Los Angeles Times editorialized
that , " The attorney general ( Holder ) should heed calls to end the DEA's
obstruction of serious research into the medicinal value of marijuana . "

Perhaps most alarming is the report 's exposure of the federal license
that enables professor ElSohly to exclusively produce marijuana for the
pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt , a subsidiary of Tyco
International .
This arrangement appears to be for the purpose of
bringing to market a generic form of Marinol ( a pill of THC , the active
compound in marijuana , suspended in oil ) due to go off - patent in 2011 ,
thereby directly enriching ElSohly at a price that he and / or the
federal government sets .
To enable this scheme , the U.S. government has
requested the United Nations increase a quota ( from past years ) for
marijuana production by 900 percent .
The request to increase federal
marijuana production is a requirement of the U.N. Single Convention on
Narcotic Drugs .
Recommendations outlined in the report include , implementation of Judge
Bittner 's 2007 recommendations , streamlining the approval process for
obtaining research - grade marijuana , and ultimately a removal of
marijuana from the list of Schedule I substances , so that it can be
made available to all who would benefit from its therapeutic
properties .
" The current research challenge is to conduct large - scale
human clinical trials that evaluate the remarkable range of potential
applications for cannabis - based treatments to specific medical
conditions , " continued Woodson .

Keira Knightley is shown suffering a shocking assault in a new TV and cinema ad campaign about domestic violence for the charity Women 's Aid .
Knightley , rarely seen on - or off - screen as anything other than polished and glamorous , is attacked by her partner in the disturbing two - minute commercial , made by Joe Wright , who directed the star in the films Atonement and Pride and Prejudice .
" I wanted to take part in this advert for Women 's Aid because while domestic violence exists in every section of society we rarely hear about it , " said Knightley .
" Domestic violence affects one in four women at some point in their lifetime and kills two women every week . "
The extended ad , which will debut on 6 April in 15 - plus films in cinemas nationwide , opens with Knightley heading home from a long day of filming .
When she gets home she is assaulted , verbally and physically , by her partner , who accuses her of having a relationship with a co-star .
The commercial , made by ad agency Grey London , pans out to show that the scene is in fact occurring on a film set – but with no one else around .
The ad ends with Knightley screaming and the strapline : " Is n't it time someone called cut ? "
Knightley and Wright , who also directed the actor in a glamorous commercial for Chanel Coco Mademoiselle , have donated their time to make the commercial for free .
The campaign , which also includes poster ads , will run on TV .
However , Grey London is still in negotiations with Clearcast , the body that clears ads for broadcast , over editing and any transmission restrictions that will apply to the commercial .
Grey London is aiming to keep the graphic images of the beating in the TV campaign , which will break in mid-April , to maintain the impact of the message .
In 2007 , the agency created a shocking and much - publicised press and poster campaign for Women 's Aid featuring celebrities including Jemma Kidd , Fiona Bruce and Anna Friel made - up to look as if their faces were covered in bruises from domestic violence .

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
" I have every confidence that Chrysler will emerge from this process stronger and more competitive , " President Obama said today as the automaker filed for bankruptcy and entered into an alliance with Fiat .
Bankruptcy was necessary because the vultures circling over Chrysler , hedge funds and other investors , could n't come to an agreement , each trying to get as much of the carrion as possible .
However , a point must be made .
They are still circling over carrion -- Chrysler is dead .
There was a reason why Cerberus Capital Management agreed to forfeit its entire equity stake , to waive its share of Chrysler 's $ 2 billion of second lien debt , and to transfer its ownership of Chrysler headquarters to the new Chrysler alliance .
And why Daimler ( DAI ) agreed to give up its 19 % equity interest , to waive its share of Chrysler 's $ 2 billion of second lien debt , and to pay $ 600 million to Chrysler 's pension funds .
The future of any car manufacturer is new product .
According to some Chrysler managers who have " retired " in recent months , chairman Robert Nardelli focused on cash flow at the expense of product development .
Most of Chrysler 's recent offerings have been badge engineered : essentially old products given new nameplates .
Chrysler trashed the Jeep name with the Patriot and the Compass ; the Dodge name with the Caliber and Nitro ; and the Chrysler name with the Sebring and Aspen .
Reportedly there is hardly anything in the pipeline , future - product teams have only half the numbers of engineers necessary , and these people are constantly being second - guessed by the finance types .
This is one reason why Chrysler has the noisiest cars on the market and the cheapest - looking interiors .
While the agreement with Fiat is helpful , Chrysler does n't get much in return .
Fiat will contribute a license to use all of its intellectual property and " know how " in exchange for 20 % of the equity of the reorganized Chrysler .
In exchange for up to 15 % in additional equity , Fiat will have to introduce a vehicle produced at a Chrysler factory in the U.S. that achieves 40 mpg , provide Chrysler with a distribution network overseas , and manufacture state - of - the - art , next generation engines at a U.S. Chrysler facility .
In Europe , Fiat is a marginal player outside of Italy .
The only cars it manufactures that can get 40 mpg will have to be extensively and expensively modified to meet U.S. safety and emission standards .
That just can't be done before the 2012 model year .
The Fiat 500 , for example , is shorter , narrower , and taller than the Mini Cooper , dimensions that make it well suited for the narrow lanes and traffic - clogged streets common across Europe .
But there is a very limited market in the U.S. for " cute , " especially when many Americans still think Fiat stands for " Fix it again , Tony . "
And even then , it is unlikely that these cars can be sold at a profit , especially when Honda and Toyota already sell hybrids with even better mileage for as little as $ 19,800 .
Meanwhile , Chrysler dealers can only look forward to the modestly freshened 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chrysler 300 .
As far as distribution overseas , that is ridiculous .
Fiat adds distribution only in markets which would n't consider buying full - size pickups , minivans and American cars .
Yes ,
Fiat is a leader in diesel - engine development , but that technology is primarily of use overseas , where emissions requirements are diesel - friendly .
When all is said and done , the " new " Chrysler will be owned by the United Auto Workers , which understandably will try to maximize jobs , wages , and benefits in the short term .
We saw how well that worked when the unions owned 55 % of United Airlines ( UAUA , Fortune 500 ) .
Institutional Investor Magazine rated Ronald Glantz the top automobile analyst for seven consecutive years .
He recently retired from Pantera Capital Management , a global macro hedge fund .
Last year at this time , a presidential campaign captured the interest of many in the nation .
Tens , perhaps hundreds of thousands of voters like me supported the candidacy of Dr. Ron Paul , a long - time Republican congressman from Texas .
Those of us who are interested in liberty and personal independence put quite a bit of our hope for a better tomorrow into his candidacy , and in my opinion , rightfully so .
Dr. Paul has a long - standing record of voting in a pro-liberty manner on many of the important issues of our day .
Many may have been disappointed by the events that took place , but perhaps they should not be surprised .
Even though Dr. Paul did not become president , or even the Republican presidential nominee , his campaign has opened the eyes of a great many people and his message continues to reverberate in the American consciousness , and indeed around the world .
The freedom message is powerful and popular worldwide , not just in America .
It became evident quite early on in Ron Paul´s campaign that the establishment was not going to give in to him easily , no matter his popularity .
The establishment media did their best to marginalize him and his supporters and minimize the impact he had on the political discourse .
They did their jobs well , as far as that went , and managed to prevent huge numbers of common folk from discovering the only candidate that could really be trusted to make a difference .
But since Ron Paul was a Republican , they couldn´t keep him out of the debates like they do so many other worthy candidates with a freedom message .
Unfortunately , it may have been too little , too late against an establishment that was simply too powerful .
Still , Ron Paul managed to awaken a multitude who may have otherwise remained apathetic and feeling helpless against the rising tide of political disenfranchisement that continues to pervade not just the United States of America , but the entire world .
Despite the fact that he was given less time than other candidates at the debates , despite the fact that he was asked more insignificant questions having nothing to do with the main issues of the day than the other candidates , despite the media´s efforts to make him and his supporters look crazy and / or radical , he managed to deliver a liberty message that resonated in the fibers of the American people .
He managed to deliver a message of smaller , more transparent government that most freedom - loving individuals can agree with .
Ron Paul´s candidacy was a success in so many ways simply because the establishment and their media cronies did not want the common folk exposed to such ideas and they could do nothing to stop it .
The idea of freedom has always been dangerous to those in power .

The Best of Szandor Blestman
She was gang - raped on the orders of a Pakistani tribal council , but became a celebrated figure when she broke with tradition and spoke out against those responsible .
Now Mukhtar Mai has married the police officer assigned by the government to protect her .
After months of wooing and concerted pressure , the 37 - year - old from southern Punjab consented to become the second wife of Nasir Abbas Gabol .
Speaking from her home village , Meerali , she confirmed she was wed at the weekend .
Her husband said : " I will do whatever possible to help my wife in her efforts for the rights of women . "
Ms Mai came to international attention in 2002 when a tribal council in Pakistan 's eastern province decided to punish her family for her brother 's alleged affair with a woman from a higher caste .
In fact , a subsequent inquiry discovered , the brother had been molested by some of the woman 's family and the accusations against him were a cover -up .
But at the time , the council decreed that as punishment for the alleged affair , his sister was to be gang - raped .
" I [ was ] dragged away like a goat to the slaughter , " Ms Mai later wrote in a autobiography , In The Name Of Honour .

Although rape victims in Pakistan suffer huge social stigma , Ms Mai spoke out about the rape and identified her attackers .
Despite pressure from the highest levels not to press the case , her attackers were brought to trial and convicted before being freed on appeal .
She has since become a women 's rights activist and opened a school in her village , where the attack took place .
She has also started several centres for women .
After her attackers were released , Ms Mai has fought for a retrial .
By marrying , she has defeated another stigma for rape victims in Pakistani society .
Ms Mai , named Glamour magazine 's Woman of the Year in 2005 , met Mr Gabol in 2002 when he was posted to the police station in her village after the rape .
His parents approached her 18 months ago with the offer of marriage but she declined .
Having threatened to kill himself , the officer said he 'd divorce his first wife if she did not agree .
Eventually , his first wife 's family met Ms Mai and persuaded her to accede to his request .
" I married him on humanitarian grounds .
I did n't want three families breaking up because of me , " she said .
" You know , I never said that I would not marry .
These things are in the hands of Allah .
I said if I got a good man I would get married .
Now , with the agreement of my parents and other people , I 've got married . "

Advertisement A village has been left £ 400,000 by a 90 - year - old widow as a thank you for the welcome she had when she retired .
Margaret Allan moved to Solva in Pembrokeshire 30 years ago with husband Harry after leaving the Foreign Office .
Mr Allan died in 1990 but villagers helped his widow rebuild her life and cared for her in her final years .
In return , she has shared her estate among scores of individuals , groups and societies in the village as well as taking care of her ginger cat , Brutus .
Mrs Allan and her late husband used to holiday in the waterfront village , in St Bride 's Bay , before retiring there .
With no children , they threw themselves into village life and soon were members of local social clubs , societies and the chapel .
She was popular with everyone but I think people were in a state of shock when they realised how generous she was to them
Neighbour Viv Phillips
When her husband died , it was the friends she had made that helped her through .
Mrs Allan is leaving up to £ 10,000 to more than a dozen of her close friends and carers .
She is also giving something to everyone over the age of 60 who has lived in the village for more than 20 years .
Around 120 people are expected to receive about £ 500 each .
Her will even takes care of her companion in her final years , her ginger tom , Brutus .
It states : " To any person whom the executors agree to taking care of my cat to avoid it being put down or going into a cattery - the sum of £ 3,000 . "
Brutus has gone to live with Mrs Allan 's neighbours Dave and Viv Phillips .
Every long - standing Solva resident over 60 is to share in the estate Retired BT engineer Mr Phillips , 56 , said : " Margaret was a remarkable woman who was friends with everybody in the village .
" She and her husband built a house here when her husband retired and they quickly became part of the community .
" They were regulars at the local Ship Inn and she always entertained there on her birthdays .
" She was housebound for a while before she died but she was still so interested in the affairs of the village and the people here . "
Mrs Phillips , 53 , said : " Because they had no children they regarded the village as her family .
' Generous '
" She was popular with everyone but I think people were in a state of shock when they realised how generous she was to them . "
The carers who looked after her in the last few years of her life had £ 25,000 to be shared between them .
The local memorial hall had £ 10,000 and the same amount went to local churches while Solva Luncheon Club had £ 5,000 to be spent on drinks at Christmas .
There was £ 2,000 to the Pembrokeshire Conservative Association , £ 5,000 to the local football club and £ 5,000 to the village surgery to improve patient facilities .
Badgers
As well as money for Brutus , local cat and dog charities had £ 15,000 and £ 1,000 went to a local badger group .
Her only living relative Jan-Petter Arseth , her paternal half - sister 's grandson , who lives in Norway , had £ 10,000 .
Mrs Allan left instructions that her ashes should be scattered in the rose bushes at the garden of her home at Anchor Down , Solva , as her husband 's were 17 years earlier .
Villager Peggy Evans , 86 , said : " Margaret was a kindly , wonderful and charming lady who always thought of other people .
" This generosity is completely in character and villagers are delighted she has remembered them . "

Heroku debuted a commercial version of their Rails hosting solution last week , after a free beta stage that lasted over a year .
They describe their service as " provisionless deployment " because it operates and scales automatically , without any system administration .
While it is more expensive than alternatives and ( for now ) is based on Amazon 's EC2 cloud with its accompanying SLA limitations , we think that they have a solid offering that is worth further examination .
Last week a couple of my engineers and I spoke to James Lindebaum , co-founder of Heroku , to pick his brain about the service .
He jovially calls his company a bunch of " Ruby guys " .
A little over a year and a half ago , with support from YCombinator , James and his two partners , Adam Wiggins and Orion Henry started working on a service to allow dead - simple deployment of Rails applications .
We think that what they have accomplished is nothing short of revolutionary .
Using Heroku , deployment of a new Ruby web application from scratch is accomplished with little more than a handful of commands from your terminal .
No emails , phone calls or support tickets needed .
We 've been using their service at Hashrocket to host our internal staging environments and I can attest , it is unlike any other deployment experience you 've ever had .
Capistrano setup and deployment is a thing of the past with Heroku .
After registering with the service and creating a new application instance in Heroku 's cloud via their command - line tool , deployment is as easy as typing " git push heroku master " .
The push triggers a processing hook which compiles your application into a self - contained , read - only instance Heroku calls a “ slug ” .
It is automatically tested to assure that it can actually start .
Gem dependencies are automatically installed and maintained via a .gems manifest file in your application 's root directory , one of the only differences from a plain - vanilla Rails application .
It 's worth mentioning that Merb and Sinatra ( actually , any Rack ) applications are supported too .
Once the push succeeds , the slug is instantiated in one or more slots in a specially - designed grid computing environment , where it is given access to its database and cache information , and brought to life .
The only major database supported is Postgres .
According to James , Heroku does not currently support MySQL because it does not have transactional DDL execution .
Once a slug is activated , it becomes a fully - functioning web application called a “ dyno ” .
Each dyno is a process running on a server in the grid , and contains a unique copy of the application code , framework , middleware , Rack , application server , Ruby virtual machine , and POSIX environment .
The app server used in a dyno is their slightly - modified version of Thin , with a 250 MB memory allocation .
In response to changing demand , Heroku ’s intelligent infrastructure can launch additional , fully - independent dynos at new locations in the grid , or shut down existing idle ones .
Startup time for a new dyno is less than 2 seconds , a fact that gives Heroku ’s platform an unprecedented level of dynamism .
The custom routing system can actually put a request " on hold " while it spins up a new dyno instance in order to meet high demand .
Four dynos give the equivalent compute performance as one server instance in conventional environments .
Heroku's grid itself is built on a robust cloud computing infrastructure which allows it to expand and contract as required to accommodate as many dynos from as many different applications as necessary .
Above the grid is a sophisticated and highly concurrent routing mesh that allocates requests among the dynos .
Additional elements , such as an HTTP cache and a memory cache , reduce the requests to the dynos and database , respectively .
According to James , the routing mesh is proprietary and an important part of Heroku 's innovation .
The initial version of the system was implemented as Nginx C-modules and worked well until they reached about 10,000 applications deployed and performance started suffering .
The second version of the routing system is written in Erlang and is working very well .
Heroku itself is hosted on a pool of extra -large EC2 instances .
I asked James how much of a premium he charges over direct usage of EC2 , a question he found hard to answer .
Since Heroku includes a full system architecture that would need 6 or 7 EC2 instances to replicate for a single app , it 's hard to draw a valid price comparison between the two services .
On the other hand , the ease with which new Heroku dynos can be activated and deactivated means that cost savings from carefully managing consumption is easier to accomplish than with normal EC2 deployments .
Heroku 's pricing model is designed to charge users for only the resources they consume , and to meet the needs of users of all levels .
There are a variety of tiers to accommodate everyone , from enterprises with large applications and millions of unique hits per month , down to entry - level users .
Prices range from thousands of dollars a month down to less than a hundred , and the platform includes a free offering great for testing the service and rapid prototyping .
As mentioned earlier , we 've been using the free offering for internal staging deployments and it works very well .
Heroku ’s service has been battle tested during an extended beta period in which over 25,000 Ruby apps have been deployed to the platform by more than 23,000 different developers .
By conservative estimates , this makes Heroku ’s platform 10 times larger than the next most popular Ruby deployment provider .
Even though the commercial offering is new , James told us that he's had paying customers right from the beginning and that with support from his investors , they are ready to offer a strong and lasting commitment to new clients .
( Heroku raised a $ 3 MM Series A from Redpoint Ventures in May 2008 . )
Google and Wolfram|Alpha are providing utterly different services , and as you might expect , that means the terms of use are also utterly different .
Wolfram 's Terms of Use are not at all what I would expect from a search engine , probably because that is n't exactly what Wolfram| Alpha is providing .
It 's a computational service , at least in some cases providing computational output from various sources of data that perhaps never existed until you asked your question .
So , they claim copyright on the results and require attribution .
That 's fine with me , so long as the information provided really is uniquely theirs and not just the answer to what is meaning of life and everything , but it is different from what I 'm used to from Google and other search engines , so it is counter - intuitive , something to be aware of before I include Wolfram| Alpha output in a presentation on Groklaw or in a book .
Here 's the section on attribution and licensing in Wolfram| Alpha 's Terms of Use : Attribution and Licensing As Wolfram|Alpha is an authoritative source of information , maintaining the integrity of its data and the computations we do with that data is vital to the success of our project .
We generate information ourselves , and we also gather , compare , contrast , and confirm data from multiple external sources .
Where we have used external sources of data we list the source or sources we relied on , but in most cases the assemblages of data you get from Wolfram| Alpha do not come directly from any one external source .
In many cases the data you are shown never existed before in exactly that way until you asked for it , so its provenance traces back both to underlying data sources and to the algorithms and knowledge built into the Wolfram| Alpha computational system .
As such , the results you get from Wolfram| Alpha are correctly attributed to Wolfram| Alpha itself .
If you make results from Wolfram| Alpha available to anyone else , or incorporate those results into your own documents or presentations , you must include attribution indicating that the results and / or the presentation of the results came from Wolfram| Alpha .
Some Wolfram|Alpha results include copyright statements or attributions linking the results to us or to third - party data providers , and you may not remove or obscure those attributions or copyright statements .
Whenever possible , such attribution should take the form of a link to Wolfram| Alpha , either to the front page of the website or , better yet , to the specific query that generated the results you used .
( This is also the most useful form of attribution for your readers , and they will appreciate your using links whenever possible . )
A list of suggested citation styles and icons is available here .
Failure to properly attribute results from Wolfram| Alpha is not only a violation of these terms , but may also constitute academic plagiarism or a violation of copyright law .
Attribution is something we expect you to give us in exchange for us having provided you with a high - quality free service .

You may use any results , including copyrighted results , from Wolfram| Alpha for personal use and in academic or non-commercial publications , provided you comply with these terms .
If you want to use copyrighted results returned by Wolfram| Alpha in a commercial or for - profit publication we will usually be happy to grant you a low - or no -cost license to do so .
To request a commercial - use license , go to this form and provide the input for which you want to use the corresponding output along with information concerning the nature of your proposed use .
Your request will be reviewed and answered as quickly as practical .
Google , in contrast , has no Terms of Use on its main page .
You have to dig to find it at all , but here it is , and basically it says you agree you wo n't violate any laws .
You do n't have to credit Google for your search results .
Again , this is n't a criticism of Wolfram| Alpha , as they have every right to do whatever they wish .
I 'm highlighting it , though , because I just would n't have expected to have to provide attribution , being so used to Google .
And I 'm highlighting it , because you probably do n't all read Terms of Use .
There are other restrictions too on Wolfram| Alpha , including a warning about some types of linking : Linking to Wolfram| Alpha
We are happy for you to link to the Wolfram| Alpha website , including deep links to specific results .
Our citation formats page provides suggested formats for linking to Wolfram| Alpha , and icons you may use for this purpose .
However , if you are constructing a very large number of deep links , or any deep links that are created automatically in response to user input given on your site , you must take into account the restrictions enumerated in the section " Ways You May Use Our Free Service and Its Results . "
If you construct a website that induces others to use our service contrary to those terms , you are inducing them to violate our Terms of Use , and can be liable for those violations .
Woah .
OK .
Got it .
So , please do n't post anything from Wolfram on Groklaw , without carefully following their instructions .
Thank you !
And the meaning of all this ?
No. Not 42 .
It means Wolfram| Alpha will never replace Google .
P.S. Wolfram|Alpha does n't know about 42 .
Here 's what you get if you ask it the meaning of life and everything : " Wolfram| Alpha is n't sure what to do with your input . "
If you ask Google , first result is Wikipedia 's Phrases from The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy with a link to it .
Update : Wolfram knows 42 , if you ask it the right way .
If you ask " " What is the answer to everything ? " , you get 42 .
Update 2 : Groklaw member Cornishman points out something wonderful , WolframTones :
This uses cellular automata ( a Stephen Wolfram forté ) to generate quasi-music .
I can pass an idle hour tweaking the parameters , browsing the variations and finally selecting something half - way pleasing to listen to .
Nonetheless , Wolfram Research asserts copyright in the content .
Agents fired as probe into Colombian wiretap scandal continues
April 24 , 2009 by intelNews
By IAN ALLEN | intelNews.org |
Colombia ’s Administrative Department of Security ( Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad , or DAS ) suffered one of the most extensive purges in its history this week , when 22 of its detectives were fired in connection with an investigation into illegal wiretapping .
Last January , the scandal - prone counterintelligence service was revealed to have engaged in systematic communications interception against several public figures in Colombian political life .
Those targeted included Supreme Court judges , prominent journalists , as well as the chief of the Colombian National Police , former president Cesar Gaviria , and even the minister of defense Juan Manuel Santos .
The warrantless interceptions appeared to be part of a concerted effort to discover the “ vices and weaknesses ” of public figures , including “ details about sexual preferences ” , extra-marital affairs , and liquor or drug habits .
Interestingly , the eavesdroppers used sophisticated interception devices purchased by DAS from the US and the UK .
In February , Colombian president Alvaro Uribe curtailed DAS ’ communications surveillance powers and launched a detailed investigation into the affair .
Late on Monday , Colombia ’s attorney general said that 22 DAS detectives had been dismissed from the service and would face “ judicial and administrative investigations ” .
Moreover , the attorney general hinted that more dismissals will be announced shortly , as it appears that “ four separate groups within DAS conducted the illegal eavesdropping ” .
Although the investigation is still inconclusive , there are increasing suspicions that the surveillance scheme was devised and implemented by senior intelligence officials .

Nothing is more romantic than cutting down trees on Earth Day .
That is , if you 're Glenn Beck .
Cable TV 's hottest property celebrated Earth Day in a Rush Limbaugh - like manner earlier today .
He even outdid King Ditto .
Limbaugh only honored the coal industry , the gasoline powered automobile , the plastic bag , and the electric light today on his program .
( Click here to read that ) .
Clear-cut
But Beck chopped down a forest .
Kinda .
The popular radio and TV host claimed to have a " forest manager " on his radio program who was calling in from the Cleveland area .
The caller was tasked with clear - cutting a full acre of woodland for a deer - hunting property owner .
Explained
Tim the woodsman , deer are very curious creatures .
So if you cut down a bunch of trees , eventually they 'll come over to investigate and the property owner can blast them .
Romance
The idea of clear cutting woodland and shooting deer was almost too much for Beck to handle , especially on Earth Day .
" This is not only going to hack off all the environmentalists but all the PETA people , too , " he said .
" I need Barry White music , " he excitedly announced .
" This is almost full - fledged light some candles , this is eroticism . "
After the roar of the chainsaw fired up , Beck was told that Tim the forest manager felled two trees specifically for him and his producer .
" I laid down an Aspen tree with Glenn 's name on it and an Aspen tree with Stu 's name on it , " Tim the woodsman announced .
" So you are both involved . "
Bigger
But Beck 's glee was short - lived .
The Aspen trees were too puny he said .
" Do n't you have like a big huge oak or something ? "
Beck asked .
" No , no , we do n't cut oak .
We cut Aspen and stuff like that and we leave behind the good stuff , " the woodsman replied .
When Tim announced he would cut down an American elm , however , Beck 's spirits were lifted .
" You go to Central Park , American Elms , those are a big deal because they are almost wiped out and everything else .
So I mean , give me another Elm , just give me another American Elm , " Beck pleaded .
Wish received .
Another elm was cut down .
Benefits
Tim the woodsman then tried to explain the environmental benefits of culling trees .
But did so in a manner that Beck might appreciate .
" When you cut down trees for paper , it 's a positive thing because you wind up planting more trees and , you know , over time it 's clearly been shown that all these environmental benefits that go to these companies that are supposedly cutting down trees , blah , blah blah , blah blah , they were going to plant them anyway because it 's part of their business plan , " he explained .
How did Beck describe the experience ?
" This is like nirvana here , " Beck said .
Publicity stunt or spoof ?
Yes .
Did it enrage some on the left ?
Yes .
Beck accomplished his goals .
Twitter response
How did the Twitterverse react to Beck today ?
Mixed .
jazzgirl4 writes : " I think Glenn Beck should host Earth Day next year .
Right at the White House .
He 's done a great job celebrating today ! "
Blake _D says : " Made the mistake of watching Glenn beck today to try to broaden my horizons .
Sweet lord that man is nuts . "
AbiClaus wonders : " What the hell did trees ever do to Glenn Beck ??
He 's a little too excited about forest management . "
Taleof6 kids asks : " My son is revving up the chainsaw and cutting a tree down for Earth Day .
Should I thank Glenn Beck for this ? "
-----
Hey , we 'll never chop down your trees .
Especially if you follow us on Twitter !
I stumbled upon a website that sells posters , T - shirts , mugs , mouse pads , aprons , keepsake boxes , bags , postcards , hats , pillows , notebooks , and wall clocks , featuring such class acts as Jeffrey Dahmer , John Wayne Gacy , Ed Gein , Albert Fish , Ted Bundy , BTK , etc .
Oh . My. God .
Seriously , who would buy this stuff other than someone who wants to be just like them ?
Who would want this crap hanging on their wall ?
F % #$ the jerks who sell it .
Five heretical questions about NATO
The Council on Foreign Relations sponsored a one - day conference on " NATO at 60 " last week , and I participated in a panel discussion with Charles Kupchan of Georgetown / CFR , Ole Waever of the University of Copenhagen , and James Goldgeier of George Washington University , and I thought each of the other participants had lots of smart things to say .
( I especially liked Waever ’s metaphor for NATO as an Old Master painting — a valuable masterpiece that you ’d want to protect but not something you could duplicate , even if you wanted to ) .
Charlie , Ole and I published a little book on NATO about ten years ago , and I used part of my time on the panel to revisit my earlier arguments and assess what I got right and what I got wrong back then .
( Short answer : I was right that the disappearance of the Soviet threat and several other structural forces were gradually pulling NATO apart , but I underestimated U.S. willingness to continue subsidizing its allies ’ security and understated European willingness to continue deferring to U.S. leadership ) .
I ended my remarks with five " heretical questions , " and thought I ’d share them with you .
First , how will generational and demographic change affect NATO in the future ?
( It was not exactly a youngish crowd at the meeting ) .
If you ’re 20 years old today , you were born the year the Berlin Wall came down .
You were twelve years old when George W. Bush became President , which means you came of age in a period when the U.S. image in much of Europe sank to new lows .
The various Berlin crises , " Flexible Response , " the Euromissiles controversy , MBFR talks , and all the other familiar landmarks of NATO ’s glorious past are ancient ( and largely irrelevant ) history to the next generation .
Is an alliance led by the United States really the only world that young Europeans can or will imagine ?
What about Americans who trace their ancestry to Asia , India , or Latin America , and whose famiy ties or economic interests lie elsewhere ?
Second , why does anyone think that Europe is going to do more to provide for collective defense ?
The alliance has been arguing about " burden - sharing " since its inception , and we have both well - developed theories and sixty years of history demonstrating why the United States still bears most of the burden while Europe tends to " free - ride . "
A continent with a larger population and combined GDP than America , and with over a million men and women under arms , still ca n’t assemble the wherewithal to put 60,000 troops in the field and sustain them for any reasonable length of time .
I ’m not picking on them , mind you , because it ’s not obvious to me that Europe needs a lot more capability in order to be secure , especially with Uncle Sam devoting a much higher share of its GDP to defense .
But given that NATO ’s European members have a declining and aging populations and face no imminent external military threats , does anyone seriously believe that they are going to take on a more equal share of the collective burden ?
Third , over the next ten to twenty years ( at least ) , America ’s strategic attention is likely to be focused on the Middle East , Central Asia , and East Asia .
In light of these priorities , what is the basis for close strategic cooperation between Europe and America ?
( Note that several NATO allies have already declared that they will be withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in the next year or so , just as the United States is ramping up ) .
If the United States were one day to decide to make a greater effort to contain China ( not a certainty , of course , but hardly a far - fetched possibility ) , would Europe join in that mission ?
What would be its interest in doing so ?
Would n’t it be more likely to seek good relations with Washington and Beijing , and cultivate profitable economic ties with both sides ?
Fourth , and following from the third point , why do so many people think that NATO can or should strive for common positions on literally dozens of contentious international issues ?
For example , a recent joint study by the RAND Corporation and the Bertelsmann Stiftung in Germany calls for major diplomatic efforts to " harmonize " positions across a whole range of problems , including terrorism , WMD , the Arab - Israeli conflict , Central Asia , the reform of Bretton Woods institutions , energy security , global poverty , and a whole lot more .
But is there any reason to expect NATO to do this ?
If not , what is that point of making this level of agreement on that many issues the benchmark of alliance cohesion ?
Might we be better off picking the two or three most important issues confronting NATO ’s members , working hard to reach agreement on them , and agreeing to disagree on the others ?
Fifth and last , is there are a point one can now foresee when NATO might actually end , or at least be recognized as essentially irrelevant ?
Back in 1998 , I compared NATO to Oscar Wilde ’s Picture of Dorian Grey : it appeared youthful and vigorous , continually holding meetings , exercises , summits , and subsequently managing to fight minor wars in Kosovo and Afghanistan ( albeit without much actual coordination ) , but in reality , the alliance was growing old and tired .
Perhaps that ’s why the titles of so many recent studies of NATO use the prefix " Re - , " as in " Renewing the Atlantic Partnership , " " Revitalizing the Transatlantic Security Partnership , " or " Alliance Reborn . "
If so many smart people think NATO badly needs repair , is n’t that rather revealing ?
There ’s no need for an acrimonious divorce — and I do n’t actually expect NATO to formally dissolve — but it is hard to see it as America ’s core alliance network going forward .
Perhaps NATO at 70 will be enjoying a quiet and well - deserved retirement .
Still alive and kicking , but like most retirees , a lot less active .
The Last Days of Guantanamo An American Nightmare Could Soon End
The military tribunals in Guantanamo were established to try America 's enemies in the war on terror .
But the treatment of prisoners and blatant disregard for the rule of law at Camp Delta undermined the system and damaged the country 's reputation .
The end is in sight for the military prison .
Almost as disturbing as reading the Bush administration ’s approved menu of brutal interrogation techniques is recognizing how President George W. Bush successfully shopped for government attorneys willing to render American laws meaningless by turning words inside out .
The four “ torture ” memos , released Thursday , revealed not just that the stomach - turning reports about CIA interrogators abusing “ war on terror ” suspects were true , but that the United States had gone from a “ nation of laws ” to a “ nation of legal sophistry ” – where conclusions on law are politically preordained and the legal analysis is made to fit .
You have passages like this in the May 10 , 2005 , memo by Steven Bradbury , then acting head of the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel :
“ Another question is whether the requirement of ‘ prolonged mental harm ’ caused by or resulting from one of the enumerated predicate acts is a separate requirement , or whether such ‘ prolonged mental harm ’ is to be presumed any time one of the predicate acts occurs . ”
As each phrase in the Convention Against Torture was held up to such narrow examination , the forest of criminal torture was lost in the trees of arcane legal jargon .
Collectively , the memos leave a disorienting sense that any ambiguity in words can be twisted to justify almost anything .
So , a “ war on terror ” prisoner could not only be locked up in solitary confinement indefinitely based on the sole authority of President Bush but could be subjected to a battery of abusive and humiliating tactics , all in the name of extracting some information that purportedly would help keep the United States safe – and it would not be called “ torture . ”
Some tactics were bizarre , like feeding detainees a liquid diet of Ensure to make “ other techniques , such as sleep deprivation , more effective . ”
The memo ’s sleep deprivation clause , in turn , allowed interrogators to shackle prisoners to an overhead pipe ( or in some other uncomfortable position ) for up to 180 hours ( or seven - and - a - half days ) .
While shackled , the prisoner would be dressed in a diaper that “ is checked regularly and changed as necessary . ”
The memo asserted that “ the use of the diaper is for sanitary and health purposes of the detainee ; it is not used for the purpose of humiliating the detainee , and it is not considered to be an interrogation technique . ”
Beyond the painful disorientation from depriving a person of sleep while chained in a standing position for days , the Justice Department memos called for prisoners to be forced into other “ stress positions ” for varying periods of time to cause “ the physical discomfort associated with muscle fatigue . ”
Tiny Boxes
The detainees also could be put into small , dark boxes where they could barely move ( and in the case of one detainee , Abu Zubaydah , could have an insect slipped into his box as a way of playing on his fear of bugs ) , according to the Aug. 1 , 2002 , memo .
“ The duration of confinement varies based upon the size of the container , ” the May 10 , 2005 , memo added , with the smaller space ( sitting only ) restricted to two hours at a time and a somewhat larger box ( permitting standing ) limited to eight hours at a time and 18 hours a day .
Then , there were various slaps , grabs and slamming a prisoner against a “ flexible ” wall while his neck was in a sling “ to help prevent whiplash . ”
Prisoners also were subjected to forced nudity , sometimes in the presence of women , according to the May 10 memo .
“ We understand that interrogators are trained to avoid sexual innuendo or any acts of implicit or explicit sexual degradation , ” the memo said .
“ Nevertheless , interrogators can exploit the detainee ’s fear of being seen naked .
“ In addition , female officers involved in the interrogation process may see the detainees naked ; and for purposes of our analysis , we will assume that detainees subjected to nudity as an interrogation technique are aware that they may be seen naked by females . ”
Another approved technique was “ water dousing ” in which a detainee is sprayed with water that can be as cold as 41 degrees Fahrenheit for up to 20 minutes .
Slightly warmer water could be used to douse a prisoner for longer periods of time .
Both the 2002 and 2005 memos permitted the “ waterboard , ” a technique that involves covering a prisoner ’s face with a cloth and pouring water on it to create the panicked sensation of drowning .
The interrogators also were authorized to prevent a detainee from trying to “ defeat the technique ” by thrashing about or trying to breathe from the corner of his mouth .
“ The interrogator may cup his hands around the detainee ’s nose and mouth to dam the runoff , in which case it would not be possible for the detainee to breathe during the application of the water , ” the May 10 memo reads .
“ In addition , you have informed us that the technique may be applied in a manner to defeat efforts by the detainee to hold his breath by , for example , beginning an application of water as the detainee is exhaling . ”
At least since the days of the Spanish Inquisition , waterboarding has been regarded as torture .
The U.S. government prosecuted Japanese soldiers who used it against American troops in World War II .
But the legal reasoning of the Bush administration 's memos transformed waterboarding into an acceptable method of interrogation .
Lawyer - Shopping
Although the four released memos included the most famous one – from Aug. 1 , 2002 , which provided the initial legal cover for abusive interrogations – the three others from May 2005 may be more significant in destroying the legal cover that President Bush and his senior aides have hidden behind .
Their claim has been that they were simply operating within legal parameters set by lawyers at the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel , which is responsible for advising Presidents on the limits of their authority .
In other words , professional lawyers provided objective legal advice and the administration simply followed it .
But that claim now collides with the reality that other Justice Department lawyers – from 2003 to 2005 – overturned the initial memo and resisted its reimplementation until they were ousted .
In effect , the Bush administration appears to have gone lawyer - shopping for attorneys who would craft opinions that the White House wanted .
Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee signed the original Aug. 1 , 2002 , “ torture ” memo and other opinions granting expansive presidential powers ( drafted by his deputy John Yoo ) .
However , Bybee quit in 2003 to accept President Bush ’s appointment of him as a federal appeals court judge in San Francisco , and his successor as head of the Office of Legal Counsel , Assistant Attorney General Jack Goldsmith , withdrew many Bybee - Yoo memos as legally flawed .
Goldsmith ’s actions angered the White House , particularly Vice President Dick Cheney ’s legal counsel David Addington .
In a 2007 book , The Terror Presidency , Goldsmith described one White House meeting at which Addington pulled out a 3 - by - 5 - inch card listing the OLC opinions that Goldsmith had withdrawn .
“ Since you ’ve withdrawn so many legal opinions that the President and others have been relying on , ” Addington said sarcastically , “ we need you to go through all of OLC ’s opinions and let us know which ones you will stand by . ”
Though supported by Deputy Attorney General James Comey , Goldsmith succumbed to the White House pressure and quit in 2004 .
Still , despite Goldsmith ’s departure , Comey and the new acting head of the OLC , Daniel Levin , resisted restoring the administration ’s right to use the harsh interrogation techniques .
That did n’t occur until White House counsel Alberto Gonzales became Attorney General in 2005 and made Bradbury the acting chief of the OLC .
After signing the three “ torture ” memos in May , Bradbury was rewarded with Bush ’s formal nomination in June to be Assistant Attorney General for the OLC ( although he never gained Senate confirmation ) .
Comey Departs
With the OLC reaffirming the administration ’s interrogation techniques , Comey ’s days were numbered .
Though having been a successful prosecutor on past terrorism cases , such as the Khobar Towers bombing which killed 19 U.S. servicemen in 1996 , Comey had earned the derisive nickname from Bush as “ Cuomey ” or just “ Cuomo , ” a strong insult from Republicans who deemed former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo to be excessively liberal and famously indecisive .
On Aug. 15 , 2005 , in his farewell speech , Comey urged his colleagues to defend the integrity and honesty of the Justice Department .
“ I expect that you will appreciate and protect an amazing gift you have received as an employee of the Department of Justice , ” Comey said .
“ It is a gift you may not notice until the first time you stand up and identify yourself as an employee of the Department of Justice and say something – whether in a courtroom , a conference room or a cocktail party – and find that total strangers believe what you say next .
“ That gift – the gift that makes possible so much of the good we accomplish – is a reservoir of trust and credibility , a reservoir built for us , and filled for us , by those who went before – most of whom we never knew .
They were people who made sacrifices and kept promises to build that reservoir of trust .
“ Our obligation – as the recipients of that great gift – is to protect that reservoir , to pass it to those who follow , those who may never know us , as full as we got it .
The problem with reservoirs is that it takes tremendous time and effort to fill them , but one hole in a dam can drain them .
“ The protection of that reservoir requires vigilance , an unerring commitment to truth , and a recognition that the actions of one may affect the priceless gift that benefits all .
I have tried my absolute best – in matters big and small – to protect that reservoir and inspire others to protect it . ”
Though the full import of Comey ’s comments was not apparent at the time , it now appears that he was referring to the legal gamesmanship that Bradbury and others had used to circumvent American laws and traditions to enable the Bush administration to engage in torture .
In releasing the four memos on Thursday , President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder repeated their rejection of the Bybee - Yoo - Bradbury legal theories , but also stipulated that they would oppose any legal action against the CIA interrogators who abused detainees under the Bush administration ’s legal guidance .
Neither Obama nor Holder spoke specifically about possible legal accountability for Bush ’s compliant lawyers -- or for Bush and his top aides who oversaw the torture policies and picked the lawyers .
However , Obama recommended a focus on the future , not the past .
Calling the period covered by the four memos a “ dark and painful chapter in our history , ” Obama added that “ nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past . ”
The lack of accountability for Bush and his lawyers , however , may mean that future Presidents will follow Bush 's lead and assign some clever legal wordsmiths the job of finding ways around criminal statutes , international treaties and the U.S. Constitution .
If legal language can be interpreted any way that a President wishes – and if the U.S. Supreme Court is stocked with like - minded judges – then laws will no longer protect anyone , whether a suspected Middle Eastern terrorist or an American citizen .

Return the current shell .
It is better than print $ SHELL which can sometimes return a false value .
By setting the UNIX95 variable in HP - UX the XPG4 mode is activated , you get new options for ps and other commands , for me the best way to use this is to create an alias named ptree in root profile : alias ptree= ' UNIX95=1 ps - eH '

If the output is too big for your screen , you can always leave the ' tac ' off to see the inner calls .

I like Lydia Hearst .
She is a top model .
She does n’t mind getting naked .
She ’s from one of America ’s original power families and probably has a huge trust fund but still seems to be cool enough to get her to do my laundry for me .
Maybe it has to do with her mother being some rebel into the art and faggot scene , who married her bodyguard and is in every one of John Waters ’ movies , who was kidnapped and charged with sympathizing with her kidnappers after robbing banks with them or some shit .
I mean I do n’t really know the story , but I know that this Lydia vagina could have been a Paris Hilton about shit , but instead she gets naked for big money in low key , artistic , fashion nudes that actually turn me on alot more that Paris ’ trashy porn tapes .

Is it fashion or is it furniture ?
Twice awarded Designer of the Year , UK native Hussein - Chalayan does n’t have the typical background you ’d come to expect of a fashion designer – in fact , he ’s a tech geek who ’s translated his knowledge into fashion and that certainly comes across in his unique designs .
On exhibit now at the Design Museum in the UK until May 17th , one of Chalayan ’s exhibits have visitors to the museum asking , is it fashion or is it furniture ?
( Pics )
It ’s probably pretty clear that the innovative designers unique fashion items span both worlds ; not only are they fashion , they are furniture too !
The idea of Chalayan ’s “ Afterwords ” exhibit which features the wearable , portable architecture , is that fashion - forward designs can be found anywhere at anytime .
Take the chair covers that are transformed into modern dresses , or the cutting - edge table that also doubles as a skirt .
With Chalayan suddenly finding himself a driving force in futuristic fashions , perhaps one day fashionistas will only have to look as a far as their living rooms to decide what to wear that day .

OCaml on iPhone
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/0e411d2051ead4b4#

It 's probably too late for my current project but in > the future I 'd love to use ocaml for my iPhone projects .

I do n't know enough about the ARM > platform to say why .
Yes , we have OCaml 3.10.2 cross compiling for iPhone OS 2.2 .
We started from the instructions you mention : > [ 1 ]
http://web.yl.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~tosh/ocaml-on-iphone/
We made the same change to the .global pseudo - ops : > [ 2 ]
I had to change all '.global ' to '.globl ' in arm.s and > arm / emit.mlp .
I have no idea what that signifies .
( These are just variant spellings of the same pseudo - op for declaring a global symbol .
For whatever reason , the Apple assembler seems to insist on .globl .
Other incarnations of gas seem to allow either spelling . )
There are at least two more problems , however .
Presumably this is due to differences between the iPhone ABI and the one that the ARM port ( the old one I guess you could say ) is targeted for .
1 . arm .S uses r10 as a scratch register , but it is not a scratch register on iPhone .
It has to be saved / restored when passing between OCaml and the native iPhone code ( I think of it as ObjC code ) .
Note , by the way , that gdb shows r10 by the alternate name of sl .
This is confusing at first .
2 . arm .S assumes r9 can be used as a general purpose register , but it is used on the iPhone to hold a global thread context .
Again , it has to be saved / restored ( or at least that 's what we decided to do ) .
We saw crashes caused by both of these problems .
I 'm appending a new version of arm .
S that works for us with one OCaml thread .
( Multiple threads will almost certainly require more careful handling of r9 . )
It has the patches from Toshiyuki Maeda mentioned above and a few of our own to fix these two problems .
We have an application that has been working well for a couple months , so there 's some evidence that these changes are sufficient .
We also made a small fix to the ARM code generator ( beyond the patches from Toshiyuki Maeda ) .
In essence , it fixes up the handling of unboxed floating return values of external functions .
Things mostly work without this change ; I 'll save a description for a later post ( if anybody is interested ) .
( Editor note : see the archive link for the arm .S code . )
> Awesome , but now I 'm confused because the arm .
S you included > has lots of .global pseudo - ops .
Do you not compile it with >
Apple 's as ?
At around line 36 , you 'll see : # define global globl
As I said in private mail , you could call this a hack , but it 's a way to avoid making lots of small changes everywhere in the file .
>
What 's your app ?
We 're working on a collection of card games for casual play .
>
How are you managing the interface between Cocoa and OCaml ?
This is a big topic .
The summary is that we model Cocoa objects as OCaml objects .
We have a layer that wraps OCaml objects in smallish ObjC objects for use on the ObjC side , and wraps ObjC objects in smallish OCaml objects for use on the OCaml side .
The layer then translates between these representations as required for calls into iPhoneOS and Cocoa Touch from OCaml ( asking for iPhone OS services ) and into OCaml from iPhoneOS ( for event handling ) .
> >
We also made a small fix to the ARM code generator > >
I am very interested in any and all information needed to get a > correct OCaml port suitable for use in App Store applications .
>
Please share !
OK , I 'll gather up our patch and send it to the list .
I want to separate out our changes from those of Toshiyuki Maeda [ 1 ] .
As I said , our patch fixes calls to external C float functions such as floor ( ) , sin ( ) , and so on .
There is special handling in ocamlopt to allow them to be unboxed , but the ABI of the existing ARM code generator does n't match the iPhone ABI .

EPTCS launch
Archive : http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/browse_thread/thread/a309fd7489847c76#
With this email , we are launching Electronic Proceedings in Theoretic Computer Science ( EPTCS ) a new international refereed open access venue for the rapid electronic publication of the proceedings of workshops and conferences , and of festschrifts , etc , in the general area of theoretical computer science , broadly construed .
We do not charge authors or event organisers for electronic publication in EPTCS in any way .
If hard - copies of proceedings are desired , event organisers have the choice of organising the printing themselves or taking advantage of a standard contract we will make with a printing house .
Copyright on all papers is retained by the author , and full - text electronic access to all papers is freely available , without any need for registration or subscription .
Permanent archival of EPTCS publications is ensured by organising EPTCS as an overlay of the Computing Research Repository ( CoRR ) : see arXiv.org .
The content of EPTCS will be indexed by DBLP .
Only original papers will be considered for publication in EPTCS : manuscripts are accepted for review by an EPTCS conference or workshop with the understanding that the same work has not been published , nor is presently submitted , elsewhere .
However , full versions of extended abstracts published in EPTCS , or substantial revisions , may later be published elsewhere .
The submission and refereeing process is handled entirely by the organisation of the conference , workshop or festschrift to which the paper is submitted .
Our editorial board carefully selects which workshops and conferences can be trusted to select scientific papers of quality only , and only those events will be granted a contract to fill a volume of EPTCS .
Our editorial board consists of : Luca Aceto Rob van Glabbeek Gordon Plotkin Rajeev Alur Lane A. Hemaspaandra Vladimiro Sassone Krzysztof R. Apt Matthew Hennessy Robert H. Sloan Lars Arge Bartek Klin Wolfgang Thomas Ran Canetti Evangelos Kranakis Irek Ulidowski Luca Cardelli Shay Kutten Dorothea Wagner Rocco De Nicola Nancy Lynch Martin Wirsing Jose ' Luiz Fiadeiro Aart Middeldorp Moti Yung Wan Fokkink Benjamin Pierce Further information can be found on our website : http://eptcs.org/.
In the hope this initiative will benefit the theoretical computer science community ,

Before taking a look at the monthly jobs data , let 's take a look at Initial Unemployment Insurance Claims from The US Department of Labor .

Jobs Decline 12th Consecutive Month
This morning , the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) released the December Employment Report .
In December 2007 I predicted a jobs disaster every month this year .
That prediction is now 12 for 12 .
Here is a synopsis of the BLS report .
Nonfarm payroll employment declined sharply in December , and the unemployment rate rose from 6.8 to 7.2 percent , the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today .
Payroll employment fell by 524,000 over the month and by 1.9 million over the last 4 months of 2008 .
In
December , job losses were large and widespread across most major industry sectors .
Nonfarm Payroll employment has shrunk to mid-2006 levels .
Establishment Data
click on chart for sharper image
Highlights
524,00 jobs were lost in total
101,000 construction jobs were lost
149,000 manufacturing jobs were lost
273,000 service providing jobs were lost
91,000 retail trade jobs were lost
67,000 professional and business services jobs were lost
45,000 education and health services jobs were added
22,000 leisure and hospitality jobs were lost
7,000 government jobs were added
Birth / Death Model In Outer Space
BLS Black Box
The net birth / death model component figures are unique to each month and exhibit a seasonal pattern that can result in negative adjustments in some months .
These models do not attempt to correct for any other potential error sources in the CES estimates such as sampling error or design limitations .
Note that the net birth / death figures are not seasonally adjusted , and are applied to not seasonally adjusted monthly employment links to determine the final estimate .
The most significant potential drawback to this or any model - based approach is that time series modeling assumes a predictable continuation of historical patterns and relationships and therefore is likely to have some difficulty producing reliable estimates at economic turning points or during periods when there are sudden changes in trend .
Household Data
In December , the number of persons who worked part time for economic reasons ( sometimes referred to as involuntary part - time workers ) continued to increase , reaching 8.0 million .
The number of such workers rose by 3.4 million over the past 12 months .
This category includes persons who would like to work full time but were working part time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find full - time jobs .
Persons Not in the Labor Force
About 1.9 million persons ( not seasonally adjusted ) were marginally attached to the labor force in December , 564,000 more than 12 months earlier .
These individuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months .
They were not counted as unemployed because they had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey .
Among the marginally attached , there were 642,000 discouraged workers in December , up by 279,000 from a year earlier .
Discouraged workers are persons not currently looking for work specifically because they believe no jobs are available for them .
The other 1.3 million persons marginally attached to the labor force in December had not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey for reasons such as school attendance or family responsibilities .

Depression Statistics
There is no official definition of depression .
Here is mine :
When the U - 6 unemployment rate rises above 12.5 in conjunction with a stock market that is down close to 50 % , the CPI is negative , and nominal wages are stagnant , it 's an economic depression .
We are in one .
Small Businesses Have Largest Decline In Seven Years
Bear in mind that government cannot really " create " any jobs per se .
It can raise taxes and shift private sector jobs creation to government jobs creation ( typically a malinvestment ) , and it can bring production and consumption forward for those jobs that are genuinely needed ( filling potholes ) , but once the potholes are filled , one has to ask the question , " What will we do for an encore ? "
Addendum :
the CPI is negative , and nominal wages are stagnant
CHICAGO --
Even before he took office six years ago , former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich , his brother and a circle of associates conspired to use the governor 's office to enrich themselves at the expense of taxpayers and " honest government , " a federal grand jury indictment charged Thursday .
The 75 - page , 19 - count indictment charged Mr. Blagojevich , 52 years old , Robert Blagojevich , 53 , two of the ex-governor 's former aides and two business associates with a variety of felonies , including allegations the former governor schemed ...
Well , this has been a depressing day .
John Odom , the minor leaguer who made news last year when he was traded for 10 maple bats , has died of an accidental overdose of drugs and alcohol .

Thrown off of his high school team , knocking around in the San Francisco Giants ' farm system , Odom was a lost soul who finally landed with the Laredo Broncos of the Independent United League .
He had been traded by the Calgary Vipers for 10 bats — a story that made headlines and got quite a few chuckles in May of last year .
He seemed to handle it well , too .
A former prospect in the San Francisco Giants ' chain — future Cy Young winner Tim Lincecum bunked on his couch in Class A ball —
Odom gladly agreed to interviews .
He kidded about the kooky deal that made him famous , saying it would make a better story if he reached the majors someday .
" People are like , ‘ I 'd kill myself ' and stuff , " Odom said at the time , dismissing any such notion .
Three weeks after the trade , he abruptly left the team .
Six months after the trade , he was dead .
The medical examiner said Odom 's death in Georgia on Nov. 5 at age 26 was an accidental overdose from heroin , methamphetamine , the stimulant benzylpiperazine and alcohol .

So some are making this out to be the tragic story of a ballplayer who was haunted by his failures in the game , forever dogged by the novelty circumstances of the famous trade .
But it probably had very little to do with that ; it was a lot simpler , most likely .

" Me han censurado en México "
Pie de foto , Martínez obtuvo el Premio Ortega y Gasset en 2008 .
La periodista mexicana Sanjuana Martínez afirmó que la libertad de expresión en su país se ve particularmente limitada cuando se denuncian casos de corrupción dentro de la Iglesia Católica .
De visita en Londres , Martínez dijo que su trabajo periodístico ha sido censurado duramente en los últimos años , sobre todo desde que empezó a denunciar supuestos casos de pederastia de sacerdotes mexicanos .
La reportera estuvo en la ceremonia de los premios a la Libertad de Expresión 2009 que organiza cada año el instituto Índice de Censura , donde participó entre los nominados .
Señaló que tras publicar sus dos libros " Prueba de Fe. Las redes de cardenales y obispos en la pederastia clerical " ( Editorial Planeta , 2007 ) y " Manto púrpura .
Pederastia clerical en tiempos del cardenal Norberto Rivera Carrera " ( Editorial Grijalbo , 2007 ) , sufrió el retiro de sus obras de una de las mayores cadenas de libros del país , e incluso fue objeto de amenazas de muerte .
Derecho fundamental
La periodista obtuvo el año pasado el Premio Ortega y Gasset , que convoca el diario El País , por sus reportajes sobre los supuestos delitos de pederastia cometidos por el clero .
El galardón lo obtuvo en la categoría de Mejor Trabajo de Investigación .
" El mérito de mis libros fue romper el cerco de silencio " , dijo en entrevista con BBC Mundo .
" Cuando presenté el primer libro en México había compañeros de distintos medios de comunicación nacionales , que me decían 'es que nosotros contra la Iglesia no podemos publicar nada .
Sencillamente lo tenemos prohibido' " .
" Los dos son textos que representan la lucha por la libertad de información en México " , afirmó .
Martínez señaló que en México hay establecimientos de libreros que rechazan estas dos obras argumentando que " son católicos y que sencillamente no pueden vender una cosa así " .
" Cuando en realidad " , asegura , " se trata de libros fundamentados , sustentados en la investigación , en la comprobación de fuentes " .

WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama 's inaugural budget sets the stage for an expansion of the federal work force and for hundreds of new rules that would widen Washington 's involvement in the workings of private business .
If enacted by Congress , the budget initiatives will mark a clear end to the deregulatory philosophy of the Bush administration , signaling profound change for the nation 's biggest businesses .
Mr. Obama envisions broad - based government hiring in the budget , from bomb detectors to food - safety inspectors .
Some defense companies face a decline in Pentagon business , as the budget proposes to replace outside contractors with 33,600 civil servants by 2015 .
Other U.S. agencies would get authority to hire hundreds of additional workers , many in regulatory - enforcement jobs .

In what is being described as an “ unprecedented global alert , ” the International Criminal Police Organization today issued its largest - ever most wanted list for 85 terrorist suspects , who are sought by Saudi Arabia for allegedly plotting attacks against the country and for suspected links to al Qaeda .
“ Never before has INTERPOL been asked to alert the world about so many dangerous fugitives at one time , ” said Secretary General Ronald K. Noble in a statement .
“ We know that we are approaching the 16th anniversary of the first World Trade Center bombing on Feb. 26 , 2009 and therefore must be especially vigilant of fugitive al Qaeda terrorists .

A major short - coming of Intelligent Design Theory has been its reluctance to identify the designer .
This study addresses this problem and firmly establishes the reality of Intelligent Design .
Most design theorists are uncomfortable talking about the designer .
Wedgiecentric analysis has demonstrated this reluctance to be part of a sinister plot to foist a theocracy on an unsuspecting , scientifically - illiterate , Bush - electing public .
If intelligent design is to be recognized for the science that it is , it must eschew this deception and show the scientific community the designer .
It has been proven that the bacterial flageller was designed .
It is so complex that it must have been designed .
It ’s not just complex ; it ’s really , really complex .
Think of the most complex thing you can think of .
Well , the bacterial flageller is way more complex than that .
Ergo , it could not possibly have come together in a tornado , so it just had to be designed .
Since designers must be in the vicinity of their designs , I hypothesized that a simple survey of flagerated bacterium would turn up the designer , sooner or later .
I decided to look through 1 x 10^150 bacterial colonies in the hope of detecting the designer .
The following is a re-enactment of the study I completed .
Results
The investigator looked at 3 plates / day for 120 days in the hope of seeing the designer .
Since each plate contained approximately 300 colonies , a total of 1.08 x 10^5 colonies were looked at .
No positive colonies were scored .
Discouraged by the idea of screening through another 145 plates , a minor adjustment in the methodology was made ( see Methods ) .
After appropriate set up , the investigator began to sense the designer was near late one night when no one was in the lab .
The investigator quickly secured plate # 112 with bacteria ( Figure 1 ) .
The investigator heard a faint sound coming from plate .
A closer look at the plate showed nothing unusual ( Figure 2 ) .
The plate was returned to the bench when the sound was heard again .
This time , the investigator took the plate and put it under a dissecting scope ( Figure 3 ) .
As can be seen from the re-enactment , a faint blue dot was seen on one of the colonies .
At this point , the investigator pulled out the special designer - detecting instrument and used it to enhance the image of the scope .
Something clearly was on the colony ( Figure 4 ) , but the image was oddly blurred , as if the designer was trying to hide .
The investigator then took his two hands , rubbed his eyes three times , waited precisely 12 seconds , and looked again .
This time , the designer was identified as clearly seen in the re-enactment shown in Figure 5 .
Discussion
The designer has been seen by at least one investigator .
With this growing consensus , it is time to introduce design into the public high schools .
Future studies will attempt to make contact with the designer .
Methods
100 micrograms of lysergic acid diethylamide was consumed by the investigator prior to sceening bacteria plates .
After a delay of 10 minutes , 100 ml of 95 % ethanol was also added to the investigator .
The designer - detecting instrument ( DDI ) was constructed by purchasing a magnifying lens from K - Mart and sending it to Venetian Way Holdings Inc. for a blessing .
The DDI can be used in conjunction with any standard dissecting scope by using it while looking through the eye pieces .
According to Rasmussen Reports , “ seventy - five percent ( 75 % ) of Americans believe the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right of an average citizen to own a gun , according to a new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey .
Just 14 % say gun ownership is not a constitutional right .
Eleven percent ( 11 % ) are not sure . ”
Of interest are these findings :
Although the plurality of Americans ( 47 % ) do not see a need for stricter gun control laws in this country , 43 % believe the Obama Administration will try to implement such laws .
Seventy - nine percent ( 79 % ) of married American support the right to gun ownership , as do 68 % of non-marrieds .
Despite the oft - cited concern about the danger of loaded weapons to children in the home , those with children in the house are a bit more likely to acknowledge gun ownership rights than those without children living with them .
Of concern is this :
Gun sales have reportedly risen in recent months because of concerns about the worsening economy and fears that President Obama will push for limits on gun ownership .
Attorney General Eric
Holder already has said the administration wants to restore the ban on so - called assault weapons that lapsed in 2004 .
Perhaps we can “ hope ” that Obama and the Congress wo n’t try to “ change ” hundreds and hundreds of years of American tradition , as well as one of the most basic of natural rights .
While we ’re on the general topic of the Constitution , Doug Mataconis provides a possible constitutional solution for D.C. residents to have both their representation and their taxation , too .
Why do n't we take a huge chunk of those BILLIONS we are throwing at GM et.
al. and throw them to a company which is at the forefront of design and technology which could wean us away from foreign oil , and move us in the Green direction ?
Lets take a look at Tesla 's newest offering :
Tell me this is not a sexy car that you would n't be proud to own and sport around town ?
Its range before recharge ?
300 miles !
I remember when I was working as an advertising executive for a small yellow pages firm back home , I used to have to travel all over the county meeting clients and making sales pitches .
I dont think I EVER drove more than 300 miles in a day .
How long to recharge ?
4 hours on a regular 220V plug .
If you get a home 480V outlet you can charge this baby up in just 45 minutes .
The current cost ?
That is the part that would need serious government and private investment to bring down ( the former would encourage the latter ) :
around 50,000 dollars .
If the US Government was serious about " going Green " and building a 21st century transportation infrastructure why not invest in a company which could be scaled UP right now , creating high paying manufacturing jobs and helping the environment in one fell swoop ?

initiative to corner the electric car market .
China Vies to Be World ’s Leader in Electric Cars By KEITH BRADSHER
Published : April 1 , 2009 TIANJIN , China — Chinese leaders have adopted a plan aimed at turning the country into one of the leading producers of hybrid and all - electric vehicles within three years , and making it the world leader in electric cars and buses after that .
The goal , which radiates from the very top of the Chinese government , suggests that Detroit ’s Big Three , already struggling to stay alive , will face even stiffer foreign competition on the next field of automotive technology than they do today .
“ China is well positioned to lead in this , ” said David Tulauskas , director of China government policy at General Motors . "

After spending three years in Meet Your Makers , which let go of their Warcraft III and Starcraft squads in January due to “ strategy concern ” , Jae Ho ' Moon ' Jang , one of the most illustrious players - if not the most - penned a three - year contract with WeMade FOX that worth 700,000,000 won , approximately 473,037 USD based on exchange rate today .
Moon relished the chance to play for a home - ground team , and is keen to bring more trophies in the future .
He said in the press conference earlier today , " I am honored to play for a Korea professional gaming team for Koreans .
As setting good circumstance of playing , I will give everything to my fans and FOX team by winning lots of titles in 2009 .
" We Made FOX manager , in the meantime , hinted at more players making their ways to the newly formed team , " We are concerned with it ( training ) .
There are n't many first class players in Korea , and the training condition is pretty poor so players usually train with foreign players .
We will introduce more quality players in the near future so I am quite confident of our training scheme .
"
It not only made the 22 - year - old the best paid player in Warcraft III scene , but also the second best paid player in the whole e-Sports scene in Korea , slightly behind Starcraft legend Yoon Yeol ' NaDa ' Lee , who signed a contract with WeMade FOX that worth 750,000,000 won back in 2007 .
The other familiar active Starcraft players do n’t even come close to Moon , as “ revolutionist ” Bisu ’s current contract worth 150,000,000 won , while the other top four players in KeSPA March Ranking , Young Ho ' Flash ' Lee Jae Dong ' Jaedong ' Lee and Byung Goo ' Stork '
Song earn significantly less .
Troubled insurer American International Group Inc. , now 80 % owned by U.S. taxpayers , spent the weekend deflecting mounting criticism of how government funds have been funneled to various banks and used to pay employee bonuses at the business unit that almost sank the company .
After calls for more transparency , AIG disclosed Sunday that roughly two - thirds of the $ 173.3 billion in federal aid it received has been paid out to trading partners such as banks and municipalities in the U.S. and abroad .
The disclosures came as AIG was lambasted for about $ 450 million in bonus payments planned for employees at a business unit that lost $ 40.5 billion last year .
The unit 's woes pushed the company to near - collapse , forcing the government bailout .
The disclosures highlighted the increasingly close but uncomfortable relationship between AIG and the U.S. government , which six months ago was a restless creditor and now has little choice but to be a patient ally .
" Something is terribly wrong with this picture , and the reckless behavior at AIG must stop immediately , " said Rep. Elijah Cummings ( D. , Md. ) , in a statement Sunday .
He called on AIG 's government - appointed chief executive , Edward Liddy , to resign over the bonus - payments issue .

Cannabis Culture Magazine will be ceasing publication of its print version and moving to an entirely online format due to increasing financial constraints , the prospect of further economic downturn , and the increasing obsolescence of print media in a digital world .
Watch for some major changes in the near future as we transform CannabisCulture.com into a revamped marijuana super - site .
Click here to tell us what you would like to see on the new CC website .
Message from Cannabis Culture Publisher and Editor - In - Chief Marc Emery :
I have decided to cease publication of Cannabis Culture Magazine ‘s print version and move to an entirely online format .
Magazine advertising and circulation are predicted to fall off in the near future and matters will get worse if I continue to print a paper edition .
We printed 62,000 copies of issue # 73 .
Soon afterward , magazine distributor Anderson News – who handles 25 % ( about 12,500 ) of our magazines that go to newsstands – went out of business .
This was terrible news for all magazines , as Anderson News was one of the largest publication distributors in North America .
That news led to our main distributor , Disticor , ordering 9,000 fewer copies of # 75 ( had we printed it ) , meaning our immediate future sales on newsstands would have been severely reduced .
Ultimately , each issue lost about $ 35,000 to $ 45,000 , and my Cannabis Culture Headquarters store in Vancouver , BC was forced to pay for the losses .
That was an unsustainable burden we cannot afford going into the future .
Cannabis Culture Magazine began as the Marijuana & Hemp Newsletter ( then called Cannabis Canada , then renamed Cannabis Culture ) in 1994 , the year the World - Wide Web debuted .
In those days , all information about marijuana , hemp and our culture was available only in the monthly High Times Magazine and nothing else .
We were the first web site ( HempBC.com ) in the world about cannabis , appearing in November 1994 , and in January 2000 , we began the very first cannabis video streaming website ( www.Pot.tv) online .
Now there are thousands of websites devoted to cannabis information , photography , commentary , grow information , and political news on an hourly or daily basis .
Our magazine , appearing once every eight weeks , simply cannot stay abreast of current events and the modern - day demand for immediate news and material .
Our organizations are often being quoted , but the references are from our online material and archives , videos , movies , TV interviews and other multi-media .
At the same time , feedback has dropped from readers and the effort to produce a print copy of CC Magazine required enormous manpower and a small Canadian forest for each issue .
The future of all print media is bleak .
Many magazines and newspapers could go out of business by the end of the year , including The National Post , Sports Illustrated , Maxim , and many others .
Check out the latest Sports Illustrated ; it has only 10.5 pages of advertising in the entire issue .
TIME Magazine has only eight pages of advertising .
Magazines rely on advertising , and as the economy worsens , companies are not able to afford ads like they used to .
The digital age is truly the future .
Magazines do n’t have nearly the impact they once did , because all information is available faster and free online .
Our www.CannabisCulture.com website gets a huge number of visitors and readers – much more than the magazine ever did – so that ’s where we will put all of our effort .
It ’s clear that printed media is no longer sustainable or effective .
If we focus on our online presence , we can raise revenue and be more efficient and competitive with information .
We will continue our pioneering ways by taking advantage of our Pot - TV video capabilities and our extensive contacts and reputation around the world .
Here ’s a breakdown of CC Magazine ’s unsustainable costs .
Of the 62,000 printed for # 73 , only 35,000 sold , meaning 27,000 got destroyed ( which is typical with magazines , but very environmentally unfriendly ) .
Now , with chaos in our distribution system , our potential sales would drop to under 30,000 .
The circulation revenue for that is a disappointing $ 44,000 per issue ; advertising revenue is only providing $ 30,000 per issue , but it costs $ 64,000 to print 62,000 copies .
It ’s another $ 10,000 to ship to distributors , stores and subscribers .
Those costs are covered by revenue from all sources , but the cost of producing the magazine is approximately $ 16,000 for material ( writers and photographers ) , $ 32,000 for the staff of six people who work in 8 - week cycles to produce the magazine , $ 4,000 an issue in promotion , posters , subscription cards , and much more that were not covered by revenue the magazine generated .
Subscriptions never made money , and we never had more than 1,400 subscribers at any one time .
Each magazine cost about $ 2 each to produce , plus 60 cents to ship in Canada , $ 1.50 to ship to USA , $ 3.00 abroad .
Envelopes and packing took another 25 cents per issue .
This huge cost of producing CC Magazine has meant our retail stores and mail order have had to pour $ 20,000 into the magazine each month for the past 3.5 years – ever since the Marc Emery Direct Seed catalog was canceled from CC Magazine in July 2005 ( after the US Drug Enforcement Administration raided my seed business and set me up for extradition to the US – please see www.NoExtradition.net if you do n’t know this story , and to help me fight to stay in my home country Canada ) .
When I had the seed business , I paid $ 35,000 for my 12 - page catalog to appear in each issue .
In those days , CC Magazine had 20 pages of additional advertising that produced $ 30,000 , so combined , advertising generated $ 65,000 per issue .
We ’re done our best to keep CC Magazine alive , but it has been a growing revenue drain .
All subscribers will get a credit in the mail worth 25 % more value than what we owe you for the remainder of your subscription .
The credit is redeemable for merchandise from the CC Mail Order catalogue , CC online store ( www.CannabisCulture.com/store) or in our CCHQ store ( 307 West Hastings Street , Vancouver BC , 604-682-1172 ) .
If there is no merchandise you would like to receive , then we will reimburse your remaining subscription money .
I am extremely proud of our 15 years of publishing Cannabis Culture in print .
Our activist publication inspired so many people , and did numerous good things for the movement .
We will continue to devote our time to changing the world and ending the war on drugs .
Our Cannabis Culture and Pot - TV websites , the CCHQ retail store , the BC Marijuana Party , and CC ’s online mail order will all continue – and they will be able to do even more now that CC Magazine ’s losses wo n’t be subsidized .
It is the end of an era , and I know many readers will miss CC Magazine , but it ’s also a new beginning .
I hope you join us on our journey into the future .
Thank you for your support over the years .

Individuality is the main achievement of European civilization .
We are playing Go , not like the common people .
We created Go Federation at our home country ,
in Russia in 2004 .
We made it , because there is a big difference between our Federation
and other Go federations and communities around the world .
We changed our life a lot , after we started to play Go .
Go gives us different possibilities to use in the real life .
We are the members of Go family – the family of amateurs and Go masters .
I am glad to say , that this newsletter , with Mr. Alexandre Dinerchtein ,
as the editor in chief , gives us new ideas .
By reading this newsletter , we will get a chance to make acquaintance with each others ,
and I believe that you will not be disappointed of it .
Somebody asked me : “ What is the goal of this newsletter ? ”
I answered : “ What is the goal of playing Go ? To win the game ?
For me it ’s a pleasant journey .
The same as the newsletter ” .

In the Republican Party 's ongoing struggle to build an online political machine to rival the formidable new media operation fielded by Barack Obama in 2008 , many conservatives pinned their hopes on Cyrus Krohn , the 38 - year - old alumnus of Microsoft and Yahoo who was heading up the Republican National Committee 's e-campaign efforts .
Admirers pointed to innovations like inviting Internet users to help draft the party 's platform , and credit Krohn with growing the GOP 's e-mail list to more than 12 million addresses from less than 2 million .
He is also credited with building a Republican presence on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter , and with helping to orchestrate the first RNC Tech Summit last month .
In January , Red State founder Erick Erickson called him the party 's " indispensable man . "
On Thursday , he handed in his resignation .
Krohn announced his departure in a blog post ( and accompanying tweet , of course ) on the site of the e-Voter Institute , titled " RNC - YA . "
Though he opens with a fierce blast at " the blog - flogging of political simpletons " who doubt the party 's ability to recover the lead online , he also laments the paucity of serious coders — as opposed to blog pundits and Twitter activists — working to build tools and platforms for the GOP .
" Maybe , " he offers , " we should start providing computer science scholarships in exchange for a commitment to serve our party ? "
Krohn — who came aboard during the tenure of former RNC Chair Mike " do it in the Facebook " Duncan — was seen as a potential casualty of the flux following the ascension of newly - minted chair Michael Steele .
Red State 's Erickson warned that the McCain campaign diaspora had unleashed a horde of staffers eager to " oust Cyrus and take over the technology he has started building . "
Erickson became one of Krohn 's most vocal boosters :
In my post , I discussed who Cyrus Krohn is and why keeping him at the RNC is important .
Since then , all the thinking we have done at RedState over endorsements , etc. has come down to one this : will Cyrus be kept at the RNC .
He is that important .
We will know whether Michael Steele is serious about bringing change to the party by , ironically enough , whether he brings change to the e-Director ’s position .
Change in that position will most likely mean he was not serious about change at all .
Krohn himself joined a Facebook campaign devoted to urging Steele to keep him on .
Now , amid growing conservative criticism of Steele 's leadership and a week after the resignation of the RNC 's finance director , Krohn is headed back to Seattle — apparently without an immediate job lined up .
We 're hearing conflicting things about what actually went down , but the consensus online appears to be that this loss is a serious setback to the party 's tech efforts .
For the moment , e-campaign queries to the RNC are being directed to Krohn protege Todd Van Etten .

Sarah Palin gives good ‘ stump ’ and is easy on the eyes , but here is how the GOP could destroy itself by nominating this baggage machine .
( Ed. Note : This is a guest column by Bob Roberts )
The only certainty about Gov. Sarah Palin is that she continually generates baggage .
When she was first nominated as VP support for McCain , the pregnant daughter story came out .
Immediately the focus was split if not diverted .
McCain had to make a statement that he knew all along and he was OK with it , so his message was diverted .
The world was a lot more interested in the morality of the situation than the political message of the candidates .
And then of course the boy - friend was trotted out , more distraction .
Advertisements
The Republican campaign quickly became the Sarah Palin story , some loved her and some hated her .
All the coverage was about why we hate or love Sarah .
The Republican Party and John McCain had long since ceased to interest anybody .
Next stop was the oddly named baby hers ?
Or in some devious plot had she taken responsibility to spare her equally strangely named child , Bristol ?
My goodness , in the space of a few days Sarah Palin had generated enough baggage to give life to any number of soap operas .
The Republican convention could n’t have been better , all the Palins and the new piece of baggage , the bridegroom to be .
So as usual all the attention went to how shining the Palins looked and of course all the details of the latest member of her cast had to be discovered and drooled over before being fed to the ever hungry public .
Politics ?
Why bother ?
Her speech was a rousing success , so much so that the only mention of McCain was that he should drop to second on the ticket .
But had we been more experienced Sarah watchers we would have been waiting for the other shoe , the baggage shoe , to drop ; and it did .
The clothes worn by the new shiny Palins + 1 had been bought for them !!
Shock !!
Outrage !!
Who ever heard of such a scandal ?
Politics ?
Do n’t be silly we ’re talking about dresses and trousers and dare I mention it underwear .
Of course a story was quickly cobbled together , some may have believed it .
The media demanded it .
It had to be true .
All along the Republican Party had planned to make a donation of second hand clothes to some nameless beneficiary , Can you really imagine that when these clothes were being purchased that they were told it was only for a loan ?
Can you imagine Sarah , who we now know to be a bit of a junket junkie tolerating that ?
Who is currently parading around in Sarah ’s old panties ?
When Sarah was interviewed she came across as a bit stupid .
Well of course that could not be tolerated so the story had to change to what a bunch of bitches the interviewers were .
Was this more baggage ?
Not half .
Her debate with Biden :
In my opinion she would have won the debate comfortably , but because she is Sarah she just had to add baggage .
“ Can I call you by your first name ? ” and then winking at the camera , more than once .
“ Say it ai n’t so Joe ! ”
You could say I felt a little bit sick in my mouth but that would be an understatement , only a full heave could suffice .
And then she went ‘ off message ’ .
I ’m sure that by this time the Republican Party hoped she would self - destruct .
Sarah could n’t have been more of a liability .
If she had appeared nude on Hannity , nobody would have been very surprised .
Of course now after the election the boy - friend has disappeared .
Was he ever for real or only for show ?
All her junkets are being repaid from her own pocket and it turns out she owes a little tax .
It is still less than a year since Sarah was selected and already it seems like some far - off fairy tale from a bygone age .
At one time there were leaks in the McCain camp which were giving ‘ hot goss ’ about madam but McCain silenced them .
Will they ever speak again ?
By next election season she will be all bright and shiny and ready to go .
But watch out for the baggage .
Einstein should have included Sarah in one of his equations because where you have Sarah you have baggage and the story always becomes about the baggage .
A thorny proposal to scrap Ontario's Human Rights Tribunal could stir up the kind of controversy that sunk the Progressive Conservatives in the last provincial election , leadership hopeful Christine Elliott warned Tuesday .
Rivals Tim Hudak and Randy Hillier both say they 'd abolish the human rights body and have discrimination cases heard in courts .
They argue the Ontario Human Rights Commission – established in 1961 by a Tory government – and the Human Rights Tribunal are trampling on individual rights and wasting taxpayer dollars on ``nuisance " claims .
It 's become a hot - button issue in the race , which will soon see all four candidates face off in a series of debates across the province .
There are problems that need to be fixed , but abolishing the tribunal would " throw the baby out with the bath water , " Elliott said in an interview with The Canadian Press .
The ruling Liberals would rejoice if the party adopted the proposal , which could tank as badly with voters as former leader John Tory 's doomed promise to extend funding to faith - based schools in the 2007 election campaign , she said .
" If we are very serious about winning the next election , I think we need to take a look at this policy and how that will be perceived by the people of the province of Ontario , " Elliott said .
" I think there 's nobody that would like to see us get rid of the human rights commission and tribunal than ( Premier ) Dalton McGuinty , because I think this particular issue has the potential to be the faith - based issue that 2007 was . "
Tory never recovered and resigned the leadership after failing to win a seat in a March byelection .
Hudak 's campaign team insists there 's no comparison between the two policies .
" This is a dysfunctional system that is doing a grave disservice , and the proposals that are being put out there – to find new and better ways of dealing with this – are certainly realistic ones , " said Jeremy Adams , a spokesman for Hudak .
Hudak is proposing that complaints of discrimination go to specially trained judges , similar to those in family law courts , which would move the province towards an " evidence - based " system rather than one " built on hurt feelings , " he said .
" It 's not a system that 's bound by the rules of evidence , which creates problems for legitimate complaints getting through the system , because there 's no ability to deal with complaints that are frivolous and politically motivated . "
The proposal may win votes in the leadership race , but it could cost the Tories dearly in a provincial election , said Henry Jacek , a politics professor at Hamilton 's McMaster University .
The Tories need to win Toronto - area suburban ridings to defeat the Liberals , but could end up alienating new immigrants who live in those areas and feel the tribunal is protecting them from discrimination , he said .
" If I were an adviser , I would n't advise a Conservative candidate to essentially make this a big issue in the general election campaign , because I think it will probably hurt them in ridings that they need to win , " he said .
Elliott echoed that sentiment , adding that the party must " be careful " with the idea of scrapping the tribunal , which is still needed in Ontario .
Most victims of discrimination can't afford the high cost of taking their complaints to court , said the 53 - year - old Whitby lawyer .
" Certainly there is a need to make some changes , because I think that the commission has gotten away from its original mandate , which is to protect people from legitimate cases of discrimination , " Elliott said .
Frank Klees , who is making a second run at the party 's top job , also opposes the idea of scrapping the commission .
However , he is in favour of repealing some of its power that " threatens freedom of expression . "

" It needs to be fixed , not annihilated , " Klees said in a statement .
" People need access to a system that will help them against wrongs without having to enter into our expensive legal system . "
Much of the criticism surrounding the Ontario commission stems from its condemnation of a Maclean 's article in April 2008 that it deemed to be Islamophobic , even though it could not legally proceed to a hearing on the complaint .
The article , which suggested that Muslims pose a threat to North America , " promotes prejudice towards Muslims " and has a " negative impact " on Muslim communities , the commission said .
That drew the ire of critics , who complained the commission was pushing for more powers that would allow it to muzzle journalists and interfere with free speech .
A number of prominent Conservatives have called for human rights commissions to be abolished , saying they are doing more harm than good .
Hillier was the first to float the idea in the provincial leadership race when he launched his campaign March 30 .
Hudak announced his support for the idea last week , leading some to speculate he was trying to win over Hillier supporters .
Adams denied this , saying Hudak has " been on the record " about his views on the issue before the race began .
The party will vote for a new leader on June 21 and June 25 , using ballots that will ask voters to rank the candidates in order of preference .
Ballot boxes will be sealed and sent to the convention , taking place June 26 to 28 , to be counted .
Experts say the candidates will be jostling for the No. 2 spot on the ballot , which could be crucial for victory if no single candidate wins a majority in the first round of counting .

This recently discovered element promises to be a boon for the entertainment industry .
Already we know that high levels of the element of surprise can occur naturally in everyday objects such as jokes about interrupting cows , guerilla warfare , and M Night Shyamalan movies .
Also , however , it appears to be almost mystical in nature - although this is really most likely to be some not yet understood quantum phase - wherein the element of surprise seems to actually manifest itself when everyday subjects utter " I wonder how old this is " while retrieving objects from the backs of refridgerators .
Similar results may be observed when uttering " I bet he 's friendly .
I 'll pet him and show you . "
Science is a many splendid thing .
MOO !

After a long drought of Shins news , here comes the flood .
Pitchfork chatted with frontman James Mercer today , and he spilled the beans on the band 's recent lineup changes ( keyboardist Marty Crandall and drummer Jesse Sandoval are n't in the band ) , as well as a bunch of exciting projects .
There 's a new Shins album in the works for Mercer 's own Aural Apothecary label , which will also reissue the sole album from the pre-Shins band Flake Music .
There 's a mysterious collaboraton .
There 's that movie he's in with Carrie Brownstein , and his contribution to the Danger Mouse / Sparklehorse project Dark Night of the Soul .
And finally , there 's the film soundtrack Mercer worked on with Modest Mouse ...
Let 's dive right in .
When the Shins took the stage at Western Washington University on Saturday night for the first night of their spring tour , fans discovered that the band had changed .
Keyboardist Marty Crandall and drummer Jesse Sandoval had been replaced by Ron Lewis from Grand Archives and Fruit Bats on bass and Joe Plummer of Modest Mouse on drums .
Crandall , Sandoval , and Mercer had been playing together since their mid-90s Flake Music days , and Mercer decided it was time for a change .
" I started to have production ideas that I wanted to do that basically required some other people , " he said .
" It 's mainly about that .
It 's an aesthetic decision .
It 's kind of hard to talk abut stuff like that , is n't it ?
Because I do n't want to bum anybody out .
I 'm on good terms with those guys , I hope to maintain that . "
He added , " I would n't say I 'd never work with them again .
I love working with those guys . "
( And in case you 're wondering , according to Mercer , Crandall 's exit from the Shins did n't have anything to do with that domestic abuse drama from early last year . )
To accomplish his new aesthetic goals , Mercer recruited Lewis and Plummer , who are on board for the current tour as well as the next Shins album .
That album is still in its very early stages , with Mercer planning to begin recording at the end of the current tour , and continue through the summer .
He 's aiming for a release early next year .
Two songs , " Double Bubble " and " The Rifle 's Spiral " are being debuted on the road right now , and Mercer said he has 30 songs in the can .
But do n't expect to hear much moping around on the new album .
" It 's a lot more up - tempo stuff , " he said .
" I have n't really got any real ballad -y stuff right now .
I 've got 30 songs and none of them are real slow .
I think maybe , I 'm not so melancholy lately .
I 'm real happy .
I 've been lucky in love and I 've got a wonderful kid now and things have been going well .
Some of the songs are sort of aggressive in a new wave way .
I 'm excited about it . "
Mercer thinks that his new material represents some of his best work .
" For some reason , it seems like pop writers , it 's like they just get worse or something over time .
And then you 're really jealous of movie directors whose careers seem to grow and they 'll be 70 years old and still doing these incredible jobs .
I 'm going to reverse that , I hope .
I think it 's just working hard at it and not letting yourself be satisfied with the stuff . "
The new album will be released on Mercer 's own label , Aural Apothecary , possibly with distribution from a larger label , possibly the Shins ' former home , Sub Pop .
So why not stick with Sub Pop ?
Why strike out on your own ?
" Because you get more money , " Mercer stated , matter - of - factly .
" I mean , it 's more work and it's more headache and all that , but I think it 'll be worth it in the end . "
Nicknamed the “ City of Water ” , Venice , Italy is world famous for its canals .
In fact , the city is practically a “ no car zone ” since it is built upon water .
Â
Unfortunately , this water is plagued by algae ( Sargassum muticum and Undaria pinnatifida ) that was brought to the seaport from Japan , China , Korea , and France .
Â
The algae poses problems for Venice ’s famous gondolas and ferry boats , but now the city is looking at a unique solution to the problem : Â convert the algae into energy !
Image by llamnudds
According to Buzzle.com :
Undaria pinnatifida , also known as Asian kelp , nevertheless figures on the Global Invasive Species Database of 100 least wanted guests , which notes that it “ forms dense forests , resulting in competition for light and space , which may lead to the exclusion or displacement of native plant and animal species ” .
Since it can grow to up to 3 metres ( about 10 ft ) in length , it also has a formidable potential to foul the propellers of boats operating in the lagoon .
Italy has announced a unique approach to the algae problem by investing 200 million euro in a project to harvest the seaweed from Venice ’s canals and turn it into emission - free energy .
Â EcoWorldy reports :
The plant , to be built in collaboration with renewable energy services company Enalg , will be operative in two years and will produce 40 megawatts of electricity , equivalent to half of the energy required by the entire city centre of Venice .
The algae will be cultivated in laboratories and put in plastic cylinders where water , carbon dioxide , and sunshine can trigger photosynthesis .
The resulting biomass will be treated further to produce a fuel to turn turbines .
The carbon dioxide produced in the process will be fed back to the algae , resulting in zero emissions from the plant .
The goal is to make Venice completely self - sufficient for its energy needs , as well as reduce carbon emissions .
Ocean biomass production could be the future for supplying the energy needs of many port cities around the world .
MERLE HAZARD , an unusually satirical country and western crooner , has captured monetary confusion better than anyone else .
“ Inflation or deflation , ” he warbles , “ tell me if you can : will we become Zimbabwe or will we be Japan ? ”
How do you guard against both the deflationary forces of America 's worst recession since the 1930s and the vigorous response of the Federal Reserve , which has in effect cut interest rates to zero and rapidly expanded its balance - sheet ?
On May 4th Paul Krugman , a Nobel laureate in economics , gave warning that Japan - style deflation loomed , even as Allan Meltzer , an eminent Fed historian , foresaw a repeat of 1970s inflation — both on the same page of the New York Times .
There is something to both fears .
But inflation is distant and containable , while deflation is at hand and pernicious .
Dragged down by debt
Fears about deflation do not rest on the 0.4 % decline in American consumer prices in the year to March .
Although this is the first such annual decline since 1955 , it is the transitory result of a plunge in energy prices .
Excluding food and energy , core inflation is 1.8 % .
Rather , the worry is of persistent price declines that characterise true deflation .
With unemployment nearing 9 % , economic output is further below the economy 's potential than at any time since 1982 .
This gap is likely to widen .
House prices are not part of America 's inflation index but their decline is forcing households to reduce debt ( see article ) , which could subdue economic growth for years .
As workers compete for scarce jobs and firms underbid each other for sales , wages and prices will come under pressure .
So far , expectations of inflation remain stable : that sentiment is itself a welcome bulwark against deflation .
But pay freezes and wage cuts may soon change people 's minds .
In one poll , more than a third of respondents said they or someone in their household had suffered a cut in pay or hours .
The employment - cost index rose by just 2.1 % in the year to the first quarter , the least since records began in 1982 .
In 2003 , during the last deflation scare , total pay grew by almost 4 % .
Does this matter ?
If prices are falling because of advancing productivity , as at the end of the 19th century , it is a sign of progress , not economic collapse .
Today , though , deflation is more likely to resemble the malign 1930s sort than that earlier benign variety , because demand is weak and households and firms are burdened by debt .
In deflation the nominal value of debts remains fixed even as nominal wages , prices and profits fall .
Real debt burdens therefore rise , causing borrowers to cut spending to service their debts or to default .
That undermines the financial system and deepens the recession .
From 1929 to 1933 prices fell by 27 % .
This time central banks are on the case .
In America , Britain , Japan and Switzerland they have pushed short - term interest rates to , or close to , zero and vastly expanded their balance - sheets by buying debt .
It helps , too , that the world has abandoned the monetary straitjacket of the gold standard it wore in the 1930s .
Yet this anti-deflationary zeal is precisely what alarms people like Mr Meltzer .
He worries that the price of seeing off deflation is that the Fed will be unable or unwilling to reverse itself in time to prevent a resurgence of inflation .
Fair enough , but inflation is easier to put right than deflation .
A central bank can raise interest rates as high as it wants to suppress inflation , but it can not cut nominal rates below zero .
Deflation robs a central bank of its ability to stimulate spending using negative real interest rates .
In the worst case , rising debts and defaults depress growth , poisoning the economy by deepening deflation and pressing real interest rates higher .
Central banks that have lowered rates to nearly zero are now using unconventional , quantitative tools , but their efficacy is unproven .
Given the choice , erring on the side of inflation would be less catastrophic than erring on the side of deflation .
That said , there is a legitimate concern that when the time comes to raise interest rates , the Fed may hold back because of political pressure or fear of fracturing financial markets .
The Fed was too slow to raise interest rates after its deflation scare in 2003 .
Yet that is best addressed by strengthening the Fed .
Barack Obama should nominate credible , independent people to the two vacant seats on the Federal Reserve Board , and bat away suggestions that the 12 reserve - bank presidents , who are not confirmed by Congress , lose their say in monetary policy .
Congress should let the Fed issue its own debt , which would give it scope to tighten monetary policy without disorderly sales of the illiquid private debt it has taken on .
Affirming the Fed 's political independence and equipping it with better tools would help the central bank combat inflation when the time comes .
It would also lessen the risk that it tightens prematurely just to demonstrate its resolve .
With Deep Throat 's identity revealed in 2005 , one might have thought there could n't be much more to discover about the reporting of Watergate .
Both Woodward and Bernstein have mined the Nixon White House scandal over the years in books , while their reporting was already dramatized in the classic 1976 film , " All the President 's Men . "
But if The New York Times had n't sat on an FBI tip , the Washington Post 's dynamic duo might not have gone down in journalism history .
The Times Richard Perez - Pena reports on the one that got away .
Robert M. Smith , a former Times reporter , says that two months after the burglary , over lunch at a Washington restaurant , the acting director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , L. Patrick Gray , disclosed explosive aspects of the case , including the culpability of the former attorney general , John Mitchell , and hinted at White House involvement .
Mr. Smith rushed back to The Times ’s bureau in Washington to repeat the story to Robert H. Phelps , an editor there , who took notes and tape - recorded the conversation , according to both men .
But then Mr. Smith had to hand off the story — he had quit The Times and was leaving town the next day to attend Yale Law School .
Mr. Smith kept the events to himself for more than three decades , but decided to go public after learning that Mr. Phelps planned to include it in his memoir .
In the days after that 1972 lunch , the Times bureau was consumed by the Republican convention , and then Mr. Phelps left on a monthlong trip to Alaska .
So what happened to the tip , the notes , the tape ?
Were they pursued to no effect ?
Simply forgotten ?
Phelps , in his forthcoming memoir on life at the Times , said that he has " no idea " what happened to the tapes , and it's a " mystery " why the paper never followed through on the tip .
UPDATE : Ed Gray , son of the late FBI director and co-author of the book , In Nixon 's Web , writes in the comments section that in the two months after the burglary , his father " gave interviews to nearly every important Washington bureau reporter , many of whom are still reporting today . "
And he casts doubt on these new revelations .
" In not one of any of those other interviews did L. Patrick Gray pass along anything like what Phelps and Smith now claim he passed along to Smith .
Readers of Phelps ’s new book will have to judge for themselves why the neither the young reporter nor the then - editor can explain why no story was ever written based on the “ explosive aspects ” supposedly passed along by Gray on this one occasion .
Had my father intended to leak anything at all about Watergate or any other subject of interest to the FBI , rest assured that he would have made sure that the story got published . "

Cole Bettles had been rejected by a raft of universities when he received an e-mail from UC San Diego on Monday congratulating him on his admission and inviting him to tour the campus .
His mother booked a hotel in San Diego , and the 18 - year - old Ojai high school senior arranged for his grandfather , uncle and other family members to meet them at the campus for lunch during the Saturday orientation .
“ They were like , ‘ Oh , my God , that ’s so awesome , ’ ” Bettles said .
Right before he got in bed , he checked his e-mail one last time and found another message saying the school had made a mistake and his application had been denied .
In fact , all 28,000 students turned away from UC San Diego in one of the toughest college entrance seasons on record had received the same misfired message , raising their hopes only to dash them again in a particularly cruel twist on the perils of instant communications in the Internet Age .
UCSD admissions director Mae Brown called the snafu an “ administrative error ” but refused to say whether the mistake was made by one or more members of her staff or by a contractor or if those responsible would be disciplined .

The e-mail , which began , “ We ’re thrilled that you ’ve been admitted to UC San Diego , and we ’re showcasing our beautiful campus on Admit Day , ” was sent to the entire freshman applicant pool of more than 46,000 students , instead of just the 18,000 who had been admitted , Brown said .
The error was discovered almost immediately by her staff , which sent an apology within hours .
The admissions director , who said she was in the office Monday until midnight answering e-mails and phone calls from disappointed students and their parents , said she took full responsibility for the error .
“ We accessed the wrong database , ” Brown said .
“ We recognize the incredible pain receiving this false encouragement caused .
It was not our intent . ”

All applicants were notified by e-mail weeks ago that admissions decisions were available online , according to UCSD officials , but Bettles said he was unaware he ’d been rejected .
“ It was really thrilling for a few hours ; now he ’s crushed , ” said the young man ’s mother , Tracy Bettles .
“ Unless you have a high school senior , or remember what it ’s like , you do n’t know .
It ’s really tough on them . ”
Schools such as Cornell University , the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Northwestern University ’s prestigious Kellogg School of Management have made similar admission notification blunders in the last five years , but UC San Diego ’s mistake was by far the biggest .
Barmak Nassirian , associate executive director of the American Assn. of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers , said colleges are concerned about the dangers of e-mail notifications but believe the benefits outweigh the risks .

“ This is a source of constant worry at colleges .
They use extremely sophisticated systems of communication from the front end of applications all the way to alumni relations for all kinds of high - stake business , and bad things can happen all the way , ” he said .
Within moments of receiving the erroneous UC San Diego e-mails , students were abuzz on sites such as Facebook and College Confidential .
In their posts , some students were hopeful that the university had changed its mind ; others thought the e-mails must be bogus .
When the apology hit their inboxes later in the evening , their posts turned scornful over how the university could make such a massive goof .
Some proposed jokingly that all who received the e-mail should show up en masse at Admit Day .
Many California students were already struggling to cope with what appears to be a particularly tough year for college admission , especially at the state ’s public universities .
Facing budget cutbacks , both the University of California and California State University have capped enrollments for the fall .
UC San Diego reduced its freshman enrollment target by 520 students , to 3,775 , Brown said .

Aakash Agarwal of San Jose said UC San Diego had been among his top choices , but he was not surprised when he was rejected weeks ago because of the stiff competition .
He said he laughed in surprise when he received the e-mail on Monday .
“ I was thinking maybe they changed their mind in terms of admitting me , ” said the 17 - year - old senior at the private Harker School .
But he checked the admissions website “ and sure enough , I was still rejected . ”
“ These kids are sitting on the edge of their seats waiting ” to know what colleges they will get into , said Teri Kuwahara , director of the college and career center at Palos Verdes High School .
Kuwahara said one of her students , after receiving the first UC San Diego e-mail on Monday , went out to dinner with her family to celebrate , then returned to find the second message wiping out her chances .
“ The wrong click of a button could affect a lot of people very quickly , ” she added .

Morgan Currier , a senior at the Cleveland High School humanities magnet in Reseda , said she had already decided to attend the University of Washington when she received the congratulatory e-mail .
She checked her page on the UCSD applications portal and learned her status had n’t changed , so she called the admissions office to get the straight story .
“ We got the answering machine with a message left over from Christmas , saying ‘ Happy Holidays , ’ ” said Currier , 18 , of Northridge .
“ This is a prominent UC , and they did n’t seem to have their act together . ”
Currier said UC San Diego was the dream school for two of her friends who received the university ’s welcome e-mail .
“ When they got the apology , it was just like getting rejected again , ” she said .

Dark matter is kind of old - hat in these exciting days of dark energy .
Nevertheless , we do n't know very much about it .
We know that it exists , we have a very good idea of where it is , and we even know how much of it is around — but we do n't know what it is or how it interacts with other matter aside from via gravity .
These are now central questions for those who study dark matter , but they are also expected to be a short - lived ones .
We can expect some pretty good answers in the next ten years as the LHC begins to build up a large database of collisions and data comes in from many cosmological observations that are already in progress .
The cosmological observations are already raising eyebrows and causing theorists to sharpen their pencils , though .
All of these observations find significantly more electrons and positrons than expected coming from the galactic center .
Now , in a very cool piece of physics , researchers have shown that all of these observations can be explained by dark matter interacting with itself .
First , lets take a look at the observational data , starting with the cosmic microwave background radiation .
The current map , produced by WMAP , shows a haze of hard radiation around the galactic center .
It turns out that the data is best explained by synchrotron radiation , produced by charged particles going around in circles near the galactic center .
But that implies that there are more charged particles out there than we'd expect .
Then there is the data obtained by PAMELA ( Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light - nuclei Astrophysics ) .
The scientists in charge have found that there are many more high - energy electrons and positrons than can be accounted for by the interaction of high - energy cosmic rays with the interstellar medium — they have already accounted for all other known sources in order to study cosmic rays in the first place .
Similar results have been found by other cosmic ray observatories , and by gamma ray observatories as well .
There are other observations that seem to display the same sort of anomaly but — and here is the kicker — all of these experiments are observing different physical phenomena in different ways , yet reporting the same problematic result .
To add to cosmologists ' problems , the conflicting results have been obtained by the LIBRA / DAMA collaboration and their competitors .
LIBRA / DAMA claims to have observed an annual modulation in dark matter collisional interactions , a result they ascribe to the Earth traveling with and against galactic rotation as it circles the sun .
Similar experiments run by other groups have failed to find such a signal , and the contradictory results have , frankly , confused everyone .
To make matters worse , every single observation could be explained by assuming that something is unusual about that particular observation — for instance , supernovae could be blurring WMAP 's vision .
But this is pretty unsatisfactory , because the point of observation is to collect phenomena under an umbrella of a few descriptive and predictive models , rather than adding extra phenomena to explain each observation .
A group of scientists have taken the first steps toward attempting to unify these phenomena under a single theoretical umbrella .
To do this , they have posited that the electrons and positrons are the result of dark matter annihilations , while other annihilation paths that lead to different particles are suppressed .
This idea is not as obvious as it sounds , because the number and energies of the electrons and positrons indicate that dark matter must be pretty strongly interacting , and interacting is on the list of things dark matter does n't do .
This problem can be alleviated if one assumes that there is relatively long - range force that acts between dark matter particles .
This force can then enhance the probability that dark matter annihilates in a way that produces electrons and positrons while also suppressing other annihilation pathways .
The nice thing is that this force provides an internal structure to dark matter that also explains why DAMA / LIBRA saw a dark matter annual modulation signal and other experiments did not .
In other words , this single hypothesis brings a wide range of observations together and makes predictions about the properties of dark matter — everything you want in a hypothesis looking to make its way to theory status .
But , I hear you say , they have replaced a few special phenomena that we know exist with one force that we do n't know exists — surely , that is a step backwards .
Well , it is true that further examination may prove that some of the observations are the result of special circumstances .
It is , however , unlikely that all of them are .
Furthermore , we know that there are very likely to be other bosons out there , awaiting the LHC attempt to reveal their existence .
It does n't seem unreasonable to suppose that one of them has the mass required for a dark force carrier .
So , no , this is n't pure speculation , and , no , it does n't rely on " something really strange emerging from the LHC . "
Nevertheless , it still requires a lot of confirmation before it gets its own chapter in physics text books .

The Non-Farm payroll report released this morning revealed that the United States economy lost 539,000 jobs in April leaving the unemployment rate at 8.9 % .
The number of lost jobs was less than forecasted and compared to last months figures ( 699,000 ) might be a sign of economic recovery as the rate of decline is being reduced as is expected less employers reduce positions going forward .
Policy makers and analysts are beginning to declare this looks like the beginning of a turn as more fiscal and monetary stimulus packages have been put in place .
Economic Indicators
Factory and constructions jobs lost more than 149,000 and 110,000 while services decreased by 269,000 .
Even if the rate of decline has slowed down , analysts are still forecasting a 9.5 % unemployment figure by the end of 2009 .
In comparison Canada posted a gain of 36,000 jobs in a government report also released this morning .
Most of the gains are increases of selfemployment , but the unexpected gain has kept the unemployment rate at 8 % after analysts forecasted higher figures that could drive the rate to 8.3 % .

NEW YORK , April 2 , 2009 – Can we always see what is in front of us ?
According to Dr. Tony Ro , a Professor of Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience at The City College of New York ( CCNY ) , the answer is " no . "
New research published in " The Journal of Neuroscience " by Professor Ro and colleagues from the University of Illinois demonstrates that the brain cannot detect images when brainwave activity is in a trough .
" We may have our eyes open , but we sometimes miss seeing things , " Professor Ro said .
" When the brain is in a state of readiness , you see ; when it is not , you do n't see . "
Brainwave activity has peaks and troughs that can occur around 10 times a second , he explained .
In their research , Professor Ro and his colleagues demonstrated how the phase of the brainwave or alpha wave can reliably predict visual detection .
Subjects were shown a faint image of a dot on a computer screen and asked to indicate whether they saw the image by pushing a button .
Subsequently , the dot was masked making it more difficult to see .
" We tried to see whether there was variability in people 's ability to see the image , " he said .
" When we presented the dots with masks sometimes people saw it and sometimes they did n't . "
The research has potential applications in improving safety .
For example , automobile accidents often occur because drivers miss seeing something , even if for a split second , he explained .
" With brain sensors we might be able to know when people will actually miss seeing something .
By being able to predict whether or not someone will see something , we should be able to implement better ways of delivering information to people to ensure that they will detect it .
This might then enhance safety , reduce errors , and prevent mishaps that frequently occur because people fail to see something that is right in front of them . "
Professor
Ro said future research will investigate what occurs when images are flashed by a strobe light at intervals to match these brainwave frequencies .

Ten years ago a co-worker turned to me and said something that I ’ll never forget , no matter how long I live : “ Hey , Sammy , there ’s been a school shooting in Littleton . ”
Since that day a great deal has been written and said about Columbine High School and the events of 4.20.99 , and like a lot of other people I ’ve tried my hardest to make sense of something that seemed ( and still seems ) inherently senseless .
Tried and failed .
Now , ten years on , the grief has n’t fully dissipated here in the city that I have come to call home , and even if we manage to understand the whos , whats , and hows , there ’s a part of us that ’s doomed to wrestle forever with the whys .
We ’ve learned a lot over the past decade , though , and as we mark the tenth anniversary of Columbine , let ’s begin by recounting three important lessons .
1 : The authorities can not be relied on .
From the emergency response through the investigation process , Columbine was a case study in how not to .
I hate to be overly critical of police because they really have to do a hellish job , but that day witnessed one of the worst failures by a law enforcement agency that we ’ve ever seen .
Two officers exchanged fire with one of the teenage gunmen just outside the school door , then stopped — as they had been trained to do — to wait for a SWAT team .
During the 45 minutes it took for the SWAT team to assemble and go in , Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold shot 10 of the 13 people they killed that day .
The killers committed suicide around the time the makeshift SWAT team finally entered .
But the SWAT officers took several hours more to secure the place , moving methodically from room by room .
One of the wounded , teacher Dave Sanders , slowly bled to death .
[ Source ]
If this is the book on how to operate , explain to me exactly why you need a SWAT team in the first place .
Events would have played out more or less identically if the SWAT budget had instead been allocated to Parks & Rec .
The good news , as the article goes on to explain , is that the meltdown at Columbine led to “ active shooter ” training , which is credited with making police officers across the country far more effective in these kinds of cases .
Sadly , there ’s no indication at all that the longer , more mind - numbing process of investigating and reporting has been improved .
“ Quagmire , ” “ spin , ” “ cover - up , ” “ embarrassment , ” “ lost ” and “ hidden ” reports – at every turn those charged with getting to the bottom of the worst school shooting in history acted like they were auditioning for roles on CSI Hooterville .
If the whole story – or at least most of it – is known today , it is despite these officials , not because of them .
As I walked the grounds of Columbine and Clement Park a few days after the massacre , I was absolutely staggered at the extent to which the tragedy had been transformed into an explicitly Christian extravaganza .
Which was a little fascinating , since it was n’t a Christian school and unless you were sucker enough to believe that there was a religious tint to the killings ( there was n’t – more on this in a minute ) the tragedy had about as much to do with Jesus as it did Kubla Khan .
Still , the impromptu memorials prayed , beseeched , questioned and promised in a distinctly evangelical way that had to make non-evangelicals a little uncomfortable .
After all , this was their town , too , and I can say with absolute certainty that it did n’t matter what your religion was or was n’t .
Columbine was personal and the grief it engendered was profound .
It was n’t just my imagination , either .
One prominent local minister said he felt like he ’d been “ hit over the head with Jesus . ”
To top it all off , Billy Graham ’s lackwit boy Franklin parachuted in to preside over a nationally televised Mournapalooza service .
No doubt some were comforted by the presence of a bona fide religious carpetbagger , but it ’s hard to see , looking back , how the needs of the community were actually addressed by the self - serving machinations of a C - list opportunist .
To put it in Chaucerian terms , we could have done with a little less Summoner and a little more Parson .
3 : The mainstream press values the narrative above the facts .
They were goths !
It was the Trenchcoat Mafia !
They were targeting jocks , blacks and Christians !
Cassie Bernall said yes !
Lie. Lie. Lie , lie , lie .
And damnable , intentional lie .
Local and national “ reporters ” could have been outperformed by monkeys with Ouija boards .
Not that the run -of - the - mill press bumbling came as any real surprise – journalistic malpractice is well - known in Colorado .
But ineptitude is one thing .
Outright , overt , premeditated lies are quite another , and that ’s exactly what both of Denver ’s mainstream papers – the Denver Post and the recently - defunct Rocky Mountain News – did when they ran the “ Cassie Bernall said yes ” story as fact .
They knew , by their own admission , that it was false , so why did they lie ?
Well , the lie seemed to be providing comfort to a grieving city .
Take that as the foundational operating principle for a free press and see where it leads …
If some of us have sort of moved on , then , if we have somehow clawed our way to a modicum of closure , it has been against a backdrop of secrecy , deceit , ineptitude and a pervasive moral pathology born of evangelical self - righteousness .
Whatever insights we have attained , whatever emotional peace we have found , it has all been accomplished without the help of our community ’s central institutions .
As a result , I suspect that many of us mark the tenth anniversary with a little anger , a little bitterness .
There ’s not much I can do about that except to suggest that what happened ten years ago today was not a one - off .
It has happened since and it will almost certainly happen again , and my deep suspicion is that these kinds of events arise , in part , as a result of the dysfunctions noted here .
That is , the governmental breakdown , the evangelical circus and the unforgivable duplicity of those who were granted particular 1st Amendment freedoms so that they could safely tell us the goddamned truth were not results of Columbine .
Maybe I ’m cynical , but it seems to me that these flaws in the fabric of our society existed well in advance of 4.20.99 and it ’s hardly surprising that a sick system would spawn broken children capable of unspeakable barbarism .
Nor is it surprising that the system would then cannibalize those children and their victims in order to slake its spiraling lust for ignorance and hatred .
Whatever was wrong ten years and one day ago is still wrong .
Next
Nearly a year after Grand Theft Auto IV exploded onto the market , the first in a series of long - promised downloadable episodes is finally here .
Packing in a surprisingly meaty single - player campaign and a clutch of new multiplayer modes , Grand Theft Auto IV : The Lost and Damned veers sharply away from GTA IV ’s immigrant story to focus on Liberty City ’s biker underground .
Or , more aptly , what ’s left of it .
The bikers of The Lost and Damned are the sad dregs of a culture that has n’t been relevant – in the game or in real life – for at least 30 years .
They ’re battle - scarred , middle - aged thugs , living on past glories and drug money , and at their center is Johnny Klebitz , the episode ’s protagonist .
Level - headed but tough , Johnny ’s been leading The Lost Motorcycle Club while its real president , Billy Grey , languishes in court - ordered rehab .
As the episode opens , Billy ’s a free man again , ready to retake the reins of power and utterly shatter the peace Johnny ’s worked hard to build .
You can probably already see where this is going to go .
Over the course of the ensuing 23 story missions ( which will take around eight to 10 hours to finish , if you charge straight through ) , Johnny engages in the usual assortment of thefts , assassinations , rescues and all - out gun battles that have become staples of the series .
And he ’ll usually engage in them while on a motorbike , so it ’s a good thing that bikes have been radically retooled to be much more stable , and therefore much more fun .
Most of the missions do n’t offer anything that GTA IV ’s did n’t ( apart from mid-mission checkpoints , which are a godsend ) , but there are a couple of unique moments .
In one mission , you ’ll need to switch to a second - person perspective ( that of the people chasing you , complete with their dialogue ) in order to make sure that your pursuers are following you into an ambush .
In another , you ’ll have to keep a familiar character under control during a clueless kidnapping attempt , which does n’t introduce any new gameplay elements but is more simultaneously sad and hilarious than anything else in the episode .
A few of the missions also pit you against ridiculous numbers of enemies , and there ’s a good reason for that : as a senior member of the Lost , Johnny rarely does anything without the help of at least one or two of his “ brothers . ”
At first , he ’ll tag along with them , riding in formation ( with the help of a badge projected on the road ) to trigger revealing dialogue .
Later , though , he ’ll be able to call on two of them – his friends Terry and Clay , who can also sell him guns and bring him free bikes , respectively – to provide backup .
Usually this just means they ’ll ride alongside you and act as sidekicks ( sometimes bringing along a few more members just in case ) , but sometimes it can change the structure of a mission , as they ’ll do things like set up ambushes for pursuing hitmen .
It ’s in your interest to call on Clay and Terry as often as possible , not just because of their oafish help , but also because they ’ll gain experience and improve their fighting skills the more they help you .
The disposable Lost members they bring along will improve , too , but they also tend to die a lot , so it really does n’t matter .
The action is strung together by a story that parallels the events of GTA IV , often intersecting with Niko ’s narrative .
Sharp - eyed players might remember Johnny from his brief appearances during a couple of key missions in GTA IV , and it ’s interesting ( if weirdly unnerving ) to see those familiar events unfold from a different perspective .
But this is Johnny ’s story , not Niko ’s , and so the diamonds and mob politics take a backseat to Johnny ’s more personal struggles with his friends and with his own antiquated , often - broken code of brotherhood and loyalty .
More pearls of wisdom from that bastion of politicized Christianist exceptionalism :
It ’s likely even Jesus would have OK ’d water boarding if it would have saved his Mom .
He would ’ve done the same to save his Dad , or any one of His disciples .
For that matter , He even died to save all humans .
It ’s obvious
He would not be happy with those who voted for the candidate who kills because it ’s above his “ pay grade ” to know if they ’re alive .
Checking the Commandments , killing innocents is against the 5th .
Because pro-aborts do n’t know for sure life does not exist at conception , they are still willing to risk that it ’s not killing .
( h/t John Cole )
So , Jesus would n’t be cool with killing babies in the womb but he’d be fine with torturing people ?
Yep , nothing says “ Christ ’s love ” like strapping a guy to a bench and drowning him to extract information .
This reminds me of a couple of things I ’ve blogged about before .
The first is the poll that came out a few weeks ago that revealed that a majority of regular church - goers approve of the use of torture :
More than half of people who attend services at least once a week — 54 percent — said the use of torture against suspected terrorists is “ often ” or “ sometimes ” justified .
Only 42 percent of people who “ seldom or never ” go to services agreed , according the analysis released Wednesday by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life .
There was also this gem of a quote from Christian Right leader Jack Gary Bauer :
There are a lot of things Jesus would n’t do because he ’s the son of God .
I ca n’t imagine Jesus being a Marine or a policeman or a bank president , for that matter .
The more appropriate question is , ‘ What is a follower of Jesus permitted to do ? ’
I think if we believe the person we have can give us information to stop thousands of Americans from being killed , it would be morally suspect to not use harsh tactics to get that information .
It ’s pretty sad that the Christian Right in this country has been politicized to the point that , in defense of their preferred political ideology , they have been reduced to claiming that Jesus ’ supposedly loving message of peace and caring for your fellow man has been perverted to justify torture .
Say what you will about torture and Christianity , only the most extreme reading of the Gospels imaginable could , at the same time , claim that Jesus preached both a message of love and a message that could justify torture .
Perhaps the most important Bible passage for this debate is this :
“ Father , forgive them , for they do not know what they are doing . ” ( Luke 23:34 )
Update :
To be fair , there are some religious people out there that are not completely insane on this issue :
Since January 2006 , the more than 250 religious organizations comprising the National Religious Campaign Against Torture have worked together to end U.S. - sponsored torture .
During 2008 , the religious community advocated for a Presidential Executive Order ending torture .
It happened .
On January 22 , President Obama issued an Executive Order halting torture .
Now the task is to make sure that U.S. - sponsored torture never happens again .
To accomplish this goal , our nation needs to put safeguards in place to prevent its recurrence .
We will better understand what safeguards are needed if we have a comprehensive understanding of what happened – who was tortured , why they were tortured , and who ordered the torture .
As a nation we need the answers to those questions .
Therefore , NRCAT is calling for a Commission of Inquiry to investigate U.S. torture policies and practices .
To bolster this call , we are asking you and other people of faith to endorse the statement “ U.S. - Sponsored Torture : A Call for a Commission of Inquiry . ”

While torture under the Bush administration was horrible , at least it has stopped .
Right ?
Wrong .
Jeremy Scahill ( the reporter who broke most of the stories on Blackwater ) says that a military police unit at Guantanamo regularly brutalizes unarmed prisoners , including gang - beating them , breaking their bones , gouging their eyes and dousing them with chemicals .
Specifically , whenever there is “ disobedience ” by the detainees – which can include praying , or having 2 styrofoam cups in their cell instead of 1 , or refusing medication or failing to immediately respond when spoken to – the “ Immediate Reaction Force ” ( IRF ) is sent in .
Scahill describes what happens next :
When an IRF team is called in , its members are dressed in full riot gear , which some prisoners and their attorneys have compared to “ Darth Vader ” suits .
Each officer is assigned a body part of the prisoner to restrain : head , right arm , left arm , left leg , right leg …
[ The IRF teams then mete out brutal punishment , including ] gang beating them , forcing their heads into toilets , breaking bones , gouging their eyes , squeezing their testicles , urinating on a prisoner ’s head , banging their heads on concrete floors and hog-tying them — sometimes leaving prisoners tied in excruciating positions for hours on end …
[ One prisoner was sprayed directly in the eyes with mace and gouged in the eyes and was then refused medical treatment , which resulted in permanent blindness in one eye .
He also endured a “ sexual attack ” .
Another prisoner had a third prisoner ’s feces spread on him . ]
There was also torture using water :
The ERF team came into the cell with a water hose under very high pressure .
He was totally shackled , and they would hold his head fixed still .
They would force water up his nose until he was suffocating and would scream for them to stop .
This was done with medical staff present , and they would join in .
Scahill says that these are not “ a few bad apples ” :
The IRF teams “ were fully approved at the highest levels [ of the Bush administration ] , including the Secretary of Defense and with outside consultation of the Justice Department , ” says Scott Horton , one of the leading experts on U.S. Military and Constitutional law .
This force “ was designed to disabuse the prisoners of any idea that they would be free from physical assault while in U.S. custody , ” he says .
“ They were trained to brutally punish prisoners in a brief period of time , and ridiculous pretexts were taken to justify ” the beatings .
Scahill ’s allegations are being confirmed by the Spanish torture investigation .
Indeed :
“ Up to 15 people attempted to commit suicide at Camp Delta due to the abuses of the IRF officials , ” according to the Spanish investigation .
One particular incident shows how brutal the IRF interrogators are :
In January 2003 , Sgt. Sean Baker [ an active - duty U.S. soldier and Gulf War veteran ] was ordered to participate in an IRF training drill at Guantánamo where he would play the role of an uncooperative prisoner .
Sgt . Baker says he was ordered by his superior to take off his military uniform and put on an orange jumpsuit like those worn by prisoners .
He was told to yell out the code word “ red ” if the situation became unbearable , or he wanted his fellow soldiers to stop .
According to sworn statements , upon entering his cell , IRF members thought they were restraining an actual prisoner .
As Sgt. Baker later described :
They grabbed my arms , my legs , twisted me up and , unfortunately , one of the individuals got up on my back from behind and put pressure down on me while I was face down .
Then he — the same individual — reached around and began to choke me and press my head down against the steel floor .
After several seconds , 20 to 30 seconds , it seemed like an eternity because I could n’t breathe .
When I could n’t breathe , I began to panic and I gave the code word I was supposed to give to stop the exercise , which was ‘ red . ’ …
That individual slammed my head against the floor and continued to choke me .
Somehow I got enough air .
I muttered out : ‘ I ’m a U.S. soldier .
I ’m a U.S. soldier . ’
Sgt. Baker said his head was slammed once more , and after groaning “ I ’m a U.S. soldier ” one more time , “ I heard them say , ‘ Whoa , whoa , whoa , ’ you know , like … he was telling the other guy to stop . ”
According to CBS : Bloodied and disoriented , Baker somehow made it back to his unit , and his first thought was to get hold of the videotape .
“ I said , ‘ Go get the tape , ’ ” recalls Baker . ” ‘ They ’ve got a tape .
Go get the tape . ’
My squad leader went to get the tape . ”
Every extraction drill at Guantanamo was routinely videotaped , and the tape of this drill would show what happened .
But Baker says his squad leader came back and said , “ There is no tape . ”
The New York Times later reported that the military “ says it ca n’t find a videotape that is believed to have been made of the incident . ”
Baker was soon diagnosed with traumatic brain injury .
He began suffering seizures , sometimes 10 to 12 per day .
“ This was just one typical incident , and Baker was recognizable as an American , ” says Horton .
“ But it gives a good flavor of what the Gitmo detainees went through , which was generally worse . ”
If they did that to a U.S. soldier during a training exercise , one who was given a special code word to have the interrogation stop , what they do to actual detainees must be much worse .
The torture by IRF teams is continuing under the Obama administration .
In fact , it is actually getting worse :
The Center for Constitutional Rights released a report titled “ Conditions of Confinement at Guantánamo : Still In Violation of the Law , ” which found that abuses continued .
In fact , one Guantanamo lawyer , Ahmed Ghappour , said that his clients were reporting “ a ramping up in abuse ” since Obama was elected .
And see this .
Note : I do n’t know whether or not torture is continuing in conjunction with interrogations .
This essay focuses on a different type of torture .

All around the world , cops and rent - a- cops are vigorously enforcing nonexistent anti-terrorist bans on photography in public places .
If you 're worried about being busted under an imaginary law , why not download these templates and print yourself an imaginary " Photography license " from the DHS ?
Who knows if it 's legal to carry one of these — probably about as legal as taking away your camera and erasing your memory card for snapping a pic on the subway .
In the event you 're stopped by overzealous law enforcement or security officials attempting to enforce fictitious laws , I 've designed these fictitious and official - looking Photographer 's Licenses .
If you have Adobe Illustrator , you can download the EPS vector art file and print your own .
You 'll need a photo of yourself , and OCR ( or a similar font ) to fill in your personal information .

You may have heard about the Tarski - Seidenberg theorem , which says that the first - order theory of the reals is decidable , that the first - order theory of the complex numbers is similarly decidable , or that the first order theory of the integers without multiplication is decidable .
In the course of John Harrison ‘s logic textbook Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning , all three of these algorithms ( and many more ) are implemented .
Furthermore , you can download and play with them for free .
( However , I still recommend checking out the book : especially if you are looking for a good textbook for a course on logic with a concrete , computational bent . )
Below , I ’ll describe how to install the programs and try them out .
There are many more interesting functions in this suite that I have n’t described .
Installation :
The software is written in OCaml and can be run interactively in an OCaml toplevel ( do n’t worry , you wo n’t actually need to know any OCaml ) .
Download and install OCaml as well as its preprocessor Camlp5 ( which is used for formatting formulas nicely ) .
Then , download the code from here ( under “ All the code together ” ) and unzip it somewhere .
To run it , go to wherever you unzipped it and type make interactive in a shell .
( At least , that ’s what worked for me on a Mac OSX .
Other systems may be different . )
The Tarski-Seidenberg Theorem .
The Tarski-Seidenberg theorem implies that there is a decision procedure which , given a first - order sentence over using plus , times , 0 , and 1 , will tell you if it ’s true or not .
The function real_qelim implements this .
Let ’s try it out .
( The symbol # indicates the beginning of the prompt ; do n’t type that , just type in what ’s after it . )
This function knows that not all quadratic polynomials have roots , but all cubics do .
# real_qelim << forall b c. exists x. x ^2 + b*x + c = 0 >> ; ; - : fol formula = << false >> # real_qelim << forall b c d. exists x. x^3 + b*x ^2 + c*x + d = 0 >> ; ; - : fol formula = < < true >>
Many geometric puzzles can , in theory , be solved automatically by this function .
Unfortunately , it is too slow for most interesting ones .
Harrison notes that there are open problems about kissing numbers of high - dimensional spheres which could be solved in theory by this algorithm , although in practice it is an unworkable approach .
This algorithm actually does something stronger than decide the truth of first - order sentences : it does quantifier - elimination , which means that if you give it a formula with free variables , it will give you a quantifier - free formula in those same free variables ( in the case of a sentence , which has no free variables , that means either the formula “ true ” or the formula “ false ” ) .
For example , if you ’ve forgotten the quadratic formula and want to know what the condition is for a quadratic polynomial to have a root :
# real_qelim << exists x. x ^2 + b*x + c = 0 >> ; ; - : fol formula = < < (0 + c * 4 ) + b * ( 0 + b * - 1 ) = 0 \/ ~( 0 + c * 4 ) + b * ( 0 + b * - 1 ) = 0 /\ ~( 0 + c * 4 ) + b * ( 0 + b * - 1 ) > 0 >>
Note that there is no claim that the formula it gives you will be completely simplified , only that it will be correct .
Deciding Sentences over the Complex Numbers
We can similarly use the function complex_qelim to do quantifier elimination over the complexes .
The fact that this possible is easier to prove than the corresponding fact for the reals , and the algorithm is similarly faster .
# complex_qelim << forall x. x^3 = 1 == > x = 1 >> ; ; - : fol formula = < < false >>
The following sentence is also true over the reals ( although for a different reason than why it ’s true over the complexes ) , but it takes significantly longer for the real quantifier elimination algorithm to decide it .
# complex_qelim << forall x1 x2 x3 .
( x1^3 = 1 /\ x2^3 = 1 /\ x3^3 = 1 /\ ~( x1 = x2 ) /\ ~( x1 = x3 ) /\ ~( x2 = x3 ) ) ==> x1 + x2 + x3 = 0 >> ; ; - : fol formula = < < true >>
Suppose we read on wikipedia that the translation of the limaçon to rectangular coordinates is .
We can verify this ( I ’ve used s to represent and c to represent ) :
# complex_qelim << forall r s c x y. ( x ^2 + y^ 2 = r^2 /\ r * c = x /\ r * s = y == > forall a b. ( r = b + a * c == > ( x ^2 + y^2 - a * x ) ^2 = b^ 2 * ( x ^ 2 + y^ 2 ) ) ) >> ; ; - : fol formula = < < true >>
Presburger Arithmetic
Finally , first - order sentences with plus and less - than over the integers and over the natural numbers are decidable .
The relevant functions are integer_qelim and natural_qelim .
Even though multiplication of variables is prohibited , we can still multiply by constants ( since for example , instead of we could have written anyway ) .
An example Harrison gives is :
There is an old ( easy ) puzzle which is to show that , with 3 - and 5 - cent stamps , you can make an - cent stamp for any .
# natural_qelim << forall n. n >= 8 == > exists x y. 3 * x + 5 * y = n >> ; ; - : fol formula = < < true >>
Ten years ago , when Jon Ronson dared to report on Bilderberg , he found himself " chased by mysterious men in dark glasses through Portugal " .
He was scared for his safety .
" When I phoned the British embassy and asked them to explain to the powerful secret society that had set their goons on me that I was essentially a humorous journalist out of my depth , I was n't being funny .
I was being genuinely desperate , " he wrote .
I know exactly how he feels .
Only out of sheer desperation did I try to arrest one of the goons following me and then follow my flimsy leads up the Greek police ladder , finally catching one of the goons wet - handed in the lavatory of the department of government security .
And only then did I know the extent of Bilderberg 's paranoia : they had set the state police on me .
So who is the paranoid one ?
Me , hiding in stairwells , watching the pavement behind me in shop windows , staying in the open for safety ?
Or Bilderberg , with its two F - 16s , circling helicopters , machine guns , navy commandos and policy of repeatedly detaining and harassing a handful of journalists ?
Who 's the nutter ?
Me or Baron Mandelson ?
Me or Paul Volker , the head of Obama 's economic advisory board ?
Me or the president of Coca - Cola ?
It makes me want to spit , the absurdity of it : the cost , not just in Greek tax euros , but on my peace of mind , of having ( conservatively ) a dozen Jack Bauers assigned to tailing me .
I hope the operation at least had a cool name : Operation Catastrophic Overreaction , perhaps .
So , yes , Bilderberg 's paranoia is half to blame .
But there is another reason why Ronson was hounded round Portugal , why I was chased round Greece , and why on Sunday the Romanian journalist Paul Dorneanu was strip - searched by goons in Vouliagmeni , held for four hours and forced to purge his camera of images ( for the crime of trying to film the delegates leaving ) .
And it is this : they can harass and detain us only because so few of us are there .
Just now , I searched for " Bilderberg " on Reuters .
I did the same on AP .
And this is what I turned up :
Bilderberg Photograph : Public Domain
Publicity is pure salt to the giant slug of Bilderberg .
So I suggest next year we turn up with a few more tubs .
If the mainstream press refuses to give proper coverage to this massive annual event , then interested citizens will have to : a people 's media .
Find the biggest lens you can and join us for Bilderberg 2010 .
No idea where it 's going to be , but there 's usually a few days ' notice .
We 'll have a barbecue selling bilderburgers ( with extra lies ) , and we will set up our own press centre near the cordon .
Get some lanyards .
Email me at bilderberg2010@yahoo.co.uk and we 'll start prepping .
Meanwhile , petition newspapers to send a correspondent .
Petition your MP to ask a question in parliament .
This happened a few days ago in Holland .
Citing an article by Paul Joseph Watson on prisonplanet.com , a Dutch MP asked in parliament about the involvement of the prime minister , the minister for European affairs and Queen Beatrix , asking them to make public any items that were on the agenda , and whether the ratification of the Lisbon treaty was discussed .
I 've got a couple of questions I would like to ask Peter Mandelson , mainly about the freedom of the press and what he thinks about a Guardian journalist being detained , shoved and intimidated by the Greek state police on his behalf .
Mandelson 's office has confirmed his attendance at this year 's meeting : " Yes , Lord Mandelson attended Bilberberg .
He found it a valuable conference . "
Oh , good .
Maybe he stole a bathrobe .
Peter has been a busy baron these last few days : all that beach volleyball and global strategising , then straight back to address the Google Zeitgeist conference on Monday , where he talked about " the need for regulation " of the internet .
" There are worries about the impact of the internet on our society , " he said .
I bet he is worried ; but not half as worried as I am about " the need for regulation " .
But these worries are small potatoes compared with the biggest concern Bilderberg 09 has given me .
My experience over the last several days in Greece has granted me a single , diamond - hard opinion .
Meaning I now have two : that John McEnroe is the greatest sportsman of all time ; and that we must fight , fight , fight , now – right now , this second , with every cubic inch of our souls – to stop identity cards .
I can tell you right now that the argument " If I 've done nothing wrong , why would I worry about showing who I am ? " is hogwash .
Worse than that , it 's horse hockey .
It 's all about the power to ask , the obligation to show , the justification of one 's existence , the power of the asker over the subservience of the asked .
( Did you know that most Greek police do n't wear a number ?
This is an obligation that goes one way . )
I have learned this from the random searches , detentions , angry security goon proddings and thumped police desks without number that I 've had to suffer on account of Bilderberg : I have spent the week living in a nightmare possible future and many different terrible pasts .
I have had the very tiniest glimpse into a world of spot checks and unchecked security powers .
And it has left me shaken .
It has left me , literally , bruised .
I can tell you this from personal experience : the onus upon the individual to carry with them some external proof of their identity is transformative of his or her status as a human being .
The identity card turns you from a free citizen into a suspect .
It is a spanner with which to beat the individual around the head .
It is the end of everything .
And how much easier to put all that information inside a microchip so you do n't have to carry around that pesky card all the time .
How much more efficient !
Listen .
I do n't care if you do n't love liberty .
For the love of yourself : fight identity cards .
Do n't let them happen .
STOP IDENTITY CARDS .
Stop identity cards .
And while you 're about it : stop identity cards .
And that 's all I have to say , you will be delighted to know , about Bilderberg 2009 .
Oh , except for a giant word of thanks to everyone who has written supportive or interested comments on these blogposts ( let 's meet up for a proper debrief ! )
And one little correction : for the record , Kenneth Clarke 's office has said he was " in his constituency " at the weekend , not at the Astir Palace doing sambuca shots with the CEO of Airbus .
Just in case he remembers differently when asked again .

Enlarge By Charles Dharapak , AP President Obama 's stimulus package gives police agencies nearly unfettered access to $ 1 billion over three years for hiring up to 6,000 officers as many departments face cuts .
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is reviving a controversial Clinton - era police hiring program , and the lack of restrictions on the money has critics warning of wasteful spending .
The stimulus package loosens the old rules for the program by dropping a provision that required police agencies to pay millions in local dollars to tap federal hiring grants .
It gives police agencies nearly unfettered access to $ 1 billion over three years for hiring up to 6,000 officers as many departments face cuts .
That money is part of an overall effort , unveiled in Obama 's budget proposal Thursday , to fund 50,000 new police officers .
The budget does not specify a timeframe or cost , and Justice Department documents say rules for the broader program will be released later .
Some criminal justice analysts say the rules in the stimulus package do n't require enough commitment from local agencies and that the program offers a potentially false promise that more police lead to less crime .
" No matching funds mean no accountability , " says David Muhlhausen , a justice policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation .
" This is giving away free money . "
He says there was " no conclusive evidence that the grants helped decrease crime " during the initial program .
Craig Uchida , a former Clinton official who helped oversee the program , says the matching funds made cities " accountable " because they invested their own money .
Police agencies had to pay 25 % of all new officer salaries and benefits for the three - year federal grant period .
" Our view was , let 's not give ( recipients ) a free ride , " he says .
Justice Department spokesman Corey Ray says the stimulus money could begin flowing to agencies within weeks and save some from layoffs that threaten public safety .
He says the bad economy makes the change necessary because the old rules blocked some cash - strapped agencies from participating , and the need for help is even greater now .
The police grants , along with other stimulus spending , will get extra scrutiny by administration auditors , he says .
The original Community Oriented Policing Services ( COPS ) program , championed by Vice President Biden while he was in the Senate , provided funding for more than 100,000 officers .
The Justice Department 's own audits of the program alleged millions of dollars were misspent and thousands of jobs funded by the grants were never filled .
In one case , a New Mexico tribe got $ 728,125 to hire eight extra officers .
After the department closed in 2002 , auditors said it was unclear where the money went or whether anyone was hired .
Ray says the problems related to the original program involved a small number of agencies .
Police groups , including the International Association of Chiefs of Police ( IACP ) , have tried to resurrect COPS since the Bush administration shut it down after 9/11 , when U.S. funds were shifted to homeland security .
Under Clinton , COPS was designed to battle a spike in violent crime .
Gene Voegtlin , the IACP 's legislative counsel , credits COPS with helping to spur the subsequent crime decline .
Yet some cities that did not accept the money , such as Oklahoma City , reported equal declines to those that did .
The Obama program is being rolled out as crime has declined in much of the past decade , including 2007 , the most recent year measured by the FBI .
A study released in January by the Police Executive Research Forum , a law enforcement think tank , found nearly half of the 233 police agencies surveyed linked recent increases in criminal offenses , such as robberies , to the economy .
Leslie Paige , spokeswoman for Citizens Against Government Waste , says the new grant program is a " give - away " that postpones needed change .
" Local governments need to learn how to live on smaller budgets and figure out what we need to jettison , including law enforcement , " she says .

FAYETTEVILLE , Ga. --
The way Jay Chambers sees it , the semiautomatic weapons in his firearm collection might be the most promising investment in his financial portfolio .
Like many gun enthusiasts , Mr. Chambers , a manager for a door wholesaler here , believes President Barack Obama and the Democrats in Congress soon will reimpose a version of an expired federal ban on the sale of so - called assault weapons .
If such a law passes , he figures his collection -- enough guns , ammo magazines and weapon parts to assemble about 30 AK - 47s , ...
A new worldwide survey of the human saliva microbiome – the bugs in our spit – finds that a man from La Paz , Bolivia , shares no more microbes in common with his neighbours than with a woman from Shanghai .
Even though humans have been swapping spit for eons , the same goes for 120 people from 10 other cities in North and South America , Europe , Africa and Asia , finds Mark Stoneking , a molecular anthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany .
He hopes to use the bacteria in spit as an indicator of human migration and contact .
This may sound far - fetched , but another team of researchers has used the stomach - ulcer - causing bacteria , Helicobacter pylori , to date human movements , including the peopling of the South Pacific .
‘ Unique ’ species
Bacterial genes evolve more rapidly than our own , so measuring genetic differences between bacteria from various populations can reveal population splits that occurred too recently to have left significant changes in human DNA .

Yet collecting H. pylori requires a stomach biopsy , no easy task in Europe or North America , let alone more remote or undeveloped regions .
Spit , on the other hand , can be easily collected and is chock full of both human and bacterial DNA , Stoneking says .
“ We would like to see if we can develop alternative bacterial species as good markers for human migration and human population contact with saliva , ” he says .
However , his team ’s initial results dampen those hopes .
Few geographical trends emerged among the more than 14,000 bacteria that his team identified in human saliva .
The most common constituent was a bacterium called Streptococcus , which accounted for about 23 % of the flora .
But many species of bacteria appeared to be unique to individuals .
Hunt continues
“ It reminds me a lot of the skin in that there ’s a lot of diversity , ” says Martin Blaser , a microbiologist at New York University School of Medicine .
He wonders if additional sequencing will uncover more predictable patterns of diversity between people from different parts of the world .
“ The fact that the variance did n’t track with geography in particular was a surprise to me .
I would have expected more of a pattern , ” says Ruth Ley , who studies gut microbial diversity at Cornell University .
Stoneking has n’t given up on using spit as a marker for human migration .
Additional saliva sequencing could uncover individual species or even specific genes that coincide better with geography , he says .
The key will be to find species of bacteria that pass generationally – from parent to child , rather than from person to person – whether by kissing or other means of transfer , Stoneking says .

Those who use Firefox and Chrome are inherently more up - to - date — and therefore more secure — than those who run Safari and Opera , according to researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology ( ETH Zurich ) and Google Switzerland .
But it 's not the browsers themselves that magically make people stay updated — it 's their built - in mechanisms that automatically update when new versions are available .
These mechanisms are keeping a large majority of their users secure , even if power users and admins might get antsy over their loss of update control .
Swiss Federal Institute of Technology researcher Stefan Frei and Thomas Duebendorfer of Google released a paper with their findings this week called " Why Silent Updates Boost Security " ( PDF ) .
In it , they note that only about 45 percent of Internet users were using the most secure browser version when visiting Google 's Web servers .
This , of course , is bad news — as many
Ars readers know , Web browsers are increasingly used to target vulnerable users with viruses , malware , adware , and more .
This discovery prompted the researchers to further examine what kinds of users are the most secure , and they found that 83 percent of all active Firefox users were using the latest version .
However , Chrome 's " silent - update " mechanism made it the most effective of all — the researchers found that 21 days after releasing Chrome version 1.0.154.48 ( a version number that would surely not send most of us rushing to download ) , 97 percent of active Chrome 1.x users were using it .
" This is by far the best update effectiveness measured for any of the four investigated Web browsers , " reads the report .
Comparatively , browsers that do n't stay on top of updates themselves performed poorly in Frei and Duebendorfer 's analysis .
Only 53 percent of Safari 3.x users had performed an update within three weeks of the update 's release , and with newer releases of Safari 3.2.x , the update effectiveness was even lower .
And Opera did n't fare any better .
After three weeks of a new release , a maximum of 24 percent of active Opera 9.x users had the newest version installed .
" It 's a pity that 76 percent of Opera 9.x users currently do n't benefit from the security improvements and new features of Opera versions within three weeks of its release , " the researchers wrote .
Frei acknowledged in a post on his website , however , that while the silent update method may be the best for browser security , not all users are happy with the loss of control .
Those who identify themselves as " expert users " are particularly sensitive to the loss of full control over what is installed on their machines , but it might be OK to let them deal with updates on their own .
" Expert users do n’t need to be excessively taken care by taking control over updates out of their hands .
They supposedly know what they do and have the expertise to assess their risks in doing so , " wrote Frei .
It 's the regular old " ordinary " users who need the most help , he says , as there are more than a billion technically unsavvy people on the Internet with little - to - no protection other than the browser .
" There is absolutely no need to confuse this class of users with unnecessary security decisions — which they anyway do n’t understand , " Frei notes .
" I consider ' silent updates ' the best solution for this group of users . "
He concludes that the best option is for all browsers to include silent update options that are enabled by default , with the option for power users to turn it off .
The large majority of users wo n't change the settings , while the remainder can customize their update preferences however they like .
In the meantime , if you 're a Safari or Opera user , what are you waiting for ?
Better go check to make sure you 're up to date .
The executive committee of the Society of Integrative and Comparative Biology decided not to hold any future meetings in New Orleans owing to " the official position of the state in weakening science education and specifically attacking evolution in science curricula , " according to a February 5 , 2009 , letter ( PDF ) from SICB 's president , Richard Satterlie , to Louisiana 's governor Bobby Jindal .
Noting that the last SICB meeting , held in Boston , attracted over 1850 scientists and graduate students to the city for five days , Satterlie observed , " As you might imagine , a professional meeting with nearly 2000 participants can contribute to the economic engine of any community . "
But in 2011 , those economic benefits will accrue to Salt Lake City rather than to New Orleans .
Particularly of concern to SICB was the Louisiana Science Education Act — originally introduced as Senate Bill 561 , then renamed as Senate Bill 733 , and finally enacted as Louisiana Revised Statutes 17:285.1 .
As NCSE previously reported , the law threatens to open the door for creationism and scientifically unwarranted critiques of evolution to be taught in public school science classes .
The development of a policy about what types of supplementary classroom materials will , and will not , be allowable under the law was not reassuring , especially when a provision that " [ m ] aterials that teach creationism or intelligent design or that advance the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind shall be prohibited for use in science classes " was deleted .
Taking note of SICB 's decision , the Louisiana Coalition for Science wrote in a February 13 , 2009 , press release ( PDF ) , " The first tangible results of the Louisiana legislature 's passage and Gov. Bobby Jindal 's signing of the 2008 Louisiana Science Education
Act have materialized , and these results are negative both for the state 's economy and national reputation . "
Observing that Governor Jindal signed the bill over the protests of educators and scientists in Louisiana and nationally , the press release concluded , " The citizens of Louisiana , whose educational well - being the governor claims to be so concerned about , are now paying the price — literally — for his loyalty to his conservative Christian base . "
The Louisiana Coalition for Science also noted that SICB may not be the only scientific organization considering taking its business elsewhere .
In the August 2008 issue of ASBMB Today , Gregory Petsko , the president of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , called for a boycott by scientific organizations of Louisiana and of any state adopting antievolution legislation , writing , " As scientists , we need to join such protests with our feet and wallets .
... I think we need to see to it that no future meeting of our society [ the ASBMB was already committed to holding its 2009 meeting in New Orleans before the LSEA was enacted ] will take place in Louisiana as long as that law stands . "
The Daily Show 's now - famous takedown of CNBC was peppered with embarrassing quotes by Fast Money host and comically inept market prognosticator Jim Cramer .
Cramer thinks this is " absurd , " and frankly his feelings are hurt .
" It rankles me , " Cramer wrote today , that Daily Show host Stewart used a clip of him appearing to advocate investment in Bear Stearns stock .
He has a point :
In that particular segment , Cramer was talking about accounts at the investment bank , not stock , in response to a question from a viewer .
Deposits at Bear Stearns indeed proved safe .
Funny , though , that Cramer is silent on the four other clips of him Stewart pulled , like the one where he said Bank of America shares , then trading in the 50s , were " going to 60 in a heartbeat " ( they never made it and are now under $ 4 ) ; or that people should " buy buy buy " an " oversold " 2007 stock market priced at roughly twice today 's levels .
At least Cramer is responding to Stewart , skirting CNBC 's official policy of ignoring the Daily Show and wishing it would go away .
The newspaper - reporter - turned - hedge - fund - manager might be dispensing terrible financial advice , but he retains his touch for self promotion .
As always .
The Wall Street Journal ’s health blog reports that drug company Cephalon are trying to get jet lag recognised as a ‘ circadian rhythm sleep disorder ’ in an attempt to promote their stay - up - forever drugs modafinil and armodafinil .
Modafinil , under the trade name Provigil , is currently a big seller for the company owing to the fact that it deletes the need for sleep and improves concentration typically without making the person feel particularly ‘ wired ’ .
It ’s licensed for the treatment of narcolepsy but is widely used by people without a prescription to stay awake and fend off mental tiredness .
Unfortunately , for Cephalon , modafinil will go out of patent in 2012 , meaning its profit making capabilities virtually disappear as competitors will be able to produce the compound at a markedly reduced price .
In the mean time , the company has been developing a very similar but newly patentable drug named armodafinil .
In fact , armodafinil has been created by a common ploy used by drug companies when they need to renew a patent on a drug .
Many drug molecules have two versions – both identical but mirror images of each other .
Drugs work when the drug molecule ‘ hand ’ inserts itself into the appropriately matching neuroreceptor ‘ glove ’ .
In the same way that you ca n’t put your left hand into a right glove , mirror image drug molecules need their matching receptor and each might have a different effect .
Many drugs , like modafinil , are mixture of both left and right - handed enantiomers , even though only one of the mirror images has the desired effect .
In the case of modafinil , it ’s the right - handed mirror image that seems the most potent .
So a common drug company ploy is to released a new drug which has been synthesised to remove the inactive or less active molecule .
Armodafinil , their new drug , is just this .
It ’s just the right - handed modafinil molecules .
So essentially it ’s the same drug but without the action of the other ‘ half ’ .
This can sometimes reduce side effects , or improve the action of the drug , but in general the difference is relatively minor .
Importantly though , you can get a new patent on this synthesized version , meaning profit is guaranteed as long as you can convince people that your new drug is worth switching too .
And this is where the spin comes in .
Because in many countries drug must be approved for a medical problem , Cephalon are trying to get jet lag classified as a disorder so they have a whole new market for their compound .
It also turns out that they ’re sharply hiking the price on modafinil , so when the new , initially lower - priced armodafinil appears , people will switch .
They ’ll then get used to using armodafinil and when modafinil becomes super - cheap and generic sometime later they ’ve already established their market on their ‘ premium branded ’ new compound .

The Coast Guard this week issued new regulations that require U.S. - flagged commercial ships to post guards when they are passing through the pirate - infested waters of the Gulf of Aden ; ship owners can now decide whether or not their guards will have guns .
The Pentagon , as well , is studying the feasibility of bringing private security firms on board U.S. vessels .
Sounds like a job for Blackwater Xe .
Only problem is , the company does n't seem to be in the pirate - fighting business at the moment .
They 're too busy getting sued by their guns - for - hire , for racial discrimination and for false imprisionment .
One of the crew members , you see , dared to speak with a reporter .
Last fall , as the piracy problem reached crisis proportions , the company then known as Blackwater stepped forward to offer its pirate - fighting services to the shipping industry .
The firm announced that its 183 - foot ship , the McArthur , was standing ready to provide convoy escort .
The ship , a former oceanographic research vessel , was reconfigured to haul two Little Bird helicopters , rigid inflatable boats , and security team .
One had to give points to founder and CEO Erik Prince points for the vision thing .
But in practice , those plans did n't seem to work out .
As Virginian - Pilot reporter Bill Sizemore reports , the McArthur 's recent cruise to the Middle East did not go smoothly , and the company is facing lawsuits from former crew members .
Writes Sizemore :
One former crew member says that on the orders of the captain , he was thrown to the deck and handcuffed in retaliation for speaking to a newspaper reporter .
He is suing for false imprisonment , saying he was unlawfully detained by being ' placed in irons . '
Another crew member , who is black , says that he was subjected to racial epithets from the chief engineer and that when he complained , the captain did nothing about the harassment and retaliated by giving the seaman a poor evaluation .
A third man , the ship 's chief steward , says he was fired after he submitted a written statement to his superiors documenting the hostile work environment and racial harassment aboard the vessel .
Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell did not comment direct on the litigation , but she said one of the employees was terminated for cause .
Regarding the discrimination suit , she told Virginian - Pilot the company " does not condone and will not tolerate discrimination of any kind and takes allegations to the contrary very seriously . "
But she also disclosed that the company is no longer doing counter - piracy work .

Here ’s some irony for you .
Perhaps Obama , Reid and Pelosi might consider following Russia ’s lead :
Arkady Dvorkevich , the Kremlin ’s chief economic adviser , said Russia would favour the inclusion of gold bullion in the basket - weighting of a new world currency based on Special Drawing Rights issued by the International Monetary Fund . [… ]
[ …] Mr Dvorkevich said it was “ logical ” that the new currency should include the rouble and the yuan , adding that “ we could also think about more effective use of gold in this system ” .
The Gold Standard was the anchor of world finance in the 19th Century but began breaking down during the First World War as governments engaged in unprecedented spending .
It collapsed in the 1930s when the British Empire , the US , and France all abandoned their parities .
It was revived as part of fixed dollar system until US inflation caused by the Vietnam War and “ Great Society ” social spending forced President Richard Nixon to close the gold window in 1971 .
The world ’s fiat paper currencies have lacked any external anchor ever since .
It is widely argued that the financial excesses and extreme debt leverage of the last quarter century would have been impossible – or less likely – under the discipline of gold .

The case of 12 men arrested over a suspected bomb plot in the UK who were all later released without any charges is to be independently reviewed .
Eleven Pakistani nationals are now in UK Border Agency custody and face possible deportation .
Lord Carlile of Berriew QC will look at the case as part of his ongoing role as independent reviewer of terrorism laws .
Greater Manchester Chief Constable Peter Fahy , defended the arrests , saying he was not " embarrassed " .
' Serious questions '
But the Muslim Council of Britain says the government should admit it had made a mistake and claimed the way it had dealt with the men was " dishonourable " .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown 's spokesman told reporters : " We are seeking to remove these individuals on grounds of national security .
" The government 's highest priority is to protect public safety .
Where a foreign national poses a threat to the country , we will seek to exclude or deport them where appropriate . "
Dominic Casciani , of the BBC 's home affairs team
If someone is arrested on suspicion of a crime , they either end up in the dock or walking out of the police station a free man .
But for foreign nationals accused of crime there is a third way - being sent directly for immigration removal .
The home secretary has considerable powers to deport foreign nationals whose presence is not conducive to the public good - and she does n't need hard criminal evidence to go ahead .
The cases will go to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission , effectively a national security tribunal .
It can hear evidence in secret - which means that intelligence assessments with no weight in a criminal trial can be used to ban someone from the UK .
That means that we 're unlikely to ever hear the full story - and if the men lose , the security services can say they acted appropriately .
It boils down to the difference between whatever the secret intelligence police and security services believed they had uncovered and the lack of evidence that the men were doing anything illegal .
However , lawyers for the men point out that they have not been charged and are innocent of any crime .
Of the 12 men arrested in raids in Liverpool , Manchester and Clitheroe in Lancashire , 11 were Pakistani nationals , with 10 holding student visas .
One was from Britain .
The Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) decided there was insufficient evidence to press charges - or to convince magistrates to allow police to hold the men any longer .
Greater Manchester Police led the inquiry and Mr Fahy said : " I do not believe a mistake has been made .
I do not feel embarrassed or humiliated about what we have done .
We carried out our duty . "
He added the fact the raids had to be brought forward after Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick accidentally revealed secret documents to photographers had not affected the outcome .
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson added : " I am satisfied that the action taken was the right action taken and we now have to follow the proper legal process . "
Lord Carlile said his self - appointed review would look at the use of the Terrorism Act 2000 in relation to the arrests as part of his " ongoing role " .
He said no criticism should be implied by the inquiry which would run from 5 May to 31 July .
Mr Fahy said both the Muslim community and public at large understood the threat to the UK and that police would sometimes arrest people without pressing charges afterwards .
No criminal history Lawyer Mohammed Ayub , who is representing three of the men , said in a statement : " After 13 days in custody , during which no evidence of any wrongdoing was disclosed , they have now been released without charge .
" Our clients have no criminal history , they were here lawfully on student visas and all were pursuing their studies and working part - time .
Our clients are neither extremists nor terrorists . "
Inayat Bunglawala , of the Muslim Council of Britain , said the government had been " dishonourable " over the way it had dealt with the men .
What we cannot afford is for the police to keep getting it wrong .
It saps the confidence of the public in the police
Afzal Khan
Lord Mayor of Manchester Mr Bunglawala told the BBC that when the arrests " took place in very dramatic circumstances of students being arrested at university and thrown to the floor " the public had been assured the men posed a serious threat .
He said it was unacceptable for the government to make these sorts of prejudicial remarks from the outset and then , having found insufficient evidence to bring charges , to deport the men anyway .
" Politics should not be interfering with what is primarily a legal process , " he said .
Lord Mayor of Manchester Afzal Khan , a former police officer and a councillor for one of the areas where the operation took place , Cheetham Hill , called for an independent investigation .
He said : " We want the police to get it right , that is what they are there for , to protect us .
What we cannot afford is for the police to keep getting it wrong .
It saps the confidence of the public in the police . "
' Very worrying '
Pakistan 's high commissioner to the UK said he would provide legal assistance to the released students who should be allowed to complete their studies since no charges were brought .
" They are youngsters from very poor families ... they spent all their savings and came here with passports and visas to pursue their education and they should be allowed ... to pursue their education , " he said .
Shadow security minister Baroness Neville - Jones said : " It is very worrying that , following an investigation based on strong intelligence into what the prime minister described as a serious terrorist plot , the police have not been able to present sufficient evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service on which it could lay charges against any of the 12 arrested . "
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne described it as " yet another embarrassment " for Home Secretary Jacqui Smith .
" Serious questions need to be answered about whether Bob Quick 's blunder distorted this operation and on what grounds these men are being deported , " he said .
Assistant Commissioner Quick - the UK 's most senior counter - terrorism officer - quit his post a day after the operation .
However , the home secretary told MPs on Monday the error had not damaged the operation and the only impact had been that the raids had been brought forward " by a matter of hours " .

Prize for ' Sun in the box ' cooker
By Richard Black
Environment correspondent , BBC News website
At the heart of the idea is a simple black painted box ...
A cheap solar cooker has won first prize in a contest for green ideas .
The Kyoto Box is made from cardboard and can be used for sterilising water or boiling or baking food .
The Kenyan - based inventor hopes it can make solar cooking widespread in the developing world , supplanting the use of wood which is driving deforestation .
Other finalists in the $ 75,000 ( £ 51,000 ) competition included a device for streamlining lorries , and a ceiling tile that cools hot rooms .
Organised by Forum for the Future , the sustainable development charity founded by Jonathan Porritt , the competition aims to support concepts that have " moved off the drawing board and demonstrated their feasibility " for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , but have not gained corporate backing .
With as many people as there are in the developing world today , they can't just cook using trees - they 'll finish off all the trees
Jon Bohmer , Kyoto Energy
" The Kyoto Box has the potential to transform millions of lives and is a model of scalable , sustainable innovation , " said Peter Madden , the forum 's chief executive .
It is made from two cardboard boxes , which use reflective foil and black paint to maximise absorption of solar energy .
Covering the cooking pot with a transparent cover retains heat and water , and temperatures inside the pot can reach at least 80C .
As many as two billion people in the world use firewood as their primary fuel .
Scaling up
The idea of cooking using the Sun 's rays has been around for centuries , and a number of organisations including Solar Cookers International are already supporting their manufacture and distribution in the developing world .
FROM THE BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service Reducing reliance on firewood reduces deforestation , but also improves the health and wellbeing of villagers who do not have to trek for miles collecting the increasingly scarce wood nor spend hours inhaling wood smoke , a major cause of respiratory disease .
What impressed the judges about the Kyoto Box was the potential for production to be scaled up significantly in a number of developing countries .
" It 's really the mass manufacturing aspect , " said Jon Bohmer , who founded the company Kyoto Energy in Kenya .
" We can take existing factories like cardboard factories and begin to make thousands and thousands of the cookers each month , " he told BBC News .
" So far , solar cooking has been a DIY project with people making them on their own in slums and so on ; but this could be the Volkswagen , you might say . "
An evaporating tile was another of the competition 's finalists Mr Bohmer hopes to gain funding from the international carbon market .
By demonstrating that using the Kyoto Box reduces greenhouse gas emissions , he can gain " carbon credits " from western countries and companies .
" With as many people as there are in the developing world today , they can't just cook using trees - they 'll finish off all the trees , " he said .
Other innovations reaching the competition 's final included a feed additive for livestock , derived from garlic , which can cut methane emissions from cows and sheep by at least 5 %
an indoor cooling system that uses a building 's exhaust air to evaporate water held inside hollow tiles
a giant microwave oven that turns wood into charcoal
an aerodynamic cover for lorry wheels that reduces drag and thus fuel use The Climate Change Challenge competition was also supported by the Financial Times newspaper and technology company HP .

An interesting article came out in the Washington Post that said that Facebook Causes was n't really helping nonprofits at all and that online giving still represented a small amount of donations for nonprofits .
The debate about Facebook Causes is an interesting one .
I never saw Facebook as a way to viably raise money but rather as a way to promote your brand and prospect for more donors .
Facebook is about creating a connection rather than raising dollars .
The question then becomes , how do you translate this connection into dollars ?
Is it by collecting everyone 's email addresses and sending out an email blast ?
By inviting people to an event ?
My question to the writers of this article is that of the many nonprofits on Facebook Causes , how many are using it to their advantage ?
And how many put together a strategy before hand that determined whether this is something that their donors would be interested in or not ?
Like any communication tool , you need to assess whether it is right for you or not .
Survey your donors , ask questions and determine if it 's worth your time and energy to make it happen .
If it is , then go for it .
But do n't do it just because everyone else is .
So my question to you is this :
Do you have a Facebook Causes page ?
Is it working for you ?
And did you survey your donors ahead of time ?
There should also be a law passed that states if Republicans obstruct a bill they may not be allowed to take credit for it if it passes .
I knew this was coming , did n't you ?
Last week , Sen. Kit Bond ( R - MO ) slammed President Obama ’s recovery and reinvestment plan .
“ Hold on to your wallets folks because with the passage of this trillion - dollar baby the Democrats will be poised to spend as much as $ 3 trillion in your tax dollars , ” Bond said .
“ Unfortunately , this bill stimulates the debt , it stimulates the growth of government , but it does n’t stimulate jobs , ” Bond insisted .
However , today Bond is touring Missouri to tout the very stimulus plan he railed against .
In a press release , Bond boasted about an amendment he included in the bill to provide more funding for affordable housing — and that will create jobs :
Last week , Bond led a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing an amendment to help provide needy families affordable housing .
Bond ’s amendment provides $ 2 billion to fund low - income housing tax credit ( LIHTC ) projects that have been stalled by the financial credit crisis .
As part of the Democrats ’ spending bill now signed into law , the Senate unanimously accepted Bond ’s provision . [… ]
This provision will have a real impact in Missouri , especially for low - income , working families in need of safe and affordable housing .
…
Bond ’s amendment will save more than 700 housing units and create 3,000 new jobs in Missouri .
“ This is the type of emergency stimulus spending we should be supporting — programs that will create jobs now and help families , ” Bond said .
I love the fact that Goober Graham is gladly taking the money :
– Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) , who also campaigned ardently against the bill , said he would nevertheless gladly accept its funds for his state .
“ You do n’t want to be crazy here , ” he said .
And Digby finds this nugget about the psycho right wing Govenors that may want to refuse some of the money .
Stupidly , Clyburn , inserted a clause in the bill that says legislator 's can override the Governor and accept the money .
I know he was just looking out for the people in the states where Republicans are more interested in playing politics than helping their constituents .
In fact , governors who reject some of the stimulus aid may find themselves overridden by their own legislatures because of language Clyburn included in the bill that allows lawmakers to accept the federal money even if their governors object .
He inserted the provision based on the early and vocal opposition to the stimulus plan by South Carolina 's Republican governor , Mark Sanford .
But it also means governors like Sanford and Louisiana 's Bobby Jindal — a GOP up - and - comer often mentioned as a potential 2012 presidential candidate — can burnish their conservative credentials , knowing all the while that their legislatures can accept the money anyway .
I guess these people are placing their political bets on the economy not being so bad that they get blamed , but still bad enough that they can blame Obama .
It 's quite tight rope they 're walking .
If the Democrats were as ruthless and reckless with other people 's lives as the Republicans are , they would n't have put that clause in the legislation and would have let the Republicans pay the price for this nonsense .
You know if the shoe were on the other foot , the GOP kamikazees would have forced the Dems to bear the brunt of such a decision .
But then , that 's the reason why the country is in this catastrophic mess in the first place is n't it ?
The Republicans just do n't give a damn about the people they are supposed to be representing .
Amen .
From the Cafferty File :
Here ’s my question to you :
When it comes to the torture debate , why has former President Bush been silent ?
While president , Bush repeatedly denied that his administration authorized torture of prisoners .
But just last week a Senate report showed top Bush officials as early as 2002 gave the CIA approval to use techniques like waterboarding — which has been considered torture since the Spanish Inquisition .
But with all the talk — one person we have n’t heard from is former President Bush himself .
Democratic Senator Patrick
Leahy insists an independent commission is needed to find out who exactly authorized this stuff , saying : “ I want to know who was it who made the decisions that we will violate our own laws ; we ’ll violate our own treaties ; we will even violate our own Constitution . ”
Bush ’s former top political adviser , Karl Rove is accusing Mr. Obama of seeking “ show trials ” of former administration officials .
Even Senator John McCain , who fought for limits on interrogation during the Bush administration , says any talk of prosecution is about “ settling old political scores . ”
I guess the fact that laws may have been broken does n’t matter to McCain .
Since the release of those Bush - era interrogation memos , former Vice President Dick Cheney has n’t been able to stop tallking .
This was a guy who we barely saw or heard from for eight years .
Cheney insists the harsh techniques kept the country safe and President Obama should release more documents to prove that .
Raymond from Charlotte , North Carolina writes :
Bush has probably “ lawyered - up ” and his lawyers have told him to remain silent on everything until the smoke settles from his administration ’s disastrous policies .
Deb from Nauvoo , Illinois writes :
George Bush is hoping that one old saying is true : out of sight , out of mind … and that one old saying is n’t : the buck stops here .
Just who do you think is ultimately responsible for the acts of torture committed in the name of The United States of America ?
I think George Bush knows too .
Adam from Thousand Oaks , California writes :
My guess is : he is at peace with the decisions he ’s made and believes they are no small part of what has kept our country safe since 9/11/2001 .
I agree with John McCain that it is a slippery slope when we start prosecuting people for their political views and interpretations .
Jay writes :
Because Bush knows that he is not as smart as Cheney .
And when he hears how absolutely stupid Cheney sounds when he tries to defend this nightmare , he understands how much dumber he will come off if he opens his mouth .
Lesley writes :
I was never a fan of George W. Bush .
I would love to write something not so nice about him .
However , in the case of torture , I have always believed that it was Cheney who was pushing all the torture buttons , along with his pal Rumsfeld .
Cheney feels the need to defend himself , and Bush has nothing to defend .
Jim from North Carolina writes :
Former President Bush ’s silence is very simple : he does n’t believe waterboarding is torture .
Torture is Nancy Pelosi lying about what she knew .
Jack from Nice , California writes :
Jack ,
Who cares ?
I spent over eight years wishing President Bush would remain silent , so now I just want to enjoy it while I can .
Twitter is a relatively new web 2.0 site that is starting to gain a lot of popularity .
That means that a lot of people have heard of it but it is also quite common to run into people who have n’t heard of it .. yet .
Twitter.com is this social site that encourages users to post often about what they are currently doing .
A lot of people are using it to improve their marketing reach , by being an active twitterer they gain followers who are interested in what they got going on .
This means people being exposed to their updates on a regular basis .
For example , if you have hundreds of followers in Twitter and you decide to post an affiliate link , that means that hundreds of people have instantly been exposed to your offer .
In this article I will discuss ways to maximize Twitter for your marketing , and also a big mistake to be aware of .
In order to have a fan base per say of followers in Twitter you must be able to keep their interest in you and what you are doing now .
“ What are you doing ? ” is the whole foundation of what Twitter is about in the first place .
Make sure to post daily if not several times throughout the day updates about what you are doing .
The magical thing behind this is that many of your contacts will be able to feel like they know you so much better , will trust you more , and feel much more comfortable about working with you .
On the other hand , when you follow others you can learn about them and their possible needs .
The big mistake to watch out for is only posting affiliate links or offers on your Twitter page .
This looks like Spam and many people will see you as just abusing Twitter for your own personal gain .
Think of it this way , if you would not want to invite your friends or family to keep up with you via Twitter then you are going about it all wrong .
As with anything you send out or provide , ninety percent should be content and ten percent ( at most ) advertising .
So this concept is quite simple … constantly post throughout the day what you are doing .. it is usually very simple and only takes a few seconds to post !
Secondly , if you write articles or provide content online , provide a link for those in your Twitter posts .
You may post many things within one day , but the last thing you post for the day is usually the most important because it will be there the longest .
This means that your last post for the day should very well contain a link that you want your followers to see before your start Twittering again the next day !
Another part of Twitter is contributing .
As with any social site it should be a give and take relationship .
Notice that give comes first … the more you give the more people will want to work with you and the more attention you will receive .
Make sure to read and follow other users in Twitter .
If you read something interesting or helpful then make sure to reply and say so , or even put a link for it on your Twitter so that you are directing others to more quality content .
This can also be as simple as connecting with other users , if they know you are reading their Twitter page they will be much more likely to check out what you have going on too .
To get started in Twitter you should first invite contacts who are n’t using Twitter and also find contacts who are already using Twitter so that you can start following them and also start getting people to follow you .
Twitter has a nice invite and find feature that makes this incredibly easy .
To grow your reach even more you can start following people who follow or are followed by the people who follow you .. or that you follow .
You might need to read that sentence again .. but basically you can find other users to connect with that are already connected to other users .
Now for a big tip .
If you really want to maximize the potential with Twitter , you should make sure to take advantage of any plug-ins or sites that support Twitter .
Here are three , but I ’m sure there will be many more in the future if not already .
Squidoo allows you to input your Twitter account info into your Squidoo account and then it can automatically post updates to your Twitter account when you create or update Squidoo lenses .
Facebook has an application called Twitter , it automatically updates your Facebook status when you make a Twitter post .
The other tool is a free WordPress plug - in called TweetMyBlog that allows you to create a two - way connection from your blogs to Twitter .
TweetMyBlog allows you to use a widget on your Wordpress blogs that will display your current Twitter feed .. that way all visitors to your blog can look at the widget and see a running feed of your latest Twitter posts .
If they click on that they will be brought to your Twitter page .
In addition , when you make a new post to your blog , TweetMyBlog will automatically make a post to your Twitter page with a link to your latest blog post .
Imagine the extra exposure you can receive by using these tools that help people see more of what you are doing .
Lastly , have fun !
Twitter is a social site … so interact and enjoy !

When you use earbuds in areas where the air is very dry , they can build up static electricity .
Your ears might receive a small electrostatic discharge from the earbuds .
If you receive a static shock from your earbuds , this does n't mean that there 's an issue with your device or the earbuds .
This condition is similar to dragging your feet across a carpet and receiving a static shock when you touch a doorknob .
However , instead of the static charge building up on your body , the charge builds up on the device that the earbuds are connected to .
Instead of the static buildup discharging through your finger when you touch a doorknob , it discharges through the earbuds .
This condition is n't limited to Apple hardware .
Static can potentially build up on almost any hardware and could be discharged through any brand of earbuds .
EA : The PC is ' Rapidly Becoming the Largest Gaming Platform in the World '
EA CEO John Riccitiello reported that the company had seen its digital direct revenue grow to $ 400 million in the last fiscal year , while CFO Eric Brown noted that digital game distribution alone nearly doubled in revenue year - over - year to $ 80 million .
" This is a big year for us , " said Brown .
" The online part of our business is growing as much as 60 % year over year . "
" In terms of distribution , the way we look at a lot what 's happening in the future is , we 've got probably a billion PCs out there in the world , " he continued .
" Very rapidly the PC is becoming the largest gaming platform in the world , just not in a packaged - good product . "
" As you look at what that means in terms of distribution of product , we think that 's incredibly exciting because it 's going to open the market to new demographics , new countries and new types of gameplay , " he added .
This morning Volkswagen ( VOW ) was worth more than Exxon Mobile ( XOM ) as common shares rocketed up as much as 93 % on a short squeeze .
Porsche , in an attempt to take over the carmaker has engineered a shortage of common shares by gobbling up as much as 75 % of the company via options .
The counter parties to these options went long the actual stock to hedge their exposure , leaving the shorts scrambling for shares to buy back .
Volkswagen Overtakes Exxon as Most Valuable Company ( Update1 ) : “ Volkswagen AG became the world 's biggest company by market value after Porsche SE announced plans to raise its stake in the German carmaker to 75 percent , triggering demand from short - sellers .
Volkswagen rose as much as 485.01 euros , or 93 percent , to 1,005.01 euros and was up 55 percent as of 11:10 a.m. in Frankfurt trading .
Wolfsburg , Germany - based Volkswagen has risen more than fivefold this year and at its intraday peak was valued at 296 billion euros ( $ 370 billion ) , more than Exxon Mobil Corp .'s $ 343 billion market value at yesterday 's closing price in New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
Porsche , the maker of the 911 sports car , has accumulated Volkswagen shares since 2005 in an effort to protect ties to its largest supplier .
Porsche said Oct. 26 that it aims to increase its holding from 42.6 percent .
That prompted some short - sellers to buy from a shrinking pool of stock to end their bets .
BaFin , Germany 's financial - market regulator , said today that it 's monitoring trading in Volkswagen shares following the gains .
“ One of the biggest risks with the herd mentality approach to shorting is that a lot of money can be made on the outset , ” said Ed Oliver , a senior business consultant at Spitalfields Advisors , a London - based firm specializing in securities lending .
“ But you can end up losing the whole of it when you try to close the position .
There 's no limit . ”
Stock On Loan
Volkswagen 's surge came as 23 of the 29 other stocks in the country 's benchmark DAX Index fell on investor concern that a slowdown in the global economy is accelerating .
About 12.9 percent of Volkswagen 's common stock was on loan as of Oct. 23 , mostly for short sales , the highest proportion of any company on the DAX , according to London - based Data Explorers .
Stuttgart , Germany - based Porsche added to an earlier 35 percent stake and said two days ago that it holds options for another 31.5 percent .
“ Porsche heads for a domination agreement and triggers a short - squeeze , ” Horst Schneider , an HSBC Holdings Plc analyst in Dusseldorf , Germany , wrote in a report yesterday , in which he upgraded Volkswagen 's common shares to “ neutral ” from
“ underweight . ”
The stock “ will be more driven by covering of short positions rather than by fundamental valuations . ”
Porsche's Intent
Until Oct. 26 , Porsche had said it was aiming only for a stake exceeding 50 percent , and Chief Executive Officer Wendelin Wiedeking said at the Paris Motor Show early this month that a stake of as much as 75 percent would be “ not realistic ” because of market turmoil .
Short sales have largely been undertaken by investors betting on a decline in Volkswagen 's common stock , which hold voting rights , or its underperformance relative to the preferred shares , which carry no votes , according to analysts .
The common shares , which outnumber the preferred equity almost three to one , are the only gainers this year on either the DAX or the nine - member Bloomberg Europe Autos Index .
In contrast , Volkswagen 's preferred stock has dropped 62 percent , including a 14 percent decline yesterday , to 37.89 euros .
“ Volkswagen has been one of the greatest shorts of hedge funds , and it's been an absolute , absolute disaster , ” Emmanuel Roman , co-chief executive officer of GLG Partners Inc. , said at a conference in London on Oct. 23 .
“ It 's been very painful . ” GLG did n't participate in short - selling trading of the carmaker 's common shares , he said . ”
BaFin , which has long been criticized for doing nothing in reviewing allegations of Porsche 's market manipulation , recently had the heat turned up on it , after billionaire Adolf Merckle committed suicide as a result of huge Volkswagen short - related losses , and may finally be forced to investigate what really happened in the days leading to October 28 .
At first sight it is glaringly obvious that Porsche did not act in good faith during the sequence of events disclosing its stake accumulation especially considering the resultant profits to the company - in 2008 Porsche generated a € 1 billion profit from car sales and € 6.8 billion from Volkswagen option trades .
Porsche has long contended that its option trades in Volkswagen were driven by " industrial logic as it built a stake in Europe 's largest carmaker . "
However at its January 31 shareholder meeting , CFO Holger Härter made a disclosure that can dramatically weaken this position and make the legal claims of complaining hedge funds strong enough to potentially lead to civil and criminal claims against the company .
Härter said at the shareholder meeting that Porsche " has also arranged share options to generate liquidity .
The underlying shares were referring to Dax companies and not Volkswagen . "
The company , acting as a full - blown hedge fund , made €400 million placing bets on several German blue - chip shares , in addition to the € 6.8 billion from Volkswagen .
It will be a very tough sell to BaFin that the company 's finance division was speculating in one set of companies ( i.e. , the Dax ) but innocently trading massive amounts of VOW options with no manipulative intentions .
If hedge funds are successful at proving manipulation , which this disclosure may have made significantly easier , Porsche could be on the hook for a full refund of the option proceeds , in addition to further civil disgorgement and / or criminal liabilities .
While the luxury carmaker is currently in swimming financial health with a huge cash war chest thanks to the options trades , any regulatory escalation could result in a rapid and dramatic downfall of the company which has a € 10 billion term loan maturity in March , as banks may run away from a debtor that may be liable for a € 7 billion cash outflow .
And if the dominos really collapse and Adolf Merckle 's suicide is found to be a result of the alleged stock market manipulation , the life of Porsche CEO Wendelin Wiedeking may get really ugly fast .
Luxury automaker Porsche , which in October briefly became the world 's largest hedge fund after it disclosed stock and derivative holdings in fellow car maker Volkswagen , prompting a massive short squeeze , and propelling Volkswagen to the status of largest company in the world by market capitalization , may be in some deep trouble after brand new disclosures by Porsche CFO Holger Härter .
For those uninitiated in the hate fest that transpired on October 28 , Financial Ninja has done a good analysis of the events on that day :
Mobile Casino Guide
Since so many people have been enjoying the action of online casinos , many of the well established casinos have introduced a new playing platform .
The mobile casino is a new way for devoted players to access their favourite games without having to use a computer .
By using a supported mobile device , players can now get in on the great casino action regardless of where they are .
With amazing convenience and portability , mobile casinos have become the latest rage and have attracted the attention of millions of online players .
Mobile casinos work on the same idea as any other casinos .
Players will deposit money and play games for cash .
The main difference between an online casino and a mobile casino is the fact that players can play virtually anywhere .
The games are a bit smaller due to viewing screens , but the concept is the same and players will have the many opportunities to win cash while enjoying some great games .
The game selection in mobile casinos is limited , but players will have no problem finding the best casino games .
Almost every mobile casino will offer an array of slots , Blackjack , Roulette , Video Poker and some other table games .
Players will also be able to play for progressive jackpots through their mobile device .
The winning opportunities do not change and this is a great opportunity for players on the go to still be able to take part in casino action .
Choosing a mobile casino is not difficult and with so many options available , players will surely find a casino that offers great games .
Most mobile casinos are operated by online casinos , so they already have a developed reputation and players know they can trust the name .
When playing in a mobile casino , the first thing to do is make sure the casino supports the device being used .
The players will always have to register for a player account and if they choose to play for real money , they will have to select a banking option and make a casino deposit .
This can all be done through the mobile device .
Once players are registered , they will select the game they want to play and a link to the download will be sent to the device .
Once the software is downloaded , players will always have access to that particular game as long as they have an internet connection .
Mobile casinos offer the same benefits as playing in an online casino .
There will be welcome bonuses , promotions and many monthly bonus deals that can be very rewarding .
A number of mobile casinos will also host tournaments .
With various languages and currencies supported , international players should have little problem accessing a quality mobile casino .
All players will have access to customer support .
Players should always make sure the chosen mobile casino is licensed and registered .
This will ensure safety and security .
If there are any doubts about the legality of the mobile casino , choose another that has a strong reputation and positive reviews from existing players .

Back from a partly medical absence .
Before I do some economics posts , I think I ought to say something about the torture memos — namely , that there is now no way to view the people who ruled us these past 8 years as anything but monsters .
We had all these rationalizations of torture over the “ ticking clock ” and all that — then we learn , for example , that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times in one month .
I really do n’t even want to think about all this .
But this was our government — and these people might be back .
Phusion Passenger is an Apache module for deploying Ruby on Rails web applications , and is mainly focused on ease of use and stability .
The community sponsorship campaign has been a huge succes .
We are proud to announce version 2.1.1 of Phusion Passenger .
This version is a beta version , and if we do n’t find any serious issues in a few weeks , we ’ll release 2.1.2 final ( which is not a beta ) .
We ’d like to pay our gratitude to the following people and organizations for sponsoring this release :
What ’s new in 2.1.1 ?
Support for Rails 2.3
The Rack specification has changed in an incompatible way , mainly in order to be Ruby 1.9 compatible .
We ’ve fixed this in a backwards - compatible manner .
Improved compatibility with other Apache modules , such as mod_rewrite Phusion Passenger is now fully compatible with mod_rewrite !
The “ RailsAllowModRewrite ” option is now obsolete , and everything should work as expected .
While this might sound like a trivial improvement , please think about this for a moment , because supporting mod_rewrite has been anything but trivial .
The way mod_rewrite interacts with Apache is for the most part undocumented .
We have spent many , many , many man hours on reading mod_rewrite ’s source code , Apache ’s source code and many Apache modules ’ source code , and reverse engineering its behavior through debuggers , in order to figure out how to make Phusion Passenger fully compatible .
To get an idea of how much effort we spent into this , take a look at the Phusion Passenger Apache module source code .
Even if you ’re not familiar with C++ , you might be interested in the comments associated with the following functions : prepareRequest , saveOriginalFilename , saveStateBeforeRewriteRules , undoRedirectionToDispatchCgi , startBlockingModDir , startBlockingModAutoIndex .
The information in all these comments are obtained through hard reverse engineering work , because the behavior that these comments describe are not documented anywhere .
We had to obtain this information the hard way .
Ruby 1.9 support
As announced here .
Support for NFS setups Using Phusion Passenger to deploy applications that live on NFS shares is currently a bit awkward , and performance is n’t that good either because of filesystem access overhead .
We ’ve made Phusion Passenger more NFS friendly !
Performance on NFS shares has been increased by up to 8 times thanks to smart filesystem access caching .
Restarting applications that live on NFS shares now works seamlessly .
Various I/ O handling and scaling improvements and fixes Phusion Passenger will now try much harder to enforce I/O timeouts , so that a bad , slow or frozen HTTP client cannot hog server resources forever .
We ’ve improved mod_xsendfile support .
If a backend process sends an X - Sendfile response , then Phusion Passenger used to keep that backend process locked until mod_xsendfile has sent the file .
This has been solved : Phusion Passenger will now immediately release the backend process , making things much more scalable .
Phusion Passenger now fully supports applications that stream large amounts of data .
Apache has the tendency to buffer the entire response in memory before sending it to the HTTP client .
We ’ve suppressed this
Apache behavior , so now your Ruby web application can happily stream hundreds of megabytes of data , and things will keep working smoothly .
Ability to disable Phusion Passenger for arbitrary URLs ( PassengerEnabled option )
This allows you to , for example , integrate PHP applications alongside Ruby / Rails applications on the same virtual host .
Improved application compatibility
If your application has a model named ‘ Passenger ’ then it will not work on Phusion Passenger 2.0. x because that ’s how our namespace is called .
We ’ve renamed our namespace to ‘ PhusionPassenger ’ , so this
problem is now a thing of the past .
Some applications are incompatible with Phusion Passenger ’s smart spawning mode , and have to be deployed in conservative spawning mode .
As you might know , smart spawning can reduce a Rails application ’s
startup time by as much as 90 % in the right circumstances , as well as decreasing its memory usage , so it ’s no surprise that smart spawning is preferred over conservative spawning .
We ’ve added various hooks which
allows developers of incompatible applications to make their applications compatible with smart spawning .
Phusion Passenger depends on the ‘ rack ’ gem in order to support Rack applications .
The latest ‘ rack ’ gem is version 0.9.1 , but some applications have ( incorrectly ) specified a hard dependency on rack 0.4.0 .
If both 0.9 and 0.4 are installed , then these applications will break when run in Phusion Passenger , because the application tries to load 0.4 after 0.9 has already been loaded .
We ’ve implemented a fix so that even these applications will now work correctly .
Better cross-platform support MacOS
X support as well as support for 64 - bit platforms have been much improved .
Sun Solaris is now officially supported , thanks to contributions by Alex Osborne , Jacob Harris , alex.kiernan , Alex Tomlins
and J Aaron Farr .
Non-interactive installer
The installer can now be run in non-interactive mode , ideal for scripting .
Use the –auto command line option .
Improved command - line admin tools
For example , the ‘ passenger - status ’ tool now displays additional useful information such as a worker process ’s uptime and how many requests it has processed so far .
Ability to display backtraces for all threads
If you ’re using the latest version of Ruby Enterprise Edition , or if you ’re using a Ruby interpreter with the caller_for_all_threads patch , then Phusion Passenger gives you the ability do dump the backtraces of all running threads to a log file .
This makes it much easier to debug multithreaded web applications .
Improved security
We ’ve taken various precautions in order to improve overall security .
For example , if user switching is disabled , then all Phusion Passenger helper daemons will be run as non-root ( they must be root for
user switching to work ) .
Temp directory permissions have been tightened to prevent malicious tampering .
More customization options for exotic systems / setups
It is now possible to customize the ‘ tmp ’ directory that Phusion Passenger uses .
This is especially useful on systems on which Apache can’t write to /tmp ( e.g. on many systems with SELinux ) , or systems on
which / tmp is not a good candidate for temporary files for whatever reason .
It ’s now also possible to customize the directory in which Phusion Passenger looks for ‘ restart .
txt ’.
Global queuing usage can now be customized per-virtual host .
It ’s now possible to explicitly specify the location of the web application ’s root directory , in case DocumentRoot + “ /.. ” is not the correct directory .
Various usability improvements
In particular , many error messages have been improved so that end users do n’t have to stare at the screen for minutes wondering what the computer is trying to tell them .
There are also many small usability
improvements here and there .
Various other minor improvements and bug fixes PassengerPoolIdleTime can now be set to 0 , which means that the backend application must never idle timeout .
This feature has been contributed by redmar .
The passenger - status tool will now display Phusion Passenger ’s own backtraces for C++ code , in order to make it possible to detect potential freezes in C++ code .
Phusion Passenger error pages now return HTTP 500 errors , as they should .
The ApplicationSpawner server and FrameworkSpawner server idle times can now be customized .
In the 2.0.x series , sometimes more backend processes might be spawned than is allowed by the ‘ PassengerMaxPoolSize ’ option .
This has been fixed .
How do I upgrade to 2.1.1 ?
Please download the 2.1.1 gem , then install it with the command :
gem install passenger - 2.1.1.gem
Next , run :
passenger - install - apache2- module
Please do n’t forget to copy & paste the Apache config snippet that the installer gives you .
You cannot type just “ gem install passenger ” because this gem is n’t uploaded to RubyForge .
We did n’t upload it to RubyForge because this is a beta release .
You can also download the source code if you prefer that instead .
Enjoy !
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid stripped Arlen Specter of his seniority after Specter became a Democrat .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Meltdown : Specter stands alone
Arlen Specter infuriated Senate Republicans when he bolted from their party last week .
Now he ’s alienated just about everybody in the Senate Democratic caucus , too .
Since declaring himself a Democrat last Tuesday , Specter has defied Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and the White House on virtually everything that ’s come down the pike : the budget , mortgage reform , the Al Franken - Norm Coleman race , even President Barack Obama ’s appointment of Dawn Johnsen to head the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel .
Advertisement
All while quibbling over whether he said he’d be a “ loyal Democrat ” — and insisting that he had an “ entitlement ” to transfer his Senate seniority from one side of the aisle to the other .
The blowback came Tuesday night :
On a voice vote , the Senate voted to strip Specter of his 29 years of seniority , effectively transforming him in a blink - and - you - missed - it - moment from one of the most senior senators in the body to a lowly freshman on most committees .
" There were concerns about his actions , " said Sen. Debbie Stabenow ( D - Mich . ) , chairwoman of the Senate Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee , which sets committee assignments .
In a statement released Wednesday afternoon , Specter said that Reid had promised him that he could transfer his seniority to the Democratic Party .
“ Sen .
Reid assured me that I would keep my committee assignments and that I would have the same seniority as if I had been elected as a Democrat in 1980 , ” Specter said .
“ It was understood that the issue of subcommittee chairmanships would not be decided until after the 2010 election .
Some members of the caucus have raised concerns about my seniority , so the caucus will vote on my seniority at the same time subcommittee chairmanships are confirmed after the 2010 election .
I am confident my seniority will be maintained under the arrangement I worked out with Sen. Reid . ”
Specter said in the statement that he would “ continue to be a staunch and effective advocate for Pennsylvania¹s and the nation 's priorities . ”
But as early as Tuesday afternoon , the Pennsylvania Republican - turned - Democrat seemed to know that he’d be doing that from something akin to freshman status .
Sen . Jeff Sessions , just selected to take Specter 's former spot as the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee , asked Specter on Tuesday where he would be sitting during committee proceedings .
" At the end of the other side of the aisle , " a dejected Specter responded , according to a first - hand account of the conversation .
Democratic staffers say Reid may have tolerated Specter ’s early splits with the party if he had n’t simultaneously been so vocal in claiming he was entitled to keep his seniority and leapfrog over veteran Democrats on some of the Senate ’s most powerful committees .
Specter ’s claim that he ’d been promised as much sparked an in - house rebellion among longtime Democratic foot soldiers , including Barbara Mikulski ( D - Md. ) and Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) .
Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , chairwoman of an Appropriations subcommittee who would have been passed over by the more senior Specter , said it would have been an unfair move .
" When you get to be a chairman , you really have some control of that area , and that 's what makes it interesting for me , " Feinstein told POLITICO .
" Somebody comes in on top — then everybody gets bumped .
Then somebody gets bumped from the committee .
That 's a very hard thing if you 've got 14 years having been on that committee .
Obviously you 'd like to stay where you are .
I understand how people feel about it . "
Feinstein said she 's heard other members complain about Specter keeping his seniority , too .
" It 's a concern , and I think Sen . Specter will understand that . "
By Tuesday night , Reid had no option but to strip Specter of his seniority , staffers with knowledge of the situation say .
Reid preserved a vestige of his original promise to Specter by vowing to revisit the matter after the 2010 midterms .
" Whenever you have a party switch like this , there has to be give and take , negotiation , and I think that 's what happened here , ” said Democrat Bob Casey , Pennsylvania ’s other senator .
“ I think the reality is between now and then is — is he on the team or not ? ” a senior Democratic aide said Wednesday .
“ If he ’s instrumental in getting health care done , I imagine his position in the caucus after 2010 will be substantially strengthened . ”
But that ’s assuming that Specter is reelected — or even survives a Democratic primary .
Republicans say the loss of seniority robs Specter of a key argument in a general election race against former Republican Rep.
Pat Toomey or perhaps former Gov. Tom Ridge — that Specter ’s seniority and experience will allow him to deliver more goodies to the Keystone State .
" It 's kind of hard to make the argument that you should be returned to the Senate because of your clout when you 're the junior most senator on every committee , " said Sen.
John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) , chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee .
" I imagine that will be the subject of some discussion on the campaign . "
Julian Zelizer , a political science expert at Princeton University , said the seniority move will be even more damaging in a primary , allowing an opponent — perhaps Democratic Rep.
Joe Sestak — to dismiss arguments that Specter has more clout .
“ This is a body blow for Pennsylvania , ” Zelizer said .
“ It certainly is not a great deal for Specter , who will look like diminished figure in the primaries as a result . ”
One more problem for Specter : Liberal groups are turning up the volume on calls for a competitive Democratic Senate primary in Pennsylvania .
" Our elected officials should have to compete for their seats , and Arlen Specter is no exception , " said Arshad Hasan , executive director of Democracy for America , a 725,000 - member political action committee .
If Specter were to keep his seat and retain his seniority , he would leapfrog nearly the entire Democratic caucus .
He ’d be tied for seventh in seniority with Sen.
Chris Dodd ( D - Conn. ) , and he’d be line to fight for coveted subcommittee chairmanships on the powerful Appropriations Committee , potentially chair the Environment and Public Works Committee and take the reins of the Judiciary Committee if Sen .
Pat Leahy ( D - Vt. ) , who is more senior , steps aside .
On Wednesday , Leahy told reporters he had “ no idea ” Specter would lose his seniority , adding , " You should talk to Sen .
Reid ; it was his decision . "
Asked if he was fine with Specter losing his seniority , Leahy said : " I 'm just glad Sen .
Specter is on the committee .
He 's a very valued senator ; we have a 40 - year friendship , the two of us .
I 'm delighted he 's there . "
Other Democrats , including Mary Landrieu ( D - La. ) , Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) and Patty Murray ( D - Wash . ) all said they were kept in the dark about Reid ’s decision .
Majority Whip Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) said he was in the loop but referred all questions to the leader .
Members are fiercely territorial and use their much - prized committee positions to shower their constituents with legislative gold .
They balked at the possibility of being replaced by someone who simply switched parties to preserve his political career .
In interviews with POLITICO , several Democrats said they were in no mood to give up their gavels either this Congress or next — and several expressed their views directly to Reid over the past several days .
In the end , aides , it was a no - brainer to strip Specter of his seniority : Specter is now a Democrat and has no choice but to try to ingratiate himself with the Democratic Caucus if he wants to retain his seniority after this Congress .
Specter tried to make some amends with members of his new party Tuesday .
After word leaked out that he ’d told The New York Times that the courts in Minnesota should “ do justice ” and name Republican Norm Coleman the winner over Democrat Al Franken , Specter backpedaled , telling CQ that he had “ conclusively misspoke ” in “ the swirl of moving from one caucus to another . ”
Victoria McGrane , Martin Kady II and Michael Falcone contributed to this story .
The Associated Press board voted Monday to " pursue legal and legislative actions " against aggregators who use content without permission , a new shot across the bow of internet news sites in the war over how little use is " fair use . "
The AP named no potential targets , yet speculation immediately turned to Google .
While the search giant pays the AP to host full versions of wire service stories , it generally does not have contracts with AP member newspapers whose headlines it also aggregates on its news portal .
The AP has also made no bones about pursuing individual bloggers , as it did the Drudge Retort last June .
Part of the initiative will be to " develop a system to track content distributed online to determine if it is being legally used " and new AP - controlled search pages .
As newspaper continue to founder and fail , the clear benefit of Google especially — to direct hordes of traffic back to the original site — is increasingly blurred by the anger and envy of newspaper executives over Google 's ability to monetize aggregation at all while paying nothing towards content creation .
It has become virtually a populist notion among many in the industry that aggregators who scrape a headline and a paragraph are taking something of value , if not outright stealing , and not operating under a fair use exception even if they drive traffic to the source .
" We can no longer stand by and watch others walk off with our work under misguided legal theories , " AP Chairman Dean Singleton said at the AP annual meeting in San Diego .
In recent days the rhetoric against Google has reached new levels , with News Corp Chairman Rupert Murdoch saying : " The question is , should we be allowing Google to steal all our copyright ... not steal , but take .
Not just them , but Yahoo . "
The AP has already sued aggregators .
It filed suit against All Headline News in Jaunary , 2008 , alleging that AHN was " simply a vehicle for copying news reports and misappropriating news gathered and reported by real news services such as AP . "
The case is pending .
In June of 2008 it told The Drudge Retort to remove seven headlines and story briefs from its site but settled the matter after an fierce backlash from bloggers and even ( member paper ) the Los Angeles Times , which called them " clueless . "
In a twist of fate Google CEO Eric Schmidt will deliver a keynote Tuesday at the National Association of America 's convention , where the AP board took today 's decision .
It will be streamed live at 10 a.m. PST at www.naa.org/annual09audio.

The Obama Administration unveiled its high - speed rail plan today , which was met mostly with “ why did n’t we do this thirty years ago like all other industrialized nations ? ”
It ’s meant to buttress and / or replace the sad - sack Amtrak trains that are notorious for two things : being expensive and smelling like urine .
So we could see the scope of the project , the Administration gave us this map of once and future projects :
Now , I ’m a huge fan of high - speed rail , and it looks like there will not only a superfast way to get upstate from New York City , but also North Carolina to New Orleans as well .
This plan would rewrite American travel , and I can’t wait .
However , despite the title “ Vision for High Speed Rail in America ” , the map is oddly lacking in , well , vision .
First off , can someone please tell me the inspiration in connecting Little Rock , Arkansas to Texarkana with a magnetic levitation bullet train ?
Is there something I do n’t know about these two towns ?
I ’ve actually done that drive twice , and heard no legends about secret treasure , breathtaking canyons or wild gazelle .
Here ’s the thing : not to be a snob , but there is one high - speed train that would capture the imagination of all Americans – even the ones who bristle at the inexorable influence of both coasts – and when rendered in yellow , it looks like this :
The Great American
West , the allure of travel , the excitement of America ’s promise was not achieved when they connected Cleveland to Akron – it happened when they connected the coasts .
As soon as that golden spike was pounded in 1869 at Promontory , Utah , our country was forever bound and we were off to the races .
The new Transcontinental Railroad would connect New York to Los Angeles via Chicago – basically a mashup of I - 40 and I - 80 .
All other routes would spine off that one , connecting all of us at 300 miles per hour .
Think of it : leave NYC at 8 am , none of the cramping of airlineers , free to walk about as you choose , free to sleep ( in a bed ) , eat , read , anything you want .
Arrive at Union Station in LA at 10 pm .
LOVE IT !
It is traditional at this point to enter a number of caveats that even now make it difficult to predict that Mr Brown will be replaced before polling day : Labour does not have a tradition of regicide , party rules make it difficult , and there is no obvious volunteer .
I say volunteer because , while candidates can be identified , which politician with any sense would wish to go down as a brief footnote to defeat , under the spiteful gaze of an ousted leader lurking on the back benches ?
Doing nothing is often the easiest course .
" His going would be liberating , but such hard work to make it happen , " one player tells me .
UPDATED !
Added explanation about how to check if you are affected below .
Thanks to vicaya on hacker news for commenting about this .
This article is going to take a look at a rather nasty low - level hardware bug which could bite people writing applications which are multi- threaded .
The bug manifests itself in MySQL as we ’ll see a bit later .
Part of the blame for the nastiness of this bug certainly lies with a third party who should have ( and could have ) publicly released a detailed errata , as we ’ll see in a bit .
Consider this article a bit of a thought experiment ; when you read this article ask yourself : “ How would I have debugged this ? ”
A quick cautionary note :
We ’re going to look at a little bit of assembly .
If you do n’t know assembly , do n’t worry .
Starting at the atom
An important concept when building complex systems with multiple threads or processes is the concept of atomicity .
Very briefly , atomicity is the idea that there is some set of instructions that when executed appear as an indivisible unit to the rest of the system .
The Intel x86 architecture has two ways to execute atomic operations :
guaranteed atomic operations
system bus locking – a processor asserts a signal and other processors are unable to gain control of the system bus during this time
Guaranteed atomic operations
The least interesting , but on the Intel 486 and above :
Reading or writing a byte
Reading or writing a word aligned on a 16 - bit boundary
Reading or writing a doubleword aligned on a 32 - bit boundary
are all guaranteed to be atomic .
[ NOTE :
There are a few more guaranteed atomic operations for the Pentium and P6 families , but I wo n’t go into the details of them here as there is way too much bleeding involved .
If you are the type of person who runs toward a burning building check out : Intel 64 and IA - 32 Architectures Software Developer ’s Manual Volume 3A Chapter 7 for more information about the other guaranteed atomic operations . ]
This list is good , but it does n’t give us enough power to actually implement a synchronization primitive .
You can imagine two processes competing for a resource .
One process reads a flag to check whether the resource is available , but before it has time to flip the flag , the other process is reading the value .
We need a little more juice , we ’d like to be able to read , write , and maybe compare as one indivisible operation .
This is where bus locking and two x86 instructions step in to save the day .
Bus locking
There are two instructions on the x86 which are commonly used as atomic operations :
xchg exchange a source and destination .
cmpxchg compare the EAX register with the destination , if equal load source into destination .
Otherwise , load destination in EAX .
And there are two flavors of bus locking :
automatic bus locking – bus is locked whenever xchg and other special instructions are executed
and other special instructions are executed software controlled bus locking – a small set of instructions ( cmpxchg , dec , and others ) can be executed atomically if preceded with lock
OK , cool .
Now we ’re talking .
We have enough firepower to build some synchronization primitives .
Let ’s build a mutex
Let ’s build a simple mutex using cmpxchg .
Assume a function exists :
/**
* compare old with the destination memory .
if they match , put new
* in the destination and return old .
Otherwise , return new .
*/
int cmpxchg ( void * memory , int old , int new ) ;
This implementation is left as an exercise to the reader .
Wow , I ’ve always wanted to say that .
( Protip :
If you do n’t feel like bleeding , you can just : # include < asm / system .h > which will take care of it for you on Linux . )
Then we can implement a stupid and simple spinlock like this :
typedef int mutex ;
void mutex_init ( mutex *m ) { *m = 1 ; }
void mutex_lock ( mutex *m ) { while ( ! cmpxchg ( m , 1 , 0 ) ) ; }
void mutex_unlock ( mutex *m ) { *m = 1 ; }
That was pretty easy !
Admittedly , it is a pretty stupid implementation .
You could imagine adding more features , and even building more complex synchronization primitives ( semaphores , barriers , read - write locks , etc ) .
Go crazy and build them out .
Synchronization bugs are nasty
So we ’ve talked a little bit about how atomic operations work , and we ’ve built a simple mutex .
Complex multi- threaded applications can use lots of synchronization primitives to control access to a shared resource ( like a piece of memory , or a file , etc ) .
As you can imagine , weird bugs can crop up like deadlock , livelock , and memory corruption if synchronization primitives are used incorrectly .
A large multi-threaded application used by lots of people in the Web 2.0 world is MySQL .
MySQL , like any other application , has bugs .
Take a look at an interesting bug report filed on Feb 5 , 2007 regarding a MySQL crash : http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=26081
So , it looks as if an assertion is being tripped in the source code , but the code in the second update to the bug looks very straightforward .
Maybe some one else is writing all over the mutex and corrupting its state ?
Definitely possible , but there is something strange about the bug reports that start to roll in afterward .
It seems that everyone hitting this bug is using AMD Opteron CPUs .
Maybe this a hardware bug ?
AMD Opteron bug causes a MySQL crash
It turns out that MySQL was crashing because of a hardware bug in AMD Opteron Revision E and pre-release Revision F processors .
There is no official errata published about this , but we can find clues in the OpenSolaris mutex implementation .
From OpenSolaris ’ IA - 32 lock_prim .S file ( NOTE : AT&T syntax ) :
560 ENTRY_NP ( mutex_enter ) ... 563 lock 564 cmpxchgq %rdx , ( %rdi ) 565 jnz mutex_vector_enter 566 .mutex_enter_lockstat_patch_point : 567 # if defined ( OPTERON_WORKAROUND_6323525 ) 568 .mutex_enter_6323525_patch_point : 569 ret /* nop space for lfence */ 570 nop 571 nop ....
Note that on line 563 , the lock prefix is used , so the cmpxchg instruction should be atomic .
But something weird is going on here , notice how line 567 checks for a macro called OPTERON_WORKAROUND_6323525 ?
That looks suspicious , as does the comment on line 569 .
The nop instruction is a no - op ; the instruction does n’t do anything .
In this case it looks as if nop instructions are being used to set aside space and will be overwritten later with an lfence if you have an affected AMD CPU .
If you look up lfence and nop in the Intel® 64 and IA - 32 Architectures Software Developer ’s Manual Volume 2A : Instruction Set Reference , A - M , you can see that nop instruction is 1 byte wide and the lfence instruction is 2 bytes wide .
Looks like the OpenSolaris guys left just enough room for one lfence .
If we dig a little deeper in lock_prim .S , we discover a helpful comment :
1133 /* 1134 * patch_workaround_6323525 : provide workaround for 6323525 1135 * 1136 *
The workaround is to place a fencing instruction ( lfence ) between the 1137 * mutex operation and the subsequent read - modify - write instruction .
1138 * 1139 * This routine hot patches the lfence instruction on top of the space 1140 * reserved by nops in the lock enter routines .
1141 */
Wow .
That is extremely painful .
So it turns out that an lfence instruction is needed after the cmpxchg .
lfence ( load fence ) forces all memory reads preceding the lfence to be read from memory before memory reads following the lfence .
Without the lfence , a read after the cmpxchg can happen before the cmpxchg .
This read can result in reading stale / incomplete state information .
The workaround hot patches the kernel and writes an lfence instruction in the space set aside by the nop instructions on lines 570 and 571 .
Thankfully , MySQL is well written and a runtime assertion caught this bug before it could do real damage or corrupt data .
But what about your multi- threaded code ?
Is it equally well - written ?
Would you have caught the same hardware bug with runtime assertions ?
Now is definitely a good time to go add those assertions you ’ve been putting off .
Current state of affairs of this bug
This bug is fixed in recent versions of OpenSolaris and it is unclear whether or not this is currently an issue with Linux .
Depending on which version of the Linux kernel you are using , Linux uses an atomic decrement ( dec ) in the fast path and an xchg in the slow path .
With the lack of an official public errata about this issue , it is difficult to tell which other instructions could be affected .
How to check if you are affected
Special thanks to vicaya on hacker news for suggesting this !
If you are using Linux you can simply check / proc / cpuinfo :
$ cat / proc / cpuinfo
If your CPU family is 15 and your model is 32 - 63 inclusive your processor is buggy !
Conclusion
There are a couple things to take away from this :
Yesterday , we considered the meaning of scientific literacy in America … or lack thereof .
So let ’s take this discussion one step further as it ’s a particularly interesting topic .
According to the National Academies :
Scientific literacy is the knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and processes required for personal decision making , participation in civic and cultural affairs , and economic productivity .
It also includes specific types of abilities .
In the National Science Education Standards , the content standards define scientific literacy .
Scientific literacy means that a person can ask , find , or determine answers to questions derived from curiosity about everyday experiences .
It means that a person has the ability to describe , explain , and predict natural phenomena .
Scientific literacy entails being able to read with understanding articles about science in the popular press and to engage in social conversation about the validity of the conclusions .
Scientific literacy implies that a person can identify scientific issues underlying national and local decisions and express positions that are scientifically and technologically informed .
A literate citizen should be able to evaluate the quality of scientific information on the basis of its source and the methods used to generate it .
Scientific literacy also implies the capacity to pose and evaluate arguments based on evidence and to apply conclusions from such arguments appropriately .
Individuals will display their scientific literacy in different ways , such as appropriately using technical terms , or applying scientific concepts and processes .
And individuals often will have differences in literacy in different domains , such as more understanding of life - science concepts and words , and less understanding of physical - science concepts and words .
Scientific literacy has different degrees and forms ; it expands and deepens over a lifetime , not just during the years in school .
But the attitudes and values established toward science in the early years will shape a person ’s development of scientific literacy as an adult .
Recently , 4 chan pwnd Time Magazine ’s poll to identify the World ’s Most Influential Person .
The online community dominated that poll and made the founder of 4 chan , moot A.K.A. Christopher Poole the winner .
That ’s not surprising .
4 chan is known for pwning everything it can get its hands on .
But this last week 4 chan got a little of it ’s own medicine when it ’s infamous /b/ board got crippled ( that ’s Internet slang for “ it stopped working right ” ) .
For over a week , the 4 chan /b/ board was down .
The question is why ?
Here ’s the scoop straight from our anonymous source ’s mouth :
Spammers posted pics with a link saying “ See nude girls here ? ” –
The link led to a zip file that was an autoexecutable virus .
Allegedly the autoexecutable was a virus based on Virtumonde .
The altered virus was able to create a MASSIVE botnet capable of DDosing the board .
So in essence , the people who brought down /b/ turned out to be /b/ itself .
To many people got infected with the virus that is DDosing that board .
Translated :
4 chan users got tricked into downloading a virus which turned around and attacked the server that the 4 chan /b/ board forum runs on .
The way to fix the problem is for 4 chan users to clean up and get rid of the virus .

A large inflatable rat placed at a job site as a labor protest is protected speech under the First Amendment , the state Supreme Court ruled today .
The high court overturned a municipal ordinance that bans any inflatable signs not being used for a store grand opening .
The court ruled the sign ban was overly broad and violates the First Amendment right to free speech .
The
text of the court opinion
is available .
The justices ruled in a case involving International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 269 in Lawrence and the union 's business manager , Wayne DeAngelo .
Local 269's lawyer , Andrew Watson , called the unanimous ruling a " landmark " decision .
" Not only will it impact labor protests in New Jersey , but we feel it's a decision that will be influencing sign ordinances and law nationwide , " he said .
The first inflatable rat was used by a Chicago union in 1990 to catch the attention of nonunion employers .
There are about 50 throughout New Jersey and the Lawrence union 's rodent is used about 50 times a year , union officials said .
The union used the rat in April 2005 to stage a protest outside a health club in Lawrence Township where electrical work was done by nonunion laborers .
The inflatable rat was anchored to a grassy spot considered part of the public right of way while union members stood nearby handing out leaflets .
When police told the workers the rat violated the local ordinance on inflatable signs , the creature was removed , but later brought back .
The union 's business manager , Wayne DeAngelo , was issued a summons and paid a $ 133 fine .
The union took Lawrence to court , but the township prevailed when its inflatable sign ban was upheld by a divided state appeals court in December 2007 .
Today the state 's highest court reversed that decision , concluding Lawrence 's sign ordinance was overly broad and violates the First Amendment right to free speech .
" The goals of the Lawrence Township sign ordinance are to maintain an aesthetic environment , to improve pedestrian and vehicular safety , and to minimize the adverse effects of signs on property .
Although those are salutary goals , they do not justify a content - based restriction of non-commercial speech , " the justice concluded in the unanimous ruling .
" Content - based restrictions that bar noncommercial speech must be subjected to the most exacting scrutiny , " the justices said .
" There is no evidence to suggest that a rat balloon is significantly more harmful to aesthetics or safety than a similar item being displayed as an advertisement or commercial logo used in a seven - day grand opening promotion .
Nor is there any evidence to suggest that the ordinance 'is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end . ' "
The justices left municipalities an avenue to regulate the " time place and manner of use " of signs , " as long as any future sign ordinance ' leaves open ample alternative channels for communication . ' "
The Mercer County case was the latest in a string of attempts to exterminate inflatable rats from public displays .
Businesses elsewhere have sued unions , arguing the rodents should n't be considered protected speech .
First Amendment scholars counter they fall into the category of " pure speech " that deserves protection akin to political and religious speech .
Watson , Local 269's lawyer , said " We believe it 's a vindication .
Unions and their members have a long history , a tradition of exercising the right of free speech and they 've developed these orderly and non-threatening means of protest and expression .
This decision really validates the rights of the unions , and frankly all New Jersey citizens , to peacefully and effectively express themselves . "
John Dember , the township 's attorney , said he was glad the high court limited its decision to the First Amendment constitutional issue and not other issues raised by the union , such as selective enforcement of the sign ordinance by township police officers or that the union 's rights under the National Labor Relations
Act trumped the township 's right to enact ordinances .
" But of course the freedom of expression First Amendment issue is the most important one they addressed , " he said .
" Obviously we need to tweak our ordinance and we 'll get on that right away . "
He said any revised ordinance would address the court 's concern that the township was restricting too much speech to accomplish the sign ordinance 's goals of promoting safety and asthetics .
" We 'll look to narrow the scope of the ordinance , " he said .
A revised ordinance also would address the issue of favoring commercial speech over non-commercial speech .

One of Vande Velde ’s first memories of bike racing is hearing the hiss of a tire pump .
At 6 a.m. , his father , John , would inflate the tires on his own bike before his daily ride .
Christian , about 5 then , would wake up , eyes wide , and bound out of bed .
Together , they would ride around their neighborhood here , around a lake , down tree - lined streets , past houses that stood dark , still and silent .
“ I bought him a blue - and - white Schwinn , and he had the training wheels off in two hours , just two hours ! ” said John Vande Velde , 60 , who is of Belgian heritage .
“ It always came so easily to him . ”
Afterward , John Vande Velde would drop off his son at home .
Christian remembers watching his father , his hero , pedal away until he was swallowed by the horizon .
John Vande Velde , a Hall of Famer , was a three - time national champion in the individual pursuit and a two - time Olympian  1968 and 1972  on the track .
He also appeared in the classic cycling film “ Breaking Away ” as an Italian bike racer , one of the Team Cinzano bad guys .
Vande Velde was mesmerized by his father ’s fame , which his dad tried to counter by emphasizing schoolwork .
But he followed in his father ’s footsteps anyway , eventually becoming a two - time Olympian himself .

At times , though , John Vande Velde worried about his son ’s confidence .
He recalled a day when his son was just a boy , playing with a toy Corvette at his grandparents ’ house .
His grandmother had told him that he would one day have a real Corvette .
Even as critics have attacked Microsoft for bending the truth in its PCs - are - cheaper ad campaign , one firm 's research shows that it might be working and turning the public minds , though not necessarily wallets , away from Apple .
After talking regularly with 5,000 people over the course of several months , ad trackers at BrandIndex discovered that Microsoft overtook Apple in value perception scores — the belief that a given brand gives more value for money — starting from the end of March , or roughly when Microsoft began its Laptop Hunters ad campaign on TV and online .
Where Apple had crested as high as a score of 70 in late February , the advent of Microsoft 's promo spots has led to a gradual but noticeable decline that , as of the end of the study on May 12th , gave the Mac maker a score of just 12 points on the study 's charts .
Microsoft , meanwhile , has almost uniformly risen in its perceived value from very nearly zero ( neutral ) to 46 points this month , or more than three times Apple 's portrayed worth .
The analyst company 's global managing director , Ted Marzilli , treats this as a role reversal prompted by the ads .
He sees Apple as having regularly trumped Microsoft in the past with a younger , 18 - to - 35 crowd more receptive to its ' cool ' but now challenged by reminders that Macs are frequently more expensive .
Many of these are more conscious about what they spend and , particularly in a tough economy , are more likely to think twice about their spending .
" Apple did a great job of putting Microsoft on the defensive , " Marzilli told AdAge .
" It made them look old , stodgy , complicated to use and unhip .
But Microsoft has started to hit back , and younger folks are more cost - or value - focused . "

After reading this interesting news , I immediately remembered my dear grandma .
She lived in the countryside and passed away more than five years ago .
She loved salty foods a lot and always used to add some salt to boiled eggs or fresh tomatoes from her garden .
Moreover , she knew an ancient Oriental recipe of some kind of drink called “ salty tea ” ( which involved tea leaves , salt , milk and black pepper – errrgh ! ) .
And , you know what , my dear readers : she was always in a good mood , even when she was tied by illness to her bed .
Now , the scientists from the University of Iowa discovered unique properties of salt to combat depression and put us in a better mood .
Amazing !
A group of American specialists leaded by Alan Kim Johnson carried out some laboratory experiments with rats .
The tests showed that salt deprivation makes the rats stay away from the activities they usually enjoyed .
“ Things that normally would be pleasurable for rats did n’t elicit the same degree of relish , which leads us to believe that a salt deficit and the craving associated with it can induce one of the key symptoms associated with depression , ” Professor Johnson commented .
The results of the study were published in Physiology & Behavior , an official journal of the International Behavioral Neuroscience Society .
Therefore , salt can be considered a great natural remedy for boosting our mood .
However , the experts warn about a property of salt to cause dependence similar to physical dependence on narcotics .
The humanity uses salt for centuries since the life on this planet began on the ocean floor .
Salt has been used as an effective food preservative , as a luxury food additive and even as a salary unit .
In our epoch , a lot of traditional and modern dishes can be characterized with increased content of salt .
The latest studies revealed that average daily intake of salt on global level is about 10 g per person while it is recommended to consume only 5 - 6 g of salt a day ( according to the British Food Standards Agency ) .
Many specialists suggest eating a reduced - salt diet since it is supposed to lower blood pressure , reduce our risks of having heat related problems and help to maintain proper levels of cholesterol in our body .
At the same time , there is no clear scientific evidence of the fact that eating less salt is strictly linked to an excellent health and long life .
According to Norman K. Hollenberg , a researcher at Harvard Medical School , “ .. the influence of salt intake is too inconsistent and generally too small to mandate policy decisions at the community level . ”
Undoubtedly , our body does need sodium , however , we need to keep our salt consumption under control .

Leaves are falling off trees in the height of summer , railway tracks are buckling , and people are retiring to their beds with deep - frozen hot - water bottles , as much of Australia swelters in its worst - ever heatwave .
On Friday , Melbourne thermometers topped 43C ( 109.4 F ) on a third successive day for the first time on record , while even normally mild Tasmania suffered its second - hottest day in a row , as temperatures reached 42.2C .
Two days before , Adelaide hit a staggering 45.6C .
After a weekend respite , more records are expected to be broken this week .
Ministers are blaming the heat - which follows a record drought - on global warming .
Experts worry that Australia , which emits more carbon dioxide per head than any nation on earth , may also be the first to implode under the impact of climate change .
At times last week it seemed as if that was happening already .
Chaos ruled in Melbourne on Friday after an electricity substation exploded , shutting down the city 's entire train service , trapping people in lifts , and blocking roads as traffic lights failed .
Half a million homes and businesses were blacked out , and patients were turned away from hospitals .
More than 20 people have died from the heat , mainly in Adelaide .
Trees in Melbourne 's parks are dropping leaves to survive , and residents at one of the city 's nursing homes have started putting their clothes in the freezer .
" All of this is consistent with climate change , and with what scientists told us would happen , " said climate change minister Penny Wong .

Australia , the driest inhabited continent on earth , is regarded as highly vulnerable .
A study by the country 's blue - chip Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation identified its ecosystems as " potentially the most fragile " on earth in the face of the threat .
Many factors put Australia especially at risk .
Its climate is already hot , dry and variable .
Its vulnerable agriculture plays an unusually important part in the economy .
And most people and industry are concentrated on the coast , making it vulnerable to the rising seas and ferocious storms that come with a warmer world .
Most of the south of the country is gripped by unprecedented 12 - year drought .
The Australian Alps have had their driest three years ever , and the water from the vast Murray - Darling river system now fails to reach the sea 40 per cent of the time .
Harvests have fallen sharply .
It will get worse as global warming increases .
Even modest temperature rises , now seen as unavoidable , are expected to increase drought by 70 per cent in New South Wales , cut Melbourne 's water supplies by more than a third , and dry up the Murray - Darling system by another 25 per cent .
As Professor David Karoly , of the University of Melbourne , said last week : " The heat is unusual , but it will become much more like the normal experience in 10 to 20 years . "

It is thought that the women were researching North Korean refugees Two US journalists arrested by North Korea near its border with China are to face trial , North Korea 's state media has reported .
Euna Lee , a Korean - American , and Laura Ling , a Chinese - American , who work for Current TV , were detained on 17 March .
The North said it had decided to charge the women after completing an inquiry into their " crimes " - although the precise charges remain unclear .
The North says the two women illegally crossed the border from China .
" Our related agency has decided to turn the US reporters over for trial based on findings of their crimes , " KCNA reported .
State media announced earlier this month that it would put the reporters on trial for " hostile acts " and illegally entering the country .
The latest announcement appears to indicate an investigation has been completed to support formal charges , although what those charges are precisely remains unclear .
The Associated Press says the women could face up to five years in prison if convicted of espionage .
' Treated well '
The journalists are believed to have been on the Chinese side of the border when North Korean guards arrested them and took them back to North Korea , although the North disputes this .
They were working on a story about refugees fleeing the hard line communist North .
Washington had initially accepted media reports that the two were being interrogated for espionage , but later said they understood the two were being investigated for illegal entry of North Korea .
The US has no diplomatic representation in the North so has asked Swedish diplomats in North Korea to request access to the reporters .
US state department spokesman Robert Wood said recently that the North had assured the US the detainees would be " well - treated " .
Mr Wood has repeatedly said the state department is trying to avoid commenting too much on the case in order to increase chances of a diplomatic negotiation to secure their release .
Relations have also been tense across the border between North and South Korea , with the North refusing this week to release a South Korean worker .
The BBC's John Sudworth , in Seoul , says there are concerns that the two reporters could be used by North Korea as bargaining chips at a time of heightened tension .

Another man in the drug ring , who was not directly connected to the death and therefore not charged with manslaughter , was recruited off the streets of Mexico and smuggled into the country expressly to peddle drugs in Ohio , the government said .
Image A FAMILY PROBLEM Dana Smiths three sons all became addicted to heroin , including the eldest , Arthur Eisel IV .
Credit ... Matt Eich for The New York Times
Fat on profits made largely in the United States , drug traffickers in Mexico are engaged there in a bloody war among themselves and with the government , which began a crackdown on them three years ago .
Since then the violence , including assaults on the police and the army , has left more than 10,000 people dead .
But on this side of the border , the traffickers continue to expand their reach .
Drug Enforcement Administration officials say that Ohio is of particular concern because of the crisscrossing network of freeways here that make it well suited as a transshipment point .
Anthony C. Marotta , who heads the agency ’s Columbus office , said heroin tied to the Columbus - area dealers had been cropping up in nearby states like Indiana , Kentucky and West Virginia and as far away as the Baltimore area .
The case of Arthur Eisel and the men arrested for selling him heroin shows how the traffickers pushed their product and how in Mr. Eisel , already addicted to expensive pain killers because of a back injury , they found a ready customer for heroin , which was cheaper .
Investigators say that Arthur Eisel was not alone in switching from a prescription painkiller to heroin .
It gives a similar , euphoric high at a fraction of the cost , $ 10 to $ 20 for a “ balloon ”  one dose , usually a gram or less  as opposed to upwards of $ 60 for a typical prescription pill dose on the street .
The traffickers found a ripe market in Grove City , a suburb of Columbus , as they have elsewhere in the nation .
Drug seizures ebb and flow over the years , but the amount of heroin confiscated nationwide has been arcing up since the mid-90s , going from 370 kilograms in 1998 nationwide to about 600 kilograms  roughly $ 150 million worth of heroin  last year , though officials believe it is a small fraction of what is available on the street .
Eric Boehlert writes that Clear Channel Communications is drowning in debt and struggling to stay in business ( yes , we weep and we mourn ) .
Already this year it has shed 12 percent of its workforce .
The workers remaining are losing company matching contributions to their 401K plans .
Yet last year Clear Channel gave Rush Limbaugh a 40 percent pay raise .
And Boehlert marvels at this , because it ’s not as if any other radio entity could have offered him more money than what he was making before .
Boehlert writes ,
The astronomical worth of Limbaugh ’s eight - year pact : $ 400 million .
The amount of money Clear Channel execs have been trying to scrimp and save this year as they lay off thousands from the struggling company : $ 400 million .
Ironic , do n’t you think ? …
… Last summer there was nobody else in a position to steal Limbaugh away .
Clear Channel was basically bidding against itself and decided , in the end , to give Limbaugh a 40 percent raise , which included writing a $ 100 million signing bonus check to celebrate his contract extension .
That right : A nine - figure signing bonus .
At the time , it was a puzzler .
Looking back at it today , the $ 100 million goodwill gesture , viewed against the backdrop of Clear Channel ’s doomsday woes , makes no business sense whatsoever .
( That $ 100 million bonus could have saved maybe 1,000 Clear Channel jobs this year alone . )
Some of the fired employees were popular local radio personalities and reporters .
Apparently Clear Channel is going to be the Rush Limbaugh Channel .
Lee Fang writes that at a recent Heritage Foundation dinner , Limbaugh mocked the poor and laughed at the very idea there might be a recession .
One of his better lines was “ So I always believed that if weâ€ ™re going to have a recession , just donâ€™t participate . ”
Kind of fascinating , in an OMG that ’s week - old roadkill way .

Ancient ecosystem thrives millions of years below Antarctic glacier
Scientists have found an ancient ecosystem below an Antarctic glacier and learned that it survived millions of years by transforming sulfur and iron compounds for growth .
Described in the April 17 issue of Science , the ecosystem lives without light or oxygen in a pool of brine trapped below Taylor Glacier and next to frozen Lake Bonney in eastern Antarctica , said John Priscu , co-author of the Science article .
Priscu is a longtime Antarctic researcher and professor in the Department of Land Resources and Environmental Sciences at Montana State University .
The ecosystem contains a diversity of bacteria that thrive in cold , salty water loaded with iron and sulfur .
The water averages 14 degrees Fahrenheit , but does n't freeze because the water is three or four times saltier than the ocean .
The scientists made a breakthrough discovery when they learned that the bacteria convert key elements on Earth into food , Priscu said .
The bacteria cycle sulfur compounds to access iron in the bedrock .
The ecosystem -- because it has been isolated for so long in extreme conditions -- could explain how life might exist on other planets and serve as a model for how life can exist under ice , Priscu said .
Jill Mikucki , lead author of the Science article and a former MSU graduate student , added that life below the glacier may help scientists answer questions about life on " Snowball Earth , " the period when large ice sheets covered the Earth .
The project also shows the power of multi-disciplinary collaborations , she said .
Techniques in biogeochemistry , microbiology and molecular biology and other novel tests were used to figure out how the ecosystem could survive without photosynthesis .
The ecosystem has the " potential to be a modern analog to what geochemistry and biogeochemistry was like millions of years ago , " Mikucki continued .
Priscu said researchers discovered the bacteria while investigating Blood Falls , a curious blood - red feature that flows from Taylor Glacier .
They learned that the falls are red because they draw water from an iron rich pool , then discovered bacteria in their samples .
The most common bacteria in the pool is Thiomicrospira arctica .
The researchers can't drill down to the pool because the glacier is too thick and the pool is too far back from the glacier 's nose , Priscu said .
The pool is believed to be less than three miles across , however , and a remnant of an ancient ocean that was trapped at least 1.5 million years ago when Taylor Glacier moved over Lake Bonney .
Priscu said scientists have known about Blood Falls for more than 100 years , and his research teams have collected data from there since the early 1990s .
The Science paper grew out of Mikucki's research at MSU and Harvard University , he added .
Mikucki studied Blood Falls for her doctoral degree at MSU and her postdoctoral research at Harvard .
Mikucki , whose project was funded by the National Science Foundation , now teaches at Dartmouth College and continues to work with Priscu .
One co-author on the Science article was Peter Lee at the Hollings Marine Laboratory in Charleston , S.C.
He was a postdoctoral researcher at MSU when Mikucki was a graduate student .
Other co-authors were Ann Pearson , David Johnston and Daniel Schrag of Harvard , Alexandra Turchyn from the University of Cambridge , James Farquhar from the University of Maryland , and Ariel Anbar from Arizona State University .

In recent weeks , the spread of swine flu in Mexico and the government ’s response of shutting down schools and canceling public gatherings brought migration here and elsewhere nearly to a halt .
But demographers expect the deep flu - related decline to be temporary .
With so many Mexicans remaining in their home villages , the population of illegal immigrants in the United States stopped growing and might have slightly decreased in the last year , an abrupt shift after a decade of yearly influxes , research by demographers in the United States shows .
Mexicans account for 32 percent of immigrants in the United States , and more than half of them lack legal status , the Pew center has reported .
Still , at least 11 million illegal immigrants remain in the United States , the demographers say .
Despite collapsing job markets in construction and other low - wage work , there has been no exodus among Mexicans living in the United States , the Mexican census figures show .
About the same number of migrants  450,000  returned to Mexico in 2008 as in 2007 .
Some researchers argue that the drop in crossings from Mexico proves that tough law enforcement at the border and in American workplaces can reduce illegal immigration in times of rising unemployment in the United States .
Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials stepped up factory and community raids last year , and the Border Patrol expanded its force by 17 percent in one year , to nearly 17,500 agents .
“ The latest evidence suggests that you can reverse the flow , ” said Steven A. Camarota , a demographer at the Center for Immigration Studies , a research group in Washington that calls for reduced immigration .
“ It is not set in stone , so with some mix of enforcement and the economy , fewer will come and more will go home . ”
But Wayne Cornelius , the director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California , San Diego , predicted that if the United States job market revived , border enforcement would become much less of a deterrent .

Tip # 5 : Eat your vegetables .
Save some moolah ( and Ma Earth ) by switching out meat for veggies at least one day a week .
Jeremy E.W. Fredericksen via Creative Commons
It ’s tried and true advice , from the USDA to First Lady Michelle Obama to your mom : Eat more veggies .
Considering 78 percent of Americans are n’t eating enough fruits and veggies , it sounds like someone is n’t listening .
Instead , Americans are chomping away at a record 222 pounds of meat a year ( as of 2003 ) .
That ’s 45 percent more meat a day than the USDA thinks is a very good idea .
Does going veg still have you quaking ?
Cutting a little meat out of your diet does n’t have to be scary .
You do n’t have to go whole hog to have a healthy impact .
( But if you do , you might even like it . )
Consider that eating less meat can :
Did we mention meat is more expensive than alternatives such as legumes and beans , which you can buy in bulk and store practically forever ?
Try starting with one of these tasty recipes — or our fave , “ Addictive Sweet Potato Burritos ” — and make this a weekly ritual for you and your family .

PRESSING QUESTIONS FOR OUR CENTURY
I 'm asking myself a lot of questions at the moment and I 'll pick out a few that are really pressing .
One is the problem about scientific literacy in contemporary society .
There are huge things going in the sciences , both in fundamental sciences , like particle physics , and in the biological sciences , especially in genetics and in medical research involving genetic techniques .
In both respects , there have got to be big changes in the way we think about the world and how we think about ourselves .
And in the case of biomedicine , there are going to be differences to longevity , health and maybe even the nature of future human beings .
Everybody 's got to be a participant in this conversation about what 's happening in science — trying to understand it , be informed about it — and to be a participant in deciding how we go forward with these developments .
In order for that to happen , more people have to be more informed about science .
We have a problem at the moment , which is that too few people go on from school to study science at university .
The point here is not about making more scientists necessarily , but making more people who are competent to observe what 's happening in science , to be interested in reading about it , to keep abreast of developments , to be excited by what is happening in science .
And as responsible and informed citizens of this world of ours , to be part of the discussion about what we should and should n't do with our science .
The big question in this respect is , how are we going to reorganize science education in school and how are we going to encourage more people to take more interest in science ?
And , indeed , to encourage more scientists to talk to the public about what they 're doing in science and what they are thinking about .
So the big question for me here is , how are we going to make science , which belongs to everybody , which is important to everybody , available to everybody so that everybody can be a party , in one way or another — whether as a spectator or as a participant — in this enormous adventure .
Because , apart from anything else , science is the greatest achievement of human history so far .
I say that as a huge admirer of the Renaissance and Renaissance art , music and literature , but the world - transforming power of science and the tremendous insights that we 've gained show that this is an enterprise , a wonderful collective enterprise , that is a great achievement of humanity .
How are we going to make more people party to that ?
That 's a pressing question for our century .
Starting right from the very beginning of grade school , finding ways of making science more accessible , not frightening people away from mathematics and physics , not making them think that it's all too difficult , finding ways of drawing them in and getting them engaged — that 's one .
Another big question for me , and I spend a lot of time thinking and writing about it , is the question of human rights and civil liberties in our world .
We think of the Western liberal democracies as representing and embodying an achievement , which took off in the Enlightenment but by a process that began even before then of respecting individual autonomy , creating institutions which embody due process of law and respect individual rights , including rights to privacy , and which lead to a big margin of individual decision over important matters in life , like our relationships and where we live and the kinds of things that we do , protecting us from the power of the state , protecting us from the power of majorities who disagree with our own choices .
These are very significant and central things .
It 's a remarkable feature of the Western world that by the second half of the twentieth century we came pretty close to a dispensation where individuals could regard themselves as free citizens of the world with a marked degree of autonomy .
Tragically , because of terrorism and crime , and also because of the development of technologies which have enabled us to communicate with one another much more rapidly , but which have exposed our communications to watching eyes , whether they 're state authorities or bad people , we 've got a serious situation even in our Western liberal democracies now involving the attrition , the erosion , the degrading of aspects of our civil liberties .
It 's tremendously important that before that goes too far , we become alert to it and do something about it .
We should get angry about some of the things that have happened , but in particular we should get energetic about protecting our civil liberties and trying to organize institutions and practices that protect liberties , and certainly awareness on the part of people to make them more vigilant about it .
We see on the horizon China , which is a tremendous country , with a huge population , now one of the great economies of the world .
Without any doubt , it 's going be a superpower in the next generation or two .
And it 's tremendously important , therefore , that that country should be one which , like the best among the liberal democracies in the West at any rate , has built into it respect for human rights and for civil liberties .
It does n't at the moment ; it sometimes tries to pretend that it does , but it does n't have a good record in this respect .
If it were to become an even more powerful player on the world stage , it would matter whether or not it did respect these things .
Now is the time , too , to be having a conversation about that , thinking a bit about the future and trying to make sure that these frameworks for protecting individuals and communities are properly in place .
My second big question , therefore , concerns how we are going to defend civil liberties and human rights .
How are we going to expand interest and commitment to this ?
By the way , one footnote to this is that the United Nations , which back in 1948 adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and then subsequently the great Covenants on Civil and Political Liberties and on Economic and Social Rights , has become a weak and compromised organization .
If you look at the United Nations Council of Human Rights , which I have some involvement with , it 's a body , which has on it a majority of states and countries whose human rights records are nothing to write home about .
Another difficulty , too , is that our major international instruments are likewise compromised .
Here is a great job of work to be done for anybody who 's keen on the interest of individual human beings , and on the idea of good societies – on trying to make good societies so that there can be good individual lives in them .
That 's my second question .
My third question is one which has much more to do with my own technical academic interests in philosophy , which have to do with the nature of consciousness and of experience and perception , thought and learning ; indeed , in general with questions of the relationship between individual minds and their forms of cognition , and the domains over which thinking , experience , perception , memory and theorizing range .
This is somewhat of a recondite area in philosophy , but of course it's an important one because it has practical applications , for example in thinking about how we would construct robots capable of doing some at least of the things human beings can do in dealing with their environments in a plastic and flexible way , so that they can learn from their environments and be adaptive to them .
Trying to understand the nature of mind and mental processes , about consciousness , is a big frontier issue in philosophy of mind , in psychology , in the cognitive sciences and in the neurosciences .
One thing we 're witnessing today is that the walls between these different enterprises are coming down and they 're influencing one another richly and fruitfully .
My big question there is how do we further that process and what 's going to come out of it ?
Because all sorts of surprising things are already becoming apparent as a result of the interaction between these disciplines .
My final question is about the way we 're going to be reading , communicating and reflecting in the future .
At the moment , we 're all very interested to know about the future in these respects .
Not the future of the book specifically , although it has traditionally been one major focus for the reflective life – sustaining it , enabling communication between participants in it – because already we see the trend that there are different ways in which written content can be delivered to people who want it .
Rather I mean the practice of reading , the practice of reflection , themselves ; I mean the nature of what underlies our ability to be good conversationalists with one another , to be reflective and informed , to have a good knowledge of the classics , but also to be open to new ideas and new work across all the disciplines — history , the sciences , philosophy , and the literary arts .
How are people going to relate to these things in the future , given that in the past this centrally involved reading and reflecting ?
This is an interesting question because in the past our culture has been one that depends tremendously on the written word , on literature in all its forms .
If the way that the written word gets to people changes in ways that make people use it less , and this is a phenomenon becoming more widespread now — formulating ideas and communicating them in very compressed forms , as in text messages for example — that kind of phenomenon might make a difference to our cultural sensibility .
So my next question is , how do we keep the best of the past while remaining flexible and receptive to this new world that our technologies are opening to us ?
Keeping alive the questioning , skeptical , fact - hungry , curious attitude towards the world that the best people in the past have exemplified .
I think the example of the late nineteenth century working class man who taught himself to read the classics , who was inspired by them , and who went on to make significant contributions — this a story that repeated itself over and over again in the United States and in the United Kingdom and elsewhere , and one would like to think that that kind of excitement , that kind of self - discovery and self - making , will continue even in a society where the way it used to be done , by somebody taking a book off the shelf , is no longer the norm .
You sometimes see the comment made , and it's a good one , that the experience of encountering texts , information , opinion and data is very different in current technologised forms as against the way it is when you read a book , or you go and browse in a book shop .
There 's a good point here — it 's true .
You walk into a book shop to buy a book , there are a whole lot of other books that , you stumble across , and you may even buy one of them .
When you pick up a book , you browse it , you go backwards and forwards , unexpected things happen .
Serendipity plays a big part in the education of an individual who loves to read .
Now when you go to a technological device , you 've got to be targeted .
You 've got to go to the thing you 're looking for , and it 's not all that likely that you 're going to stumble across things that just come out of left field and interest you in the way that happens when you go into a bookstore .
For example , you go online and click on a topic , and what the search engine provides you with is alternative stuff about that topic .
But not about topics that you did n't even expect to find that time .
Skeptics about the new technology rightly alert us to the fact that this changing relationship between the mind — one 's own mind — and the texts that one comes across will have this new feature , and there is something to be regretted there .

This year , 2009 , is the 50th anniversary of the celebrated lecture given by C.P.
Snow , a scientist and a novelist , and a civil servant — he was a government official in Britain back in the forties and fifties .
On the ninth of May , 1959 , he gave a lecture in Cambridge , the Rede Lecture , called " The Two Cultures , " in which he said that humanistic culture , literary culture , on the one hand , and scientific culture on the other hand , had diverged very far , and that there was a mutual lack of comprehension across the resulting divide , mainly , of course , from the direction of the humanities .
An additional problem was that so many people in positions of authority in society — members of parliament , ministers in the government — had been brought up in the humanities and did n't really have much of a scientific background at all , so they did n't really understand what was happening in the sciences .
There 's an old saying in the culture that C.P .
Snow came out of , " let 's have the experts on tap , not on top " .
They did n't want to have the scientists in government or in the civil service system with them unless , like him , they were people who were also recognizably of their own cultural kind so that therefore the MP's and others could feel comfortable with them .
Snow accordingly decried this diverging gap between the two cultures .
In the 50 years since Snow gave that lecture , that gap has widened far , far , far more .
Yet it 's still the case that people who make decisions about funding policies — the people in Congress , the people who get into presidential office — tend not to be scientists , they tend to be people who have come out of the humanities or the law .
The problem identified by Snow has worsened .
What are we to do about that ?
Well , I repeat a point that I make often , which is that the only way to bridge this divide is to increase literacy on both sides .
The real urgency is increasing literacy about science on the humanities side , for those people , but it 's a two - way street .
Because scientists also need to realize that their responsibility to society at large places upon them a duty to talk about what they 're doing , to explain what they 're doing , to inform people about it .
There should be interaction .
This is the only way that the divide is going to be at least bridged , and of course in the ideal ultimately it would be closed .
~
Almost every generation thinks that it occupies the time when things are not quite as good as they were in the past .
It 's a very common for people to think that the world is a much less safe place than it was when they were children , but that 's because of course a child 's experience usually is that the world is indeed a safe one , being protected and organised by parents .
From the point of view of culture , and in particular from the point of view of British culture , a lot of visitors to the United Kingdom say how surprised they are by the unpleasant , rather raw nature , rather degraded and superficial nature of popular culture in the United Kingdom .
The tabloid newspapers , the popular magazines , which are all about “ celebrities ” , which are all about a certain kind of voyeurism — they hunt in packs , the tabloid press , chasing after people , first to extol them and then to tear them down when they 're up .
And that there 's a presumption that if a nail sticks up , it 's got to be hammered down , so anybody who 's a bit special in society or sticks out in a certain way is likely to get a hammering by the tabloid press .
There is something rather sullied and sterile about popular culture in the United Kingdom .
At the same time , it 's always been the case that high culture flourishes in the United Kingdom — publishing , opera , ballet , music , the art scene — particularly in London , and London unfortunately , rather like Paris in France , does absorb a lot of the cultural oxygen in the country .
Although other major centers , such as Birmingham , Manchester and Edinburgh , do make a contribution here , which is an important one .
But high culture continues to flourish .
Even despite the repeated efforts by people who are not very sympathetic towards high culture who say , " Why should society be funding high culture for high - brows ?
Why should the government be giving a subsidy to two opera houses in London ? "
But despite that , all you have to do is go to an exhibition , let 's say at the National Gallery in London , and you can hardly get elbow room to see what 's hanging on the walls because even though high culture is an avocation for a minority of society , that minority in absolute terms is growing all of the time .
There remains a very energetic , very vigorous cultural life , mainly in the capital but all around the country , which is a resource for people who care about those things and who may be dismayed by the way that the popular culture has become so lowest - common - denominator .
As regards this latter , I do n't think that the United Kingdom is alone in being this way , but it is pretty marked and it is pretty distressing for people who come from time to time to visit .
~
One thing we 've witnessed in our times , of course , is the bad - tempered quarrel between the religions on one hand , and on the other hand those people who are not interested in or who are indeed opposed to religion .
Some people say that one aspect of this is that religion is experiencing a resurgence , that more people are once again becoming interested in it .
I just do n't think that is the case .
What is happening is that the amplifiers have been turned up a lot by people on the religious side of this discussion because they feel under threat .
This has happened in history before ; there are precedents for this .
One goes back to the sixteenth , seventeenth century when the Reformation occurred and the consequence of that was the Counter - Reformation , the effort made by the Church of Rome to recover its hegemony over Europe .
That was a bloody and painful hundred years , and the tumult made it seem as though the only thing that mattered at that time was religion .
Now when we look back across the landscape of history , we see that a lot more important things were happening at that time than that religious quarrel — the rise of science , the great literary efflorescence in England and in the rest of Europe .
What we learn from that is that when religious people feel under threat and under pressure , they turn up the volume and they fight back ; it 's the cornered - rat syndrome .
What we 've seen in the last few decades is this .
We 've seen globalization impacting areas of the world and putting traditional views under pressure , not least in predominantly Muslim areas of the world , where traditional conservative values are threatened by the much more open kind of society in the liberal West , which exports attitudes and practices disagreeable to traditional societies .
You can imagine , for example , a conservative , traditional Muslim father of teenage daughters encountering an American movie with girls in bikinis , and becoming very worried about what effect that might have on his daughters ; and you can sympathize with the fact that that is a problem and an anxiety for him .
You can also see how , therefore , young men , especially in countries where there might not be enough work and few other outlets – segregated from girls , notably – are angered by this , angered by the difference between their own culture and others , and feeling under threat .
And the result has been a ratcheting - up of the rhetoric , of the heat of the rhetoric .
At the very margin , of course , at the extreme , there has been violence .
But generally speaking , this is not a violent phenomenon ; this is a phenomenon of quarrel , of tension .
But Islam is a Western religion , too .
It 's in Europe , it 's in North America .
When Muslims in England became activist on behalf of their own community , making demands of the host community to be treated equally with other religious communities , what happened was that Hindus and other Christian groupings all wanted to do the same .
They all came jostling together into the public square demanding tax funding for faith - based schools , representation in Parliament , dispensation from anti-discrimination laws .
And so on and so on .
This angered secularists who did n't want to see a recurrence of inflated religious influence in society .
In the closing decades of the twentieth century , people did n't talk much about their religious faith if they had it , and if you were a secularist and you met somebody with a religious faith , as a matter of taste you likewise did n't talk about it .
But after 9/11 especially , there was a watershed .
A polarization occurred .
People on the secular side of the discussion were just not prepared to pussyfoot around and to " respect " people who claimed a faith , and to give them an extra bit in the sunlight because of it , without some challenge , without a discussion about why they were entitled on the basis of that claim .
Religious people have for a very long time said , " Respect me because I believe something . "
Now secularists are saying , " Why should I , especially if it 's a belief in something that I do n't share or that I think is challengeable ? "
That 's my diagnosis anyway of how this quarrel has come up and also my diagnosis , too , of this being a phenomenon of amplification of the quarrel , not of resurgent numbers .
Because we know that everywhere in the West , even in the United States of America , the number of people who lay claim to being religiously observant is decreasing .
What are we going to do about this problem now ?
Well , our main challenge at the moment is how we manage this situation , how we live together and cope with the difficulty of having this bad - tempered quarrel going on .
We have to try as hard as we can , people on the secular side of the argument , in a calm consistent and well - informed way , to keep this discussion going and to talk about how we 're going to encourage younger people , for example , to think critically , to think for themselves , not to accept things on authority , not to take the easy option which is the quick simple story that a religion can tell you , but to do the work that 's required of understanding things scientifically and with deeper insights .
In the course of this quarrel between religion and people who have a non-religious outlook , one factor is that there are certain religious lobbies that are well organized and well funded .
In the United States , for example , the religious Right has television stations , radio programs and publications , and it has lobbyists in Washington , and it 's been able to state its point of view very cogently and powerfully for a long time .
Whereas people , and there are many of them — 30 million or so in the last Pew poll — who self - describe themselves as agnostic or atheists or who have no religious commitment , are equal to just one person because they 're independent and they think for themselves and they have n't got together to fund television and radio stations .
Now in amongst all this , there is the following phenomenon .
You get organisations like the Discovery Institute in Seattle , which is well funded and pushes the Creationist / Intelligent Design line .
And you get institutions like the Templeton Foundation , which is wealthy and offers a very big money prize — more valuable in money terms than the Nobel Prize — and offers it to anybody who will , in effect , make it seem that religion and science are perfectly respectable bedfellows and even , indeed , that science supports some religious claims .
If you think about this , people who do work in science in universities and elsewhere are not paid like bankers on Wall Street .
You can imagine that just to say something , even if you do n't really have a religious belief , to be friendly towards that point of view , you may end up with a million dollars .
That 's like bribery .
That 's a corrupting influence in this debate and a very bad one .
Just recently , somebody who is both a physicist and a religious person , John Polkinghorne , wrote a book trying to show that religion has answers to scientific questions .
He launched this book on the premises of the Royal Society in London — not sponsored by the Royal Society , but because he was a fellow of the Royal Society before he became a priest , he was able to ask if he could do this on Royal Society premises .
It seemed to me that that was a very bad thing for the Royal Society to have done .
It should n't have given any kind of imprimatur to this .
The Royal Society is the one major institution for science in the United Kingdom , yet there are hundreds of church halls and other places where a book of that kind could have been launched .
The Royal Society accepted money in the recent past from the Templeton Foundation for research projects .
They 've ceased to do so now .
I used to write a column for the New Scientist magazine , which ran some Templeton ads until we complained about it .
They have I think stopped doing that now .
This is a mere corner of the larger debate at the moment , but an important corner because here is an institution , Templeton , which is using large sums of money to try to insinuate ways of thinking and talking and certain tendentious ideas into an enterprise — the enterprise of science — where they do n't belong .
There are other formats for religious opinions .
One should not , in an open and liberal society , seek to silence them .
They 've got a right to say what they want to say , but without muddying the waters .
~
I got interested in science in a way that might be regarded as a bit unusual .
There are some philosophers who come out of science — did physics , biology or maths degrees — who are very knowledgeable and who work in the history and philosophy of science , bringing insights , for example , from the neurosciences into the work that they do in the philosophy of mind and cognitive studies .
But for my own part , the story is this .
I was educated in the British tradition which very early made people choose between the humanities and classical languages , on the one hand , and on the other hand , the science subjects .
There had always been an implicit snobbery involved here that the clever kids would go on to the classical side of school and the ones with dirt under their fingernails and who did n't mind smells and bangs would go on to the science side of school .
You were channeled , really without much discussion about what you wanted to do , into one or the other of these lines .
I went on to the classical side of school and straight on into the humanities .
But I quickly realized , just because of being something of a reader and having a lively curiosity , that this meant that I was missing something tremendously important .
So I started to read in the sciences .
Now the fact is that out there , and for a number of decades , there have been wonderful resources for people who do n't have a professional scientific background or training in science , but which nevertheless give them some insights into what 's going on in the sciences .
The more you read , the more you interested become , the more you want to try and equip yourself with a bit of technical competency so that you can understand yet more ; so you read more .
And in very many ways , being an autodidact in this respect is a boon because you do n't go through the process of early on being told what to think about things .
You 're doing it on your own .
So I became passionate about it , recognized the tremendous importance of being as literate as one could possibly be as a spectator of science , and the importance of keeping up that interest .
And more especially to get involved , to get involved in the discussion with scientists about what they are doing , what they are thinking , why they are doing it , where their work is going .
Being involved in that kind of way , too , is a powerful continuing incentive to keep learning .
This plugs into another thought I have , which is that the education that we get in grade school and college is really just the first step out of many thousands of steps that we ought to take in the lifelong process of teaching ourselves , of being educated by what other people are doing , what 's happening in the world ; being educated by staying intellectually alive , staying alert to everything that 's going on out there .
This is the imperative ; this is what we should all be deeply engaged in , always .
The crisis also has implications for Washington , which wants a European Union that can promote common interests in places like Afghanistan and the Middle East with financial and military help .
“ All of that is in doubt if the cornerstone of the E.U.  its internal market , economic union and solidarity  is in question , ” said Ronald D. Asmus , a former State Department official who runs the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund .
The problems are basically twofold : within the inner core of nations that use the euro as their common currency , which together have an economy roughly the size of the United States ’ ; and within the larger European Union .
The 16 nations that use the euro  introduced in 1999 , and one of the proudest European accomplishments  must submit to the monetary leadership of the European Central Bank .
That keeps some members hardest hit by the economic downturn , like Ireland , Spain , Italy and Greece , from unilaterally taking radical steps to stimulate their economies .
Germany once vowed never to bail out weaker members in return for giving up its strong national currency , the deutsche mark .
But German leaders are now faced with the unpalatable prospect of having to put German money at risk to bail out less responsible partners that do not adhere to European fiscal rules .
Within the larger European Union , fissures are growing between older members and newer ones , especially those that lived under the yoke of Soviet socialism .
Some countries of Central Europe , like the Czech Republic and Poland , are doing relatively well .
Others , including Hungary , Romania and the Baltic states , are in a state of near - meltdown .

But only two newer members  tiny Slovenia and Slovakia  are protected by being among the countries that use the euro , and there was little support on Sunday for changing the rules to allow more to join quickly .
Iranian parliament speaker Ari Larijani , in an interview released on Sunday , said Tehran is ready to talk with Washington " without pre-conditions " but is waiting for a " concrete " offer from the new US administration .
" The dispute over the nuclear issue is not an unsolvable problem if we stop being entrenched in our positions , " Larijani told the daily Suddeutsche Zeitung .
" We are ready to talk without pre-conditions .
But for that , we need a real starting point , " the former nuclear negotiator said in the interview to be published on Monday .
Obama to open entire Mall for inauguration Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday December 4 , 2008

The entire length of the National Mall will be open during President - elect Barack Obama 's inauguration for the first time in history to accommodate the million - plus people expected to travel to Washington next month , the inaugural committee announced Thursday .
Officials predict anywhere between 1.5 million and 4 million people will travel to Washington to see the nation 's first black president take the oath of office .
Members of the House and Senate are allotted between 200 and 400 inaugural tickets each to distribute to constituents , but demand this year is massively outpacing that supply .
The National Mall , which covers the 2 - mile long stretch from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial , will be outfitted with large screens and speakers for people unable to obtain tickets to the swearing - in .
In previous years , the Mall has been used as a staging area for inauguration participants and was not open to the general public .
" We 're grateful to local , federal , and military officials for their efforts to open up the National Mall to Americans who want to participate in this historic occasion , " inaugural committee executive director Emmett S. Beliveau said in a news release .
" These arrangements represent our committee 's continuing commitment to make next year 's historic inauguration as accessible as possible to citizens in Washington , D.C. , and across the country . "
The Presidential Inaugural Committee has launched a Web site with further details about the inauguration .

For some reason , there are a lot of people out there who can't stand the gold standard .
Maybe their hostility is in reaction to the large ( and growing ) number of gold bugs who think the worst day in history was August 15 , 1971 .
But since I 'm an economist , not a psychoanalyst , all I can really do is patiently explain how silly the antigold arguments are , rather than speculate on the motives of their authors .
For today 's article I will focus on a recent Bloomberg piece with the suggestive title , " Gold Standard Fans Yearn for Great Depression . "
Gold Is Volatile ?!
Early in his essay , the Bloomberg commentator Michael Sesit gives a rapid - fire sequence of flaws with the barbarous relic :
A return to the gold standard , where countries peg their currencies to a given quantity of the metal and thus to one another , is a bad idea .
Gold - based monetary systems are overly rigid and restrictive , possess a deflationary bias and can be volatile .
They make long - term inflation dependent on the pace of mining output in places such as China , South Africa and Russia .
Let 's take these one at a time .
To criticize a monetary system based on gold as " rigid " only makes sense if you believe that printing green pieces of paper makes a country richer .
After all , the only rigidity enforced by the gold standard is on the central bank 's use of the printing press .
Requiring the government to maintain a fixed dollar / gold exchange rate is " restrictive " in the same way that the Bill of Rights limits the discretionary power of the feds .
" A fixed dollar / gold exchange rate is ' restrictive ' in the same way that the Bill of Rights limits the discretionary power of the feds . "
So yes , if Mr. Sesit thinks that the government does a good job centrally planning the economy with injections of new paper money , then I can see why he would consider the gold standard a bad idea .
But let me ask you this : would you trust your next - door neighbor to use a legal - tender printing press " responsibly " ?
Now what about the people in DC ?
If we 're going to be foolish enough to give them a printing press in the first place , do n't you think it 's a good idea to put some strict rules in place ?
What 's So Bad About Falling Prices ?
Sesit 's next point is that the gold standard has a " deflationary bias . "
So what ?
That 's one of its virtues , that the purchasing power of the dollar does n't fall or might actually increase over time .
Even mainstream macroeconomists — whether neoclassical or New Keynesian — have come to realize over the last few decades that long - term predictability in monetary policy has definite advantages , and that in the long run , the best thing the monetary authorities can do is provide a currency with stable purchasing power .
So you tell me : looking at the graph below of the Consumer Price Index , when was the value of the dollar stable and predictable , and when was it really volatile ?
In which environment could businesses and investors confidently make long - term decisions ?
Remember that FDR took away private citizens ' right to redeem dollars for gold in 1933 , and then Nixon finally removed even the ability of central banks to do so in 1971 .
As the chart above makes fairly clear , US prices ( measured in dollars ) exploded after Nixon formally closed the gold window .
And what the chart above does n't reveal — since it only goes back to 1913 — is how stable US prices were throughout its early history , compared to the 20th century .
To get a sense , consider the following chart showing the price of gold ( measured in US dollars per ounce ) over a long stretch of time :
Remember , Mr. Sesit is warning us that under the gold standard , things were very volatile .
Let me deal with a possible objection : the opponent of the gold standard might look at the above chart and say , " Well of course the dollar - price of gold is stable under a gold standard ; that 's true by definition !
The problem is that this enforced stability means that other parts of the economy get jerked around because of the arbitrary handcuffs placed on the central bank . "
But the historical record does not support this ( typical ) claim .
I always remind people who tout the stabilizing virtues of central banks that the Great Depression started fifteen years after the Federal Reserve opened its doors .
Whether you subscribe to the Austrian theory ( see this and this ) that the Fed pumped up the stock market with artificial credit in the 1920s , or whether you subscribe to the Friedmanite theory that the Fed pushed on the brakes too hard in the late 1920s and then did n't inflate enough in the early 1930s , either way you are blaming the Great Depression on the botched policies of the Federal Reserve .
In contrast , throughout its previous 150 or so years , the American economy had managed to do just fine without the Federal Reserve " fine tuning " the money supply .
Yes , there were occasional panics ( the term they used before " depression " ) when the major economic powers adhered to the classical gold standard , but these business cycles paled in comparison to the Great Depression .
What About Those Foreign Gold Producers ?
As for entrusting our money supply to gold miners in China , Russia , and South Africa , so what ?
When it comes to money , the great danger is a massive inflation .
That 's the only way you can really destroy an economy : through flooding it with more and more paper money so that prices start rising at runaway rates .
One of the prime virtues of using gold as money is that the annual output is a small fraction of the total world stockpile .
We never need fear that prices — if they were expressed in terms of gold ounces — would rise at Zimbabwean rates .
The absolute worst that could happen is that all of the major gold producers decide to stop operations in order to punish the United States .
Note that they could n't simply refrain from selling to American buyers : because gold is even more fungible than oil , the gold exporting countries would need to cut off all of their buyers if they wanted to punish Americans .
Now how long could they afford to do that ?
Unlike oil or other commodities intended for use in production , when gold is used as a money , a given amount can always " do the job . "
It 's true that a sudden interruption in the growth of the world stock of mined gold would put downward pressure on prices , if those prices are quoted in gold ounces .
But soon enough people would adjust , and would factor in the new trend to their expectations .
There were plenty of long stretches in world history where genuine economic prosperity went hand in hand with gently falling prices .
In any event , could those mischievous gold miners in Russia do anything like this to our money supply ?
A Gold Standard Wo n't Work Because It Will Be Violated
Sesit concludes with an odd argument :
What 's more , a gold standard is n't the panacea its advocates claim .
A central bank 's ability to adhere to it is only as strong as the population 's willingness to endure the pain associated with enforcing the system .
Countries periodically abandoned the gold standard during times of war — Britain during World War I , for example — and free - spending Latin American countries were repeatedly forced to exit the system in the late 19th century .
The Bretton Woods System collapsed in 1971 when the costs associated with fighting the Vietnam War forced President Richard Nixon to suspend the convertibility of dollars into gold .
If you do n't have faith in central bankers or politicians to ride herd over inflation , why would you trust them to keep a country on a gold standard for more than a short period of time ?
I 'm not sure how to answer this .
It 's true , I do n't trust central bankers to stick to a gold standard ; that 's why I think the government should get out of the money industry altogether .
Suppose we were starting in an initial state of pure laissez - faire in money and banking , and someone said , " Hey I know !
Let 's give this Princeton professor — what was your name , sir , was it Ben ? — a printing press , but be very stern that he can't overdo it and allow the gold price to rise more than 1 percent from the day he starts .
Does that sound like a good idea ? "
In response , I would obviously say , " No , that seems rather risky .
I think we should stick to the current system , where the market determines how much new money is brought into the economy through gold production . "
But that 's not where we 're starting .
If we 're going to have a central bank , it makes a lot of sense to put in place rigid restrictions on it .
Notice you could use Sesit 's argument for any recommendation to restrain inflation .
For example , Milton Friedman famously recommended that the central bank announce a fixed rate of growth in the money stock .
Well gee whiz , Dr. Friedman , if you do n't trust the central bank to responsibly exercise discretionary policy , how can you trust them to stick to a fixed rate of growth ?
And the same thing applies to the Bill of Rights , too .
If you can't trust the politicians to respect freedom of speech , why would they respect the First Amendment ?
Conclusion
In closing , let me admit that a hardcore libertarian really could say that it is a waste of time to defend the gold standard , or even the Bill of Rights for that matter .
Maybe they really are diversions , little gimmicks that the politicians can use to fool a gullible public into thinking they are safe .
But that is clearly not what Sesit is arguing in his Bloomberg piece .
No , he is arguing that the gold standard is a bad idea because it keeps the central bankers from using all the latest , cutting - edge macro models to fine - tune the economy .
Rather than his proposal , I would far prefer the classical gold standard .
It 's true that the government can always renege on its pledge to maintain a fixed peg to gold , but at least everybody would know exactly when the government cheated .
You would at least avoid absurdities such as the present crisis , in which people are actually praising the Fed for pumping in unprecedented amounts of new money in order to " help . "

Evidence For Jesus
Evidence for Jesus – What Does Archaeology Reveal ?
When it comes to archaeology , is there any evidence for Jesus ?
Do we have actual sites or artifacts that testify to the historical truth of Jesus Christ ?
Remarkably , over the last few decades , significant evidence revealing the life , teaching , death and resurrection of Jesus has been uncovered !
Evidence for Jesus – His Early Life and Ministry
The evidence for Jesus starts with the place of his birth in Bethlehem .
The Church of the Nativity is generally considered a credible historical site , with the traditional cave of Christ ’s birth being marked by the ornate Star of Bethlehem .
Terraced hills containing shepherds ’ flocks still encircle the small city .
On the Sea of Galilee , Christ ’s childhood town of Nazareth is still active today .
In addition , ancient harbors matching the biblical record have been located in recent drought cycles .
In fact , a first century Galilean fishing boat was recently unearthed from the mud and preserved .
Although we have no idea who the boat belonged to , it matches the biblical record for the vessels used by Christ ’s disciples .
Capernaum , a town often visited by Jesus , is widely excavated and protected .
Specific sites of interest include the synagogue at Capernaum where Jesus cured a man with an unclean spirit and delivered the sermon on the bread of life , and the house of Peter where Jesus healed Peter 's mother - in - law and others .
Other archaeological sites involved in Christ ’s ministry include Chorazin ( where Jesus taught in the synagogue ) , Kursi ( the swine miracle ) , Tabgha ( loaves and fishes ) , the Mount of Beatitudes ( Sermon on the Mount ) , Caesarea Philippi ( Peter 's confession ) , and Jacob 's well where Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman .
In Jerusalem , we still see the foundations for the Jewish Temple Mount built by Herod the Great .
Other remarkable sites in Jerusalem include the " Southern Steps " where Jesus and his followers entered the Temple , the Pool of Bethesda where Jesus healed a crippled man , and the recently uncovered Pool of Siloam where Jesus healed a blind man .
Evidence for Jesus – His Last Days and Crucifixion
The evidence for Jesus in the events leading to his crucifixion starts across the Kidron Valley from Jerusalem at the Mount of Olives .
There , we can walk through ancient olive trees to the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus prayed before his capture .
Then , we can look back across the Kidron Valley to the Golden Gate where Christ entered Jerusalem for his trial , scourging and death .
Elsewhere , we find more evidence for Jesus and the leaders presiding over his trial and crucifixion , including an inscription that mentions the Roman procurator of the time , Pontius Pilate , and the actual bones of the Jewish High Priest of the time , Caiaphas , preserved in an ornate ossuary ( bone box ) .
The evidence continues throughout Jerusalem where we can stand in the judgment place of Pontius Pilate called Gabbatha , and then walk the Via Dolorosa where Christ carried his own cross to Calvary .
The huge Church of the Holy Sepulchre is considered by most scholars to be a reliable historical site covering the locations of the crucifixion and burial of Christ .
Incredibly , a 2,000 - year - old heel bone pierced by an iron nail was recently discovered in a Jerusalem graveyard that sheds more light on the practice of crucifixion by the first century Romans .
Evidence for Jesus – What About His Resurrection ?
The evidence for Jesus in ancient sites and artifacts culminates with an empty tomb just outside the walls of Jerusalem .
Although we do n’t know the exact location for the tomb of Joseph of Arimathaea , the traditional site known as the Garden Tomb provides a wonderful image .
Later , on the Road to Emmaus , we picture the risen Christ walking with two deflated and dejected men who lost their leader – the hoped - for Messiah – just a few days earlier .
What event could cause a handful of scared and hiding peasants to light up the ancient world with the bold proclamation of Jesus Christ ?
Nothing short of Christ ’s resurrection could have transformed these people – the evidence for Jesus after his death and resurrection is staggering !

We 've been asked these before so we decided to answer them for you ahead of time .
1 . Is a seebeck the same as a peltier unit ?
Almost .
You can use any thermoelectric in either way but a peltier is optomized to cool while a seebeck is optomized to generate power .
A peltier could be used to generate power but as our video shows its not as efficient as a seebeck is .
It took around 700F Delta to generate 5V with a peltier , the seebeck only required 200F .
You can buy peltiers on Ebay for a lot cheaper than a seebeck .
To get the same power you will have to use more peltiers so it would mean you would need more heat and more cooling .
that may defeat some of your efficiency .
Plus at 700 F the wires tended to melt off for us .
2 . How would you improve the design and draw more power ?
Well just like batteries or solar panels you can stack more in parallel to draw more current , or more in series to get more voltage .
If manufacturers could make these in flexible strips we could wrap them around pipes like the engine exhaust and that could generate some serious power .
See the extras page for more info on this .
3 . How is a blowtorch green ?
It is n't , that is why we recommend using a wasted heat source that would otherwise be vented into the environment .
4 . Do you need a heat sink ?
Not always , but it will work better .
They wo n't generate the full power if you do n't heat sink the other side .
5 . Are you really planning to make a store out of the laser cutter ?
Yes we are , we were planning to launch www.splitreaction.com on July 20th as a blog , but since our main idea fit this Instructables contest we decided to jump start and rush to finish it to make the deadline .
6 . Why does your current boost circuit not work for iPods ?
We built that boost circuit for a super cap powered LED flashlight .
Its only designed for 100 mA .
It will allow a charged super cap to output 5V steadily from 5V to 1.8V input .
Since I -pods and phones need more current our current boost circuit wont charge them .
We do plan to improve it .
7 . When will you be providing the circuit board design ?
Hopefully by July 20th our full blog will be up and we will have perfected a boost circuit .
8. Will a Minty boost work with the thermoelectric element ?
Maybe .
We do n't own one .
Perhaps we can collaborate .
9. OMG these seebecks are expensive .
Yes they are , but over time they compensate for the initial cost of the purchase .
Not to mention , the prices should drop dramatically when large manufacturers see the benefit and start creating them in larger quantities .
10 .
Why do you use a regulator ?
The voltage is very unstable and varies with changes in the temperature , without regulation the element could go way beyond what you want and possibly damage your device .
11 . Can it charge a super cap ?
Yes it can , and with a efficient boost regulator it could power almost anything you could think of .
12 . Are you going to sell kits ?
Maybe if enough people request it we can order parts in bulk and kit it out .
13 . Will the $ 15 350W Peltier from Ebay work ?
It seems bigger than the 6W you use .
Well it will ... kinda ... but not as well as a seebeck one would .
They use different metals to make them .
Also the 350W number is how much energy it consumes to cool , not how much power it can generate .
14 . I do n't know how to solder or do any of this , but I still want to try it out .
Where should I start ?
It 's not the easiest thing to do , but start off by browsing Instructables .
They have plenty of How - tos that will build you up to the expertise you need to try this one .
Cristina Fender , 34 , of Austin , Texas , is an aspiring writer , blogger , and mother of two who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2006 .
Each and every day Cristina struggles to manage her condition while taking care of her family .
Though Cristina 's approach to treating bipolar disorder is n't for everyone , her story vividly demonstrates how elusive stability can be for people with bipolar .
( CRISTINA-FENDER ) I think the hardest job in the world is being a stay - at - home mom with bipolar disorder .
Im 34 and married , and I have two girls , ages 2 and 5 .
I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder on October 2 , 2006 , while pregnant with the second baby .
Im a compliant patient , although I still feel crippled by my disorder .
I duly take my medications — lithium , Geodon , Ambien , Xanax , and Prozac — as prescribed by my psychiatric nurse practitioner .
The various meds calm my mania , even out my moods , and ease my depression , and they allow me to sleep most nights .
I see a talk therapist , too .
Despite all this help , there are days when I cant get out of bed because
Im in a deep depression or didnt sleep at all the night before .
Sometimes
Im unable to do anything other than get my kids fed .
When
Im too depressed to function , I tell the girls that " mommys sick . "
At the other end of the spectrum , if Im in a manic phase , I frantically work on other projects around the house , and the TV is my babysitter .
It 's because of my children that I can get up in the morning and attempt to function at a somewhat normal level .
Getting out of bed when your Geodon causes sleepiness ( yet prevents mania and psychosis ) is a feat in itself .
I down two Frappuccinos just to get going .
After my 2 - year - old goes down for a nap at 11:30 , my anxiety creeps in .
Im restless , pacing , and I feel like Im going to explode from the inside out .
Anxiety makes my skin crawl and I almost claw at my skin to get it to stop .
I usually take a Xanax , which calms me down .
Next Page : After lunch [ pagebreak ] After lunch , I wander into my bedroom , light some incense , and pull out my stash of marijuana .
A few tokes and Im anxiety - free for about half an hour .
( My therapist agrees that it helps some people . )
I dont mention my marijuana use to the nurse practitioner because , frankly , we dont always see eye to eye on my treatment .
For example , right now I get the shakes ; she thinks its due to the lithium and I think its the Geodon .
But when you mess around with my medication — cutting down on one med or the other — you better be right .
The consequences can be devastating for me and my family .
And even if Im doing fairly well , I still experience episodes of “ auditory overload . ”
Everything gets louder and I cant cope .
These episodes usually occur when the kids are yelling and the TV is on .
Listening to my iPod helps ; it keeps me centered .

By four oclock I start drinking my three to four glasses of half wine and half mineral water for the night .

Sometimes I feel like screaming , but I dont want to scream in front of my family .
The Pakistani Taliban , a copy of the Afghan extremist movement , have long controlled the tribal area along the Afghan border , which is a sanctuary for militants , including al - Qaeda .
But it is their march into the heart of the country that has horrified ordinary Pakistanis , and the wider world .
And the threat comes not just from the Taliban to the west .
Islamic extremists , who are not part of the Taliban , are already entrenched in Islamabad and across the Punjab , the most populous province , seemingly ready to surface when their moment comes .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korea faces consequences if it goes ahead with a second nuclear test , but little can be done to stop it , the U.S. special envoy to the communist state said on Friday .
U.S. Special Representative for North Korean Policy Stephen Bosworth speaks to the media at a hotel in Beijing May 7 , 2009 .
The U.S. envoy for North Korea began a swing through Asia on Thursday to seek support from regional powers to rein in North Korea , which may be preparing to rattle security with a second nuclear test .
REUTERS / Grace Liang
Stephen Bosworth said after meeting officials in Seoul that the United States was leaving the door open for dialogue , despite the fact that Pyongyang said it was useless to talk to the Obama administration because its “ hostile policy ” left it no choice but to bolster its nuclear deterrent .
“ If the North Koreans decide to carry out a second nuclear test , we will deal with the consequences of that .
And there will be consequences , ” Bosworth told reporters after meeting South Korea ’s foreign minister .
“ But we ca n’t control at this stage what North Korea does . ”
A South Korean official familiar with the North said there was increased activity at North Korea ’s known nuclear test site , suggesting Pyongyang was gearing up for a new test .
Experts said it could take a few weeks for the North , which conducted its first nuclear test in October 2006 , to prepare for another one .
Politically , North Korea wants to play out its test preparations , many of which can be seen by U.S. spy satellites , as long as possible to increase its leverage in nuclear negotiations , which means it may not come for months , if at all .
Bosworth began a swing through Asia that started in Beijing on Thursday to discuss how to rein in the reclusive North after it raised regional security concerns by threatening last week to test a nuclear device .
North Korea , angered by Washington ’s push to punish it at the United Nations for a launching a long - range rocket , unleashed its harshest criticism of U.S. President Barack Obama ’s government , saying it is trying to topple Pyongyang ’s leaders .
“ The study of the policy pursued by the Obama administration for the past 100 days since its emergence made it clear that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK ( North Korea ) remains unchanged , ” the official KCNA news agency quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying .
“ There is nothing to be gained by sitting down together with a party that continues to view us with hostility . ”
He added : “ The DPRK will bolster its nuclear deterrent as it has already clarified . ”
Last month , North Korea said it was quitting the six - way talks and would restart a plant that separates plutonium from spent nuclear fuel rods in response to being punished by the United Nations for the April 5 launch of a long - range rocket .
The six - way talks began in 2003 and involve the two Koreas , the United States , Japan , Russia and China .
North Korea insists it sent a satellite into orbit and had the right to do so as a part of a peaceful space program .
U.S. and South Korean officials said nothing was put into orbit and the launch was a disguised test of a long - range missile that violated U.N. resolutions .
Destitute North Korea , which conducted its only nuclear test in October 2006 , later said it had resumed producing arms - grade plutonium at its Soviet - era Yongbyon nuclear plant .
It then threatened a fresh nuclear test and ballistic missile test launch unless the U.N. Security Council apologized for chastising the state and tightening existing sanctions that limit its overseas arm trade , a key source of hard currency .
Bosworth will go to Tokyo next week .
State Department envoy Sung Kim will travel to Moscow , Bosworth said .

“ Harper ’s Island ” — good idea , spotty execution
** WARNING : FIRST EPISODE “ HARPER ’S ISLAND ” SPOILERS AHEAD **
There are / were a few reasons to be optimistic about CBS ’s 13 - part miniseries : 1 ) the premise — 13 episodes with one character dying each week until the murderer is revealed , 2 ) it has a good look and feel to it , and 3 ) it has an end date .
As I was watching the premiere , I was amazed by the utter lack of familiar faces .
Anytime Harry Hamlin is the most famous actor on a series , it ca n’t be a good sign .
( No offense , Harry .
I do like your work , but you ’re just not the carry - a - series type anymore .
By the way , see Will Harris ’ interview with Hamlin here . )
I watch a lot of TV , and other than Hamlin , I only recognized three faces — Chris Gauthier ( Vincent from “ Eureka ” ) , Richard Burgi ( Karl from “ Desperate Housewives ” ) and Jim Beaver ( Uncle Bobby from “ Supernatural ” ) — and I think it ’s safe to say that each of these actors play supporting characters on those other series .
This lack of “ name ” talent tells me one of two things : 1 ) they could n’t cast the actors they wanted , or 2 ) they purposefully went with relatively unknown talent to keep everyone guessing .
( One of the best ways to solve a television mystery is to see if there are any recognizable guest stars in the cast .
If so , there ’s a good chance that you ’ve found your killer .
For that reason , Hamlin ’s casting and subsequent murder did surprise . )
One of the other problems with the premiere is that it really did n’t grab me .
CBS put together a solid promo campaign for the series , but the first episode just did n’t live up to the hype .
For one , the characters really did n’t make much of an impact .
Even after watching each actress in a few scenes , I ’m still not sure if I could pick the bride or the bride ’s sister out of a lineup .
Secondly , save for maybe Abby Mills ( the groom ’s best friend whose mother died in murders years ago ) , there really is n’t anyone to root for .
I realize that they need to keep things close to the vest , but would it hurt to have two or three protagonists to cheer for ?
I ’m pretty sure that I ’m going to save myself 12 hours and just check the “ Harper ’s Island ” wiki page in a few months and see what happened .
There is just too much good television on right now ( and my Netflix queue is getting pretty backed up ) .
Besides , other than the occasional comedy and “ The Unit , ” it seems anytime I start watching a CBS series , it just does n’t end well .
The former employee of 3D Realms Mark Skelton aka Marks not only has posted the Duke Nukem Forever high - res 3D renders , but he also has revealed some details of the development situation .
Whilst technically ‘ in development ’ for well over a decade , it would appear from his words that it has only been in the past two or three years that any real progress been made .
Ten year and they only got that done , that is simply amazing to me , but it is hard when the game is constantly in development then not in development .
The leaked material lets to assume that the guys would have finished the game in a year or so , but obviously the recent efforts were not enough to save ‘ the sinking ship ’ .
Let ’s wait for the Take - Two statement which is coming soon , this Thursday to be exact .

How a little old lady spent 23 years single - handedly dismantling her cottage brick by brick and rebuilding it 100 miles away
For a labour of love , it was the DIY job of the century .
Brick by brick , the gutsy little old lady demolished her precious home , pulling each medieval nail from its ancient oak beam .
Dressed in a workman 's apron , her greying hair tucked beneath a headscarf , she single - handedly piled high the thousands of hand - made Hertfordshire peg tiles from the roof .
Huge timbers were loaded onto a lorry , alongside Tudor fireplaces and Elizabethan diamond leaded glass , for a rebuild that would consume the rest of her life .
Back in business : Ware Hall House , now in Norfork , is a B &B run by May 's niece , Christine Adams
Shell of a house :
May started to demolish her home timber by timber
For May Savidge was determined to beat developers and planners who threatened to crush her historic cottage under a road - building project .
Long before conservation became fashionable , she decided to move her home lock , stock and barrel from busy Ware High Street in Hertfordshire to a Norfolk backwater 100 miles away .
And move it she did , in a 23 - year labour of love , during which she battled the authorities , deathwatch beetles , rats and her failing health , accompanied only by her faithful dog , Sasha .
Now , her incredible story has been told for the first time by her niece , Christine Adams , in a book which is a heartbreaking tale of love lost , stoical determination and a poignant secret .
So who was May Alice Savidge and why did she move 15th - century Ware Hall House from one county to the next ?
Born in Streatham , South London , in 1911 , May was just ten when her father died of heart failure , plunging the family into poverty .
She had to go out to work , becoming a draughts - woman for the Ministry of Aircraft Production team .
Broken - hearted :
When her fiance died , May bought Ware Hall House in 1947 to restore
At 16 , May met an older man , Denis Watson , a gifted Shakespearean actor .
They planned to marry , but he died prematurely in 1938 .
May never recovered from this cruel blow and wore his signet ring on her wedding ring finger for the rest of her life .
She retreated into herself and it was in 1947 that she bought a house to restore .
Number 1 Monkey Row , Ware , Hertfordshire , had been built around 1450 for a wealthy monk as a ' hall house ' , a medieval arrangement in which the living space is attached to an open hall overlooked by a minstrel 's gallery .
A self - taught home improvement enthusiast , May exposed the heavy oak beams that bore the marks of medieval carpenters and lifted crumbling lino to reveal wide , hand - cut floorboards .
She employed a builder to repair the roof , but all the rest of the work - including brick - laying , carpentry , re-glazing and stripping plaster from the ceilings and 20 layers of paper from the walls - she did with her own hands .
Then , in 1953 , the council told her the house was to be demolished to make way for a road - an act of vandalism unthinkable today , now that ancient properties are listed and protected .
Battle began .
May dug her heels in and resolved to save the building .
For 15 years , she fought the council 's plans , writing to them :
' If this little house is really in the way , I would rather move it and re-erect it than see it destroyed . '
Long haul :
May carried the timbers herself to the lorries that would move her house
In 1969 , when she was 58 , the bulldozers reached her gate .
Her response was to number each beam and pane of glass so that her home could be reassembled like a giant jigsaw puzzle .
Dismantling the heavy oak timber frame , held together with tapered wooden pegs , was both difficult and dangerous .
A team of local demolition contractors helped May .
She traced over a sample of brickwork using greaseproof paper and crayons so that she would know which bond to use and how thick to lay the mortar .
She continued to live in the house as it was taken down , sleeping beneath the stars in the freezing cold .
Jigsaw puzzle : Each beam is numbered according to May 's floor plans
' I just wo n't have such a marvellous old house bulldozed into the ground , ' she said .
' I 've got nothing to do all day , so I might as well do the job myself . '
Strangers sent money to help her - and many became life - long friends .
' Yours is the spirit that once made Britain great , ' wrote one .
She found a site in the seaside town of Wells - next - the - Sea in Norfolk , and obtained planning permission and laid foundations .
A lorry made the round trip to Norfolk 11 times to carry every part of the house .
So began a life of hardship .
She had no electricity and worked by the light of Victorian paraffin lamps .
She used an alarm clock to set herself targets each day , noting how many nails she extracted from oak beams per hour , as she dismantled the house and prepared for rebuilding .
A caravan was her home while she began the new work .
It was often unbearably cold , but , as she told the Fakenham Ladies Circle Club in 1971 : ' My mother brought us up on the maxim that there is no such word as " can't " . '
Two years later , the framework was fixed to the foundations by a local carpenter and May started to infill the brickwork .
She had no experience of brickwork , but was determined to lay every single brick perfectly .
It would be another eight years before the roof tiles were put in place and the property made watertight .
By the time she was into her 70s , however , May had moved in and the house stood proudly in its new gardens , each old oak beam in place , the brickwork nearly complete and many of the walls plastered .
Despite her age , she continued to build , climbing scaffolding to reach the top windows .
In 1986 , the Queen recognised her pluck , inviting her to a Buckingham Palace garden party .
On the tiles : May , with her dog Sasha , painstakingly inspects the tons of roof tiles
By now , however , she was running out of steam .
In 1992 , she finally installed a small wood - burning stove to heat the house , but was having difficulty climbing ladders and found cement work ' a bit heavy ' .
On her death in 1993 , just before reaching the age of 82 , the house was still not finished .
' The walls were up and the roof was on , but the place was little more than a shaky shell , ' says Adams , who was left the house in her aunt 's will .
A collector extraordinaire , May had filled her home until it looked like an overstocked curiosity shop .
In the garden , nine sidesaddles languished , relics of a bygone age .
Boxes of unworn wartime nurses ' bonnets and May 's service medals lay at the bottom of heavy trunks , stacked to ceiling height .
She kept packets of old - fashioned soap powder , Omo , Oxydol and the like , alongside bottles of J Collis Browne 's Mixture , the Victorian cure - all .
There were thousands of train , bus and trolley bus tickets , and even the notes left by the milkman .
In 440 diaries , she listed every action she carried out each day , revealing a Britain now lost : a world of shillings and ounces , telegrams and typewriters .
Among this archive , Adams uncovered May 's tragic secret .
After her fiance 's death , she had entered into another secret liaison - a 17 - year courtship with a man she believed would marry her .
In a devastating letter , dated 1960 , he reveals to her that he has simultaneously found God and fallen in love with his cousin , writing : ' I have , thanks to God , seen my dear cousin Iris in a new and wonderful light .
' I know this will hurt you as I know only too well how you feel towards me .
I pray to the Lord that you , too , may experience this most wonderful love .
' I should like nothing better than for you to regard us as a new sister and brother .
I would like to bring Iris to see you when you feel like it , I know you , too , will love her - everybody does ! '
Clearly cut to the quick , May wrote back :
' It surprises me that anyone so dear and lovable as your Cousin Iris should have thought it right to come between us , after 17 years .
My heart is not made of stone .
You often spoke of our marriage .
Is it surprising that I thought you really cared ?
I hope you will be more faithful to Iris than you have been to me .
Goodbye . '
Next to these letters was a photo of her fiancée playing Hamlet .
Adams says : ' Auntie May had wrapped her broken heart in a parcel , tied it with string and hidden it at the back of the attic .
Looking through those letters , I could see that she had not become a loner through choice . '
In tribute to her stoical aunt , Adams took on the project of finishing the house , and in the end it was May 's hoarding instincts which breathed new life Ware Hall House .
Adams sold May 's memorabilia , raising funds to renovate the house , which she now runs as a bed and breakfast .
Through her extraordinary habits , May effectively financed the final building work from beyond the grave .
After everything and against all the odds , she had won - she had moved her house across Britain and defied the developers .

The merger still needs approval from a number of governments , but it could change hardware and OEM markets - and just about every technology that uses them .
Last week , we released the source code to django - openid - auth .
This is a small library that can add OpenID based authentication to Django applications .
It has been used for a number of internal Canonical projects , including the sprint scheduler Scott wrote for the last Ubuntu Developer Summit , so it is possible you ’ve already used the code .
Rather than trying to cover all possible use cases of OpenID , it focuses on providing OpenID Relying Party support to applications using Django ’s django.contrib.auth authentication system .
As such , it is usually enough to edit just two files in an existing application to enable OpenID login .
The library has a number of useful features :
As well as the standard method of prompting the user for an identity URL , you can configure a fixed OpenID server URL .
This is useful for deployments where OpenID is being used for single sign on , and you always want users to log in using a particular OpenID provider .
Rather than asking the user for their identity URL , they are sent directly to the provider .
It can be configured to automatically create accounts when new identity URLs are seen .
User names , full names and email addresses can be set on accounts based on data sent via the OpenID Simple Registration extension .
Support for Launchpad ‘s Teams OpenID extension , which lets you query membership of Launchpad teams when authenticating against Launchpad ’s OpenID provider .
Team memberships are mapped to Django group membership .
While the code can be used for generic OpenID login , we ’ve mostly been using it for single sign on .
The hope is that it will help members of the Ubuntu and Launchpad communities reuse our authentication system in a secure fashion .
The source code can be downloaded using the following Bazaar command :
bzr branch lp:django-openid-auth
In this recipe , you ferment cucumbers to make dill pickles .
This means youll be setting up special conditions that allow " good " bacteria to grow on your cucumbers .
These bacteria do not spoil your cucumbers .
Instead , they digest the cucumbers sugars and produce lactic acid , changing the vegetables flavor and texture and turning your cucumbers into pickles in about three weeks .
The lactic acid also helps to preserve the pickles .
Recipe Conversions What Do I Need ? .  10 pounds pickling cucumbers , 3 1/2 to 5 inches in length CAUTION
Follow recipe exactly .
Careful setting up and monitoring of conditions ingredient quantities , temperature , time , and cleanliness are essential to the success and safety of fermented pickles .
 1/4 cup whole mixed pickling spices  2 bunches of fresh dill  1 cup white vinegar  3 / 4 cup coarse pickling salt  1 gallon of water  10 fresh garlic cloves , peeled  a soft vegetable brush  a 5 - gallon plastic bucket or crock  a glass or ceramic plate  a zipper freezer bag ( unused )  a clean towel  a cheesecloth  a large , deep , stainless - steel , nonreactive pot  6 to 8 1 - quart glass jars ( clean )  canning equipment  a narrow plastic spatula Questions about ingredients or supplies ?
Read the pickling tips .
What Do I Do ?
NOTE : Please read the pickling tips and general canning instructions before starting this recipe .
1 . Using a soft vegetable brush , thoroughly scrub the cucumbers in cool running water .
Cut 1/16 inch off the blossom end .
Discard any cucumbers that are bruised or damaged .
2 . Put half the pickling spices and 1 bunch of dill in the bottom of the plastic bucket or crock .
Add the cucumbers .
3 . Mix the vinegar , pickling salt , and water , dissolving the salt completely .
Pour over the top of the pickles .
Add in the garlic , the remaining spices , and the dill .
4 . You must use a weight to fully submerge your pickles in the brineor risk spoilage during fermentation .
To do this , first cover the pickles with a glass or ceramic plate ( no metal , please ) that s a bit smaller than the opening of the crock .
Then fill a zipper freezer bag with more brine ( make the brine with original recipe proportions of salt , vinegar , and water ) , make sure its tightly shut , and place it on the plate .
5 . Cover the crock with a clean towel and store at cool room temperature ( 70° F  75° F is ideal ) .
6 . Check the crock every day , and skim off the film that forms on the top ( this usually starts after a day or two ) .
Make sure the pickles are covered completely with brine .
If necessary , make a little more brine following the original recipe proportions .
CAUTION
The scum on the brine surface is yeast growth .
If you dont remove it , your pickles will spoil .
7 . Let the cucumbers ferment until evenly colored ( olive green ) or evenly translucent throughout .
This should take about 2 1/2 to 3 weeks .
At this point , you can safely eat the pickles .
If your pickles are not yet well - flavored with dill , you can leave them in the crock longer but the total time in the crock should not exceed 3 weeks .
CAUTION
Dont taste your pickles until they are evenly colored or evenly translucent throughout .
8. Strain off the brine from the crock through the cheesecloth to remove impurities .
Place the strained brine in a large nonreactive pot .
Tip
During fermentation , there may be a few white spots on your pickles .
Dont worry ; theyll go away when you process them .
9 . Prepare your jars and lids .
Pack the pickles in the clean , hot jars , filling to within 3/4 inch of the top of the jar rims .
Add a few sprigs of dill for garnish .
10 .
Bring the brine to a boil and pour it over the pickles , covering them completely and filling to within 1/2 inch of the top of the jars .
To remove air bubbles , gently run the plastic spatula ( do n't use a metal one ) around the jar , keeping the utensil between the pickles and the jar 's inner surface .
If necessary , add more liquid to readjust headspace .
Wipe any residue off the jar rims with a clean , damp towel .
Apply lids and screwbands evenly and firmly until resistance is metfingertip tight .
11 . Process jars for 15 minutes in a boiling - water canner .
12 .
Let the pickles sit for at least 1 week before eating , so the flavors can mellow .

Advertisement Timothy Peake , a 37 - year - old test pilot in the Army Air Corps , has been accepted into the European Space Agency 's ( Esa ) Astronaut Corps .
The spaceman , who hails from Chichester , was unveiled at a ceremony in Paris , along with five other new colleagues from across Europe .
The other recruits to emerge from Esa 's latest trawl for new candidates include a woman astronaut .
There are two Italians , a Frenchman , a German , and a Dane .
But it is the UK citizen who is sure to command a lion 's share of the headlines .
Successive British governments have considered human spaceflight an expensive distraction , preferring to fund robotic exploration instead .
This policy has made it extremely difficult for British - born individuals to get into orbit .
" I hope it will now encourage the British government to contribute , " said Jean - Jacques Dordain , director - general of Esa .
" With such a good guy [ in Timothy Peake ] , how can they not contribute ? "
Major Peake currently lives in Salisbury , Wiltshire .
He is a helicopter test pilot and has a degree in flight dynamics .
He has been in the armed forces for 18 years .
He flies primarily Apache helicopters and has over 3,000 hours to his credit .
New recruits
The 37 - year - old Briton thanked his friends and family for their support during the selection process .
He said : " It has been quite a difficult year and the waiting has been quite difficult during the past few weeks .

" If it was n't for the British Army , I would n't be in this position , so I 'm very grateful for the training and support I 've received from them also . "
The first Briton in space was Sheffield - born chemist Helen Sharman .
She had to secure private funding to fly to the Mir space station on a Russian Soyuz craft in 1991 .
Four British - born astronauts have flown into space under an American flag : Michael Foale , Piers Sellers , Nicholas Patrick and Greg Johnson .
From 8,000 to six : Esa announced its new astronauts in Paris
The most recent non-governmental British - born astronaut was Richard Garriott .
The wealthy games developer paid for his trip , again through the Russians .
But the European Space agency says its new astronauts were judged solely on their ability to do the job , not on national government policy .
Timothy Peake and his new colleagues will now train to fly to the space station and with renewed interest in the Moon , they could conceivably also get to walk on the lunar surface one day .
He reflected on how he might feel , sitting on a launch pad atop a rocket waiting to blast into space .

Meet Europe 's new astronauts
It 's ground control to Major Tim " I think it 's going to be the most incredible experience in the world , without a shadow of a doubt .
The adrenalin will be thoroughly flowing at that stage , " he told BBC News .
The other new recruits comprise Frenchman Thomas Pesquet , Italians Samantha Cristoforetti and Luca Parmitano , Germany 's Alexander Gerst , Denmark 's Andreas Mogensen .
" One day hopefully I will have the opportunity to walk on the Moon .
That 's the biggest dream I have at the moment , " said Mogensen , who has been working in the UK at the Surrey Space Centre .
The astronauts will begin their basic education in September for a period of 18 months .
They will then get assigned to a mission for more specific training .
But it will be a minimum of 3.5 years before they can get into orbit .
Pressed about the selection of a Briton as one of the astronauts when the UK chose not to fund manned spaceflight , Mr Dordain said : " I have taken the decision after consultation and there was unanimity about the ranking of the candidates . "
Mr Dordain named British - born officials who had taken prominent roles in the running of Esa 's human spaceflight programme , adding : " You can contribute with something other than money ... you can contribute with expertise . "
Nick Spall , co-ordinator of the UK human spaceflight campaign at the British Interplanetary Society , told BBC News : " The UK astronaut campaign is delighted that a British candidate has been chosen by Esa to join the growing cadre of European astronauts .
" Despite its rich heritage of aerospace experience , for many years the UK has been absent from government - organised human spaceflight activity .
" As a result , the nation has missed out on the science , industrial , exploration and inspirational benefits that this international endeavour has provided for the rest of the developed world " Jonathan .

At least 25,000 civilians have fled a Tamil Tiger - held area in northern Sri Lanka , the military says .
People escaped after troops broke through a fortification which had been blocking their advance into the Tigers ' last stronghold , the army said .
Aerial video showed thousands of people filing out of the combat zone .
Tens of thousands remain in the area , which has seen heavy fighting for months .
The government says the rebels must now surrender or face a final assault .
See map of the region
There was no immediate response from the rebels , who have rejected previous calls to surrender .
The pro-rebel TamilNet website said several hundred civilians were feared killed and injured after troops advanced into the zone .
Each side accuses the other of killing civilians in the long running civil conflict .
Foreign reporters are not allowed into the combat zone , making it impossible to independently verify the claims .
A doctor speaking to the BBC from the conflict zone said that one hospital had been hit by shelling and gunfire early on Monday .
Dr T Satyamurthy , director of health services in Kilinochchi , said there were several hundred injured and dozens of dead there and at another , nearby hospital .
He also said his staff had told him that they had seen " many dead bodies " by the edge of a road in the area .
' Haunting sight '
The BBC's Charles Haviland in Colombo has seen the video , shot by an unmanned military vehicle , of civilians fleeing the combat zone .
The film was apparently taken early on Monday morning .

The government and the military are feeling increasingly bullish .
They felt able to call in a large number of journalists and show aerial footage shot from an unmanned plane .
The pictures are remarkable .
Hundreds or thousands of people , small specks in the camera frame , are seen hurrying in a direction away from the sea , across land , lagoon and swamp .
Other pictures show what looks like tens of thousands milling around , waiting to be processed at army checkpoints .
Tamil protests in London Civilians tell of war ordeal Confirming estimates of at least 25,000 people fleeing , our correspondent described as " haunting " the sight of thousands of people filing as quickly as they could away from the ocean side of the strip of land where fighting has been going on .
A far greater number were visible milling around outside the zone waiting to be taken to government - run camps , our correspondent says .
Some estimates say as many as 35,000 people fled the fighting on Monday .
President Mahinda Rajapakse said : " The footage clearly shows that the people are defying the LTTE [ Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ] and escaping .
They are running to safety .
" The only thing [ LTTE leader Velupillai ] Prabhakaran can now do is to surrender . "
Earlier in the day , military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said the army had managed to smash through an earth fortification which had been blocking its advance into the tiny coastal strip held by the rebels .
He said those who had just escaped would go , like others , to special camps around the town of Vavuniya about 100 km ( 60 miles ) from the fighting .
' Worn - out doctors '
The Tigers are restricted to a 20 sq km ( 12.4 sq miles ) coastal patch that the government has designated a " safe zone " for civilians .
Gordon Weis , the UN spokesman in Sri Lanka , said it was not known how many civilians remained there but that the UN had been working off a figure of some 150,000 to 200,000 people in recent months .
Hospitals in the war zone are lacking staff and medical supplies " It 's still a significant number of people locked inside , " he told the BBC .
Our correspondent says life for the Tamil civilians in the zone is a nightmare .
There has been shelling for months , while the UN says the Tigers are preventing people from escaping , despite rebel denials .
A military spokesman said 17 people were killed on Monday when the rebels launched three suicide attacks on those fleeing , though it was not possible to verify his account .
The government is not giving the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) access to the landward side of the zone .
So it can only evacuate people by sea , with two or three ships per week each carrying 400 or 500 of the sickest , oldest and most badly wounded people .
ICRC country chief Paul Castella told the BBC that government doctors working in the area were " really worn out " .
" These people are working for months now without any break , they work day and night .
And medical supplies are lacking , " he added .
The Red Cross has evacuated more than 10,000 civilians since early February , but Mr Castella could not confirm or deny figures that others are citing for the number of people recently killed , or managing to escape by land .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The U.S. policy shift toward Cuba makes no mention of the " harshest of measures " -- the economic blockade -- former Cuban leader Fidel Castro says .
The changes in Cuban policy was unveiled before President Obama 's trip to the Summit of the Americas .
U.S. President Barack Obama " has announced the relief of some hateful restrictions , " Castro said in a statement carried by the official Cuban News Agency on Monday night .
" But not a word was said about the harshest of measures : the blockade .
This is the way a truly genocidal measure is piously called , one whose damage cannot be calculated only on the basis of its economic effects , for it constantly takes human lives and brings painful suffering to our people . "
Earlier Obama lifted all restrictions on the ability of individuals to visit relatives in Cuba , as well as to send them remittances .
The move represents a significant shift in a U.S. policy that had remained largely unchanged for nearly half a century .
But several key components of America 's embargo on the island nation will be preserved .
Travel restrictions for Americans of non-Cuban descent will also remain in place .
The U.S. government instituted the embargo three years after Castro took office in 1959 .
Watch report on easing of travel restrictions »
Castro , in his message , said Obama can use his " talents " in creating a constructive policy that would end the embargo that " has failed for almost half a century . "
" On the other hand , our country , which has resisted and is willing to resist whatever it takes , neither blames Obama for the atrocities of other U.S. administrations nor doubts his sincerity and his wishes to change the United States policy and image , " Castro said .
" We understand that he waged a very difficult battle to be elected , despite centuries - old prejudices . "
Obama thinks the change in U.S. policy will ultimately help bring about a more tolerant , democratic Cuban government , said White House Latin American policy adviser Dan Restrepo .
The president thinks " that creating independence , creating space for the Cuban people to operate freely from the regime is the kind of space they need to start the process toward a more democratic Cuba , " Restrepo said .
But critics of the change blasted the administration for unilaterally changing what had been a long - settled U.S. policy .
Watch report on whether Cuba is ready for U.S. tourists »
The Castro " dictatorship is one of the most brutal in the world .
The U.S. economic embargo must remain in place until tyranny gives way to freedom and democracy , " Rep. Connie Mack , R - Florida , said in a written statement .
Obama " should not make any unilateral change in America 's policy toward Cuba .
Instead , Congress should vigorously debate these and other ideas before any substantive policy changes are implemented . "
The president 's gesture precedes a trip this week to Trinidad and Tobago for a key meeting of hemispheric powers -- the Summit of the Americas .
Castro said Cuba had " resisted and it will continue to resist . "
" It will never beg for alms .
It will go on forward holding its head up high and cooperating with the fraternal peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean ; with or without Summits of the Americas ; whether or not the president of the United States is Obama , a man or a woman , a black or a white citizen . "

Handling long running queries on SQL Server can be one of the hardest things to deal with as a DBA .
You have dozens of variables that must be considered before you can actually do anything about them .
Usually if you ask a number of DBAs how they go about determining if the long runtimes can be resolved , you will get several different variations of troubleshooting .
Even if the steps are blurred in sequential order , they will typical contain a few of the following
Execution Plan analysis
Indexing options
Disk alterations
Data storage alterations
Latency troubleshooting
Application issues
resource issues ( Memory etc … )
and the list goes on for awhile .
Sometimes you come to a quick resolution and sometimes the resolution is a large scale restructure that just cannot be completed given resources and time .
Good examples of this are queries that do massive amounts of reads on historical tables .
This is commonly pushed into your typical data warehouse solution but in some cases and some ERP solutions , the applications will allow the users to select reporting criteria that is less than favorable .
The option that you can use in this case is the query governor .
Before I go into this configuration I ’d like to warn you about it .
The query governor uses the estimated execution plan .
This is critical to you and setting this option because if statistics are bad or you have a cached plan that is n’t favorable , you are going to get bad results from the governor and it determining if the query realistically will take greater than the set value .
I would recommend in the last resort cry for help you make by setting this option , you update all statistics , remove fragmentation and then clear the cache on the instance .
Now retest the reason you were even looking at this option and see if it is still required .
Of course after you re-cache the plan ð Ÿ˜ ‰
If it comes to the query governor being configured then there is another concern you have to be aware of .
It will not catch your dumb mistakes !
I mean that literally .
I ’ll show you want I mean in configuring the governor .
The governor has two options on the context in which you can configure it .
Either you can set the server wide governor or per transaction .
I wo n’t go into this much sense we have the awesome documentation over in BOL .
You can find that here query governor cost limit Option
Important things to point out are the fact the value you attempt to set the governor to is truncated to int .
So that means you do n’t get Mr. Run less than 9.43214365 seconds .
Also be aware of the security restrictions for configuring this .
So let ’s do it .
First open a new query window and execute
sp_configure ' show advanced options ' , 1 ; GO RECONFIGURE ; GO sp_configure ' query governor cost limit '
,1 ; GO RECONFIGURE ; GO
Now attempt to query a large table or even a poorly indexed table that you know iwll take larger than a second to return .
You should be shown the following
Msg 8649 , Level 17 , State 1 , Line 1
The query has been canceled because the estimated cost of this query ( 494 ) exceeds the configured threshold of 1 .
Contact the system administrator .
In another blog I ’ll go into playing with these error messages returned to make them user friendly .
So you ’ve successfully kept your database server from having the life sucked out of it from one bad query .
Or have you ?
Run this now while you still have the configuration at 1
While 1=1 Begin Select ' Oh boy ...'
End
Alright , this was a given what was going to happen .
It ’s an infinite loop so it ’s going to run forever .
Given a really bad loop you will proceed down the path of sucking the same life out of the server the earlier query may have .
This is a misconception of the query governor though .
The reason for that is of course the execution plan .
If you throw the select on the large table in there , then the governor will pick it up due to the execution plan determining the internal select .
Now configure the governor back to 0 ( default and means forever ) .
What you can do now is try it in your session with the SET .
SET QUERY_GOVERNOR_COST_LIMIT
1 SELECT * FROM BIGARCETABLE SET QUERY_GOVERNOR_COST_LIMIT
0
Makes you feel dirty even thinking you would want to do that does n’t it .
It is a good warning though if you are possibly missing a DBA position in the company or are running time statistics on how long a query is averaging over time based on performance deterioration from transactions going on in the background .
Fragmentation levels can quickly cause a query to go from milliseconds to seconds and that can cause a severe problem with some business tasks .
Saying that I do want to say I ’ve only used this option in those few situations .
Setting this server wide is tricky and if you do attempt to make sure you are maintaining your objects very well before you do .
Do n’t get this confused with the enterprise feature in SQL Server 2008 called the resource governor either .
The resource governor can stop / limit long running queries and limit resources allocated to them along with several other configurations and monitoring features .
It is completely different to the query governor though and much more of a feature than a configuration .

Length : 6.6 meters ( 22 feet ) from bow to stern
6.6 meters ( 22 feet ) from bow to stern Width : 1 meter ( 3 feet ) at the widest point midship
1 meter ( 3 feet ) at the widest point midship Scale : 1/40
1/40 Time to complete : 6 years , 4 months
6 years , 4 months Parts : 200,000 LEGO elements
200,000 LEGO elements Weight : 150 kilograms ( 330 pounds )
Jumpei ’s LEGO version is based on the way Yamato appeared immediately prior to the fateful Operation Ten - Go in 1945 .
Jumpei built LEGO Yamato to answer the question he posed to himself all the way back in elementary school : “ How big would Yamato be from a LEGO minifig ’s perspective ? ”
A third - year college student today , Jumpei can now demonstrate exactly what that would look like !
Breaking through the language barrier , Jumpei pioneered the use of Bricklink among Japanese LEGO fans to source the two hundred thousand LEGO elements necessary to build Yamato .
Yamato includes wonderful details like the Imperial chrysanthemum emblem on the bow and a brick - built Japanese navy flag flying from the bridge .
The superstructure is especially impressive :

Not to be confused with the fictional Space battleship Yamato , the real Japanese battleship Yamato was launched in 1941 , and remains the largest battleship ever constructed by any navy .
Having fired her guns against Allied forces only once during the Pacific War , Yamato was sunk in 1945 , taking nearly 2,500 of her 2,700 crew to their deaths .
Six years in the making , Jumpei Mitsui ’s LEGO battleship Yamato is major news in the LEGO fan community .
The Brothers Brick will get in touch with Jumpei and try to arrange an interview for our English - speaking readers .
In the meantime , we hope you enjoy the pictures .

Advertisement US music producer Phil Spector has been convicted of murdering actress Lana Clarkson , after a five - month retrial .
The 68 - year - old , famous for the " Wall of Sound " recording technique , faces between 18 years and life in prison .
He had pleaded not guilty to the second degree murder of 40 - year - old Ms Clarkson , who was shot in the mouth at Spector 's home in Los Angeles .
Spector was remanded in custody until sentencing on 29 May .
His lawyer has said he intends to appeal .

" I do n't think justice was done today , " said lawyer Doron Weinberg .
Spector had looked frail as he entered the Los Angeles Superior Court , dressed in a black suit with a bright red tie .
The jury took some 30 hours of deliberation to reach their unanimous guilty verdict .
As the verdict was read out , Spector remained quiet and his wife Rachelle sobbed .
' Legal errors '
The jury had the option of returning a verdict of involuntary manslaughter , but chose not do so .
An earlier trial was abandoned in 2007 after a jury failed to reach a unanimous decision .
In pictures : Phil Spector Second degree murder falls between first degree murder , which requires proof of pre-meditation , and manslaughter .
Speaking after the verdict , Mr Weinberg congratulated the jury on " trying to do the best honest job they could " with " complete integrity and complete honesty " .
But he said the jurors had been flooded with " improper and prejudicial evidence " which made it impossible for them to reach a fair conclusion .
He said he was " very , very certain " that Spector had not been proved guilty " under the proper legal standard " .
Mr Weinberg said " the nature of the legal errors " made in the trial were " so significant and so clear that there is every likelihood that this case will be set aside on appeal " .
One of the jurors , speaking at a news conference after the trial , said the jury had a " complete picture " from the evidence .
The unnamed woman said they had " gone through all the information and that 's what the conclusion was " .
Prolific career Phil Spector worked with some of the biggest names in the pop and rock business , including The Beatles and Ike and Tina Turner .
Spector had decided not to give evidence at his trial
He produced hits including You 've Lost That Lovin ' Feelin ' by the Righteous Brothers and the Ronettes ' Be My Baby .
But for all his musical genius , Spector had a dark side .
He was often described as being a bully in the studio , a man with a liking for guns and an eccentric personality .
During the five - month retrial , five female acquaintances testified that Spector had threatened them at gunpoint in incidents dating back to the 1970s .
Mr Weinberg had argued that the evidence from the women should not have been admitted .
The defence said Ms Clarkson 's death was a suicide and appealed to jurors not to judge the star on his eccentric appearance .
Spector himself opted not to give evidence .
Stun gun Actress Clarkson , 40 , had been working as a hostess at the House of Blues venue in Los Angeles , and went home with Spector on the night of her death .
Lana Clarkson appeared in cult 1980s film Barbarian Queen After appearing in cult 1980s films such as Barbarian Queen and Fast Times at Ridgemont High , her acting career had hit the rocks .
Spector had arrived at the club with waitress Kathy Sullivan , before setting his sights on Ms Clarkson .
Spector 's Brazilian chauffeur , Adriano De Souza , said his boss appeared to be intoxicated and that Ms Clarkson was initially reluctant to go home with the music producer .
She was found dead in the foyer of his house in the early hours of the morning .
A holster that matched the snub - nosed Colt Cobra revolver that Spector used to kill her was found in a drawer in the foyer .
Mr De Souza called the emergency services , saying : " I think my boss killed somebody " , after Spector emerged from his home with a gun .
He told jurors Spector had said : " I think I killed somebody . "
The defence argued he had misheard his employer .
The producer was taken into custody about 40 minutes after the shooting and had to be subdued by officers using a stun gun .

( CNN ) --
Your saliva is doing all kinds of useful things for you all the time -- for instance , helping you chew and taste food .
It 's also home to more than 600 species of bacteria , which are harmlessly enjoying the moisture of your mouth .
There 's a slew of bacteria floating around in your mouth , but it 's generally harmless .
Since people have different eating habits in different places , you might think an American 's saliva might look a lot different from , say , a South African's .
But a new study published in the journal Genome Research finds that bacteria in saliva may not be as related to environment and diet as you might think .
In fact , researchers found that the human salivary microbiome -- that is , the community of bacteria in saliva -- does not vary greatly between different geographic locations .
That means your saliva is just as different from your neighbor 's as someone 's on the other side of the planet .
" It was somewhat surprising to us , because in our sampling we did n't control for diet , or environment , or anything like that , " said Mark Stoneking of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , and co-author of the study .
Now , Stoneking and colleagues are trying to figure out why .
One theory is that since the researchers looked only at the genus of the bacteria in question , they might find more differences at the level of individual species .
They are investigating this in a follow - up study .
Stoneking became interested in surveying the bacteria of saliva when he learned that saliva contains more DNA than blood , if you include DNA of bacteria and other organisms .
Human blood , as you might guess , still contains more human DNA than saliva .
Watch CNN 's Elizabeth Landau talk more about saliva »
Researchers took saliva samples from a total of 120 healthy subjects .
The countries represented in this sample were Germany , Poland , Turkey , Georgia , China , Philippines , South Africa , Republic of the Congo , Argentina , Bolivia and the United States .
This was the first global survey of bacteria diversity in human saliva .
Health Library MayoClinic.com : Understand and protect against infection
The most common type of bacteria found in the survey of saliva was Streptococcus , Stoneking said .
People typically have Streptococcus in their mouths living benignly , although certain species are responsible for diseases such as strep throat , meningitis and bacterial pneumonia .
Why do you need hundreds of bacteria species in your mouth ?
It turns out they 're mostly not helping you at all -- you 're just giving them a warm , moist home .
" Having those bacteria -- that 's the price we have to pay for having a lot of saliva in the mouth to begin with , " said Nate Dominy , anthropologist at the University of California , Santa Cruz .
Dominy , who has studied enzymes in saliva , found the results surprising , and said no one had previously surveyed the variety of bacteria in saliva .
What else is inside saliva ?
One component of saliva that has been shown to vary according to diet is amylase , the only digestive enzyme that converts starch into sugar , Dominy said .
Amylase is also found in the pancreas and the small intestine .
The human body evolved to start the digestive process early , in the mouth , so we can maximize the amount of sugar that we take in , Dominy said .
" Given that we have such large brains , and our brains are metabolically very demanding tissues , they 're extremely costly and expensive to maintain , so we need a lot of sugar , " he said .
Americans in particular have a lot of amylase in their saliva because their diets are full of starch : chips , rice and baked potatoes .
But the Pygmies of central Africa , for example , eat mostly game animals , honey and fruit .
They have relatively little amylase in their saliva .
Dominy and colleagues found these differences at the genetic level , meaning natural selection has favored large quantities of amylase in populations with starchy diets .
But there is also evidence that amylase levels can rise and fall within an individual 's lifetime .
A study on college students in Ghana , who typically eat a lot of meat at the university , found that students who had grown up eating traditional starchy Ghanaian home - cooked meals had lower levels of amylase after attending the school .
Humans have had starch as an important part of their diet for at least 12,000 years , since the advent of agriculture , he said .
So what else is spit good for ?
Saliva spreads molecules to the taste receptors on the tongue so you can tell whether something is salty , sour , sweet or spicy , Dominy said .
It also helps soften food and spread it to your teeth so that you do n't have to chew as hard .
Compared with other animals , humans are not very good at detecting toxins , he said .
As a result , humans vomit much more than other species , and saliva buffers the acid that results from throwing up -- meaning you 'll likely salivate immediately beforehand to limit the damage .
" A lot of the value of saliva is attributable to the fact that , in human evolution , we 've had to eat marginal plant foods , things that are marginal in quality and full of toxins , and we need these particular salivary adaptations to help cope with those types of food , " he said .

Why Mark Sanchez will be a Cleveland Brown
Have you heard the latest draft rumors on Mark Sanchez ?
Apparently only the Lions , Rams , Seahawks , Browns , Jaguars , 49ers , Jets , Redskins and Broncos are either in love , smitten or downright want to get in bed with the USC quarterback .
Is that all ?
It seems every day rumors of a new team being interested in Sanchez emerge and while it ’s easy to get caught up in all the pre-draft speculation , it would obviously be wise not to believe everything you hear .
That said , with the draft quickly approaching , I ’ve thoroughly convinced myself that Mark Sanchez will in fact be a Cleveland Brown .
Where there ’s smoke , there ’s usually fire and there ’s a ton of smoke coming out of Cleveland that new head coach Eric Mangini is n’t a big Brady Quinn fan .
Along with daily Sanchez - is - going - here speculation , there have been just as many Quinn - will - be - traded - here rumors .
Maybe Mangini and new GM George Kokinis are just throwing up smokescreens to keep other teams guessing at what their draft day plans are .
Or maybe ( and this seems more logical by the day ) Mangini and Kokinis want to blow up the entire roster and start over and that ’s why Kellen Winslow was traded to the Bucs , Braylon Edwards will soon be dealt to the Giants and Quinn will be jettisoned to parts unknown .
Read between the lines and you get the impression that Mangini would rather hold onto Derek Anderson than Brady Quinn .
Anderson might not have as much upside as Quinn , but he has more starting experience and is just two years removed from a Pro Bowl season .
He ’s also only 25 years old and has the strong arm Mangini apparently covets to run his team ’s offense .
( Do n’t forget in New York , Mangini eventually banished noodle - armed Chad Pennington last year in favor of big-armed Brett Favre . )
One would have to believe that the Browns want to replenish their pick stock after former GM Phil Savage went gonzo and traded away multiple draft selections last offseason .
Getting a first round pick for Quinn would be ideal , but if Mangini truly wants to rid himself of the former Notre Dame alum , then who knows what Cleveland will be willing to accept in compensation .
But the bottom line is that Quinn will be traded by draft day in order for the Browns to acquire more picks and to make room for Sanchez .
Getting back to Sanchez , the Browns will make him the No. 5 pick .
Who else are they going to take ?
Brian Orkapo or Everette Brown ?
Maybe , the Browns do need another outside linebacker .
Michael Crabtree ?
Maybe , the Browns will need a receiver with Donte Stallworth likely heading to prison and if Edwards is traded .
Rey Maualuga ?
Maybe , but doubtful considering he’s an inside linebacker and Cleveland signed free agent Eric Barton this offseason , who played for Mangini in New York .
B.J. Raji ?
Maybe , the Browns could use him in a rotation with fellow defensive tackle Shaun Rogers or use him at one of the end spots in a 3 - 4 , although he ’s a better fit inside .
All of the prospects mentioned above are possibilities , but you can make a strong argument that none of them are worthy of the top 5 pick .
Sanchez might not be either , but if the Browns see a franchise - caliber quarterback in him down the road , then you better believe they ’ll have no regrets taking him that high .
So they trade Quinn , draft Sanchez at No. 5 and have him sit for a year or two behind Anderson until he ’s ready to play .
This is all just speculation on my part of course , but the more I think about it , the more this scenario makes sense .
Cleveland is essentially stuck in a tough spot with no clear - cut choice at No. 5 and again , they would love to acquire more draft picks .
And if Mangini is n’t big on Quinn and does n’t see Anderson as the long - term answer , than Sanchez makes a ton of sense for them in the first round .
Plus , if they can acquire more selections , then they can still fill their defensive and wideout needs later in the draft .
Hell , if they can convince a team like the Redskins ( who clearly are n’t sold on Jason Campbell ) to give them their first round pick for Quinn , then a guy like Brown might fall to them at No. 13 .
Would the ‘ Skins be willing to give up their first round pick for Quinn ?
I do n’t know , but anything is a possibility at this point .
When World War II swept through Europe and pulled in all of the major powers around the globe , it left oceans of blood in its wake .
Having taken approximately 50 million lives , it 's said to be the bloodiest war known to history [ source : Chatterjee ] .
The war began with German dictator Adolf Hitler 's rise to power and hostile invasion of Poland in 1939 .
Germany , Italy , Japan and other countries made up the Axis powers .
The opposing side was the Allies , which consisted of powerful nations like Britain , France , the USSR and the United States .
The conflict did n't end until 1945 , after the U.S. bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .

When you consider that these world powers were using technologically advanced explosives and weapons built to be efficient killing machines , it comes as no surprise that the war featured some of the bloodiest battles ever .
We 've gathered some of the most significant battles of violent conflict , each one costing thousands -- and in some cases millions -- of lives .
As we go over each one , take note that the exact numbers of casualties ( which can include not only the number of dead , but injured , sick and missing ) are disputed and vary among sources .
Also , the term " battle " is n't strictly defined .
Some use it only to refer to shorter conflicts that take place in a confined area , while others have a looser definition that includes large - scale operations or military campaigns .
We 'll start with one of the bloodiest battles in the Pacific theater .
Colorado Springs Republican senator Dave Schultheis continued a style of politics this week that values Biblical interpretations and right - wing philosophy over human life , human suffering and common sense .
His latest sentiments involved a bill that would require pregnant women to be tested for HIV .
The bill is important because if HIV is caught early enough , its spread from mother to baby can be prevented .
But Schultheis said he'd rather that HIV - positive women did pass the deadly virus onto their children , so that their suffering would remind society about the dangers of sexual promiscuity .
" This stems from sexual promiscuity for the most part and I just can't go there , " he was quoted as saying .
" We do things continually to remove the consequences of poor behavior , unacceptable behavior , quite frankly .
" What I 'm hoping is that , yes , that person may have AIDS , have it seriously as a baby and when they grow up , but the mother will begin to feel guilt as a result of that , " he continued .
" The family will see the negative consequences of that promiscuity and it may make a number of people over the coming years begin to realize that there are negative consequences and maybe they should adjust their behavior . "
Earlier this month , Schultheis won another Shmuck of the Week award for his comments criticizing the Colorado Department of Transportation for trying to protect the lives of Latinos .
Schultheis again championed dogmatic politics over human life by accusing CDOT of wasting money by running a public service announcement in Spanish warning people who may or may not be illegal immigrants to buckle their seat belts .
Eighty Latinos died in traffic accidents in Colorado in 2008 , or roughly one quarter of the total number of people who were killed in car crashes .
Of the eighty , 59 were unbuckled .
" All these ads are going to do is provide one more assimilation off - ramp for new arrivals .
Bilingualism in our buckle - up ads -- just like bilingualism in our schools -- will only encourage the further balkanization of our culture , reduce the pressure on new immigrants to learn English and make it harder in the long run for immigrants to become Americans , " he was quoted as saying .
" And where is this going to end ? " the forward - thinking Schultheis asked the Rocky Mountain News .
" Can we expect a new round of PSAs from CDOT this year in Vietnamese , Mandarin Chinese or some other foreign language ? "
Next up for the Senator : A bill that would allow Emergency Rooms to let victims of violence die if they have n't been to church in the past month .

Although Firefox 3.5 is yet to be released , Mozilla has already started planning the next version , which has tentatively been designated 3.6 , with the codename Namoroka .
Firefox 3.6 is loosely scheduled for release in 2010 .
Mozilla is currently working on Firefox 3.5 , which is maturing rapidly .
The third beta release , which landed last month , includes a number of compelling features such as support for the HTML 5 video element and the new high - performance TraceMonkey JavaScript engine .
A fourth beta is expected to arrive later this month , and the final release is expected in June .
Firefox 3.5 was originally called 3.1 , but the version number was increased to reflect the large number of features that have been introduced .
Firefox 3.6 could also see a similar jump in version number , so Mozilla suggests referring to it as " Firefox.next " or Namaroka to avoid confusion .
In a roadmap document published on the Mozilla website , the developers have outlined key areas of focus for the release and some specific features that will be targeted .
Some of the goals are very broad and could encompass a lot of changes to functionality and the Firefox user interface .
Performance will continue to be a high priority for the 3.6 release , with a specific emphasis on startup time and responsiveness .
Customization will also be boosted , with support for new " lightweight " themes and add - ons that can be installed without requiring the browser to restart .
This could build upon the Personas project , which brings simple visual skins to the browser .
The developers aim to automatically tailor more aspects of the user interface to the user based on browsing history and other activity that is automatically tracked by the browser .
One potential example can be seen in the new tab page prototype from Mozilla Labs .
Broader UI changes could also be introduced in 3.6 , such as a task - based navigation paradigm that allows users to group and save tabs and interact with Web services through a command - oriented interface that is potentially influenced by elements of Mozilla 's experimental Ubiquity project .
Some early mockups have already emerged to show how specific ubiquity features could potentially be integrated into the browser .
Mozilla plans to explore possibilities for breaking down some of the barriers between the Web and the desktop by implementing much tighter integration of Prism - like rich Internet application functionality .
According to the roadmap , this plan could also encompass improved file uploading capabilities and integrated rich content editing functionality , like the cool Ubiquity - based photo - editing concept Mozilla revealed earlier this year .
Mozilla delivered a much - improved user experience with the Firefox 3.0 release and is on track to provide impressive enhancements for users and developers in the upcoming 3.5 release .
The roadmap for 3.6 , which looks a lot more ambitious , reflects an effort to move beyond technical improvements and produce innovation in core aspects of the user experience .
It is likely that some of the goals will be refined for a more narrow focus before the new roadmap finalizes .
The browser market is becoming increasingly competitive as Internet Explorer makes a bit of a comeback and new competitors like Chrome really start to gain momentum .
Mozilla seems to have a compelling plan laid out to keep its browser at the front of the pack .

Scientists are developing bullet - proof turbans so Sikh police can carry guns .
Sikh officers are currently barred from becoming firearms or riot police as their religion does not allow them to remove turbans to put on bullet - proof headgear .
But yesterday it emerged a turban made from Kevlar - like material is being developed .
With more than 2 , 000 Sikh officers and staff in the UK , the newly - formed British Police Sikh Association , has made bullet - proof turbans a priority ..
Insp Gian Singh Chahal , vice chairman of the BPSA , told the Police Review research had begun into finding the right material .
One Sikh PC , who did n't want to be named , said : " It would be incredible if they developed a bullet - proof turban . "
Last year West Midlands
Police tried but failed to find protective gear to fit on a turban after a Sikh applied to join a counterterror unit .
The unnamed officer is reported to have claimed discrimination and gone off with stress .
For Sikhs the turban is a symbol of courage and spirituality and must be worn by all adult males .
The Home Office said forces should make " reasonable adjustments " to accommodate beliefs .

Despite President Obama ’s recent flippant remark dismissing legalization of marijuana for economic gain , I think the best direction to take regarding the drug war is to “ keep on keepin ’ on ” with Obama , his drug policy czar , the US Justice Department and state and local officials .
And we should do it along these lines : Obama has stated that public policy is to be guided by SCIENCE , not ideology .
How about that for intelligent strategy !
That ’s change we all can believe in !
And if you take that wisdom and apply it to the drug war look what happens .
We have :
* The science of medical marijuana and how people suffering from various disorders benefit from using it
* The science of drug abuse treatment and prevention which leads to effective means of reducing the abuse of legal and illegal substances
* The science of public health with concepts like harm reduction through needle exchange and drug substitution or replacement
* The science of hemp and its many uses as alternative energy , in products that replace plastics and in personal products including food
* The science of the physiological effects of drug USE and drug ABUSE ; and
* The several social sciences that reveal the tremendous costs to our society of incarcerating people ( currently 1 in 100 Americans ) then attempting to reinstate them to live productive lives .
The drug war economically , socially and physically does greatest harm to the middle class , to young people and to people of color .
And the harm that war does is far beyond the harm of drug abuse .
We have the history of alcohol prohibition from which we should surely have learned that repeal of a prohibition can reduce the violence associated with illegality .
And economics explains how decriminalization coupled with taxation and regulation and hemp production could be of great benefit to our country .
Taken together , the multiple branches of science clearly point in a different direction on drug policy .
If we just follow where science leads it will result in rethinking the drug war .
It will reveal the rationality of decriminalization , regulation and taxation .
And it will lead to opening up the market for hemp .
So we need to simply take Obama at his word and demand that drug policy , as other policies , be guided by science .
We need to remind him that we are not drug users or abusers , we are very rational people ( many with experience in health care and law enforcement ) who agree with him that science should guide public policy .
He set forth a direction here ; we need to hold him to his word .
Mr Obama hopes to get a reform package agreed this year President Barack Obama has welcomed a " historic " commitment from US industry groups to help push forward healthcare reform by cutting costs .
Groups representing hospitals , doctors , drug companies and insurance firms said they intended to cut spending by $ 2 trillion ( £ 1.3tn ) over 10 years .
Mr Obama has made healthcare reform one of his top priorities for 2009 .
His planned reforms include medical insurance for the 46 million Americans currently without it .
Confirming the deal with the health industry , Mr Obama told Americans that he " will not rest until the dream of health care reform is achieved in the United States of America " .
' Significant step '
The six industry groups delivered a letter to the president outlining their voluntary agreement to cut spending increases by 1.5 % a year until 2019 .
Savings would be achieved , they said , by improving coordination , focusing on efficiency , developing better technology and accepting regulatory reform .
No specific commitments were spelled out in the letter , however .
The BBC's North America Editor Justin Webb says although today 's announcement contains little in the way of specifics , it does suggest that the big industry players think some form of healthcare reform will pass this year , and they want to be in on the discussions .
The White House believes the industry groups ' proposals could eventually save families as much as $ 2,500 a year .
" I do n't think there can be a more significant step to help struggling families and the federal budget , " a senior administration official was quoted by the Washington Post as saying on Sunday .
Signatories to the deal include America 's Health Insurance Plans , the American Medical Association , the American Hospital Association , the Service Employees International Union and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America .
They were among the harshest critics of a similar health reform plan set out by President Bill Clinton in 1993 .
But there is a sense among some industry groups that now may be the best time to act before public opinion , fuelled by anger over costs , turns against them , the Associated Press reports .
Obama administration officials predict the move will significantly boost momentum for the president 's plans to get a reform package agreed this year .
The US currently spends $ 2.2 trillion a year on medical care , which amounts to 16 % of the overall economy .

During the three most lucrative and widely watched hours of TV , the cable news channel MSNBC outranked CNN for the first time ever in March .
Viewers continued to flock to the TV versions of the op - ed page in the evenings , according to Nielsen Media Research ratings released Tuesday , posing trouble for CNN , which placed third for the month in weekday prime time from 8 to 11 p.m .
Fox News Channel , the longtime No. 1 cable news operation and a unit of the News Corporation , has extended its lead over CNN and MSNBC in recent months .
In March , “ The O’Reilly Factor , ” Fox ’s 8 p.m. program , reached a milestone of 100 consecutive months as the most popular program on cable news .
Mr. O’Reilly ’s wide audience  an average of 3.4 million each night  reaffirms the popularity of fiercely partisan programs on cable , especially in the evening .
During the prime time hours of 8 to 11 p.m. , when the right - leaning Mr. O’Reilly and the stalwart conservative Sean Hannity are hosts of shows on Fox News , the network is the second - most - popular channel on ad - supported cable , with an average of 2.2 million viewers .
Only the drama - oriented channel USA averages more viewers .
May 3 , 2009 -- Workers at Visteon , following a four - week battle , have gained a victory .
After the occupation of the Visteon plants and 24 - hour picketing when the company announced its liquidation , Ford / Visteon bosses were finally forced to concede to the workers ' demands .
Workers in Enfield and Basildon have already voted in favour of the deal , while those at Belfast will be voting soon .
Below are reports and videos that recount events as they unfolded .

April 9 , 2009 -- Socialist Appeal -- Visteon workers in Enfield , having been threatened with mass arrest by a court order , agree to leave peacefully under the recommendation of the union on April 9 , 2009 .
Some workers feel that ending the occupation is a mistake , despite an agreement by the Visteon management to enter into negotiations .

March 31 , 2009 -- Socialist Resistance -- 200 Visteon car plant workers in Belfast are blockading their factory after the company went into administration today .
If they get away with it , over 600 workers in ex-Ford factories in Belfast , Enfield and Basildon will be sacked and left to claim statutory redundancy from the state .
Even workers with over 30 years ' service will only get about £ 9000 and most workers a lot less .
Also , their pensions plus those of ex-Visteon workers in Swansea and retirees will go into the Pension Protection Fund , which will result in reduced payments .
This is the brutal side of capitalism -- no bailouts or bonuses like the bankrupt fat cats but bare minimum pay outs and the dole .
Visteon UK executives have jumped ship are now employed by their own spin - off ``Visteon Engineering Services ' ' .
A life raft for rats escaping the sinking ship !
Visteon was spun - off by Ford in 2000 as a device to slash costs at the expense of the workforce .
Two and then three - tier contracts then followed as well as outsourcing of ``indirect '' jobs .
However , for Visteon bosses this was n’t enough .
They ’ve spent the last three - and - a - half years demanding that Visteon workers break their Ford ``mirrored '' contracts .
No doubt there will be some in the unions who will agree with management that if only the workforce had agreed cuts in their pay , pensions , terms and conditions , insolvency could have been avoided .
The reality is however , that Visteon , like General Motors ’ spin - off Delphi , was never viable .
Visteon workers were correct to resist and have had at least more income by doing so .
It was that successful battle that has given the Belfast workers the confidence to resist now .
These workers want to put pressure on Ford to intervene to stop the sackings .
They are appealing to the unions in Ford to support them by not using parts shipped in to replace those from Belfast .
If that fails , the occupation can be built to involve the trade union movement and working - class community to force
the government to intervene to nationalise Visteon to save these jobs .

April 1 , 2009 -- Socialist Appeal -- Visteon workers in Enfield and Basildon have joined with Belfast workers in occupying their plants .
Management have put the firm into administration .
Belfast workers have been defending their occupation by staying in overnight .
The workers are taking action because they have to .
They were just brutally kicked off the premises without any notice .
If management get away with this , 600 workers at the three plants will be sacked and left on the minimum statutory redundancy pay .
Statutory redundancy pay is paltry .
Even workers with 30 years ’ service are only entitled to £ 9000 and most will get far less .
In Belfast John McGowan , shift leader at Visteon , said : “ I ’m just dumbstruck .
I feel it ’s totally unjust the way we ’re being treated by the company .
They have had redundancy packages in the past due to the downturn in sales .
“ Last year they were offering redundancy packages of £ 30,000 minimum .
Now they ’re telling me for my 30 years loyalty to this company I ’m getting a redundancy package which is capped at just over £ 9000 .
That ’s totally unjust and unfair . ”
The background to the dispute is that Visteon was spun off from Ford as a scam to attack workers ’ pay and conditions .
Before incorporation in 2000 the plants were part of the Ford combine , making parts for the cars .
The workers were on the normal Ford wages and conditions .
The bosses ’ idea was to uncouple workers ’ pay at the component suppliers from those in the main plant .
Visteon workers have consistently fought attempts to downgrade their labour since 2000 , but now management says the firm is losing money .
Going into administration will also put the workers ’ pensions in peril .
The money will end up in the Pension Protection Fund , where it will in effect become a zombie fund , with no top-ups and guarantees to the workers and pensioners not honoured , as they would have to do if Visteon were a going concern .
No flies on Visteon management .
They have setup a separate outfit called Visteon Engineering Services , which is in effect a life raft to carry their own pensions to safety away from the wreckage of Visteon that they have created .
Over and over again Ford management swore blind that the creation of Visteon was not just a device to enable them to dodge out of their obligations to the components ’ workforce .
Redundant Ford workers have always walked away with a decent package in the past .
In 2000 Ford gave workers cast iron guarantees , which they have shamelessly broken .
The occupying workers are appealing to Ford workers for solidarity in the form of blacking alternative sources of supply for the components Visteon have always delivered .
Putting Visteon into administration is a squalid manoeuvre to load the crisis in the motor industry onto the workers .
But the workers are fighting back !
We see the unity in action of Protestant and Catholic workers in Belfast , and of British and Irish workers across these islands .

On April 6 , 2009 , seven days after occupying their factory in Basildon in Essex , the Visteon car plant workers decide to visit their former boss , Steve Gawne , at his country manor to hand deliver a letter demanding justice be served .
Irish Republican Socialist Party : ` Nationalise Visteon under workers ' control '
April 8 , 2009 --
The IRSP on April 7 , 2009 , accused local politicians of rerouting responsibility regarding the investment and manufacturing crisis in the North of Ireland .
The IRSP employment spokesperson Sean
White , told activists last night that it was easy to blame a global economic crises or credit crunch rather than blame the companies and bankers who intentionally created the crisis ; a crisis created in the interest of profit .
The current economic situation may be global ; but the loss of jobs locally is a consequence of the Stormont Programme for Government with its dependency on inward investment .
Job losses are the result of policies in favour of the employers whilst ignoring the needs of workers .
The long - term needs of the workers were known at Visteon UK when Stormont was subsidising the profits of its directors .
Sean
White went on to say ; “ There is no ‘ natural ’ order to the economy .
There are no innate , static laws overriding economic behaviour .
It is a myth to say nothing can be done .
What is termed the ‘ economy ’ is the way people work , to produce goods and services , and then decide how , where when to sell or use what they produce .
People decide rightly or wrongly .
It is people who make success , make mistakes .
It is people who gamble for profit .
It is people who exploit other people .
We must move away from treating the economy as if it is a fluke in the weather . ”
All economists know that recessions and inflation do n’t just happen .
They are caused .
The banks deliberately restricted the flow of currency ; that is a fact , a fact not disputed by the bankers .
Bankers were aware that a restriction of currency gives way to a recession .
The banks responsible for investment have so far ignored the pleas from the First Minister Peter D. Robinson MP MLA and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuiness .
On December 16 , 2008 , First Minister Robinson and deputy McGuiness and their executive colleagues Nigel Dodd and Arlene Foster tmet with the chief executives of local banks to explore further initiatives to ease the impact of the present economic downturn on consumers and businesses .
To date there has been no response .
Who governs ?
The banks or the elected representatives ?
The IRSP is asking whatever happened to the billions investment promised to create new jobs in current industries .
A small number of people made decisions regarding how this money was used or if it was used .
The IRSP believes that the Irish people deserve answers .
Companies are downsizing or closing as a consequence of poor investment .
Of course there is the immediate response car sales are down by an average of 33 % , but remember in generic terms profit averages 40 % .
Decreases in profit are compensated with job losses and cuts in labour ; in turn increasing the workload on workers .
There is no evidence of any major investment outside of construction .
But there is evidence that the banks responsible for investment paid increased bonuses to their directors .
Transnational companies here are not facing unreserved profit loss .
TNCs require extensive returns ; not marginal profit .
The reported losses of Visteon UK are percentage falls in profit .
However , such profit is not great enough for TNC investment .
Visteon UK 's reported losses totalled £ 669 m .
However in the West Belfast section of the company administrators found no evidence of any losses .
According to the IRSP spokesperson there is not a single component produced by Visteon that we cannot match in terms of a nationalised industry .
Different members of the Stormont Government have come out with statements in support of workers who face job losses .
But they place no blame on the employers .
There is an illusion that Stormont cannot and does not want to interfere in free - market capitalism .
An illusion partly created by the first and second ministers when they visit the US with their begging bowls and partly the Programme for Government .
They over emphasise no government interference .
In fact , without Stormont with its inward investment policies , TNCs could not exist at all .
Government actions and programs have tended to reinforce and stabilise the basic relationships of all TNCs ; guaranteeing private property rights , supplying British and US business ( including Ford and later Visteon UK ) with needed inputs ( like reliable infrastructure and skilled , disciplined workers ) , expanding markets and managing social relationships in a way that promotes both stability and profitability .
If Stormont can interfere on behalf of the bosses , it can interfere on behalf of the workers .
What was not considered by our MLA ’s waltzing about in Stormont and should be , is that workers continue to produce the said components for Ford or any other car company .
The assembly has already stated that “ we are a growing , a dynamic , innovative economy , in a position to invest and build our own infrastructure with a highly trained workforce . ”
The factory should be nationalised under workers ’ control .
But that would be too radical a step for any of the parties in Stormont already committed to administering the neoliberal economic policies of the pro-business Brown government in Westminster .

One of the several planets within the Gliese 581 star system , called Gliese 581 d , may be one of the most potentially habitable alien worlds known .
It is about 8 times the mass of Earth , and located in an orbit just right for liquid water to exist on the surface .
Water is a key ingredient for life as we know it .
Gliese 581 is a red dwarf star 20.5 light - years from Earth
Roughly three quarters of the stars in the galaxy are reddwarfs , but planet searches have typically passed over these tiny faint starsbecause they were thought to be unfriendly to potential life forms .
But this prejudice has softened lately .
Preliminary resultsfrom a dedicated research program have shown that planetsaround red dwarfs could be habitable if they can maintain a magnetic fieldfor a few billion years .
Red dwarfs — alsocalled M dwarfs — are between 7 and 60 percent as massive as our sun .
?
Theirlower mass means they don?t burn as hot or as brightly , emitting less than 5 percent as much light as the sun .
However , they have strong magnetic activity , which makes them relatively bright in X - rays and UV radiation and causes themto flare frequently .
To understand the environment around these common stars , the " Living with a Red Dwarf " program was started three years ago .
It ispiecing together observational data to provide a profile of how red dwarfs varyin brightness and magnetic activity as they age .
" This is the information that you would want to know tomodel the suitability for life on a nearby planet , " says Ed Guinan ofVillanova University , a scientist working with the program .
Death lock
As habitability goes , red dwarfs were thought to be the badroommates of the cosmos .
Because they are so faint , the habitable zone — the distancefrom a star where liquid water can exist — is in many cases closer than theorbital distance between Mercury and our sun .
When a planet orbits a star thisclosely , the gravitational pull of the star may cause the planet to become tidallylocked with the same side always facing the star ( similar to the Moon 's fixedgaze on the Earth ) .
Previously , scientists speculated that the dark side of atidally locked planet would become so cold that it would freeze up the entireatmosphere , leaving even the sun - lit side with little air for breathing .
Butmore recent models have shown that winds would distribute the heat sufficientlyto avoid this atmospheric collapse .
Still , life might not be a picnic around a red dwarf .
Severaltimes per day flares shoot off the star , causing the UV radiation to jump by100 to 10,000 times normal .
For several minutes , the star appears blue insteadof red .
This increased radiation could sterilize the surface of a nearbyplanet .
" You probably want to live on the dark side , " Guinan says .
" Or at least along the twilight zone where you would haveless exposure . " ?
Even between flares , the combination of UV light and stellarwinds can stripaway the atmosphere if nothing is protecting or replenishing it .?
However , all hope is not lost .
The high - energy radiation is predominantlyemitted by young stars .
As they age , red dwarfs become less magnetically active , while continuing to shine steadily at visible wavelengths for 100 billion yearsor more .
Therefore , if an orbiting planet can just hold onto itsatmosphere through the wild early years of its red dwarf roommate , it could endup being a decent place to live .
Turning back the stellar clock
But just how long are red dwarfs dangerous ?
To develop a model for how a star 's magnetic activitychanges with time , Guinan and his colleague Scott Engle looked at the rotationrates of a large sample of red dwarfs .
As expected , faster spinning stars hadmore X -ray and UV emission , as well as more flares .?
The rotation causescharged material inside the star to be churned around , and this " dynamo " action generates a magnetic field .
Gas around the starbecomes trapped in this field and heatedto millions of degrees .
This hot gas produces the observed high energy radiation .
By estimating the ages of stars in their sample , theresearchers were able to build up a typical red dwarf life history .?
The data show that a red dwarf is born spinning rapidly , andit exhibits the corresponding magnetic activity .
However , the magnetic fieldalso creates strong winds that carry away angular momentum , and thus slow thestar down with time .
The conclusion is that a red dwarf will calm down afterabout 2 or 3 billion years .
In comparison , our sun ( a typical G star ) wasmagnetically very active ( with 2 to 5 big flares per day ) for its first half abillion years .
Magnetic shield
A planet with a substantial magnetic field , like Earth 's , can deflect stellar winds and thereby avoid having its atmosphere stripped away .
" This could protect the planet for the 2 to 3 billionyears that a red dwarf is active , " Guinan says .
He is not completely optimistic , however .
The fact thatpotentially habitable planets around a red dwarf are tidally locked implies theyare rotating slowly around their axis .
By the same physics that applies tostars , slow rotation will mean a weak magnetic field that could shut downcompletely .
This is what happened to Mars .
It had a magnetic field 3.5 billion years ago , but when its liquid iron core solidified , the field turnedoff .
Without this protective shield , the solar wind stripped away most of the planet ?
satmosphere and liquid water .
To avoid this fate around a red dwarf , Guinan speculatesthat a planet might need to be more massive than Earth .
The large liquid iron coreinside a super Earth ( with a mass between 2 and 10 times Earth 's ) could perhapsmaintain a magnetic field in spite of the slower rotation rate .
Interestingly , three of the two dozen planets detected sofar around red dwarfs are super Earths .
More will presumably be found in futuresearches : ? The MEarth Project is a planned survey of 2000 M stars usingground - based telescopes , and the Kepler spacecraft that launched in March hasadded more red dwarfs to its target list .
" M dwarf stars were overlooked in the past , but theyhave become more popular as people realize that life could potentially arisearound them , " Guinan says .
Прийшов час виконати обіцяне та поговорити про японське письмо .
Почнемо з основ : абетки .
Проте японці навіть тут підготували для 外人達 , що посміли вчити їх мову , кілька сюрпризів .
А саме :
Абеток – дві : катакана та хіраґана .
Обидві вони складові ( силабічні ) .
Записують їх у вигляді таблиці – 五十音 .
Табличка читається згори донизу та справа наліво .
Ось сама таблиця : у клітинках подано знаки хіраґани , катакани та читання .

Докладніше :
1 . Не буду вдаватися у історію , скажу лише , що обидві абетки походять від китайських ієрогліфів , що були завезені в Японію десь у 5 столітті .
Раніше більш уживаною була катакана , проте у сучасній мові в основному використовується хіраґана : нею записують закінчення слів , службові слова , фуріґану та ін .
Катакану в основному використовують для запису іншомовних слів .
Крім того , катаканою виділяють слова або частини тексту – аналогічно до жирного шрифту або курсиву у нашій мові .
В такому випадку катаканою можуть записувати навіть ті слова , що звичайно пишуться канджі або хіраґаною .
У окремих випадках катаканою пишуть окремі глави або й цілі твори – теж у якості своєрідного стилістичного виділення .
2 . Як видно з таблички , більшість знаків абеток позначають два звука , проте не всі .
Є 5 голосних , окремий звук “ н ” та “ напівскладови й ” “ во ” , який читається як “ о ” .
3. 五十 означає 50 ( докладніше читайте у дописі про японську лічбу ) , а 音 – звук .
Отже , 50 звуків , 5 рядків на 10 стовпчиків .
Проте на сьогодні знаків усього 46 ( плюс ще два можна зустріти у відносно недавній – довоєнній – літературі ) : 5 вийшли з ужитку , а “ н ” було додано пізніше , так що він стоїть у окремому стовпчику .
4. Нічого дивного , бо саме так ( вгори донизу та справа наліво ) японці і пишуть .
Відповідно і книжки починаються у них “ з кінця ” .
Правда , у сучасні й
Японії все частіше зустрічається звичне для нас горизонтальне письмо ( особливо у електронних виданнях ) .
Ще кілька зауважень :
五十音 є лише основою фонетики : з її знаків утворюються інші .
По-перше , якщо над знаком абетки поставити значок нігорі ゛ , то приголосний цього складу одзвінчується : звуки “ к ” , “ х ” , “ с ” та “ т ” стають “ ґ ” , “ б ” , “ з ” та “ д ” відповідно ( дзвінкі “ чі ” , “ ші ” читаються як “ джі ” , а “ цу ” – як “ дзу ” ) .
Ханнігорі ゜ перетворює “ х ” в “ п ” .
, то приголосний цього складу одзвінчується : звуки “ к ” , “ х ” , “ с ” та “ т ” стають “ ґ ” , “ б ” , “ з ” та “ д ” відповідно ( дзвінкі “ чі ” , “ ші ” читаються як “ джі ” , а “ цу ” – як “ дзу ” ) .
перетворює “ х ” в “ п ” .
По - друге , якщо до знаків ряду “ і ” додати йотовані , то отримаємо пом ’якшені звуки : “ кя ” , “ рю ” , “ шьо ” , тощо .
На письмі йотований знак пишеться трохи меншим , ніж основний текст : きゃ , りゅ , しょ .
Крім того , голосні можуть подовжуватися .
Для цього голосний звук на письмі подвоюється , як , наприклад , у слові 遠い .
Довжина “ о ” також може позначатися додаванням після нього “ у ” : そう .
Але будьте уважні , бо у такому випадку це може бути як подовження звуку “ о ” , так два окремі звуки : “ оу ” .
У катакані подовження звуків позначається тире ( дивіться нижче ) .
Про вимову :
Вимова звуків у японській не надто відрізняється від української або російської , тому , власне , і запис їх кирилицею можливий без уведення спеціальних знаків транскрипції ( на відміну , наприклад , від англійської ) .
У першому наближенні , як кажуть математики , можна вимовляти їх так , як написано у даній табличці .
Проте і тут є підводні камені .
Так , щодо “ ші ” та “ чі ” ( та їх похідних ) точаться гарячі суперечки .
Особливо це стосується “ ші ” .
Щоб зрозуміти суть проблеми , можете почитати , наприклад , “ Віртуальні сусі “ .
Свою думку я докладно висловлю у іншому дописі , а тут зауважу лише , що запис “ ші ” та “ чі ” для відповідних складів не співпадає з офіційною кириличною ( Поліванівською ) транскрипцією .
Ви , певно , помітили , що у табличці немає ряду “ л ” .
Справді , такого звуку в японській мові не існує .
Зате “ р ” вимовляється ( у другому наближенні , так сказати ) десь між нашими “ р ” та “ л ” .
А як же запис іншомовних слів , у яких є і окремі звуки ( а не склади ) , і той же “ л ” ?
А це окрема наука , що потребує певної практики .
Наприклад , розшифруйте - но , що означає ラブ・エンド・ピース або ラブ・レター ( підказка : походить з англійської ) .
Наостанок :
Ну от , основи закладено .
Тепер , сподіваюсь , підзаголовок мого блогу , у якому є хіраґана , катакана та канджі , не видаватиметься вам китайською грамотою : ви з упевненістю можете сказати , що грамота японська .
На цьому все . またね。
P.S. Маленький тест : від якого ієрогліфа походить знак катакани “ ні ” ?
Підказка тут або тут .
By 52 % to 48 % , voters approved the measure reinstating a ban on same - sex marriage after the state Supreme Court , in a landmark ruling last May , approved such marriages .
Left in limbo were about 18,000 couples who got married in California between May and November of last year .
( Note : An earlier version of this post said voters approved by a 52 - 48 margin the measure reinstating a ban on same - sex marriage after the state Supreme Court , in a landmark ruling last May , approved such marriages . )
The California Supreme Court today upheld Proposition 8 ’s ban on same - sex marriage but also ruled that gay couples who wed before the election will continue to be married under state law .
The California Supreme Court today upheld Proposition 8 ’s ban on same - sex marriage but also ruled that gay couples who wed before the election will continue to be married under state law .
The decision virtually ensures another fight at the ballot box over marriage rights for gays .
Gay rights activists said they may ask voters to repeal the marriage ban as early as next year , and opponents have pledged to fight any such effort .
Proposition 8 passed with 52 % of the vote .
The case for overturning the initiative was widely viewed as a long shot .
Gay rights lawyers had no solid legal precedent on their side , and some of the court ’s earlier holdings on constitutional revisions mildly undercut their arguments .
But gay marriage advocates captured a wide array of support in the case , with civil rights groups , legal scholars and even some churches urging the court to overturn the measure .
Supporters of the measure included many churches and religious organizations .
The legal fight over same - sex marriage in California began in San Francisco in 2004 , when Mayor Gavin Newsom spurned state law , and the city began issuing marriage licenses to gay couples .
Long lines of couples showed up to marry and celebrated within view of the court with rice and champagne .
Those marriages sparked a national debate about gay rights and made the marriage question a political issue in an election year .
Dozens of states later adopted constitutional amendments to bar same - sex marriage .
Those gay couples who wed in San Francisco later had their marriages rescinded by the California Supreme Court , which ruled that a city could not single - handedly flout state law .
But the court said supporters of marriage rights could challenge the ban in the lower courts .
The legal fight moved to San Francisco Superior Court , where a judge struck down the marriage ban as unconstitutional .
A Court of Appeal in San Francisco later overturned that decision on a 2 - 1 vote .
The state high court eventually took up the case , which culminated in a May 15 ruling last year declaring gays could marry each other .
Before last fall , California was one of only two states — the other was Massachusetts — to permit same - sex marriage .
Iowa , Connecticut , Vermont and Maine have since legalized it , and lawmakers in New York , New Jersey and New Hampshire are considering bills of their own .
California ’s historic 2008 ruling , written by Chief Justice Ronald George , repeatedly invoked the words " respect and dignity " and framed the marriage question as one that deeply affected not just couples but also their children .
California has more than 100,000 households headed by gay couples , about a quarter with children , according to 2000 census data .
As soon as the ruling was final , thousands of gay couples showed up at city halls around the state to marry , and many flew in from elsewhere for California weddings .
While the wedding business was brisk , opponents mounted a heated campaign with the help of churches and conservatives to overturn the court ’s action .
Even though the court has upheld Proposition 8 , a key portion of the court ’s May 15 , 2008 , decision remains intact .
Sexual orientation will continue to receive the strongest constitutional protection possible when California courts consider cases of alleged discrimination .
The California Supreme Court is the only state high court in the nation to have elevated sexual orientation to the status of race and gender in weighing discrimination claims .

A chat with Pete Docter , Pete Docter interview , Up , Toy Story , Monsters , Inc. , Wall - E
Movies Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
If a Pixar movie has either made you cry or brought you to the edge of tears , odds are Pete Docter was involved .
All of Pixar ’s directors are mindful of making family - friendly entertainment , but Docter is all about the heart , and his latest effort “ Up ” raises the ante tenfold .
Bullz - Eye caught up with Docter to ask him about the darkest days in Pixar ’s history , the risks that come with making a 78 - year - old the lead in your movie , and how he feels about the work that his fellow animators are producing .
Surprise !
He ’s somewhat disappointed .
Bullz - Eye : Pleasure to talk to you , for starters .
Thanks for taking the time to talk to us .
PD : Not at all .
BE : You ’ll be happy to know that the first full - length movie I showed my son , who is now two , was “ Monsters , Inc. ” .
PD : Oh , wow .
BE : Yeah .
Although now he ’s all about [ “ Finding Nemo ” and “ WALL·E ” director ] Andrew Stanton .
PD : Oh , he was n’t freaked out at all by “ Monsters ” ?
BE : No , no , not at all .
PD : Good .
BE : So , your movie opened the Cannes Film Festival .
That ’s pretty cool .
PD : Yeah , that ’s not something that happens every day .
In fact , this is the first animated film to open the festival there in their 62 - year run , so not bad ; pretty cool .
BE : I saw the movie on Tuesday , and I ’d just like to say … you bastard .
I cried like a little girl during the opening sequence .
" We do n’t really think about marketing and merchandising .
That ’s not what makes a good movie .
If you start with that …well , you know where that goes . "
PD : ( Laughs )
Well , cool , that ’s great .
I mean , we sort of knew we had a lot of comedy and action stuff coming up later , so I do n’t know about you , but films that really stick with me are ones that have some sort of heart to them , and emotional basis .
That ’s where we were going with that .
BE : Well , that ’s definitely a theme within your work , because the last scene in “ Monsters , Inc. ” kills me as well .
PD : Oh , cool .
I actually animated that scene myself .
That was fun .
BE : “ Up ” is the first real Pixar movie that takes place within “ our ” world , as it were .
Was that a conscious decision on the studio’s part to move away from like the fish world or the insect world ?
PD : No , it was more just a sense of , “ Okay , what have we not done ? ”
Every time we approach a project , we want to make sure that we ’re doing something new , that we have n’t covered this territory already .
And in this case , there is just something to Bob Peterson and I – Bob is the head writer and co-director on the project – we were thinking there is something really appealing about a grouchy old guy , who is the “ get off of my lawn , ” keeps - your - baseballs kind of guy .
Do you know what I mean ?
BE : Yes .
PD : So we just started playing with that , and it did seem like it had a lot of comic potential , as well as great emotional appeal as well .
So it was n’t so much a desire to move away from anything , it was just move towards something different .
BE : Fair enough .
Now tell me about approaching the 3D aspect of the movie ?
Was there a part of you that wanted nothing to do with it on general principle ?
PD : Well , it was definitely … to me , I guess , whenever you come across new technology like this , it ’s like , “ Oh , this is a kind of cool new toy …how can we break it ?
What can we do with this ? ”
Pixar had done a couple of 3D films before , one in ’ 89 , “ Knick Knack , ” the short film .
So it ’s definitely something that everybody was intrigued by .
And then we just started putting together a great team that tried to figure out what makes things work and when do things break .
To me , the things that bug me about 3D , as cool as it is when things come out at you in to your face , I end up being very conscious of “ Hey , I ’m watching a movie with glasses on . ”
Do you know what I mean ?
BE : Yes .
PD : So we made a conscious effort to try not to do that , to treat it more subtly .
Almost like a window looking in , as opposed to coming out at you .
And in that sense , it ’s just more of a story coming to life .
We can use it to emphasize certain scenes .
When we want Carl to feel closed off and alone , we sort of squash the space .
And then when he takes off , we really want to emphasize how grand something is , so you make it real dynamic and deep .
So it just ended up being another tool in which to tell the stories .
BE : Give me your honest reaction when that report surfaced saying that a research group was questioning your movie ’s viability because of its lack of merchandising potential .
PD : Well , I was n’t sure to be offended or pleased , you know ?
Because just myself , I… and this is kind of our approach at Pixar in general , we do n’t really think about marketing and merchandising .
That ’s not what makes a good movie .
If you start with that …well , you know where that goes .
You have to think about good storytelling and characters first .
Then hopefully , the rest of that stuff will follow , some more than others .
But if you do n’t have a good film and strong characters , then you do n’t have anything down the road .
BE : I read Robert Iger ’s quote about the ‘ check the box ’ approach to filmmaking , and I literally pumped my fist in the air when I saw that .
PD : Yeah , he ’s been great , and John Lasseter , it has always been their philosophy ; both of them have been very clear about , “ Just make a great movie and do n’t worry about the other stuff .
It will come . ”
“ There is no right or wrong with this stuff .
It ’s art ; it ’s not math .
Some people love different things than what other people like .
That ’s the idea . ”
BE : Does Pixar have any house rules in terms of what they absolutely will not put into a movie ?
PD : Not that I know of , no .
I mean , we did early on in “ Toy Story ” ; this was [ made ] as animation had been boxing itself off a little bit .
Or at least that ’s the way people were perceiving it .
“ It ’s animated ?
Well , where do the princesses go , and where ’s the ‘ I Want ’ song , ” and all those things .
So on “ Toy Story , ” we made a list of things that we did not want .
We wanted to break free of any sort of genre that people were putting animation into .
It ’s a medium ; you could do anything with it .
You could do horror films , you could do whatever .
Anything is possible .
But now , as we go forward , I guess the only rule we have for ourselves is to try to make it unique and different from what we ’ve done , so that you ’re not traveling down a road that you ’ve already been down .
BE : Well , what inspired that question was that before the screening of “ Up , ” they showed a trailer for the upcoming Disney movie about the spy gerbils or whatever .
( Note : They ’re guinea pigs , and the movie is called “ G Force . ” )
PD : Oh , yeah .
BE : It had two underwear jokes and two fart jokes in the span of three minutes .
And I thought , “ Pixar would n’t do that . ”
PD : Oh , I see .
Every film is different , and every director is different .
I guess it just depends on where you end up .
I would n’t say that we are holier than that , or anything .
We have our share of butt jokes and stuff .
It just kind of depends on the taste of whoever is doing it , I guess .
BE : I do n’t expect a straight answer from this , but I have to ask : what do you think of the animated movies that the other studios are putting out ?
Admit it , do n’t you want to slap a couple of them around ?
Because I know I do .
PD : Well , I mean , there are definitely films that come out that I do n’t really have any desire to see .
There are other films that come out and I go , “ Yeah , I would never make that , but that is so cool . ”
I love it when you see films that are just totally different , that are coming out of a real different direction .
I think “ Coraline ” does that .
It ’s just … again , not something that Pixar would do , but it ’s very Henry Selick , and it approaches storytelling from a different angle .
I love the Aardman films for that same reason .
They just have such charm and appeal and they really keep the medium diverse .
That ’s what I think is the sign of a healthy industry , is when you have all these different choices and different approaches .
There is no right or wrong with this stuff .
It ’s art ; it ’s not math .
Some people love different things than what other people like .
That ’s the idea .
BE : That ’s funny you mention “ Coraline , ” because I was going to ask you if you guys had considered granting Henry Selick the Brad Bird exemption clause to let him come in and do a movie for you .
PD : Yeah , I do n’t know .
I mean , that ’s kind of outside of my purview , but the guy is a very talented designer and filmmaker .
I hope he keeps making movies .
BE : This is your first directorial effort in eight years , and most Pixar movies , by my estimate , take anywhere from three to five years to put together .
Was there a specific reason for the delay between movies , or was it just a matter of waiting your turn ?
PD : Well , on this one , let ’s see … I guess by the time I got done with “ Monsters , ” it was late ’ 02 .
It came out late ’01 .
And then I started in on a project that kind of did n’t go , that became “ WALL·E . ” Andrew [ Stanton ] took that on , and was able to make certain things work that I was having trouble with .
And then I worked on “ Howl ’s Moving Castle , ” the English translation of that .
And then [ there were ] a couple of other projects that kind of sputtered for a little while and then finally caught fire , and that was in early ’ 04 on this one .
So it just took whatever time it took .
Longer than I would have wanted , for sure , but I got to do some interesting stuff in the interim .
BE : Were you as upset as I was when “ WALL·E ” did n’t win either of the Academy Awards for sound ?
PD : Oh , yeah .
I mean they really did such a stellar job , and it just seemed like it had a real chance to me .
That was a bummer .
BE : Legend has it that every Pixar movie has hit a point where the people working on it think it ’s awful and unfixable .
Did “ Up ” hit a similar spot ?
PD : Well , obviously we do n’t think that it ’s unfixable , or we would dump it .
But “ Up ” had its most difficult time – now that it ’s done I can look back on it – I think it was the early , early days .
And getting back to your last question of why has it been so long [ since my last directorial effort ] , you know , it just had trouble … I was really pushing for something more otherworldly and abstract .
It just took us a while to figure out what elements we need to appeal to people , to move forward .
So once we locked in on the old man and the floating house , that ’s where we started hitting strides .
BE : Now a follow - up to that : which Pixar movie was , in your opinion , the most difficult one to “ get on track ” ?
" Animation had been boxing itself off a little bit .
‘ It ’s animated ?
Well , where do the princesses go , and where ’s the “ I Want ” song ? "
PD : Oh , let ’s see … I guess that depends how you define difficult .
“ Toy Story ” probably had the darkest hour , and the most chance of just sinking the company .
I mean , there was a time , and I do n’t remember what day of the week this was – we ’ve referred to it as Black Monday – but where we had a screening of the film , and it was awful .
Even we , now looking back at it , go , “ Oh my gosh , that ’s awful .
The characters are n’t appealing , and I do n’t want to watch these guys . ”
They threatened to shut the studio down and lay everybody off , and move everybody to L.A. to try to fix it .
Luckily , the Pixar folks stood up for us and said , “ Just give us another chance . ”
Basically , what we did in a very short amount of time , two or three weeks , John [ Lasseter ] was able to get it from them and say , “ Let ’s just make the movie that we want to make .
We ’re going to ignore all the notes that we ’ve gotten and come on , let ’s just do it . ”
We worked long nights , and everybody pulled together and did stuff all together .
And we finally put something out that was n’t the complete film , but was enough to get people back on board and say , “ Oh , all right , these guys are n’t a bunch of insane people . ”
BE : [ SPOILER ALERT :
If you have n’t seen the movie , continue reading at your own peril . ]
The Charles Muntz character , the brave explorer and Carl ’s childhood idol that turns out to be less than heroic : I ca n’t help but think that was based on a personal experience of yours .
Am I right ?
PD : Not really .
BE : Meeting someone in Hollywood and realizing , “ Oh my gosh , they ’re not at all who I thought they would be . ”
PD : Not really .
It was more just a desire to twist expectation .
I mean , I ’ve definitely had experiences in my own life where I have built people up , kind of unfairly .
One of my heroes was Jim Henson .
I got to meet him and he was very nice , but he did n’t single me out and hire me on the spot , which is what I was expecting .
So that was a bit disappointing .
But more than that , [ Charles Muntz ] was just based on the idea of twisting expectation and kind of foiling what the audience … where they think this is going .
BE : Fair enough .
PD : But I ’m curious , what about it , do you think , felt to you like it was from personal experience ?
What do you think led you to that ?
BE : I ca n’t really put my finger on it .
I do n’t know your history well enough to say .
I just did n’t know if you had run into some animation legend and had this really awkward , miserable experience like Carl has when meets Charles Muntz .
It was pure conjecture on my part .
PD : I was just curious to know if there was something in there .
It ’s actually really cool that you thought that , just because we always try to make these feel as personal as we can .
But unfortunately , there is no great story there .
[ END OF SPOILER ALERT ]
BE : So what do you have planned next ?
PD : Next for me is some time off , and then hopefully get back in there and do another film before another three , four years go by .
BE : Do you have any stories that you are sketching out right now ?
PD : Yeah , I ’ve got some ideas that are tumbling around back in my head , but nothing that I want to talk about at this point .
BE : Well , I will keep you on schedule .
I appreciate you taking the time to talk with us .
PD : All right , thank you .
BE : I love the movie .
Best of luck with it .
PD : Oh , thanks .

An Oklahoma public school teacher was forced to resign for teaching The Laramie Project , a play about Matthew Shepard , a man who was murdered because he was gay .
Grandfield , Okla. , public school teacher Debra Taylor was including The Laramie Project , a play about Matthew Shepard , a man murdered because he was gay , in a unit on the ways in which communities can justify hatred and intolerance .
Once Superintendent Ed Turlington learned that she was teaching material that addresses homosexuality , he demanded that she stop teaching the play .
After holding a mock funeral for the play for her students , Taylor was asked to resign .
She did so , worried that if she did n’t , she would be fired , and would be unable to work again in the state ’s public school system .
Last night , the Superintendent accepted her resignation .
Advocates at SIECUS working with Taylor say she has received consistent support from her students and their parents .
" The level of support that Debra is receiving should give more than
enough cause to look at this case again and to question the Superintendent ’s movements
here , " says William Smith , Vice - President of SIECUS .
" But we need to be clear – it does n’t
matter if there are a huge amount of parents in support of her or against her .
It ’s the most American of things to speak out
and fight against injustice wherever we find it breeding , and it ’s breeding in
this school . "

Smith adds , " What happens when the next teacher tries to talk about
intolerance and hatred and murdering people for that , and they get harassed
and forced to resign ?
This is bigger than just
what ’s happening to Debra Taylor .
It ’s about the perpetuation
of hatred and injustice in our society .
The same
sort of hatred and discrimination that led to Shepard ’s death leads to this teacher ’s
firing .
We ca n’t allow that to stand . "
The SIECUS action alert follows :
Tell Superintendent Turlington : Teach Respect !
Reinstate Teacher Debra Taylor !
Advocates in Oklahoma , Texas , and surrounding states are strongly
encouraged to call or email in support .
TAKE ACTION NOW … call Superintendent Turlington at 580-479-5237 or send an email to [ email protected ] and tell him :
" Debra
Taylor did not deserve this kind of treatment .
Young people need
dedicated teachers willing to confront issues of respect and acceptance
for people of all sexual orientations .
She should be commended for
creating a safe space for all her students and should be reinstated
immediately . "

Advertisement Public health experts in Wales refer to it as the newspaper effect .
During the height of the scare over the link between the MMR vaccine and autism local papers ran vociferous campaigns warning parents about the supposed dangers of the jab .
The research , by Dr Andrew Wakefield , has now been discredited , but the problem is the damage has been done .
With vaccination levels down to 15 % in some schools , the region is seeing record numbers of measles cases .
It is still hard to convince people of the truth
Dr Mac Walapu
National Public Health Service for Wales
There are already more than 120 cases being investigated compared to just 39 in the whole of Wales last year .
Back in 2005 , there were none .
" Uptake rates for MMR are much lower than for other vaccinations , " says Dr Mac Walapu , a measles expert at the National Public Health Service for Wales .
" Parents are taking a conscious decision not to get the MMR jab .
We think that is down to the concerns that were raised when the research came out .
" The newspapers have admitted the research was wrong , but it is still hard to convince people of the truth . "
Breeding ground
What seems to be happening in Wales - and across the rest of the UK for that matter - is that the children who were not vaccinated at the height of the MMR scare at the turn of the century are the ones who are now mixing in the school yard .
In Llanelli alone - a town with fewer than 50,000 residents - there are thought to be 800 primary school children and 2,100 secondary school pupils who are not vaccinated .
This creates a breeding ground for the virus to be passed on throughout the community .
MEASLES Measles is a highly infectious virus .
It starts with a fever and conjunctivitis before a rash develops
The rash often lasts about a week and other complications can include pneumonia and diarrhoea
The MMR jab is used to immunise children against the disease Before the triple vaccine was introduced in the late 1980s , there were 20 deaths a year on average in the UK
But since the early 1990s there has just been two in total
For a number of years the UK has been struggling to get to a 95 % vaccination rate , the level needed for herd immunity whereby even unvaccinated individuals are protected because the disease cannot take a hold .
Scotland has only just achieved the level , but in England and Wales even uptake of the first of the two courses of the vaccine is only at 85 % .
The effect is clear .
In 2008 , there were 1,348 cases of measles in England and Wales compared to 56 a decade ago .
London has been particularly badly hit , although this week the north east announced it was seeing a dramatic rise with 37 cases confirmed so far in 2009 and another 100 suspected compared to just 17 last year .
The cases have been predominantly in children under 18 and have prompted health officials to run catch up campaigns to try to get more children and teenagers vaccinated .
In England , Chief Medical Officer Sir Liam Donaldson has given local NHS trusts between £ 30,000 and £ 60,000 to target the 3 m young people who are thought to have missed out on inoculation .
Spread A spokeswoman for the Health Protection Agency , which coordinates the vaccination programme in England and Wales , said : " We have reached the point where there are sufficient numbers of unvaccinated children in the population to sustain the spread of the disease .
" It has become very hard to stop .
What is particularly concerning is that there are vulnerable people who have underlying medical conditions or are allergic to vaccinations who can not be vaccinated .
" Measles can kill and it is especially risky for these people .
That is forgotten . "
But the UK is not alone in struggling with measles , which causes fever and can have serious complications including pneumonia and encephalitis .
Over the last two years there have been more than 12,000 cases across Europe with high rates in Italy , Germany and Switzerland in particular .
And to think that in the early 1990s experts thought they had seen the back of measles , prompting the World Health Organization to set a 2010 deadline to eradicate the disease .

Back in the 1980s , Citibank CEO John S. Reed looked at the bank ’s earnings and said , more or less :
This is really a credit card company with six other lines of business .
That is , the card portfolio was making lots of dough , and carrying the rest .
Commercial lending , real estate lending , clearing , foreign exchange , branch banking — all of them were flat or losing money , while the card business was cooking .
Membership has its privileges indeed .
I am reminded of this today because this past week President Obama has been meeting with the CEOs of the big credit card companies and trying to jawbone them into giving up some of the power they enjoy to goose their earnings by opportunistic manipulation of terms of service to their customers .
It ’s as if Mobil or BP had the power to come back in the dark of night and siphon off some of the gas they sold you in the afternoon .
I wish the president well .
He made it clear during his session with the card executives that he was familiar with their machinations from personal experience .
We have come a long way since the first President Bush marveled at a bar code reader .
But I have my doubts .
Right now , the whole banking portfolio looks a good deal like Citibank did in those days .
Commercial lending , mortgages , trading … all underwater .
Credit cards may or may not be making money — that shoe does n’t drop all at once — but when you can squeeze your customers the way all that fine print allows , you do n’t give up the franchise lightly .
Let ’s not forget , the credit card business already had its bailout , in the form of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 , which functions according to the Law of Goodfellas : Drowning in medical bills ?
“ F* you , pay me . ”
Swamped by alimony and child support ?
“ F* you , pay me . ”
To that , add : Lost your job , house , and health insurance ?
“ F* you ! ”
When I arrived at Citibank in 1980 , one of the first speeches I wrote was for the opening of Citibank , South Dakota , which was created expressly for the purpose of lodging the credit card business .
Citibank had transplanted this business from New York State because New York still had usury laws , which capped retail interest rates at 12 % .
The bank was in big trouble .
In the preceding years , Mr. Reed had flooded the nation with credit cards , a bold move in an era when people did their banking locally .
A credit card was generally an extension of an existing banking relationship , replete with a credit history and some suasion of banker over customer .
Reed ’s folly , as it was occasionally called , entailed giving cards to total strangers by mass mailing — unlike retail banks , the U.S. Post Office could branch across state lines — many of whom were of dubious creditworthiness , or dubious character for that matter .
With interest rates capped at 12 % by New York law , and overnight money , borrowed as needed from other banks , floating north of that — this was when Paul Volcker was Fed chairman — something had to give .
As Walter Wriston put it , “ When you borrow money at 14 % and lend it at 12 % , you ca n’t make it up on volume . ”
When I was recruited as a Citibank speechwriter , among the perks my boss mentioned was that I could take out a loan at a low employee rate and buy a CD that paid a higher one .
New York State legislators never imagined that one of the most venerable of banking institutions would relocate the business to a more favorable venue , a practice called jurisdiction shopping .
But armed with some combination of the Bank Holding Company Act and other legislation , and something called the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution , they found their way to South Dakota and its accommodating four - term Governor William Janklow .
Governor Janklow ’s signature legislative accomplishments were the reinstatement of capital punishment , and lifting the State ’s usury limits .
( He was later convicted of running a stop sign and hitting a motorcyclist , killing him .
The family was precluded from collecting damages because Janklow was heading home from a speech at a country fair , and thus on official business .
He is now a practicing lawyer . )
But enough local color .
Suffice it to say that the bank got what it wanted , and so did the State .
The bank instantly became South Dakota ’s largest employer , and , as we pointed out in our speeches , its college graduates found an employer where they could put their degrees to work without leaving home .
This was so soon after I started working at Citibank that I was denied my first credit card because I had n’t been at my job long enough .
“ I ’m writing speeches for the chairman of the bank and for your boss , Rick Braddock , ” I told the phone rep .
“ That may be , ” she said , “ but you have n’t been employed long enough to qualify . ”
When I told Rick , he laughed and said , “ At least they ’re doing their jobs .
What do you want , plain vanilla or preferred ? ”
Freed from the constraints of New York State law , Citibank survived its catastrophic loan losses and pioneered many now - standard innovations , including risk - based pricing , affinity cards , and a portfolio of cards targeted to different categories and classes of users .
Even then , the promiscuous marketing of cards and the potential resulting horrors were manifest .
Like pornographers ’ lawyers , we found the germ of redeeming social importance .
We were providing consumers with a tool for managing their personal and family finances .
We were freeing working people from the necessity of relying on loan sharks from payday to payday .
We were dealing with consenting adults .
The bankers were fully aware , of course , that in spite of talk about sensible use of credit and managing the household budget , they were really selling liquor to the natives .
Behind the scenes was a laboratory where young people with degrees in psychology were kicking the consumer behavior of millions around like a soccer ball , finding ways to hype the impulse to buy , buy , buy , and mining data to place “ choices ” in front of people based on their previous purchases .
We take it all for granted now , with Amazon.com and a thousand other websites , but this took place in the years of the mid-1980s , one of which was 1984 .
By the end of last week , the biggest story out of the credit card summit was that Larry Summers fell asleep , a serendipity that is almost a reenactment of regulatory behavior over the past eight years or more ( I am aware of the role Summers played under Clinton ) .
The New York Times reported , “ One executive told the president that although her assignment had been to try to persuade the president not to support new restrictions , ‘ it was pretty clear I wo n’t succeed . ’”
The biggest underlying argument is that with the banks ’ other businesses so weak , they do n’t want to give up the one cash cow .
My fear is that whatever new restriction is placed on this weasel industry , whether we have to wait for new Federal Reserve regulations in 2010 or they are expedited , the evil minions at the banks will find a way around it .
This is the game they have long played .
I have seen their tricks in my own accounts , including that first one that Mr. Braddock granted me .
Lower the interest rate ?
They accelerate the repayment schedule , which means the customer has to pay just as much each month , resulting in lower repayment of interest as a share of the payment .
It reminds me of the way cigarette companies lower the tar content of cigarettes by perforating the paper .
The poor addict drags more often and harder , just to maintain the accustomed nicotine levels .
Or the time I paid my balance in full — thousands of dollars worth — when my interest rate was low , then used the card in an emergency , only to find that my rate had shot up to Tony Soprano levels .
Why ?
Because when I had paid my bill in full , they had n’t yet posted $ 6 in new interest charges , which went unpaid , and therefore I was now being charged at deadbeat levels .
Or , as Michael Corleone would put it , just when I thought I was out , they pulled me back in .

One Lone Ranger Rides Again To Legalize Dope
Howard Wooldridge has one of the craziest jobs : trying to convince 535 of the most uptight people in Washington - the entire membership of Congress - to legalize drugs .
That means everything from marijuana to cocaine to heroin .
The idea is n't quite as far - fetched as you may think .
The more money the United States spends on fighting a drug war that has spiraled out of control in Mexico , the more interest Congress seems to be taking in talk of decriminalization .
" For the first time since I 've been here , the " L " word , legalization , has been used in subcommittee hearings as a solution to the violence and Mexican cartels , " says Wooldridge , a cowboy and retired police detective who three years ago became the lobbyist for Law Enforcement Against Prohibition , known as LEAP .
A handful of lawmakers have endorsed legalization of marijuana , including Reps. Loretta Sanchez ( D - Calif. ) , Jim McDermott ( D - Wash . ) , Dana Rohrabacher ( R - Calif . ) and Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) .
Their group will likely remain small .
As Rohrabacher points out , drug legalization is n't politically palatable to a majority of House members who face reelection every two years .
" If it was a vote - a blind vote where nobody knew who was voting - you would have overwhelming support for legalizing marijuana out there , but they will never vote for it because they are afraid of taking on a controversial issue . "
LEAP is encouraged by the efforts of Sen. Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) , whose prison reform bill would explore the possibility of decriminalizing drug use .
Webb 's bill has a growing roster of bipartisan co-sponsors led by Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - Pa . ) .
Just yesterday on CNN , Webb signaled he'd be open to legalizing pot .
( " I think what we need to do is to put all the issues on the table .
If you go back to 1980 as a starting point , I think we had 40,000 people in prison on drug charges and today we have about a half a million of them .
A great majority of those are non-violent crimes , possession crimes or minor sales . " )
Wooldridge trots ( on foot ) around Capitol Hill in his signature cowboy hat and boots carrying the message that " the war on drugs is the most destructive , dysfunctional and immoral domestic policy since slavery and Jim Crow . "
He says the idea of ending " modern prohibition " is just beginning to penetrate as lawmakers grapple with a crumbling economy , a soaring deficit and tens of billions in U.S. tax dollars being spent on a seemingly endless drug war .
Though clearly , it is n't resonating with everyone .
Rep. Tom Latham ( R - Iowa ) recently labeled Wooldridge 's group of former law enforcement agents " probably a bunch of old potheads . "
Watch the video above , which chronicles a day in the life of the cowboy lobbyist , to see how Wooldridge dug in his spurs .
( And click here and here to see photos of Wooldridge riding his horse , Misty , on a cross-country mission to legalize drugs . )
SHANGHAI -- Tony
Yu grew rich helping build China into the world 's factory floor .
Over a decade , his small firm outfitted more than a thousand assembly lines with specialized equipment : pumps and pipes to sluice chemicals through high - tech plants .
Business was so good his biggest challenge was keeping up with manufacturers impatient to cut the ribbons on their next plant .
Mr. Yu poached engineers from rivals as he grew and acquired a mansion overlooking Shanghai 's fanciest golf course .
Now his order book is emptying .
China 's February exports fell nearly 26 % from a year before , the fourth in a series of worsening monthly declines .
The building boom in Chinese factories is over , and Mr. Yu is casting about for business ideas .
" We have ridden the wave of economic development in the last few years , " he says .
" We are at a loss as to what to do in the immediate future . "
His fate echoes a broader challenge for China itself .
The country has relied heavily for its often double - digit growth on a furious pace of investment in manufacturing .
More than 40 % of China 's gross domestic product traces to factory construction and other kinds of fixed - asset investment .
Contributing to this have been hundreds of thousands of bootstrap entrepreneurs like Mr. Yu who appeared from nowhere , helping the Chinese economy to multiply 14 - fold , adjusted for inflation , since 1980 .
Their bold dives into business -- dubbed xia hai , or " jump into the sea " -- and often unorthodox methods both thrilled and chilled the wider business community .
Tiny firms shocked global goliaths with aggressive cost- cutting and sometimes corner - cutting as well .
Pelosi tipped off to wiretap after intelligence mutiny John Byrne
Published : Thursday April 23 , 2009
Print This Email This House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) was told that a fellow Democratic congresswoman had been wiretapped because intelligence officials were irate that then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales had blocked a probe into the congresswoman 's involvement related to an Israeli espionage case , CQ's Jeff Stein revealed late Wednesday .
" In doing so , " Stein writes , " the officials flouted an order by Gonzales not to inform Pelosi , three former national security officials said . "
Rep. Jane Harman ( D - CA ) , then ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee , was caught on an FBI wiretap as part of an investigation into Israeli spying .
The wiretap transcript showed that she had spoken with an Israeli agent about threatening Pelosi with witholding campaign donations if she was n't named chairwoman of the intelligence committee .
It also appeared to show Harman agreeing to try to lobby the White House on behalf of two pro-Israeli lobbyists who had recently been charged in an espionage case .
Pelosi was tipped off to the FBI wiretap by " some intelligence official , " her spokesman Brendan Daly said Wednesday .
" She was notified that Harman had been overheard and that the target was someone else , " he added .
" It was n't a full - scale briefing . "
According to the CQ report , Alberto Gonzales dropped an investigation into Harman , telling CIA Director Porter Goss in 2005 that he " needed Jane 's help " in defending the soon - to - be - exposed warrantless wiretapping program .
" Frustrated and angry at Gonzales for aborting the investigation , intelligence officials let Pelosi know about the wiretap and its contents , according to three former national security officials , " Stein writes .
" She knew .
We made sure she knew , " one of the former officials was quoted as say , " chuckling " as he said it .
Harman was and has not been charged with any crime .
Officials have declined to comment on the matter , and Harman has called for the transcript of her call to be released .

We first profiled Summer Rayne Oakes in 2006 , introducing readers to a belly - baring , sludge - loving 22 - year - old with “ superhuman ambition ” and a moniker that was just too fitting to be made up .
Since then , Oakes has been a loyal friend to Grist ; she ’s done occasional fashion blogging for us , and she participated in one of our fundraising appeals .
Now , a month shy of her 25th birthday , she ’s almost too busy to breathe .
This spring saw the launch of a shoe line and a book , and she has spoken at venues ranging from the Fashion Institute of Technology to the Fair Trade Expo in Hong Kong .
Press coverage is exploding — her website gives just a taste — and an article in The New York Times mentioned her in the same breath as Al Gore .
Well , almost .
Despite this astonishing comet ride , Oakes seems to remain approachable , accessible , and down - to - earth — about as far from the stereotype of a fashion model as you can get .
Try as we might to find a reason not to engage in unabashed fawning , it ’s tough ; she works her photogenic butt off , and about the only dirt the web reveals is that she ’s occasionally Photoshopped .
Shocker !
In short , the ambitious Oakes is putting a good face on green .
To find out what the future holds , we fired a few questions her way .
Q. In April , you launched a shoe line with Payless .
Can you tell us a little bit about your work on the line , and why it ’s important to you to make sustainability affordable ?
A. Payless are incredible partners to work with because they are really into this .
They ’ve figured out how to democratize fashion in the footwear industry , with design partnerships like Lela Rose , Patricia Field and most recently with Project Runway ’s Christian Siriano .
But this is really the first step for them on the sustainability front .
This is also the first time they ’ve had a person come in both as the strategist and face for a brand , which is one of the things that I really love about my work .
You get to wear different hats and truly feel a part of something .
PaylessI ’ve been involved on a number of levels , including idea building and strategy , messaging , sourcing and design …
This is definitely not a flash - in - the - pan - brand .
We ’re building it into a lifestyle brand equipped with awareness campaigns , and it heartens us to see that it ’s selling really well just out of the gates .
That sends a message back to the company about what is important to consumers .
Believe me , we ’re listening !
I was just telling some environmental journalists the other day … that I love the fact that this brand touches so many different demographics .
I was chatting with some women from the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico who will be getting the brand in their hometowns in June and September , respectively .
They were so excited about what this brand was about .
This is the first time they were really hearing the term “ green ” and seeing something “ more sustainable , fashionable , and affordable . ”
I can equate it to the energy that Americans had in the green space back in 2006 , 2007 .
It ’s new , it ’s fresh , it ’s exciting , and most of all , it ’s within reach .
Q. Tell us about your book , which also debuted this spring , and what kind of reaction you ’re getting .
A. Style , Naturally is a global guide to sustainable fashion and beauty .
I wrote it for women who love style , but may not have “ green ” or “ environment ” in their lexicon .
It ’s all a part of my vision to keep the movement in a forward - moving direction .
I thought , why write another green book for green people ?
Why not make a style book that is invisibly green ?
For instance , my book is sold as a “ Lifestyle ” book , not a “ Green ” book , at Barnes & Noble .
I just went there the other day and saw it sitting next to Harper ’s Bazaar ‘s new book and The Lucky Style Guide .
That ’s exactly where it should be .
I ’m getting good feedback about the book from all over , but I ’m making a really big effort .
We ’ve launched it in ten countries — from Canada to the U.K. ; Singapore to Indonesia ; U.S. to Australia and New Zealand and many places in between — and I ’m making an effort to go to all those countries , not only to promote the book , but to really get a feel for what ’s happening on the ground there , see where the media and culture is on the environmental front , forge new alliances , and see what information I can bring back .
Q . Over the last couple of years , you ’ve gotten more prominent , even being mentioned as a back - up speaker for those who ca n’t swing Al Gore ’s fee .
What ’s that like , and what type of audience is your favorite ?
A. Yah , that was a real honor — you know , to be mentioned side - by - side to Al Gore ’s message .
And it ’s true , you know :
In this economy , it ’s hard to swing some of those speaker ’s fees now that attendance is down .
I ’ve spoken at a lot of venues — from the World Trade Organization to boards of advisors of fashion houses to green conferences — but I most like speaking to college students .
There is something about coming in to a group of students , who are about the same age , and just being real with them .
It ’s awesome that people have begun recognizing my work , but it ’s been a steady climb for me over all the years .
Almost like an ascent up a mountain where you can stop and catch your breath along the way ; enjoy being outdoors ; squint your eyes and see the summit ; and most important , look to the foothills and clearly see where you ’ve started .
I guess what I ’m trying to say is I ’ve never forgotten about where I ’ve come from and where I am going — and I think that is an important message to convey , especially to my peers .
Q . You ’ve said “ swapping is the new shopping ” — has that gotten you any flack from the fashion world ?
A. I think the fashion world has got bigger problems to worry about .
Q . What are some upcoming projects for you in the next year ?
A. Finishing up the book tour and travels , experiencing life a little , building a B2B and B2C sustainable design site , doing a soft launch for the a.d. schwarz label in the next few weeks , and heading out to Africa [ with them ] in the fall , trying to get a Pennsylvania Clean Energy Council off the ground , which is proving to be difficult due to lack of time , and gearing up later this year for some on - camera work with Planet Green .
I think that ’s enough .
My blood pressure just rose a few points after reading all this stuff over .
Q . What ’s one non -green habit you just ca n’t shake ?
A . Do you consider travel non-green ?
I project my carbon footprint for the year ( I know , a tad nerdy ) and calculate how many trees we ’ll plant in Mozambique at the Mezimbite Forest Centre , where the line a.d. schwarz is from .
The dedication , hard work and cordial relation we shared allowed us to not only complete within the target date ,
but also to have the opportunity to test the product much before the target date .
Our Management team takes pleasure in commending you on
this very first engagement with you for a job well done .
I often need to connect to a server with ssh from another server because I do n’t have direct access .
I even gave a small configuration example to use such jump hosts using ProxyCommand s.
A while ago , I got fed up to have to add new entries for each host I wanted to join with a jump server , especially when I only need these entries sporadicly , and decided to write a generic configuration .
I ended up with this setup :
Host *%* ProxyCommand ssh $ ( echo %h | cut -d % % - f1 ) nc - w1 $ ( echo %h | cut -d % % - f2 ) %p
The trick here is that you can use subshell expansions in a ProxyCommand .
So , when I ssh to “ host1 %host2 ” , the first subshell expansion returns “ host1 ” and the second “ host2 ” , this setup ends up being the equivalent of :
Host host1 % host2 ProxyCommand ssh host1 nc - w1 host2 %p
which is quite similar to the setup from my previous post .
Later on , I came up with an even more powerful implementation :
Host *%* ProxyCommand ssh $ ( echo %h | awk - F % % '{ OFS= " % % " ; NF --; print $ 0} ' ) nc $ ( echo %h | awk - F % % '{print $ NF} ' ) %p
Here , the first awk splits at the % characters and returns all fields except the last one , and the second awk returns only the last field .
As a consequence , ssh ing to “ host1 %host2%host3%host4 ” will have the first subshell expansion return “ host1%host2%host3 ” and the second “ host4 ” .
The setup will then be equivalent to :
Host host1 %host2%host3%host4 ProxyCommand ssh host1%host2%host3 nc -w1 host4 %p
The ssh in the ProxyCommand will , in turn , trigger the rule again so that the result is that host4 will be contacted from host3 , which is contacted from host2 that we contacted from host1 .
In the meanwhile , I decided % was not that nice a separator , and switched to using / , which also allows for a nicer setup with the same recursive effect :
Host */* ProxyCommand ssh $ ( dirname %h ) nc - w1 $ ( basename %h ) %p
Finally , since some remote hosts do n’t have nc installed , I usually copy it in my $ HOME on these servers and changed my setup to :
Host */* ProxyCommand ssh $ ( dirname %h ) PATH =.:\$ PATH nc - w1 $ ( basename %h ) %p
The main drawback of this method is that the more jump hosts you use , the more your ssh traffic is encapsulated ( recursively ) in other ssh traffic .
The advantage , though , is that you do n’t need to forward an agent onto untrusted servers to use ssh key authentication on any of the jump or final servers , nor to forward X11 or tunnel multiple times .

For years , a majority of Iraqis have just wanted the Americans to leave .
As of June 30 , urban Iraqis will likely get their wish .
But let ’s step back for a moment and think about why some Iraqis , particularly in the Sunni areas , may be having second thoughts , and why others , their lives blistered over with varying degrees of dismal circumstances , are too depleted to engage in the hearty sendoff they ’ve always dreamed of .
As many reports " from the ground " now reveal , the dirty little secret of American withdrawal from Iraq is that for many Iraqis , their world looks uncomfortably like the one the U.S. delivered them from in 2003 , particularly in terms of corruption and greed – in the central government and police – and a substandard quality of life caused by unemployment and deteriorating infrastructure .
After more than six years of fighting and nearly a trillion dollars spent " to free the Iraqi people " – as exclaimed by invading President George W. Bush in 2003 – we find Iraqis in places like Anbar province fearing their new freedom could come at too high a cost .
" We feel many bad things are coming , " said Kareem Arak , head of the North Ramadi city council , in a recent Associated Press report .
Raheem Kalaaf Mohammed , vice president of the council , shares his friend ’s dire prediction .
" We feel there will be disaster here . "
Among other security concerns , such as the increasing suicide bomb attacks against security forces throughout Anbar , local business leaders in Ramadi fear a " wave of corruption " and charge the local police with stealing from their stores .
And that ’s not all they ’re accused of doing .
The London Times produced a disturbing piece on April 24 indicating that Saddam - era tactics are alive and well throughout the Sunni and Shia - led police and security forces in the very cities slated for U.S. withdrawal in June .
" In this vast and largely unaccountable security apparatus , with almost a million people in uniform , corruption is rife , " writer James Hider intones after telling this horrific story : " A young woman , evidently drugged , vomiting and occasionally calling for her mother , tries weakly to stop the grinning man in a white T - shirt and boxer shorts from pulling off her underwear . "
She is raped .
Her rapist and his accomplice , who shot the whole thing with the camera on his cell phone , are Ramadi police officers , according to the victim .
The accused rapist , being the nephew of a senior police officer , was held briefly before " mysteriously " freed , fleeing possibly to Syria .
The girl ’s fate , her family name now sullied by the rape , was much worse , as it was suggested to Hider by a government official that she was later the victim of a family honor killing .
No surprise , then , that when the group of businessmen in Ramadi was told by a U.S. officer that " very soon , there wo n’t be any Marines coming here , " there were " murmurs of dismay " in response .
Granted , these minority Sunnis have never been keen on the Americans leaving , but their reasons now are clear enough : two years ago , al - Qaeda bloodied the streets , targeting their local tribesmen who were standing in line to join the police .
Now , al - Qaeda is largely gone , and it ’s the police who are doing the terrorizing .
Fear and Loathing in Baghdad
Miles away in Baghdad , the corruption is blatant and somewhat more complicated , tied in with Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s Shia -led government .
Formally oppressed , these Shia knew well the cruel fist of Saddam ’s Ba’athist henchmen .
But the corruption today , alleged in emerging , scattered reports , looks eerily familiar – from men being yanked off the street , beaten , detained , and bribed for their last dime , to kidnappings , rape , and even assassinations .
Now add the worst thing imaginable : the selling and exploitation of Iraqi children .
" MPs and American officials now believe that they [ security forces ] are often a law unto themselves , " writes Hider , " admired when they defeat terrorists but also feared for their widespread abuse of power . "
According to an April report in Time , corruption within the security forces " is enabling [ sex ] traffickers to operate with impunity , " in that traffickers have established relationships with the local police .
Girls and women are sold into prostitution by their families , and in some incredible cases , prostitutes who escape are returned right to their brothels – by police .
Meanwhile , children are being sold to adoptive parents , or worse , pedophiles , outside of Iraq – with the cover provided by corrupt government officials , reports allege .
The Guardian recently reported that scores of Iraqi children were being abducted from poor Iraqis and spirited off to foreign buyers by as many as 12 criminal gangs operating within the country .
In this case , underpaid bureaucrats taking bribes and falsifying documents are making these unspeakable crimes happen .
As in Anbar , there is an acute tension in Baghdad , in part over fears that when the Americans eventually pull out , this perfect storm of bureaucratic corruption , police brutality , and the growing cancer of mistrust between the ruling Shia and the Sunni Awakening Councils that helped to sideline al - Qaeda will tear asunder any remaining hope for healing this scarred city .
Maliki ’s government has promised to absorb into the government many of the former Sunni insurgents ( also known as the " Sons of Iraq " ) now securing walled Sunni neighborhoods and communities beyond Baghdad .
After months of red tape , some 90,000 fighters were given a paycheck in April .
Tensions had already reached a critical pitch when the Iraqi army arrested Adel Mashadani , the Awakening Council leader in Baghdad ’s Sunni Fadhil district , on March 28 .
U.S. forces aided in his arrest and the detention of several other Awakening members in Fadhil .
A statement was issued afterward insisting that Mashadani had been targeted for committing crimes – like involvement in sectarian violence and extorting more than $ 160,000 from neighborhood residents – not for his status as an Awakening Council leader .
But Maliki ’s mistrust of the Awakening Council movement is well known , and many fear this was just the opening salvo in an effort to bring about its ultimate demise .
Meanwhile , Iraq ’s interior minister , Jawad al - Bolani , recently claimed in an American press op - ed , " We ’ve tackled corruption by firing 62,000 employees and begun to dismantle sectarianism by prohibiting all political activity by police officers and creating a force made up of all Iraqis — Shia , Sunni , and Kurd . "
What to believe ?
As of March , when Bolani ’s op - ed was published , only 5,000 Sons of Iraq had been hired by Maliki ’s government , according to reports , and the tales of corruption continue to confuse Bolani ’s hopeful spin .
Who ’s to Blame ?
That the police have become so corrupt is no surprise to people who saw how they were trained and managed from the beginning .
Details of the initial dismantling of the Ba’athist police after the fall of Saddam in 2003 and the unsuccessful scramble to replace them have been well documented .
Considering the whole of the post - invasion catastrophe , it is no surprise that the blame has been largely placed on poor planning and execution by American policymakers .
While former New York police commissioner Bernard Kerik was parachuted into the country as interim interior minister and police trainer in 2003 , Shia militias began taking over the fledgling police force to become , as researcher Robert Perito described it as recently as 2007 , " a patchwork organization of commando - style , counter - insurgency units [ that ] harbors sectarian death squads . "
Kerik , who told the New York Times in 2006 that he was so unprepared he watched A&E Network documentaries beforehand to learn about Saddam Hussein , was a " waste of time and effort , " charged retired Lt. Gen.
Ricardo Sanchez , former commander of U.S. forces in Iraq , in a 2008 interview .
The loss of time putting a minor celebrity – Kerik had been celebrated for his police work following the 9/11 attacks in New York – into the role of creating an entire police force out of whole cloth cost the country dearly .
Even today , people complain that Maliki has merely reduced the number of militias operating within the system down to one – his own .
Meanwhile , in places like Ramadi , former Sunni militiamen - turned - police have seemingly picked up where their Ba’athist predecessors left off .
As Perito wrote , the police under Saddam were " poorly trained and equipped , badly led , and underpaid … notorious for brutality and corruption . "
How much has changed ?
As always , U.S. military officials must convey a sense of evolution in these matters so that their long years in Iraq wo n’t seem so futile .
" [ T ] hey ’re trying .
They ’re trying to move forward , " said Maj .
Joseph A. Musacchia , chief of security forces , commander of the 81st Security Forces Squadron , in a teleconference with bloggers on April 17 [ .pdf ] .
" They ’re trying to get to that point to where they can make up a gap of almost 100 years of police evolving .
You know , they ca n’t go from Barney Fife to CHIPS overnight , " he told listeners .
Why not – did n’t President Bush promise as much for the Iraqi people when he invaded ?
The dream of such a turnaround has become a daily nightmare for many Iraqis , particularly city residents who anticipate the fresh vulnerabilities when U.S. forces finally decamp .
As Baghdad - born director Ghaith Abdul - Ahad asked in his dark and striking 2008 - 09 video series , Baghdad : City of Walls , " What will be left for the next generation when the Americans leave ? "
Hopefully , not just a mirror to the past .
An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Guardian : " The majority of them use the drop valve system , which sits at the bottom of the cistern and opens to allow the water to flow out when the flush is pressed , " reports The Guardian .
" Debris and other issues can cause the mechanism to fail to close , meaning water continually flows from the cistern and into the bowl . "
" Older cisterns tend to use a siphon system , which works by pushing water upwards until it reaches a point at which it can flow into the bowl .
Because that point is above the waterline when the toilet is not being flushed , the system is less likely to develop the same sort of leak . "
Jason Parker , the managing director of Thomas Dudley Ltd , one of the UK 's largest plumbing manufacturers , told the BBC : " If we 're serious about wasting water and we want to stop it , the only way to do that is put a siphon back in . "

The Gamasutra 20 : Top Game Writers
By Bonnie Ruberg
[ Continuing the ' Gamasutra 20 ' series , the editors of Gamasutra and Game Developer magazine are proud to name and profile a score of the world 's top game writers and story crafters , from Levine to Schafer and far beyond . ]
Often overlooked as a crucial part of the development process , writers are the unsung creative heroes of the video game industry .
Combining their knowledge of the written word with a knack for the interactive , game writers fill a space that 's integral to the artistic future of games , and yet still very loosely defined .
There is no one typical experience for a game writer .
Everyone does things a little differently .
Some focus on dialogue , some on story arcs , some on character development .
Some have complete control over the path of a game , while others are brought in to consult on and add to a project already underway .
However , there is one thing all game writers have in common : they help inject a hint of the real -- of the believable and the personal -- to an unreal environment .
They 're craftspeople of the new fiction .
This list , made up of those we consider to be 20 of the top game writers working in the industry today , is by no means an exhaustive account of all the writers who have or are currently breaking ground in the field .
The list is also not ranked , and only includes writers with recent , predominantly ' published or prominent in the last 12 - 18 months ' work in the game industry - it's not meant to be an ' all - time ' best list .
With that said , we have made a conscious effort to include writers from around the world -- including North America , Europe , and Japan -- as well as those whose work falls in very different genres and who come from a variety of experience backgrounds .
In addition to information about their work , the way they approach game writing , and what makes them stand out from the crowd , we 've also provided you with commentary from the Gamasutra and Game Developer magazine staff on what makes each of these game writers great .
Chris Avellone
Creative Lead and Co-Owner , Obsidian Entertainment
Notable projects
Planescape : Torment , Fallout 2 , Knights of the Old Republic II : The Sith Lords
Project focus
Currently the creative lead at Obsidian Entertainment , Chris Avellone got his start writing stories and scripts for pen and paper role - playing games .
He moved on to writing game - related books and comics before starting a career in video game design .
In his role at Obsidian , a studio he helped found in 2003 , he contributes heavily to story development .
As lead designer of Knights of the Old Republic II : the Sith Lords , for example , Avellone was responsible for the game 's overarching storyline and scripting .
What stands out
Avellone 's background in RPGs as well as his history of perseverance in the face of canceled games gives him a unique perspective and determination that makes itself clear in his writing .
His 1999 Planescape : Torment is still considered by some to be one of the greatest RPGs ever released .
Even a decade ago , Avellone was innovating with his radical emphasis on text and exposition , key writerly elements that have made his work stand out in the industry .
Our take
" When working with such vast and shambling properties as Dungeons & Dragons or Star Wars , an individual writer 's voice could easily get lost behind the accumulated lore that has built up over many years of overlapping narratives .
Chris Avellone neatly dodges that trap by always emphasizing his characters ' personalities and relationships over back story .
Avellone also understands that dice rolling is the least interesting aspect of role - playing , and in his work , typical " gameplay " activities are often subordinate to character interactions .
While his upcoming Alpha Protocol will undoubtedly have some entertaining action , the real pleasure in the game will come from getting to know the many personalities inhabiting it . "

Richard Dansky
Manager of Design , Red Storm Entertainment
Central Clancy Writer , Ubisoft
Notable projects
Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell , Tom Clancy 's Rainbow Six , Far Cry
Project focus
Formerly a developer with White Wolf studios , Richard Dansky now works as a game writer for both Red Storm Entertainment and its parent company , Ubisoft .
A fiction author with a flare for horror , Dansky has also contributed to over 130 role - playing books from White Wolf .
In addition to writing over a dozen games for Ubisoft -- most notably the games in the Tom Clancy series , for which he holds the title of Central Writer -- Dansky is the co-author of an instructional book on writing for games , Game Writing : Narrative Skills for Video Games .
He also holds an executive chair on the International Game Developers Association 's Writers Special Interest Group .
Dansky has gone on record about how much he enjoys one particular element of game writing : composing believable dialogue for bad guys -- like the guards in Far Cry some of his players found too realistic to kill .
What stands out
With extensive experience as a writer of fiction and manuals , the sheer volume of Dansky 's gives him an impressive basis from which to approach games .
Perhaps it should n't be surprising then that his Tom Clancy series is on of the most consistently praised in video games -- a series not coincidentally also inspired by books .
Of course , what really shines is his believable dialogue , which could even conjure sympathy in a player coming in for the kill : no easy feat .
Our take
" Dansky 's credits are n't best known for their writing , but his firm hand has helped steer a number of projects into the clear -- with a reputation among game writers as being something of a professional " fixer " .
He 's a mentor to writers online and in discussions , and enjoys running writing workshops and advocating for better storytelling -- in short , his reputation extends beyond the obvious into behind - the - scenes movement that 's just as critical to improving the stories in games . "

Tom Abernathy
Writer , Microsoft Game Studios
Notable projects
Heavy Gear , Destroy All Humans ! , Saboteur
Project focus
Tom Abernathy was n't always a game writer .
His diverse background has given him experience in acting , filmmaking , even composing .
He has an MFA in film production , so it makes sense that he got his start in video games writing cut scenes for Activision 's Heavy Gear .
Later he became the Senior Writer / Designer for Pandemic Studios where he received awards for his work on Destroy All Humans !
Often handed projects in progress , Abernathy takes his scriptwriting work beyond simply rewriting designer dialogue , infusing his unique sense of humor into his projects and giving them a creative flair through writing .
What stands out
Abernathy brings something to game writing tables other members of the game development process may overlook : tone .
By emphasizing the importance of tone -- adding , for example , satire and wit to an already outrageous game like Destroy All Humans ! -- he offers a tinge of irony to his games that make them unique , and uniquely fun .
Our take
" One reason to applaud Abernathy is for doing something that is rarely attempted in games and even more rarely succeeded at : satire .
The original Destroy All Humans !
games blended off - the - wall humor with social critique and were the better for it .
He 's also a champion of meeting design in the middle , which is the true way forward for writing in games , while maintaining filmic standards for narrative -- knowing when to compromise and when not to is a crucial distinction . "

Patrick Redding
Game / Narrative Designer , Ubisoft Montreal
Notable projects
Far Cry 2
Project focus
Most recently as part of a team of writers who worked on Ubisoft Montreal 's groundbreaking Far Cry 2 , Patrick Redding has spent the last four years of his career focusing on story design , narrative systems , and scripted events .
Previously the creative director at Vancouver - based studio Blast Radius , where he produced web and video for clients such as Nintendo , Sony , EA and Activision , Redding has over fifteen years of experience in interactive media , including a background in graphic design , advertising , and filmmaking .
Those past projects help color his work in video game writing today .
As part of the Far Cry 2 team , for example , he oversaw what he describes as an ambitious dynamic story architecture that emphasizes the player 's ability to drive the narrative .
What stands out
Not content to perfect the craft of game writing as we currently know it , Redding has strongly advocated a new approach to presenting narratives in games .
Specifically , he wants to see a " systemic , " not a scripted narrative , one that gives the player ownership of the story through the game 's " low - level inputs . "
He told Gamasutra in an interview , " My job is to kind of enforce the notion that the most important story in any game , honestly , is the story that the player can actually play . "
This focus means Redding has to be uniquely equipped to keep his eye on both the big picture and the little details his projects : both the narrative arc , and the minute - to - minute experience of the player .
Our take
" Patrick Redding 's development role of " narrative designer " attempts to create a role that deals with story in a way more native to game development , by merging design and writing .
Though at times it can be dense and inaccessible , Far Cry 2 seamlessly weaves together its strings of assignments based on the player 's initial character selection and mission choices .
Solving the problem of creating a dynamic or adaptive narrative has been attempted by countless designers and discussed in countless GDC sessions , and Redding hopes that Ubisoft Montreal may be able to expand on the groundwork laid in Far Cry 2 to eventually reach that goal . "

Erik Wolpaw
Writer , Valve
Notable projects
Psychonauts , Portal
Project focus
Eric Wolpaw is a relative newcomer to the game writing scene .
Previously a game journalist and freelance writer , he has worked with Double Fine Productions on their acclaimed title Psychonauts , and then joined Valve and worked on projects including leading writing for Portal , which won the Game Developers Choice Award for best writing in 2006 .
Wolpaw describes his own turbulent childhood as the " inauspicious start " that gave him the dark sense of humor he 's putting to use in award - winning games today .
For him , game writing is like being " the MC at a strip club " -- someone who has to step up in between moments of action ( i.e. video game play time ) and make moments of waiting ( i.e. cutscenes ) actually entertaining .
Needless to say , it 's a tough gig .
What stands out
Wolpaw 's humor is what makes him stand out -- and it's also what made the now classic Portal so uniquely effective .
While Wolpaw might not be able to take responsibility for Portal 's innovative gameplay , he certainly shaped the game 's irreverent , funny , eerily endearing voice .
Without that , it would have been an excellent game , but hardly the cult favorite we know today .
Our take
" The narrative component of Portal is something of an achievement in game writing .
It consists almost entirely of the disembodied voice of one character for the course of the entire game , and it couples tightly with the pacing and gameplay throughout .
But all its formal uniqueness would be meaningless were it not one of the most consistently clever and hilarious -- not to mention faintly disturbing -- game scripts ever written .
In some ways , Wolpaw 's writing feels like a throwback to 90s - era PC adventure game writing in the vein of his Psychonauts co-writer Tim Schafer , the best of which frequently used humor as a vehicle to deliver seriously compelling narrative -- but the execution here is thoroughly progressive and unusual .
It would probably be extremely influential if it did n't seem too difficult to pull off . "

Drew Karpyshyn
Lead Writer , BioWare
Notable projects
Mass Effect , Star Wars : Knights of the Old Republic , Jade Empire , Neverwinter Nights
Project focus
A writer who has worn many hats within his trade , Drew Karpyshyn got his start as a game designer at Wizards of the Coast , but soon moved on to composing novels and games .
The lead writer on the 2007 hit Mass Effect , as well as the author of the Mass Effect novels , Karpyshyn contributes to story writing , scenario , and dialogue .
He was also the lead on Star Wars : Knights of the Old Republic , and , similarly , wrote Star Wars novels .
What stands out
Karpyshyn's experience working with longer form narratives makes itself apparent in the intricacy of projects like Mass Effect .
This game in particular took a number of commendable risks when it came to including content -- like the potential for a lesbian love side story .
Few other writers have dared to be as all - encompassing and unbiased when representing characters and their actions in contemporary games .
Our take
" Drew Karpyshyn 's work on Mass Effect reminds us that well - developed characters are not motivated solely by a collection of personal wants and needs .
They are also moved in subtle ways by the deeper currents of history , faith , and blood .
His efforts at constructing the detailed universe of Mass Effect -- a universe that is larger and more ancient than humanity 's experience -- helps us to better identify with our character 's struggle for respect as she navigates the densities of its various cultures . "

Ken Levine
President and Creative Director , 2 K Boston
Notable projects
BioShock , System Shock 2
Project focus
As the president and creative director of the studio 2 K Boston , Ken Levine is able to take a much more wide - sweeping creative approach to the games he works on than other writers who work specifically with dialogue or scenario .
Previously employed at Looking Glass Studios , Levine is most famous for his work on the critically acclaimed 2007 release BioShock , for which , while collaborating with fellow game writers like Susan O'Connor , he played a very significant narrative role .
He has gone on record as crediting his otherwise " useless liberal arts degree " with leading him to works of literature like those written by Ayn Ran and George Orwell -- works which greatly influenced the tone and message of BioShock .
What stands out
In BioShock , Levine was able to offer to the gaming community a title that more closely resembled a piece of literature -- the meaning of each bit of its content carefully thought out -- than arguably any we had seen before .
His unique approach gives new , revitalizing life to genres like the first - person shooter , infusing them with his analytical , liberal arts mindset , and making them all the more interesting for us .
Our take
" When I asked a fairly casual gamer friend of mine , who rarely plays the big holiday season blockbusters , why he enjoyed BioShock so much , he answered , " I loved the art deco style , and I loved that it actually had an agenda . "
Video game stories tend to be obsessively plot - driven , but BioShock 's narrative was gripping ( and particularly unique for the medium ) in part because it put so much effort into exploring an idea -- and an ideal .
The game tries to tell you something , and to give you something to consider , beyond the more common game themes dealing with warfare , espionage operations , ancient evil , and urban crime .
The fact that the game was so well - received by the gaming public suggests that Levine and his team were on the right track . "

Kazushige Nojima
Freelance Game Scenario Writer
Notable projects
Final Fantasy series , Kingdom Hearts series
Project focus
Kazushige Nojima is most famous for his work as a game scenario writer for monumental series like Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts -- some of the best - loved in all of video game fandom .
He worked for Final Fantasy developer Square Enix until 2003 , when he left to become a freelance game scenario writer and found his own company , Stellavista .
These days , he 's still working on big - name projects , including games for Square Enix and , recently , the Nintendo fan hit Smash Bros .
Brawl , as well as penning the scenario for the upcoming Final Fantasy XIII .
What stands out
Nojima is a noted name in game writing -- indeed , in all of video game development -- for good reason .
His work on Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts games has helped produce some of the most classic , most long - lasting series in video game culture .
What makes them unique : the complexity and emotionality of the narrative and character threads that can be traced from game to game , and the scenarios that bring players back .
This is what Nojima has to offer , and it's a rare gift .
Our take
" Though Nojima 's stories often become overly convoluted , they always have functioning internal logic that sees them through -- and , of course , he 's responsible for giving a personality to some of the most iconic characters in gaming .
Unafraid to tell a love story in gaming , Nojima takes stories from adrenaline - soaked battlefields to tender , more personal moments , and back again , with ease and grace .
A list of memorable moments that has come from the games he 's worked on is far too long to attempt here .
But with work ranging from Smash Bros. to Final Fantasy , he has established himself as one of the strongest and most widely - consumed voices in the industry . "

Marc Laidlaw
Writer , Valve
Notable projects
Half - Life , Half - Life 2
Project focus
Marc Laidlaw is no stranger to weird fiction , and that 's nowhere more evident than in his creative work on Half - Life and Half - Life 2 .
The author of multiple novels , Laidlaw has experience as a science fiction and horror writer .
Before joining Valve as a staffer , he was the sole writer on the Half - Life games .
It was even further back , in 1997 , when he began his first forays in elements of game design .
These days , he works hand - in - hand with a team of fellow writers ( which he refers to as his " literary posse " ) on Half - Life 2 episodic content .
What stands out
Laidlaw 's experience as a horror and science fiction author colors his work in a unique light that makes it stand out from other first - person shooters .
What other writer could give us a dystopian future setting filled with head crab zombies and explored by -- of all people -- a scientist ?
These strange gifts from Laidlaw have entered the general gaming mythos , leaving us to wonder where we'd be , for example , without creatures who threatened to suck our brains while riding our heads like deadly crustacean hats .
Our take
" The success of Marc Laidlaw 's work on the Half - Life series demonstrates the creative gains that the game industry can enjoy when it embraces voices outside of its own insular world .
As an author with a talent for writing anarchic science fiction ( see the 1989 anthology Semiotext (e ) SF for an object lesson in dangerous writing from a variety of authors , including Laidlaw ) he brought a subversive edge to Valve 's shooters .
Neesless to say , his talents resulted in a story that resonated with players long after the gunfire was over . "

Emil Pagliarulo
Lead Designer , Bethesda Software
Notable projects
Fallout 3 , Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion , Thief 2 : The Metal Age
Project focus
Though he has gotten a lot of attention recently as both the lead designer and the writer on the much - anticipated Fallout 3 , Emil Pagliarulo spent several years as a journalist before joining Looking Glass Studios as a level designer .
There , he contributed to Thief Gold and served as a designer on Thief 2 : The Metal Age .
He followed the Thief series to Ion Storm in Austin and continued to work as a senior designer on Thief : Deadly Shadows .
For the past several years , however , Pagliarulo has been at Bethesda Game Studios , where he served as a senior designer on the Bloodmoon expansion to Morrowind , and the Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion , on which he was responsible for the Dark Brotherhood and Arena quest lines .
While it may sound like Pagliarulo has more experience as a game designer than as a game writer , it 's important to remember his time in non-fiction before entering the game industry .
Culminating with his work on Fallout 3 , he 's returning to writing and combining it with his newer craft : video games .
What stands out
Pagliarulo has clearly brought to Fallout 3 a solid combination of writerly and gaming mentalities .
The game combines a familiar landscape -- a post - apocalyptic wasteland of society -- with elements normally found in a novel , like a cast of believable if minor characters and details that make this world , far from cliché , colorful and alive .
Our take
" Pagliarulo disproves that old theory that game designers should n't write their own games .
That adage only holds true when the designer is n't a good writer to begin with .
Though " game journalist " certainly does n't translate to " good writer " in a one - to - one ratio , it does indicate an interest in writing .
And it does n't hurt that after writing what many thought was the best part of Oblivion , the company saw fit to let him lead the charge in Fallout 3 .
The dialog here is relatively consistent , with impressively nuanced trees and choices that feel important within the game world .
Pagliarulo gets my vote for most ambitious game writer of 2008 . "

Dan Houser
Vice President of Creativity , Rockstar Games
Notable projects
Grand Theft Auto IV , Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas , Grand Theft Auto III
Project focus
One of the two infamous British brothers behind not only Rockstar Games , but also its most successful and controversial series , Grand Theft Auto , Dan Houser is the writing half of the equation .
Perhaps not surprisingly , given the cinematic quality of Grand Theft Auto IV , Houser has gone on record as calling himself more of a movie fan than a video game fan : someone who focuses on using his writing to make his games give players an experience similar to watching film .
He is n't making this all up , though .
Not content to make small games -- or mediocre ones -- Houser did tireless research for GTA IV , obsessively exploring the New York City area .
The result : the game 's pedestrians have 660 speaking parts with 80,000 lines of dialogue ( yes , 80,000 ! ) alone .
What stands out
Houser makes no bones about it : he wants to be groundbreaking .
That Houser and Rockstar are doing something different in the industry is obvious from their unapologetic approach to controversy .
But it 's also obvious from the impressive scope of their latest Grand Theft Auto game , which many critics have speculated may bring us as close as we 've yet come to combining video games and art .
Though he may have once wanted to be a rock star himself , these days Houser pushes attention away from himself and onto the world he creates in his games .
Our take
" The Grand Theft Auto games tend to be characterized by a strange blend of both reverence and revulsion for American culture , from the Miami neon 1980s caricature of Vice City to the subtle pang of immigrant desperation in GTA IV .
Though the games ' themes and stories draw ire from parents groups and social right - wingers so easily you'd think they solicited it deliberately , the true signature here is n't the way these narratives have drawn exaggerated comparisons to classic film drama .
Rather , it 's how beneath the games ' ludicrous talk radio , unapologetic violence and exaggeratedly vile casts of characters lurks surprisingly shrewd and uncomfortably truthful social commentary . "

Jerry Holkins
Writer , Penny Arcade
Notable projects
On the Rain - Slick Precipice of Darkness
Project focus
Most famous for his work as the writer of the game web comic Penny Arcade , which has spawned in recent years the now enormous fan event Penny Arcade Expo , Holkins also writes about games on the Penny Arcade blog .
In both forms he gives insightful -- and funny -- responses to the video games and the industry , leaving no one safe from a little playful ridicule .
However , Holkins put himself in the hot seat when he became the writer on the Penny Arcade adventure RPG game , On the Rain - Slick Precipice of Darkness .
Following in the tradition of old - school adventure games ,
On the Rain - Slick Precipice of Darkness , which talks the same facetious , succinct tone as the Penny Arcade comics , was released this year on PC , Xbox 360 , and PlayStation 3 .
What stands out
Holkins ' strong point -- whether he 's writing a comic , blogging , or working on a game -- has always been to bring intelligent humor to the video game community .
In the same way , Holkins is bringing that humor to his games themselves , injecting the old - school adventure experience with a little bit of that Penny Arcade snark , and reminding us that game writing in and of itself can be entertaining -- it does n't have to be just a means to an end .
Our take
" I find Holkins ' strength to be his imaginative wordplay , and juxtaposition and combinations of terms .
His skill with the metaphor is unparalleled in game writing ( an odd statement , but a true one ) , and he will waste no opportunity to add a clever turn of phrase , and a double ( or triple ) entendre .
Through the keyboard of another writer , this could be profoundly obnoxious , but Holkins does it with a certain humility and a wink toward the viewer .
He 's letting you in on the joke , not showing you how smart he is .
I can only hope that this is the beginning of his game writing career , and that he tries his hand at properties that are not his own . "

Hideo Kojima
Head , Kojima Productions
Notable projects
Metal Gear Solid 2 , Metal Gear Solid 3 , Metal Gear Solid 4
Project focus
Kojima broke into the video game world with his first title , Metal Gear , in 1987 , which became a hit for Konami not least because of its military / espionage theme , which meshed well with the movies of the decade .
Since then , he has branched out to form his own company , Kojima Productions , and brought his series to a crescendo with this year 's Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots .
Consistently considered one of the most influential and important personalities in game design for his work on the Metal Gear Solid series , Kojima has also turned his pen to other little - known but highly - praised narrative games such as Snatcher and Policenauts .
These are games that may not have made a splash in the west , but which successfully brought mature and complicated narrative to the medium years before it was widely attempted by console developers on this side of the Pacific .
What stands out
As a series , Metal Gear is a staple among video games , one that 's helped define the genre of stealth action .
What makes it most memorable , though , surprisingly enough , is n't its sneaky challenges ; it 's the characters -- like Solid Snake , of course -- as well as its strange bursts of humor and its byzantine plot twists .
A favorite character among fans , Snake stands on his own as a character whose history and experiences a huge number of gamers have followed reverently over the years .
Kojima , the man who made Snake , has the craft and skill to fill each game with enough unanswered questions to leave us wanting more .
Our take
" In the Metal Gear Solid series , Hideo Kojima has presented a decade of nesting metaphors , parallel symbols and cyclical in - jokes in such a dense , even convoluted , fashion that audiences are polarized .
In fact , some are just as fatigued and perplexed as they are helplessly fond of the enduring themes the director 's so carefully crafted .
But despite the inimitable , distinctive quirks , in Kojima video games might have their first true postmodernist .
Simply , his stories offer a degree of complexity and sophistication virtually unprecedented in video games . "

Jonathan Blow
Founder , Number None
Notable projects
Braid
Project focus
With a notable background in experimental game design , Jonathan Blow has won the hearts of the video game community with his simple but beautiful 2D platformer Braid , released at the end of summer 2008 .
The host of the Experimental Gameplay Workshop at the annual Game Developers Conference , a longtime columnist for Game Developer Magazine , and a regular participant in the Indie Game Jam , Blow has for years been presenting the new ideas of others to the world .
Now he has presented his own , and the results are stunning -- such as when Braid won the Innovation in Game Design Award at the 2006 Independent Games Festival .
Blow 's team for the game , like the game itself , was modestly small , giving him creative control over gameplay and written aspects simultaneously , while others helped with aspects like art and music .
Braid is therefore predictably a very well - integrated game , the result of an artistic vision executed by game designer , level developer , and game writer all in one .
What stands out
Braid , which so impressed the game community when it came out earlier this August , uses text in a way less like traditional video games and more like a work of literature .
This leaves the player to find the story , read the comments left by its author , and decide what it means for himself .
Our take
" Before releasing Braid , outspoken independent developer Jonathan Blow developed a reputation for himself by challenging -- vocally and often -- the standard narrative conventions of video games .
Although plenty of Braid 's story is told in dreamlike written interludes between levels of playtime , the predominant mode of storytelling is the unfolding of the game 's environments alongside the time - bending gameplay .
Critics continue to debate whether Blow served his own ideals by dividing static text from gameplay narrative the way he did .
But the result of his work not only motivated a new depth of discussion around game stories , but compelled players and thinkers alike to seek their own conclusions to Braid 's tale . "

Susan O'Connor has been writing for games since 1998 , and is now recognized as one of the most original and influential game writers currently working in the industry .
Over the last ten years , she has written for more than 20 titles in a variety of genres , from first - person shooters to action - adventure games .
Her clients have included companies like Activision , Midway , and Microsoft Game Studios .
In 2005 , she founded the Game Writers Conference , now part of Austin GDC .
As a freelancer who joins other companies on specific projects , she has filled many of the game writer 's roles -- changing her approach as her games change , but always paying careful attention to the importance of craft .
What stands out
With her attention to creative , quality game writing , O'Connor has re-infused mainstream , blockbuster games with the energy of her art .
The games she has worked on , including most recently Far Cry 2 and BioShock , have been major examples of innovative storytelling , pushing the boundaries of game content and the line between mainstream gaming and art .
O'Connor also stands out for being a game writer 's game writer , sticking up for the craft and spreading the word about words in video games .
Our take
" O'Connor 's approach to writing is to create believability , in the most unbelievable of situations .
While Far Cry 2 , BioShock and Gears of War are games that , to put it mildly , have varying levels of plausibility , they all have veracity .
Like it or not , Gears of War 's beefy banter set the tone for a generation of fist - bumping bro heroes ; Far Cry 2 takes things the opposite direction , filling a difficult world with realistically desperate characters . "

Jesse Stern
Writer and Co-producer , CBS's " NCIS "
Notable projects
Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare
Project focus
Strictly speaking , Jesse Stern is more a television and movie writer than a game writer .
It was his recent work on Call of Duty 4 : Modern Warfare for Infinity Ward that marked his first foray into the video game world .
Previously known for his work on films like the 2003 hit Monster , for which he served as executive story editor , Stern is , by day , a writer and co-producer for CBS 's television drama , NCIS ( Naval Criminal Investigative Service ) .
He 's admitted in interviews though that , while he got caught up in television writing , he 's always been a hardcore gamer at heart .
What was his process like for Call of Duty 4 ?
Infinity Ward came to him with a story outline in mind , but it was his job to figure out how to best tell the story at hand .
The script for the game was a joint effort between writers , but Stern was in charge of making decisions .
Though he was n't particularly involved in the mechanics or gameplay aspects of development , Stern did strive to bring a cinematic quality to the game , a crossover from his normal work on screens big and small .
What stands out
Stern brings not only his talents as a writer to Call of Duty 4 but also his refreshing break from the industry and the clichés of the series .
Unlike previous Call of Duty games , which are set in historical World War II , this one does as it name suggests and breaks away , placing players in a modern setting -- facing more morally complicated scenarios .
It 's clear Stern combined the modern approach he 's accustomed to in a show like NCIS with an established game model to create a title that received considerable praise when it came out in 2007 .
Our take
" Call of Duty 4 took the idea of " blockbuster videogame , " in the sense that movies are blockbusters , and realized that concept .
Where most games that draw from action movies or military epics have the most inane dialog possible , Jesse Stern 's was remarkably inoffensive -- even for a pacifist like myself .
The way the dialog was integrated into the narrative and overall structure was extremely smooth , and remains one of the best - implemented game stories in recent memory , for my money . "

Sohei Niikawa
Producer , Nippon Ichi Software
Notable projects
Disgaea : Hour of Darkness , Disaea 2 : Cursed Memories , Disgaea 3 : Absence of Justice
Project focus
Sohei Niikawa entered Nippon Ichi Software in April 1995 as a staffer in marketing and sales , but soon took on the role of scenario writer and game producer .
The first game he worked on as a writer / producer was the cult - hit musical RPG Rhapsody : A Musical Adventure , released in 1998 to general pleased confusion on the part of gamers , won over by its sheer likability .
From this game he has continued to work on various Nippon Ichi Software titles as a writer and producer , including Disgaea : Hour of Darkness , Disaea 2 : Cursed Memories , Disgaea 3 : Absence of Justice -- in the process , creating a series known for warped stories , bizarre characters , and an enduringly ( and endearingly ) macabre universe .
What stands out
Representing the Japanese side of the game writing tradition , Niikawa is one of the few writers on our list who , instead of moving from RPGs to writing for other genres , has stayed there in that field , perfecting the use of words in his medium .
The key to his writing is creating amusing scenarios filled with vibrant characters -- with undead penguins and demon princes motivated to act over deleted save games .
These quirks have helped build an idiosyncratic universe that has allowed a little - known Japanese publisher to become a fan - favorite the world over .
Our take
" Sohei Niikawa gleefully populates his games with characters that are loud , disrespectful , and prone to vandalism .
And why should n't he ?
After all , when you strip away the weak moral justifications ( usually conveyed as bullet points on the back of a game box ) for why video game characters behave as they do , they begin to look extremely anti-social .
Even a straight arrow like Zelda 's Link is essentially a murdering thief when examined objectively .
Particularly in world of Japanese RPGs where mawkish sentimentality is the rule , Niikawa 's writing stands out for its irreverent wit , echoing across the church of videogames like a very wet Bronx cheer . "

Yuichiro Tanaka
Scenario writer , Atlus
Notable projects
Persona 3 , Persona 4
Project focus
Finding information on Tanaka has been tough ; even his own company 's PR was unresponsive , and Japanese Google searches proved almost fruitless .
But one has to look at his work -- the most recent installments of the Persona series , which has almost completely rehabbed the reputation of Japanese RPGs in the West -- to understand what he 's aiming at : character depth , and story / gameplay integration .
Called by some " the perfect RPG , " Persona 3 was met by great critical praise following its 2007 North American release .
Most striking was its unique combination of traditional RPG elements and the high school backdrop of a Japanese social sim .
That 's not all that players found daring about this game -- it cleverly tied growing your relationships to increased power in the RPG side of the game , bringing together two elements that are so often split in other games .
What stands out
Tanaka and the Persona 3 team took a bold creative leap when they decided that their teenage protagonists would switch into their fighting personas by symbolically shooting themselves in the head .
Persona 4 may have lost the headshot , but won even more praise for deep characterization , with Tanaka to transporting this story out of a typical urban school setting and into the countryside for a more traditional murder mystery -- with a Persona spin , of course .
Our take
" In an era in which traditionally - opaque Japanese fantasy narratives have arguably fallen out of favor outside their home turf , the Persona games managed to quickly gain cult hit status in Western markets precisely for the way in which they embrace distinctly Japanese social tensions around the concept of the self .
Delicate , unparalleled localization played a key role specifically for how it preserved the narratives ' particular flavor of " otherness " in careful balance with fantasy - realism .
The result is arresting stories that employ modern , relevant insight into the lives of teenagers as they discover their role in society . "

With experience writing and designing on a number of AAA game titles , Marianne Krawczyk is most often recognized for her work on the the critically and commercially acclaimed franchise God of War .
In addition to working on many games in that series , Krawczyk has written for Area 51 , The Sopranos : Road to Respect , and more , including a number of soon - to - be - announced titles for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 .
Specifically , she focuses on story and dialogue .
She has worked with all of the major games publishers , including Sony , Activision , Vivendi Universal , THQ and Midway .
In addition to writing for games , she has also written about game writing .
She is the author of Game Development Essentials : Game Story and Character Development .
Krawczyk is the recent recipient of the BAFTA for Best Story and Character for God of War II .
She has also won other awards for her excellence in character development .
What stands out
As her awards indicate , Krawczyk 's strength is truly in her characters , like God of War 's Kratos , who has developed a life and a following of his own that keeps God of War fans coming back for more .
She has gone on as saying her strongest characters find her -- and just start talking .
Thank goodness they do , because that leaves us with characters to remember .
Our take
" In the U.K. , where the equivalent of the Oscars -- the BAFTAs -- encompasses games as well as film , God of War II won the award for Best Story and Character .
That 's an impressive achievement , but those who play games are already aware of how instantly iconic the twisted hero of that series , Kratos , has become .
Would the games still have been immensely popular relying on their brutal gameplay alone ?
Sure .
Could he have become an icon without the dark and disturbing story that underpins that action ?
It does not seem likely at all . "

Project focus
Schafer is the creative director at Double Fine Productions , the independent studio he founded in 2000 after a decade making graphic adventure games at LucasArts .
He began his writing career on the Ron Gilbert - led Secret of Monkey Island and its sequel , moving to a co-design role with Dave Grossman on Day of the Tentacle .
In 1995 , he wrote and designed the biker adventure Full Throttle , and followed it up with 1998 's ambitious and acclaimed Grim Fandango .
At Double Fine , Schafer headed up the quirky character - driven platformer Psychonauts , which won the Game Developers Choice Award for Best Writing in 2006 -- a distinction shared with co-writer and fellow Gamasutra 20 writer honoree Erik Wolpaw .
He is currently working on the heavy metal - themed fantasy action game Brutal Legend .
What stands out
Games by Tim Schafer are relentlessly imaginative to an extent rarely seen in the video game industry .
His games span a hard - boiled film noir take on the Mexican land of the dead , a biker wasteland simultaneously nostalgic and high - tech , even to the fractured yet fully - realized subconscious minds of spies and asylum inmates .
In Schafer 's games , we visit places few other game writers seem willing or able to take us .
Our take
" Tim Schafer understands some principles few game writers do : you can present breathtaking imaginary worlds without the aid of plodding text crawls or expository voiceovers .
You can flesh out complex and interesting characters with dialogue that is concise and enjoyable rather than neverending .
More so , you can combine genuine humor and genuine drama without making either seem cheap .
There is a welcome frugality to Schafer 's witty writing ; though he is known to write extensive back story and character profiles during development , he resists letting too much of it make its way to the game in the form of unnecessary dialogue .
The result is dialogue and narrative that is sharp and always enjoyable , but that also hints at something deeper under the surface . "

A Devon farmer has succeeded in introducing a breed of cattle that has not been seen in the UK for over 4,000 years .
During the Second World War , the Heck cow was a symbol of Nazi ambitions to rule the world .
Alex Bushill reports .
Swedish Internet users love themselves some file - sharing — but not when their veil of anonymity can be stripped away .
The EU's Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive ( IPRED ) requires all member states to adopt tougher protections against piracy and counterfeiting .
Sweden 's own implementation of the law went into effect on the first day of April and had an immediate effect ;
Internet traffic passing though the country 's main exchange points fell nearly in half .
The main provision of Sweden 's IPRED directive would not be specially controversial in the US ; indeed , it 's already the law here .
Copyright holders who identify the IP address of someone sharing their material online can go to a court , which can force ISPs to turn over information about the subscriber using that IP address at the time in question .
Should ISPs then choose to sue the person , they can do so .
The threat of unmasking appears to have slashed Internet traffic in Sweden .
Netnod , which runs major Swedish Internet exchange points in Lule ? , Sundsvall , Stockholm , Gothenburg , and Malm ? , publishes data about the traffic passing through its facilities .
Its graphs show that total traffic dropped from a peak of 190 Gb/s on Tuesday , March 31 down to a peak of only 110 Gb/s on Wednesday , when the new law went into effect .
Some declines were even more significant .
Traffic at the Gothenburg site alone plummeted even further ( as a percentage ) , dropping from 16 Gb /s to 7 Gb/s , and today 's numbers appear to be even lower than yesterday's .
Of special note is the fact that traffic on March 31 was higher than the average at every site , suggesting a last - minute bingeing at the Internet 's P2P buffet .
Will the effect last ?
Who knows .
Some overall reduction seems likely , but it will probably be modest ; countries where rightsholders can already unmask IP addresses certainly have n't managed to curtail files - sharing simply by threatening lawsuits .
Even the RIAA 's lawsuit campaign in the US failed to cut files - swapping substantially .
But the dramatic data will no doubt provide the impetus for rightsholders to push even harder for graduated response laws across the globe .
One of the key points of such a campaign is stripping away the sense of anonymity ; even in trials where the ISP passes along infringement notices but does n't threaten disconnection , P2P usage has dropped .
One UK study last year suggested that 70 percent of file - swappers would stop sharing copyrighted files after a simple notice that their activity had been detected .
Sweden 's Internet number might well recover as the " novelty " of the new threat wears off and most Internet users remain unsued , but the data does seem to suggest that so long as people feel exposed , they will alter their behavior .
Of course , rather than stop sharing files — practically a national pastime in Sweden — Internet users may turn instead to services like The Pirate Bay 's new " IPREDator " anonymous VPN .
Rightsholders are already putting the new law to use , as several book publishers have gone to court seeking information about the online sharing of their audiobooks .
Introduction
The NSLU2 running OpenWRT and the QuickCam Pro 9000 combine to make a very versatile device .
In this post I ’m going to describe how to use them as a time - lapse camera which takes photos every ten seconds at 1600 ×1200 resolution and stores them on a flash drive .
The photos occupy anywhere from 80 K to 400K each depending on the complexity of the scene .
This means that around 10,000 to 15,000 will fit on a 4 G Byte flash drive , corresponding to 20 - 40 hours of coverage .
All that is required is an NSLU2 , a UVC - compatible webcam , a flash drive , and an OpenWRT firmware build , which is available here .
A brief sample movie ( 30 seconds , 8.5 Mbytes , DivX ) is available here .
A simple hardware mod
The first step in building this arrangement is to bypass a hardware limitation of the NSLU2 .
As provided , only one of the two USB ports has power .
If we want to attach both a webcam and a flash drive , we need both ports to supply power .
The solution is a very simple hardware mod ( a single jumper ) which is described here .
A good description of how to open the case can be found here .
Installing the firmware
This process is described in “ A High - Resolution IP Camera ” , but for completeness here it is again .
You will need :
An NSLU2 A host computer , best running Linux
The firmware image , openwrt- nslu2-uvc-webcam2.bin
You will need to run a tool called UpSlug2 to install the firmware .
UpSlug2 is described here .
I would recommend running it from Linux .
I used my Ubuntu machine , but booting a Knoppix Live CD on a Windows machine should work fine .
Under Ubuntu , getting UpSlug2 is as simple as :
apt - get install upslug2
The next step is to power - up the NSLU2 in “ upgrade mode ” .
It should be connected to the same LAN as your Linux machine , but do not plug in the camera or flash drive at this stage .
Use a straightened paper clip or other thin probe inserted in the Reset hole at the back of the NSLU2 .
Apply gentle pressure and the reset switch will click in .
Hold it down and press the power button at the front .
The Ready / Status LED will come on orange , but after nine or ten seconds will turn red .
Release the reset switch as soon as this happens .
The Ready / Status LED should start alternating red and green , indicating that the device is ready to upgrade .
Now issue the command :
sudo upslug2 -- image=" openwrt-nslu2-uvc-webcam2.bin "
If all is well and UpSlug2 can find the NSLU2 you should see a nice animated summary of the upgrade process , which will take about one minute twenty seconds .
When it finishes you should wait for about two more minutes for it to perform initial setup – eventually the Disk 1 and Disk 2 LEDs should go out and the Ready / Status come on red .
You can then disconnect the power , plug in the webcam and the flash drive , and power it up again .
After about 60 seconds the red ring light on the camera , indicating that it is recording , should come on .
Recording images
Once the firmware is installed , the NSLU2 will start recording images as soon as it has started up .
The recording is done with Tom Stöveken ’s versatile MJPG - streamer software .
MJPG - streamer is capable of writing images to external storage at regular intervals .
It names each image with a rather long but unique name of the form :
year–month–day–hour–minute–second-picture-serialnum.jpg
e.g 2008_05_11_08_38_50_picture_000000046.jpg .
The serialnum increments by 1 for each successive image .
The firmware has been set up to write these files to a normal flash drive filesystem ; that is , in MS - DOS or more properly FAT32 format .
Its not the worlds best filesystem , but it is ubiquitous and works with almost everything .
Most flash drives come formatted this way , so should work immediately .
Note that the firmware does not make subdirectories ; all the files are written to the top directory of the drive .
There are limits to how many files can be placed in one directory like this – officially 65536 is the limit for FAT32 , but I have n’t tested this and would advise caution .
The firmware makes use of the LEDs on the NSLU2 to describe its status .
It will look at what resources are available when it starts up , and select one of the following four modes :
– No-camera mode .
If no UVC - compatible webcam is found , the Ready / Status LED will turn red and nothing interesting will happen .
– IP - camera mode , where it streams the camera images to a web page .
This is pretty much the same as the system described in my earlier post “ A High - Resolution IP Camera ” .
The Ready / Status LED will be green and the Disk 1 LED will be on .
– Dual IP - camera mode .
If it finds two cameras , it will try to stream both of them to two separate web pages .
The second web page is at the same address as the first , but on port 8080 .
The Ready / Status LED will be green and both the Disk 1 and Disk 2 LED will come on .
I have n’t actually tested this as I only have one camera .
– Time - lapse camera mode , which is the main subject of this post .
In this case no web page will be available and the NSLU2 will start storing images on the flash drive every ten seconds .
The Ready / Status LED will be green , the Disk 2 LED will come on , and you should see activity every ten seconds on the flash drive ’s LED ( if it has one ) .
The Ethernet LED will , in all modes , as usual , indicate whether or not the NSLU2 is connected to a LAN .
In time - lapse camera mode the NSLU2 does not need to be connected to a LAN and can operate independently .
Time - lapse camera mode runs at the full 1600 ×1200 resolution of the camera , which is possible because we are only processing an image every ten seconds .
The NSLU2 ca n’t cope with these images at much speed ( see this post for a discussion of why ) .
The disadvantage of the high resolution is that it ca n’t do a web page as well .
MJPG - streamer is quite capable of doing both , but the resolution has to be reduced to 960 x 720 in JPEG mode , and as I expect the time - lapse mode to be used for unattended long - term recording , I have adopted the higher resolution .
Trouble at mill ; filling up the disk
It would be nice to be able to delete the oldest images once the flash drive filled up , so that the camera could run continuously and keep only the new images .
This turns out to be difficult to do .
With 10,000 files on the drive , the ‘ ls ’ command that would find the oldest becomes glacially slow , taking over twenty minutes to complete .
It also risks crashing the NSLU2 .
Instead , I have installed a script that checks for a nearly - full drive and issues the ‘ poweroff ’ command when there is only 15 M bytes free .
Viewing the images
A flash drive with 13,859 JPEGs on it is not actually a very usable thing .
Even though the images are labelled with dates and times , looking through them is tedious at best .
A much better way of reviewing them is to turn them into a movie .
I spent some time looking for the best way to do this , and in the end discovered that Apple ’s QuickTime Pro software has an “ Open Image Sequence … ” command that does a very good job of it indeed .
Its also a good tool for viewing , single - stepping , rewinding , editing and generally working with time - lapse movies , and I can recommend it as worth the money ( US$ 30 ) .
The only piece of trickery required is that QuickTime Pro expects to be pointed at the first file of a series of files with numerical sequence numbers for names , and the date prefixed onto the file names by MJPG - streamer confuses it .
This is best dealt with by applying a shell script to strip off the date prefix .
Writing one that runs at a reasonable speed and can cope with 20,000 files in one directory turned out to be a little tricky , but eventually I found the powerful incantation :
find .
- name '*. jpg ' - print | sed 's /.* _picture_\(.*\) . jpg$ /mv " & " " \ 1.jpg " / ' | sh
This can strip paint off bargeboards at twenty metres and will convert about 12,000 filenames a minute on my Mac Mini .
For ease of use under Mac OS X I have packaged it up into an AppleScript application that will convert folders of files that are dropped onto it .
It is available here .
Be warned that if there are multiple sequences in the folder ( i.e more than one file that ends with 0000001.jpg ) the earlier ones will be overwritten .
Quicktime
Pro also seems to object to the zero - size .jpg files that the recording process sometimes leaves at the end – you should remove these manually .
To strip date prefixes under Windows , I am advised that the Cygwin environment will probably support the incantation above .
Internal details and making changes
openwrt-nslu2-uvc-webcam2.bin is a normal build of a selection of packages from OpenWRT Kamikaze taken from the current ‘ trunk ’ , with a couple of simple shell scripts added .
The main script can be found in / etc / init.d / done .
Checking for “ disk full ” is done by a second script which can be found in / root / stopwhenfull , and the cron entry that runs it every three minutes is added to /etc / crontabs / root by the ‘ done ’ script .
A copy of the two scripts and a list of the packages in use can be found here .
You can telnet directly into the OpenWRT shell , which has no password .
You should set a password and use ssh thereafter .
Many things can be changed if you log in and edit the scripts .
The time between images is controlled by the -d parameter to mjpg_streamer ( in milliseconds ) .
I would n’t advise setting it to less than five seconds at 1600 ×1200 on the Pro 9000 , as the NSLU2 is likely to crash .
Image size is controlled by the -r parameter and image type by -y .
The stopwhenfull script assumes that you wo n’t generate more than 5 M bytes / minute and should be adjusted if this is not the case .
The firmware does not have to write to a flash drive , but is not likely to work with a USB hard drive as they are usually formatted with NTFS or somesuch , which it does not understand .
It does understand the Linux ext3 filesystem , though , which might be more suitable for larger applications anyway , as it does n’t seem to have a limit to the number of files that can be in one directory .
The firmware includes an NTP client which will try to keep accurate time if the NSLU2 can find Internet access .
As provided it will keep UTC time .
If you are n’t in the Greenwich time zone you will need to add an appropriate /etc / TZ file for your timezone taken from here .
I have experimented with Samba and vsftpd with the idea of being able to look at the images on the flash drive as they are recorded over the LAN connection .
Performance in both cases turns out to be somewhere between glacial and completely fossilised if there are very many files on the disk .
I have left vsftpd in as it can be useful for checking that the images are OK just after startup , but I ca n’t recommend using it once there are more than a few hundred images .
To use vsftpd you will need to login over telnet and set a root password , then use that password and the username ‘ root ’ to gain access over ftp .
The firmware uses DHCP to obtain an IP address , as described in “ A High - Resolution IP Camera ” .
Limitations and improvements
The firmware as it stands has a few deficiencies which I would like to address .
– There is no way of turning the NSLU2 off , which would be a good idea , as its not really very nice to just unplug the flash drive as it runs .
With any luck OpenWRT will someday get the power button working as an off switch .
– The focus controls on the QuickCam are n’t accessible in time - lapse mode .
The camera can actually focus down to a few centimetres and it would be useful for studying very small slow things if the focus was available .
– A simple web page that at least gave a static image would be handy in time - lapse mode for checking the field of view .
– A better way of storing files than the present single directory would be nice , and the best way to do it would be to modify MJPG - streamer .
– Battery - driven operation is possible but a bit demanding ; the combination of the NSLU2 , the Quickcam Pro 9000 , and a 4 G Byte flash drive draws 900 - 1100 mA at 5V while recording , which is rather a lot for batteries .
I want to look into reducing this for remote recording applications .

Guest Editorial by Ernest A. Canning
I am a California attorney .
After 31 years of practice , I find myself in the enviable position of semi-retirement .
As my practice winds down , I have had the luxury to follow the Coleman election challenge closely , both reading court filings and watching a good deal of the proceedings .
I consider The BRAD BLOG the most extensive and thorough source of the dangers of E-voting .
I felt , however , it would be useful to provide a legal analysis of the present state of the Coleman challenge .
Brad Friedman 's described the latest effort by team Coleman to challenge absentee ballots it had previously agreed were properly opened and counted , as a " flip - flop , " .
While accurate , the term does not begin describe the deep legal dilemma now faced by Norm Coleman 's attorneys in the U.S. Senate election contest in Minnesota ...
On Dec. 18 , 2008 , in response to Coleman 's effort to prevent the opening and counting of erroneously rejected absentee ballots , the Minnesota Supreme Court ordered that local election officials open and count absentee ballots only where both the Coleman and Al Franken campaigns agreed .
The ensuing process resulted in the opening and counting of 933 absentee ballots .
These 933 absentee ballots produced a net gain of 176 votes for Franken .
After Franken was declared the winner on Jan. 5 , 2009 by the State Canvassing Board , Coleman filed notice he was contesting the election .
On Feb. 3 , 2009 the Coleman and Franken legal teams entered a legally binding stipulation [ PDF ] that the 933 ballots were " properly and lawfully counted " and " properly and lawfully included in the results of the 2008 United States Senate Election as certified by the Minnesota State Canvassing Board . "
As part of the stipulation , Coleman agreed to " dismiss with prejudice all claims in the Notice of Contest relating to the 933 Ballots . "
These stipulations were approved by the three judge panel selected to preside over the election contest .
The Coleman legal team then adopted a strategy of seeking to have approximately 4,800 additional absentee ballots opened and counted .
It sought to by - pass the strict anti-fraud requirements of Minnesota law for absentee ballots --- for example , the voter must be registered and must sign the return envelope before a witness who is also a registered voter ; the addresses of both the witness and the voter must be on the ballot , and the voter 's address must be the same as that listed on their absentee ballot application .
Coleman sought to offer the absentee ballots en masse , by simply categorizing them under the reasons for rejection , as given by election officials .
On Feb. 13 , 2009 the three - judge panel expressly rejected [ PDF ]
Coleman 's position , writing : " Proving that the reason given by election officials for rejecting a ballot was invalid is not tantamount to proving that it was legally cast . "
The court imposed a burden upon the Coleman legal team to prove that a previously rejected absentee ballot had , indeed , been lawfully cast .
The weakness of Coleman 's strategy , in simply pointing to whether an absentee ballot was improperly rejected , was underscored by the subsequent testimony of a county election official .
Coleman 's attorney brought out the fact that a ballot was improperly rejected , and the county official , looking only at the return envelope , conceded she saw no reason why the ballot should not be opened and counted .
However , cross-examination by Franken 's attorney revealed that local election officials had notified the voter of the error and that the same voter had signed the precinct ledger and voted on Election Day .
It was revealed that by now opening and counting that particular " improperly rejected absentee ballot " , the court would be permitting one individual to vote twice .
While Franken attorney Marc Elias was circumspect in estimating the impact the February 13th ruling had on the " ballot universe " ( the number of unopened absentee ballots still in play ) , the increasingly strident claims made by the Coleman legal team both inside and outside the courtroom , about Minnesota 's allegedly " fatally flawed " electoral system , along with a repeated inability to introduce relevant , admissible evidence during the past week , strongly suggests that the Coleman effort to demonstrate that he had received more lawfully cast votes than Franken is dead in its tracks .
In a Feb. 16 , 2009 letter seeking reconsideration [ PDF ] of the Feb. 13 order , Coleman suggested that amongst the 933 ballots previously found to have been " properly opened and counted " there were " scores " that did not meet the standards set forth in the court 's order .
On Feb. 17 , 2009 the three - judge panel summarily denied this request [ PDF ] .
In a separate ruling [ PDF ] excluding a Coleman expert witness on this issue , the court stated : " The Court will be reviewing all ballots presented according to the uniform standard contained in Minnesota Statutes … .
It is irrelevant whether there were irregularities between the counties in applying Minnesota Statutes … prior to this election contest . "
It was against this background that Coleman filed a Feb. 20 , 2009 motion seeking a temporary injunction [ PDF ] to prevent the Secretary of State from redacting the envelopes associated with the previously counted 933 ballots , contending that " many " of these ballots opened and counted " fall into one or more of the categories of ballots that the Court has now ruled are ' not legally cast ' "
Coleman suggests that his earlier stipulation was based on the assumption that the 933 would be " reflective of the standards " that the court would apply to the remaining ballots .
Having practiced law for more than 31 years , I was stunned by this motion .
As The BRAD BLOG previously observed , the Franken legal team had pointed to questions of estoppel and invited error with respect to Coleman 's effort to reverse legal positions it had taken previously during the recount .
This latest reversal entails something far more significant .
The court - approved stipulation that the 933 votes were lawfully cast and counted , and agreement to dismiss , with prejudice , all claims made against the 933 ballots amounted to a final ruling by the court that the 933 were lawfully cast ballots .
Coleman waived the right to so much as even suggest that any of those 933 ballots were not lawfully cast .
Coleman 's motion is frivolous and , as suggested by Franken 's opposition [ PDF ] , warrants the imposition of sanctions .
The status of this election contest is deeply troubling .
It has become increasingly apparent that the Coleman position is devoid of merit , yet his team plods on , delaying the seating of a U.S. Senator at a time when every vote has become essential to the new administration 's efforts to bring this nation back from the edge of an economic abyss .
Perhaps , for the Party of " No " delay is a victory .

10:16 am - Dream : Scarcity
Nothing ever lasted anymore .
Sure , people banded together here and there , for a bit , and made something that worked for a while .
Call it a town , a village , a camp , whatever .
But it never lasted .
The world was not for lasting anymore .
The winds were too fast , too hot , too dry .
The raiders viewed success and failure as the same outcome and this made them bold .
Every day , there was less untarnished metal , less unburnt wood , less undiseased meat , and there was never anything new that was good .
New was only bad ; new was only horror : a new illness nobody knew how to treat , a new tribe looking to fall upon you and yours , a new creature spit up from the desert to kill and maim in some new way you never imagined possible .
And then the village or town or camp or whatever would be gone and those who survived would make their own way , again .
We were making our own way , again .
This time , at least , we had a car of sorts .
A Volkswagen Beetle , I think it was called when it was still being made .
The tank was more gas than sand and so we were able to coax it along what remained of a road , away from the last horror as it was winding down , towards the next thing we would try - whatever that might be .
But cars , like everything else in the broken world , cannot last , and so ours did not .
We had just passed through a little town before the breakdown .
It was still visible in the shimmering heat - some other group of folks bravely trying to make and hold onto something .
They were too close to the recent horror for us to feel comfortable throwing in our lot with them but more power to 'em - at least , so we felt when we had the car .
Now , we were repacking our supplies on the side of the road , arranging everything for foot travel .
Heading back and seeing what the little shithole town had to offer for a bit was n't looking so bad now .
Then a decision of sorts was forced upon us , because the wind changed , and with it came the unmistakable whisper of a distant sound : the pulsing , echoing shrieks of an approaching flock of banshees .
Sure enough : the dark mass peeking over the horizon was no cloud .
In their teeming thousands , the flock would be here all too soon , bombarding everything with their overwhelming din , setting our brains to resonance within our skulls no matter how tightly we plugged our ears .
The effect would render us unconscious within minutes .
In the open , this was the same thing as death .
As always , with these things , there was no time for rational consideration or the formulation of a plan .
That we could hear them at all might mean it was too late .
We ran for the town .
If we could get into a secure building , we'd be safe - unconscious , sure , but locked away from their talons and beaks until the flock moved on .
We could n't bring the supplies .
They 'd probably be long gone by the time we woke up , carried away by someone else who awoke sooner .
The way of things , now .
The town never seemed to get any closer .
The sand pounded , pounded , pounded under our feet forever and the shrill , throbbing noise grew louder and louder .
I could n't look up , just down at my feet , running and running , feeling tunnel vision close in as my head began to beat like a drum .
The flock was over us , around us , encircling us , waiting for us to fall , but we ran and ran - and then suddenly my hand was on a door handle .
Opened , we were inside , pull it shut , throw down the bar .
Just enough time to look around once - before the tone became unbearable and we fell into darkness - to make sure we were all inside , that there was a roof over our head and no holes in the walls .
Not safe , exactly , but safe enough .
Hopefully it would last , in this time and place where nothing ever lasted anymore .

For consideration : documenting the apocalypse one dream at a time
By relying on asset - backed securities , large amounts of leverage and unregulated hedge funds as its key elements , the U.S. Treasury Department 's overhaul of the banking - system bailout plan is essentially relying on some of the same ingredients that caused the financial crisis in the first place .
This time around , someone should take the punch bowl away before the party even gets started .
Otherwise , as Yogi Berra once said , it will be " Déjàvu all over again . "
The only difference this time around is that the U.S. Treasury Department is calling the plays .
Omaha has more than cows and corn !
My husband will tell you that his favorite dessert my chocolate caramel cheesecake , the orange - chocolate bundt cake , Mom ’s chocolate chip sour cream coffee cake or the bourbon - pumpkin cheesecake but do n’t believe him — he lies .
Alex ’s favorite cake looks comes from either Billy ’s or Magnolia bakery , looks to him like “ opened Oreos ” and is called an icebox cake .
It is also , I am so sorry to say , a bit of a sham .
Like the 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 cake recipe ( 1 cup butter , 2 cups sugar , 3 cups flour and 4 eggs ) as well as the back - of - the - box shortcut buttercream frosting that they bakeries combined to form a “ cupcake trend , ” they have neither invented the icebox cake nor made it any better than the American home cooks that first concocted these simple desserts — they ’ve just got better marketing .
The National Biscuit Company — later shortened to Nabisco and whose original factory now houses Chelsea Market , OXO products and the Food Network — introduced their Famous Chocolate Wafers in 1924 , along with a ginger and a sugar variety .
The chocolate ones , lighter , thinner and more crisp than an unfilled Oreo but with a noticeably similar taste , and would have likely faded into obscurity when the non-chocolate varieties did had some ingenious 1930s housewives not figured out that if you stack them , separated with a layer of sweetened whipped cream , they soften overnight and become a glorious chocolate cake , with layers as thin and wisp - like as ribbons .
One thing I will hand to the bakeries that have trendified this dessert — and sell it for $ 3.50 per slice — is that two years ago , I ’d have been hard - pressed to find these cookies in any store ( seriously , I still ca n’t even find the product on Nabisco ’s website ) and now , not only do they hold some shelf - space at my local Gristedes , I can order them from Amazon .
Of course , none of this holds any interest to my husband , who in suffering the ultimate act of cruelty on Thursday night , had to witness me throw together the cake ( in about 30 minutes , to boot ) , pack it away and then serve it to other people .
I wanted to make something for my chocoholic coworker ’s last day of work , but not actually have to burn the midnight oil or worse , skip the gym , to do so .
Though Luisa and I ( whose significant other is also a Billly ’s icebox cake fanatic ) had schemed a few weeks ago to make one completely from scratch in the near future , icebox cake ’s temptation wore me down sooner .
You simply cannot lose when you make this cake .
If you can get past this one thing : THREE CUPS of heavy cream !
Mon dieu !
This , plus two packages of cookies , a few tablespoons of sugar and possibly , a heart doctor , is all you will need ( though I suggest buying a third package , as many of these humble , unlovable wafers , wedged into a bottom shelf in your grocer ’s cookie section will inevitably arrive broken ) , though in the future I may toy with whipped cream flavorings from mint extract to raspberry liquor .
Or homemade chocolate wafers .
But there ’s no reason for you to be that kind of crazy ; I ’ve got more than enough for all of us .
Update :
Want to make your own chocolate wafers for this cake ?
Now you can !
Finding a Django - friendly host just got a little easier
Djangofriendly celebrated its first birthday in March .
In its first year , more than 16,000 visitors came by to find and share knowledge on hosting Django applications with various hosts .
Voters and commenters have made it quite clear that WebFaction is the preferred shared Django host , and Slicehost is the preferred VPS provider , while Django should n’t touch Dreamhost unless it ’s with a very sharp , angry stick .
To celebrate Djangofriendly ’s birthday , I ’ve gone into a bit of a code sprint , the first phase of which concluded this morning as the new code went live .
The first step was to upgrade the existing site to Django 1.1 .
After that , I began implementing functionality that has been requested of me by various users .
The Djangofriendly Hosts that launched this morning has the following enhancements :
Users can now edit the information for each host to provide missing details , or correct inaccurate or out - of - date details .
Host information can now be aware of the country from which the host operates , thanks to the django - countries .
I ’ve begun adding country info to several hosts , but hopefully I wo n’t be the only one updating this information now .
Filtering of hosts by environment , price , and country can now be chained .
In the past , hosts could only be filtered by environment OR price .
Now these can all be chained together for a more refined search .
Let me know in the comments if something is broken or not working as expected .
I hope the Django community finds these additions helpful , and I ’ll be continuing my sprint for a second Djangofriendly update in the very near future , hoping to help the community find more than just Django hosts …
God Damned Young People and Their Weirdo Haircuts Drive Me Nuts
The problem with young people today is that they have crazy haircuts .
In my day , a lad had two choices for a haircut – a crew cut or a flat top and both cost 50 cents .
You went to the barber every Saturday morning with your old dad , had your ears raised and were grateful to look like every other kid on your block .
But these young people today .
They all want to “ express themselves ” with their weirdo hairdos !
They walk around with their spiky bangs , corn rows , streaky uplifts , mohawks , faux hawks and wigged out sideburns .
It ’s a carnival freak show but without the popcorn .
If I had ever come home with a multi-colored mullet and a bum fluff goatee my old dad would have used me as a stump and split a cord of wood on my back .
It ’s showy and disrespectful .
Plumped and preening like a bunch of randy roosters let loose in a hen house .
Disgraceful .
I say they should round those damned young people up and sheer them down like the sheep they ’re supposed to be .
It ’s dangerous I tell you and it leads to anarchy and loose morals .
It wo n’t be long before willy nilly hair styles are n’t enough for them anymore and they start frothing at the mouth , burning down post offices , practicing communism and forcing seniors to sport dreadlocks , rattails , moptops and worse .
And mark my god damned words , when that day comes we are all going to be well and truly sorry .
They have crazy haircuts .
That ’s the problem with young people today .

tom hazel had six months to go .
He ’d been at his job at the aluminum plant in Longview , Washington , for 29 years and six months .
Under his union contract , he was eligible to retire with a full pension — about $ 1,000 a month , or $ 37.50 for each year of employment — when he hit his 30th anniversary .
It was a promise that had kept him going for decades in a job that otherwise had little to recommend itself .
Temperatures in the foundry soared well past 100 degrees ; workers were required to wear respirator masks , into which they tore holes to smoke cigarettes as they lugged massive iron studs and jackhammers .
Once , a guy was effectively cut in half when a piece of machinery fell on him ; other men were electrocuted , or burned to death by molten metal .
Aluminum workers are also at elevated risk of leukemia and a host of lung diseases .
“ I do n’t know how many times I thought about quitting , ” one of Hazel ’s colleagues admits .
“ But I thought , ‘ Boy , I ’ve got too many years invested here .
I ca n’t afford to give up those years . ' ”
The attitude was common : Aluminum offered men with no college a ticket into the middle class , into one of the cozy wooden houses lining the town ’s side streets , and eventually into a comfortable retirement .
Young men were brought into the factory by fathers , uncles , brothers .
“ They used to call it the mill flunkies .
You ’d hire in , show up every day , do the job you ’re supposed to do , and you thought you were going to be taken care of , ” recalls Hazel ’s union president , Bill Hannah , who joined the company at age 19 .
Less than an hour ’s drive north of Portland , the town of 35,000 , originally designed by the Long - Bell Lumber Company as part of the World War I -era City Beautiful movement , retained a close - knit working - class culture ; even the restaurants were unionized well into the 1980s .
Hazel spent a lot of time thinking about what he would do once he got that pension at age 50 .
“ I would have maybe worked part time somewhere , moved up to Hood Canal or the coast , ” he says .
“ I like clamming and crabbing and getting oysters .
You just walk right out on the beach and rake ’em up ; take out your boat and drop your crab pots . ”
Today , the foundry sits shuttered .
Tom Hazel ’s pension plan has been suspended , and the lifetime medical benefits he was promised are gone .
Any dreams of crabbing are now just that .
He ’s emptied his savings to support his wife , son , grandson , and two stepchildren ; his new job , as a forklift driver at the local timber plant , has very limited benefits , and he counts himself lucky to have it .
He ’ll get a pension eventually , at 62 , but right now , with seven years to go , that ’s not much help .
All over the country , pensions guaranteed by union - negotiated contracts are vanishing into thin air , casualties of bankruptcy , economic upheaval , and flawed legislation .
Pensions have turned to dust at airlines ( United , Delta ) , steel companies ( Bethlehem ) , textile makers , and even electronics companies like Polaroid .
The Big Three and their suppliers may roll back pension plans that support hundreds of thousands of retirees and their families .
Entire towns have seen their economic base disappear ; in Kannapolis , North Carolina , home to the textile maker Pillowtex Corporation , 23,000 private pensions were wiped out overnight when the company went bankrupt in 2003 .
For workers whose pensions vanish , the only safety net is the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation , an insurance fund financed by employer premiums .
Today , 1.3 million workers rely on the federal government to pay pensions that their employers no longer can or will pay ; the number has more than doubled in the past eight years , and it keeps rising .
The pbgc , its investments battered by the stock market crash , is now deep in the red , with a deficit of more than $ 11 billion instead of the $ 9.7 billion surplus it had in 2000 .
But there is a growing population of workers whom the pbgc ca n’t fully compensate : those in heavy - labor industries , where bodies wear out long before the traditional retirement age , and where retirement typically starts in a worker ’s mid-50s .
When these companies bail on their pensions , the pbgc often offers significantly less .
It also does n’t cover health insurance , an essential benefit to workers who do n’t qualify for Medicare and who often have children still at home .
“ It ’s a frightful societal development , ” says Bill Brandt , a Chicago - based financial consultant who has served as a trustee during numerous bankruptcy proceedings .
Between the disappearing pensions , slim prospects for new jobs , and vanished medical benefits , middle - aged workers like Hazel “ will discover it ’s the beginning of a very sordid story for the rest of their lives . ”
In Longview , retirement promises were only the last to be broken .
In 2000 , the world ’s largest aluminum producer , Alcoa , Inc. ( then run by Paul O’Neill , whom George W. Bush would soon appoint as treasury secretary ) , had bought out the foundry ’s owner , Reynolds Metals .
But Alcoa quickly found itself embroiled in an antitrust battle , which required it to sell part of its stake in Reynolds ; it also realized that the Longview plant used obsolete , polluting technology — ” we were dinosaurs in the mud , ” says one ex-worker bitterly — and that the plant was full of men whose pension and health iou s were coming due .
The company wanted out , and it turned to Michael Lynch , an eccentric Chicago investor with a habit of buying and bankrupting aluminum companies .
In 2000 , Lynch offered $ 150 million for the plant , far more than other bidders were willing to cough up — and far more , it turned out , than he could actually finance .
The negotiations dragged on until the Enron - manufactured energy crisis of 2001 hit the West : Suddenly , the plant ’s enormous electricity contract — aluminum smelters use a stupendous amount of power — was worth a fortune .
The local utility , Bonneville Power Administration , offered Alcoa $ 226 million , almost three times the plant ’s annual output , to temporarily cease operations in Longview .
Alcoa leapt at the offer — and so did Lynch .
The investor , who did n’t respond to requests for comment for this article , informed bpa that it could n’t close the deal with Alcoa because he ’d already bid on the plant .
Desperate for electricity , bpa offered a compromise : Alcoa would sell to Lynch , for whom bpa would in effect finance the deal to the tune of $ 140 million .
The remaining $ 86 million or so of the electricity buyout would be handed over to Lynch .
It was the deal of a lifetime — except for the workers .
Under the terms of the contract , Alcoa would pay for the Longview employees ’ pensions once they turned 62 .
But until then , Lynch was responsible , and as long as the company was viable he was also on the hook for the retirees ’ lifetime medical benefits .
Lynch did “ temporarily ” close the plant down , as agreed with bpa ; for the next two years , he kept assuring the union that he planned to upgrade the equipment and reopen .
Then in 2003 , Longview Aluminum suddenly declared bankruptcy , owing the county $ 1.47 million in unpaid taxes and its workers tens of millions in pensions and health care obligations .
The day the deal went down , many of the old - timers went down to Grumpy ’s Tavern and got as drunk as humanly possible .
“ It pissed you off they ’d do that to you that easily , ” says Tom Hazel .
“ You ’re like a check mark in a book .
They checked you off , after you helped them make the money they made . ”
Ken Williams was 51 then , and due to retire in another three months .
When I met him he was smartly dressed , tan , with a shaved head — except for his white walrus mustache , he recalled Telly Savalas , circa 1973 .
Williams is now working as a handyman , earning about a third of what he made at the plant .
“ It was really a hurtful time .
I was just hoping , ‘ Get me them few more days here , that ’s all I ’m asking , ' ” he recalls .
“ You were just kind of stunned , you know ?
All them years you ’d worked toward something and gave yourself to a company .
I felt totally shafted .
Now I ’m renting , probably never will own my own home .
A lot of people lost homes and dreams , the dream of putting their children through college , being able to do better for their families . ”
One of Tom Hazel ’s colleagues , a pillar of the local church , ended up living out of his Volvo , sleeping in mall parking lots and washing up in the bathroom at Burger King .
Another retrained as a pharmacy technician and landed a job at Wal - Mart , where he started with half the wages he used to have and still has virtually no benefits .
Other men got divorced or took to drinking ; one killed himself ; another landed in a mental institution .
Eugene Murphy was 50 when the plant shut down .
A feisty guy in jeans and a yellow baseball cap who devours a sausage , egg , and cheese croissant as we talk , he recalls feeling “ betrayed by the whole country .
There ’s not hardly a drop of aluminum produced anymore in the Northwest , and we used to be a powerhouse . ”
For a while after the plant shut down , Murphy drove a combine on a pea farm ; more recently , he became a security guard , earning half what he used to make .
His friend Bill Hannah found low - paid , low - benefits work at the local port .
Randy Querin , a spokesman for the regional health care company , PeaceHealth , says the number of Medicaid claimants in Longview has soared , as has the amount of charity care — care , that is , that providers and taxpayers are paying for , instead of Alcoa or Michael Lynch .
Dan Fowler , 53 when I met him , divorced , and suffering from multiple chronic health problems , was getting what medical help he could at Longview ’s family health clinic .
When he needed medication for high blood pressure , high cholesterol , weak lungs , he had to rely on free samples from the clinic .
A few years ago he had to have four cancerous lesions removed from his face ; he paid for the procedure by cashing in his 401( k ) .
When he had a scare about a possible brain tumor , he barely managed to get the requisite tests because providers demanded cash up front .
“ These are not going to be golden years , ” Fowler told me ruefully .
“ I have no job .
The things that are happening to me now medically , I know the things we did at the beginning take a toll at the end and nobody wants to be responsible for that .
I do n’t want to sell everything I have to just have medical insurance .
“ I do n’t see a good end to it .
We put in 28 to 30 years , and we get nothing . ”

In yet another Constitutionally conservative ruling , from yet another state Supreme Court , the very American values of equal protection under the law and protection of the minority against the tyranny of the majority ( and against the tyranny of Big Government intrusion into private lives ) have been upheld in Iowa today !
The Iowa Supreme Court this morning upheld a Polk County judge ’s 2007 ruling that marriage should not be limited to one man and one woman .
The ruling , viewed nationally and at home as a victory for the gay rights movement and a setback for social conservatives , means Iowa ’s 5,800 gay couples can legally marry in Iowa beginning April 24 .
...
Today ’s decision makes Iowa the first Midwestern state , and the third in the country , to allow same - sex marriages .
Lambda Legal , a gay rights group , financed the court battle and represented six couples who challenged Iowa ’s 10 - year - old ban on gay marriage .
Supreme Court Justice Mark Cady [ed note : a Republican appointee ] , who wrote the unanimous decision , at one point invoked the court ’s first - ever decision , in 1839 , which struck down slavery laws 17 years before the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the right of a slave owner to treat a person as property .
In addition to real Constitutional conservatives who should be rejoicing today , true Fiscal conservatives should also appreciate today 's ruling , which is bound to be a boon to the state 's economy since " There are no residency rules for marriage in Iowa , so the rule would apply to any couple who wanted to travel to Iowa . "
Welcome into the light of civilized society and equality for all , Iowa !
That 's three states down ( MA , CT and IA ) , with just 47 more to go !
UPDATE : As the emailed headline linking to the following article was so darn good , we just had to offer them a link for their good work : " Court Decision Deals Gay Opponents a Hard Blow "
FURTHER UPDATE : Steve Benen at Washington Monthly points out : " In recent years , four state Supreme Courts have ruled in support of same sex-marriage ...
And what do all four have in common ?
Each was appointed to their respective state Supreme Court by a Republican governor . "
Those darn ' judicial activists ' strike again !
Google has a Grants program specific for non-profit organizations trying to reach their outreach goals through advertising via Google AdWords .
I had a chance to speak with one of the first education - based recipients of the Google Grants program ; a social media marketing class at Emerson College led by Professor David Gerzof .
Having an innovative social media marketing class is impressive enough , but Professor Gerzof has enabled the class even further by incorporating real life experiences into the course .
Part of that is being achieved through Google Grants .
With the class broken into six groups , each group of students has the opportunity to run social media campaigns for their assigned non-profit .
Google advertising is one way in which outreach can become a part of a given marketing campaign in the online realm , so the Google Grants program is a useful way for the class groups to not only learn about marketing but specifically about advertising as well .
The non-profits include Piers Park Sailing Center , The Level Field Foundation , Samaritans , Farm Aid , VHL Family Alliance and Partners for Youth with Disabilities .
Being a non-profit in need of marketing is a unique situation to be in but it ’s necessary along with every other aspect of raising awareness .
And combining social media marketing efforts with the Google AdWords has even proven tricky for some of the class groups .
Whether the target market for a given non-profit is in need of honing or broadening , or the established budget for the Google Grants program proves restrictive for a particular campaign , there are limiting factors that each group has had to deal with .
Of course , being in the classroom environment has allowed the groups to get some early and necessary experience with real world applications of having to navigate an online marketing campaign .
The class also has another set of groups that are doing social media ad campaigns for start - ups , though these operate outside of the Google Grants program .
But what ’s promising with this classroom experience is that Emerson itself has the foresight to provide online marketing tools specifically for social media integration , and Google is extending its non-profit and education options for its applications and programs .
See here for more details on Google Grants .

So you ’ve downloaded our free eBook , Curly ’s Law , about the need to identify your One Thing , your True Life Purpose – but did you actually read it ?
And if you did read it – have you managed to actually identify your One Thing ?
It ’s not always easy is it ?
I gave my method for figuring out my One Thing in the book , but that was just one way .
I do n’t really know what other ways there are , or at least I did n’t until I read Brian Kim ’s excellent “ How To Finally Find What You Love to Do AND Get Paid For Doing It ! ”
The Trouble with the “ Do What You Love ” Theory
When it comes to careers , the clichéd advice is to “ do what you love ” if you want to succeed BUT what do you do if you do n’t know what you love ?
And hang on a second – do n’t you know plenty of artists , writers , healers , musicians and wannabe - entrepreneurs who know very well what they love to do but just ca n’t seem to make it pay ?
Well , if that ’s you – relax .
Brian ’s excellent little eBook ( with the very long title ) is a Godsend for those who are undecided as to what their true purpose is or who have n’t got a clue how to make their passion pay - up some cold hard cash .
4 Reasons I Highly Recommend this Book
I do n’t know Brian Kim personally , but I have been twice now impressed with his work ( read about the other time his writing blew my mind here ) .
The reasons I so heartily recommend “ How to Find What You Love To Do AND Get Paid For Doing It ” are :
There ’s no hippy - drippy nonsense ; no “ open your mind to the Universe and let the love flow in ” crap .
In case you have n’t woken up and smelled the coffee yet , all that Law of Attraction baloney does n’t work – not on its own anyway .
You can sit around and wish for success all you like , but if you do , all you ’re really doing is settling for a life of mediocrity .
Instead you need concrete , practical advice about how to get off your butt and make it happen already .
This book provides just that .
It ’s a very structured book , a practical workbook that gets you to work it out over a period of time .
Brian will have you delve deeper and deeper into your own nature until you find your True Purpose inside of you , just sitting there like a brilliant diamond waiting all this time for you to discover it .
It ’s specific – you ’ll learn “ What ” and then “ How ” .
First you find ‘ what ’ it is you truly should be doing with your life – your calling .
Once you know what this is ( and you will ) then you move on to ‘ how ’ to make it pay .
If you know you ca n’t be happy while you ’re working a dreary , dead - end day job that does n’t leave you with enough energy to pursue your dreams , then take my advice – buy this book now and get moving .
Life is short !
Stop wasting time !
There ’s no fluff .
Coming in at 52 pages , this book gets straight to the point and will have you up and at ‘em in no time .
In fact Brian says that the book was originally over 200 pages long but he boiled it down to the bare essentials so as not to overwhelm you with too much superfluous information and padding .
If only more authors would do this !
I do n’t know about you but I am a busy man and I like to just get in , get the information I need , and then get on with it .
Who Else is Ready To Get On With Fulfilling Their True Life Purpose ?
If you ’re happy in your work or have figured out what your life ’s passion is – and how to make it pay so that you do n’t need no stinkin’ day job , then do n’t buy this book .
It ’s not for those who are content with their station in life and feel they have no more learning to do , no more adventures to go on .
But if that is n’t you then you need to find out what your One Thing is now and how to go for it and succeed .
What are your other options ?
Keep working for the man forever ?
Consider these pertinent questions from Brian ’s website :
Why sacrifice almost half of your day ( if you include commuting ) 5 days a week just to enjoy your nights and weekends ?
Why sacrifice the best time period of your life so you can enjoy your golden years ?
Why put yourself through all this pain and misery for the majority of your adult life ?
When did people lie down and accept drudgery , boredom and dissatisfaction as a fact of life ?
It does n’t make any sense .
As I said at the beginning of this article , I already know my true life purpose – and I am making it pay already – but reading this book made me feel even more resolute to move on up to the next level and “ go for gold ” as the cliché goes .
Now – I paid 25 bucks for “ How to Find What You Love To Do… ” , but for a short time Brian has reduced the price to about $ 19 so click through now to check it out and ask yourself this – if you spend $ 19 on a book that finally brings you the success you have craved all your life – then is n’t that worth it ?
I reckon it is , so hop to it and Click Here Now to find out more about the book .

British racing car manufacturer Lola is considering re-entering Formula 1 next year after confirming that it has committed to a full technical , operational and financial evaulation of the project .
The Huntingdon - based company has a long history of building F1 cars and last appeared with a short - lived and unsuccessful works team at the start of the 1997 season .
However , in the wake of the FIA announcing last month its plans for teams to be able to compete in F1 under a £ 30 million budget cap , Lola executive chairman Martin Birrane now believes the time is right to consider a return .
" The announcement that teams may opt for a prudent , financially responsible ' cost - capped ' regime from 2010 has resulted in us deciding to fully evaluate the opportunity to develop a car to compete in the FIA Formula One World Championship , " he said .
" Providing world - class engineering excellence , offering high quality solutions governed by a tightly controlled financial regime has been part of Lola 's DNA over the last decade .
" The current necessity for F1 to adopt a responsible approach in times of economic uncertainty has created the ideal conditions for us to consider developing a car for the world championship . "
Birrane , who bought Lola in 1997 after its F1 team collapsed , has made no secret of his ambition to take the company back into top level of international racing .
It has been heavily involved in single - seater production in the past decade , building chassis for a wide range of categories including the defunct Champ Car World Series , Formula 3 , A1GP , F3000 and Formula Nippon .
The company also has recent experience of developing customer LMP1 and LMP2 machinery for top - line sportscar racing , with the Prodrive - run Lola Aston Martin project claiming a debut victory in the Barcelona Le Mans Series race earlier this month .
The facilities that Lola has built up for such activities in recent years means that it already has a base that could easily be adapted to develop an F1 car .
" Lola possesses the technical resources , capability and know - how to develop cars capable of competing at the very highest levels of international motor sport , including F1 , " said Birrane .
" We are therefore embracing the WMSC 's timely announcements and assessing a relevant programme for F1 with a view to making a formal entry in the coming weeks . "
Lola has already appointed engineering personnel to evaluate the possibility of an F1 return , and already has an F1 - standard windtunnel , computational fluid dynamics capability and a seven - post dynamic chassis rig in its factory .
AUTOSPORT understands that Lola is one of eight new teams that have entered into discussions with Cosworth for a supply of V8 engines for 2010 , and that it could face competition for the available grid slots from a number of other prospective teams , including the USF1 project .
Now it is nothing but torture .

The natural olympia is one of the pharmaceutical - free - bodybuilding circuit ’s premier contests , and even without steroids , its competitors look less like men than ideas of men as imagined by comic book artists — with rough - hewn backs and abdomens like stamped iron panels .
As the annual event gets under way in a ballroom at an airport hotel outside San Francisco , gaggles of these impossibly beefy men strip down to Speedos and skimpy “ posing trunks ” backstage .
They lather themselves with Dream Tan , their skin colors gradually homogenizing into a slim range of black and bronze .
They line up in front of mirrors and rehearse their poses .
From time to time , someone takes a pull of beef jerky .
Kenneth Williams sits in the audience , waiting for his turn to preen .
The 41 - year - old is irrepressibly handsome , with a mayoral smile , shaved head , and tiny triangular tattoo under his left eye .
At 6 feet , 190 pounds , he ’s “ still in the baby stage ” ; he hopes to gain another 25 pounds .
After a four - year hiatus from bodybuilding , he ’s spent the last seven months resculpting his musculature — all on a diet of fruits , vegetables , seeds , nuts , legumes , and lots of soy protein .
In a feat that he claims “ shocked the world , ” Williams placed third in the novice division of the Natural Olympia in 2004 , becoming a major figure in the exceedingly minor subculture of vegan bodybuilding .
So far , just a few vegans have infiltrated the elite levels of professional sports , such as Kansas City Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez , the former Atlanta Hawks guard Salim Stoudamire , and Ultimate Fighting Championship bruiser Mac Danzig .
Williams is on a mission to inflate his body into a bulging rejoinder to the myth that you ca n’t build muscle on a plant - based diet .
“ If you think of a vegan , ” he says , “ you think of someone who is skinny and frail , who has issues .
A tree hugger .
Smells funny .
I ’m putting the breath of life back into people .
I ’m out to save lives . ”
Williams is also out for fame — huge , ridiculous fame , and all the money and influence that come with athletic stardom .
“ The legend of Kenneth Williams ” is not a phrase he is uncomfortable using .
It ’s only a matter of time , Williams believes , before big companies realize what a “ conscious athlete ” can do for their brand .
“ This is what I want : $ 10 million with $ 2 million cash in hand , ” Williams told me a few days before the Natural Olympia .
“ Imagine ‘ Nike Natural . ’
When Nike gives me a deal , I ’ll outsell Michael Jordan . ”
Then he pitched me his ideas for hybrid car commercials .
When the “ Open Men Tall ” class is announced , Williams and 11 other competitors file onto the stage , toe a yellow line , and follow a monotonous cycle of commands : “ Quarter turn to the right … Abdominals with one leg extended … Lat spread … Face front . ”
Bodybuilding is about exhibiting muscles , not using them .
Thus the 20 - minute series of poses that isolate parts of the anatomy while a long table of judges , like usda inspectors , silently grade the meat in front of them .
Williams , far stage right , transitions fluidly between poses , almost tai chi-like .
He is impressively chiseled , but it ’s impossible not to notice that he ’s dramatically smaller and less defined than nearly everyone else .
When a Briton with angel - white hair assumes the signature “ pump you up ” pose , called “ crab most muscular , ” it looks like he ’s wearing a rubber strongman suit .
Williams , like many bodybuilders , says he does n’t know his own measurements , but it looks like his chest is a good 12 inches smaller than the 50 - inch ones around him .
He is fit , yes .
But the former arena football player and firefighter looks like a mere underwear model among titans .
There ’s a certain Neolithic simplicity to building muscle by devouring the muscle of another living thing .
For example , Dexter “ The Blade ” Jackson , last year ’s Mr. Olympia and a three - time Arnold Classic champion , routinely bookends a day of steak and chicken eating with 10 egg whites .
( “ My metabolism is very special , ” he notes . )
Meat is such an obvious delivery device for protein that bodybuilders often use the two words interchangeably .
When I tell Jackson that I am writing about a vegan bodybuilder , he is incredulous : “ There ’s no way you ’d be a pro bodybuilder without meat .
I ’ve never heard of anyone who does n’t eat protein . ”
“ I ca n’t think of any reason why muscle ca n’t be built on a vegan diet , ” says nutrition professor Marion Nestle , the author of What to Eat .
Going vegan , she explains , should have no effect on the performance of normal athletes , provided they eat a balanced diet .
But bodybuilders ’ diets are anything but balanced :
When they ’re bulking up , they may consume between 1.5 and 2 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day .
That ’s a ridiculous amount , Nestle says , about twice what ’s recommended for strength - training athletes and enough to cause chronic kidney problems .
And because plant - based sources of protein are generally far less concentrated than animal sources , a vegan muscleman must eat even more food ( or protein powder ) than a carnivore .
Nestle says the thought of protein - pounding bodybuilders , vegan or not , “ makes me want to throw up just to think about it . ”
It was at 3 a.m. five years ago that , while fixing a middle - of - the - night meal , Williams “ had the awakening . ”
“ I had two pieces of fried chicken , rice , and salad , ” he recalls .
For some reason , he could n’t stop glaring at the chicken .
“ I was thinking about all the killing and the destruction going on in the world .
And I looked down at that chicken and said , ‘ I ’m eating death , and I do n’t even know why . ' ”
He scraped the meat off his plate and went back to sleep a changed man .
He had never heard the word “ vegan ” before .
All he knew was , “ The spirit told me , ‘ Nothing from an animal .
You do n’t eat nothing from an animal until you find out what ’s going on . ' ”
He entered the 2004 Natural Olympia to prove a point to his meat - loving gym buddies , “ not knowing , ” as he puts it , “ that the stardom was just around the corner . ”
Elliot Katz , president of the Bay Area - based animal rights group In Defense of Animals ( ida ) , heard about Williams ’ feat and started going to local gyms , asking if anyone knew the vegan bodybuilder .
One gargantuan fellow , Katz remembers , told him , “ There ’s no such thing . ”
Katz eventually found Williams and made him the poster boy for a campaign with the catchphrase “ Go Vegan and No Body Gets Hurt . ”
Pictures of Williams balancing a yellow chick on his deltoid or hoisting a massive wicker cornucopia of fruits and vegetables appeared on billboards and in vegetarian magazines .
He went to animal rights conventions and hosted 52 episodes of Undercover TV , which featured footage of animal abuse inside factory farms , rodeos , and zoos .
After a four - year break from competition , early last year , he realized the best way to continue his vegan evangelism .
“ The universe said , ‘ Ken , it ’s time to get back into bodybuilding . ' ”
We popped into ida ‘s Marin County offices , where Williams wanted me to meet Katz , whom he now considers a mentor .
( After some catching up , Williams helped put a heavy wooden desk back against the wall ; a couple of employees had dragged it out to rescue a potato bug . )
Katz told me he sees Williams as the clearest contradiction to the assumption that “ if you ’re a vegan , you ’re just this weakling kind of a thing . ”
Williams generally eats between 210 and 250 grams of protein a day — what you ’d find in about 2.5 pounds of lean top sirloin .
He eats six or seven meals daily , and a few mornings before the Olympia , I watched him prepare his second breakfast .
He made a shake : water , 50 grams of soy protein , and three supplement powders made by HealthForce Nutritionals , his sponsor .
The drink looked like pesto and tasted like a forest floor , but Williams seemed to genuinely enjoy it .
He has three of these a day , supplementing a diet of tofu , red and black beans , nuts , lentils , and leafy greens like kale .
Bodybuilders generally spend three to four months “ cutting up ” before a competition — having blown up muscle , they now whittle away everything else .
In the week before a show , this sculpting process intensifies , as they reduce their sodium intake and gradually cut back on water .
“ You ’re trying to drain out all the excess water and get paper - thin and dry , ” explains Williams , who took an herbal diuretic for two days before the Natural Olympia .
In pursuit of the perfect body , the vegan bodybuilder , like all bodybuilders , subjects himself to indignities not unlike those visited on industrial cattle .
Which only highlights the irony of Williams ’ quest to cure what he calls our “ eating psychosis . ”
As we talk about adopting a more sustainable diet , should we see a guy who eats four times his share of protein as a role model , or the equivalent of a biofuel - powered Hummer ?
Finally , after a judge dismisses the contestants , Williams shakes out his hands and arms , claps enthusiastically a few times , and exits .
As he turns , a large tattoo of the ida logo — the silhouettes of a dog , cat , and rabbit — comes into view on his upper left arm .
He knows immediately that he has n’t won anything — he will , in fact , finish 12th out of 12 .
“ I ’ve done everything the universe told me to , ” he says backstage .
He heads into the ballroom to watch the top class of marquee competitors and support his friend — a tanklike Nigerian in a green velvet G - string named Moses Ajala .
Williams whispers to me that he hopes to qualify for this elite class in two years .
He ’s determined to keep eating “ what the gods and goddesses put on Earth for us to eat , ” bulk up to 215 pounds , and win the whole thing .
“ I want to come in big , ” he says .
LOS ANGELES 
Most summer school programs for students from elementary through high school will be canceled this year , the latest casualty of California ’s widening budget gap , the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District said Friday .
Core curriculum courses , available only to those who need credits to graduate , will remain open , the superintendent , Raymond C. Cortines , said .
But other summer classes will not be offered , nor will non-academic programs like recreational activities for younger children , Mr. Cortines said , leaving many whose parents work at loose ends .
Students who do not need credits will be shut out of courses like math and English .
Roughly 225,000 students attend summer school in an average year , a district spokeswoman , Gayle Pollard - Terry , said .
“ This is unfortunate , ” Mr. Cortines said of the cancellations .
“ This goes against my education values , but I have cut in every area , and the cuts I made first were farthest away from students . ”
For more than 30 years , New York ’s draconian drug laws have been among the toughest in the nation , requiring sentences of 15 years to life even for nonviolent first - time offenders .
Worse , New York ’s early example was followed by states across the country , furthering a flawed strategy that was as harmful to society , in many ways , as drug use itself .
The result has been wasted law enforcement resources -- as if police could arrest away drug addiction -- and a national incarceration crisis .
Millions of lives were destroyed .
So we were pleased to hear that New York Gov. David Paterson and a group of legislators have agreed to repeal the state ’s mandatory minimum sentences for low - level drug offenders , permit some addicts to go into treatment rather than face prison time , and allow inmates in some cases to seek reductions of their sentences .
It represents nothing less than the demise of the Rockefeller drug laws , named after Gov. Nelson Rockefeller , who pushed them through in 1973 .
When they were first implemented , the laws appealed to a public panicked by escalating heroin use , particularly in cities .
But three decades later , the research is conclusive : Treatment is more cost - effective than prison , and long - term programs are best for reducing recidivism .
States are finally getting the message .
In 2000 , California voters , facing a severe incarceration crisis , approved new laws allowing convicted offenders to be sent to treatment instead of prison .
Since then , a UCLA study showed , the incarceration rate for drug possession offenses has dropped by more than 34 % , and the state saves $ 2.50 for every dollar invested .
Last year , Massachusetts became the first state to make possession of an ounce or less of marijuana a civil infraction , the equivalent of a parking ticket .
But de-escalating the drug war state by state is inefficient ; federal leadership is necessary .
To that end , Sen. Jim Webb ( D - Va. ) has introduced a bill that would set up a commission to scrutinize the nation ’s penal system and make recommendations for its overhaul .
Among other tasks , the commission would review drug laws and examine racial disparities in sentencing -- drug consumption is equal across the races , but blacks account for 37 % of those arrested , 59 % of those convicted and 74 % of those incarcerated .
The White House and congressional leaders from both parties have backed the bill .
Just as the Rockefeller laws led to similarly harsh measures in other states , we hope their repeal will inspire reforms across the country and give Congress the will , finally , to do the same .
Sun 's Garbage
First garbage collector ( hereafter referred to by its nickname G1 ) is the new low latency garbage collector planned to replace CMS in the Hotspot JVM .
It is a server - style collector , targeted at multi- processor machines with large amounts of memory .
There are two major differences between CMS and G1 .
The first is that G1 is a compacting collector .
Compacting , a process by which live objects are moved over free memory space towards one end of the heap so that the other becomes one contiguous free area of memory , is important in long running applications because it is inevitable that the heap will fragment over time .
G1 compacts sufficiently to completely avoid the use of fine - grain free lists for allocation , which considerably simplifies parts of the collector and mostly eliminates potential fragmentation issues .
As well as compacting , G1 offers more predictable garbage collection pauses than can be obtained with the CMS collector and allows users to set their desired pause targets .
This strong determinism gives G1 some of the characteristics of a true real - time collector but it is n't genuinely hard real - time since factors like OS scheduling still mean that the pauses cannot be guaranteed .
It is however considerably easier for developers to use than the Java real - time products since existing code is able to take advantage of the improved performance that it offers without needing to make any code - level changes .
G1 uses a number of interesting techniques , based on global marking information and other metrics , to prioritise regions for collection according to their GC efficiency .
A previous InfoQ article provides more of the technical details .
In a recent podcast , James Gosling highlights the importance of G1 for certain kinds of large - scale Java applications , such as financial exchanges , which are characterised by large amounts of live heap data and considerable thread - level parallelism , and are often run on high - end multi-core processors :
" ... the deep hidden secret about many of these Java apps is that they do n't really use databases .
Instead of databases they use huge amounts of RAM and push the garbage collector like mad because they cannot afford to touch the disk ever .
When you are doing many , many thousands of transactions per second it's all about keeping everything in RAM , using hash tables , getting as many cores focused on the transactions as possible , and they usually have big issues about transaction latency . "
Gosling goes on to talk about the trade - offs between throughput and determinism .
Typically a garbage collector is optimised for one or the other .
A garbage collector optimised for throughput is ideally suited to tasks like long running batch jobs , where pauses for the garbage collector are less of an issue than getting the entire batch run to complete as rapidly as possible .
Conversely , if you are working on an interactive system such as a web application , then a low latency garbage collector is generally the best choice .
Gosling makes the point that these trade - offs also exist elsewhere in the JVM and that generally the JVM is optimised for throughput .
Indeed :
" It happens everywhere where there are algorithms that reorganise anything .
So take a hash table - everyone thinks that a hash table is constant time insertion and constant time removal , which is false .
It 's constant time insertion until it has to re-hash and then that one insertion will take a long time . "
By allowing users to specify an explicit target that garbage collection consume no more than x ms of any y ms time slice , G1 can try to keep collection pauses as small and infrequent as necessary for the application , but not so low as to decrease throughput or increase footprint unnecessarily .
Given that garbage collectors are one of the areas where the throughput / low latency trade - off is most visible , G1 should offer significant benefits to Java Enterprise developers .
It is available in the early access release of Java 6 update 14 and Sun's Hotspot team are extremely keen to get feedback and bug reports from early adopters .
Do you know the difference between a religion and a cult ?
Salman over at Irtiqa has a very welcome post about the terminology of these things .
It ’s the subject of a very significant debate in the study of contemporary religion today , especially since it has such real legal ramifications .
These days , all eyes are on the trial going on in France in which Scientology is being accused of fraud and manipulation .
The trial has inspired , for instance , a discussion at the Guardian ’s Belief section on “ What makes a cult ? ”
Salman turns to an entry in the beautiful new edition of the Encyclopedia of Religion for some help :
The terms cult and sect are regarded as stereotype - loaded terms that are associated with new or unpopular religious movements , and these terms are thus mostly avoided by scholars .
They are , however , widely used by the media and by groups ( especially so - called anticult groups ) that perceive certain new religious movements as objectionable and dangerous .
In contemporary English , cult functions as the derogatory word , with sect reserved for less controversial groups .
In French , German , Spanish , and Italian , the derogatory word is the local equivalent of sect , and the word cult is rarely used .
Some dictionaries now translate the French secte and similar non-English words with cult rather than with sect .
Originally , however , the English cult and sect were nonpejorative , scholarly terms .
In recent years , the term “ new religious movement ” has been used by those scholars who do n’t want to approach their subject with a tone of hostility from the outset .
Even so , in the United States , the vocabulary of “ cult ” vs. “ religion ” ( and the corollary , “ brainwashing ” vs. “ conversion ” ) has so proliferated in public consciousness that virtually any new religious movement becomes instantly classed as illegitimate compared to the legitimate historical faiths .
This same terminological poverty might also be the reason people involved in certain alternative spiritualities are so insistent that they have no religion at all — they ’re stuck between a rock and a hard place .
“ New religious movement ” is a mouthful ( some say , simply , “ new religion ” ) , but its consequences are well worth making available to the wider culture .
Because , when you scratch away the stereotypes on the surface , the difference between religion and cult melt away surprisingly quickly .
If one is to grant Christianity and Islam legal and social legitimacy , one becomes compelled to do so also for the small , new movements that so much resemble their early stages .
It is an affirmation of the religious creativity of human beings , which is so much vaster and more ever - present than many people have been allowed to realize .
Or , for some , an appreciation of how widespread foolish superstition is — not just confined to the deluded popes and imams and rabbis and their henchmen .
Recognizing that there are thousands of new movements popping up around the world at any given time helps us understand better the origins and development of the great traditions .
It ’s serious stuff , with people ’s lives and communities , and cosmologies in the balance .
But it ’s also a fantastic circus .

Barcelona coach Ronald Koeman has said Lionel Messi's happiness is not in his hands but admits he was pleased to hear the Argentine saying on Tuesday he wants to end his disputes with the club .
This one might need to be filed in the Duh category , but according to analysis by Douglas Taylor , the managing director of consulting group , Burton - Taylor , Bloomberg and Reuters are facing steep revenue losses for 2009 .
In a story based on his report , published by financial news rival Dow Jones ( sub req .'d ) , it is estimated that " global spending by the securities industry on data , largely through leasing desktop terminals , is forecast to shrink by 3 % , or $ 700 m , this year . "
As a result Bloomberg and Reuters will get hit with big losses , as they are the industry leaders in this realm .
Taylor thinks they could lose $ 500 million in revenue this year .
Last December , we reported that Bloomberg LLP had a rough November , with net sales down about 1,100 for the month .
We 've heard that terminal sales were down in December too , and there is no reason to be optimistic that financial companies are going to shell out $ 1500 a month for data terminals .
We do n't think that the TARP'd up banks are going to be spending loads of their government cash on terminals .
Earlier this year Bloomberg thinned the ranks of its unprofitable television and radio staff , laying off 100 employees .
An unarmed man fatally shot by a Bay Area Rapid Transit officer on New Year ’s Day contributed to the incident by hitting one of the two officers who initially detained him , according to court documents filed by the agency Friday .
BART filed a legal response in federal court to a $ 50 million wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of 22 - year - old Oscar Grant who was fatally shot at an Oakland transit station .
Dale Allen , an attorney representing BART , said Grant ’s shooting death by former officer Johannes Mehserle , 27 , was “ a tragic accident . ”
Last month , Grant ’s family sued BART , Mehserle , BART police chief Gary Gee , and officers Tony Pirone and Marysol Domenici .
The lawsuit says Pirone threatened to use his Taser on Grant and his friends if they did not comply with his orders .
Pirone ’s attorney , Bill Rapoport , has said that Grant provoked Pirone ’s blow by trying to knee Pirone at least twice .
“ It is our position that there was a provocation and assault on Mr. Pirone based upon a video that shows Mr. Grant apparently hitting Mr. Pirone with his knee , ” Allen said .
Domenici is accused of repeatedly pointing her Taser and threatening to stun them in the face .
However , Friday ’s filing by BART said the officers were just defending themselves .
“ Oscar Grant willfully , wrongfully , and unlawfully made an assault upon defendants and would have beaten , bruised , and ill - treated them if defendants had not immediately defended themselves , ” the response said .
“ ( The ) defendants necessarily and unavoidably came in contact with decedent Oscar Grant and threatened him , but no more than was necessary for said defense . ”
Meanwhile , Grant family attorney John Burris on Friday maintains the shooting was intentional and called the filing , “ legal mumbo jumbo . ”
Mehserle has pleaded not guilty to murder and is free on $ 3 million bail .
He has a preliminary hearing May 18 .
Mehserle ’s attorney , Michael Rains , has previously said his client had meant to fire his Taser when he fired a single shot with his pistol .
The shooting — which grabbed national attention after cell phone videos of the incident began circulating on the Internet and television — continues to cause community outrage and has led to numerous protests and arrests .
Allen said in a phone interview Friday that BART acknowledges Grant was shot in the back but denies Pirone and Domenici were unprovoked when they tried to detain Grant .
He said the officers were justified in pulling Grant and his friends from a train because witnesses had identified them as being involved in an earlier fight .
Allen also believes the officers used reasonable force to detain Grant because he was resisting arrest .
However , Allen said there was no reason for Mehserle to shoot Grant , adding that the officer “ made a horrible , terrible mistake , ” firing his gun instead of his Taser while trying to subdue Grant .
Allen said he ’s hoping that the lawsuit can be settled through mediation .
Burris said the filing has no impact on his assessment of the case .
He has said Grant was unlawfully detained , arrested and deprived of urgent medical care after being shot .

' Protecting children ' ... by comparing them to Hitler Youth
by Jeremy Hooper
Since the election , we 've noticed a frightening upswing in the far - right 's willingness to trot out Nazi comparisons to make their partisan points .
But for the most part these offensive links have been confined to President Obama and his administration , all of whom ( a ) knew what they were getting into when they signed up for public life , and ( b ) are old enough to take it .
Because seriously , who would be cold enough to bring underage children or teens into these rhetorical shenanigans ?
Meet Ms. Cold Enough , WorldNetDaily columnist Judith Reisman :
Such American classroom indoctrination is now found in " hate " and sexual diversity training and in 3,500 nationwide Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network ( GLSEN ) school clubs .
Under color of a " Safe Schools Movement " battling alleged " bullying " of so - called " gay " children ( K - 12 ) , some see GLSEN as a modern version of the Hitler Youth and as preparing the ground for a larger , sweeping , schoolroom Youth Brigade .
...
Both the GLSEN youth and the Hitler Youth were trained to be revolutionary leaders of the brave new world order .
GLSEN school clubs and their teacher sponsor / trainers are now funded by major corporations and by some state funds .
GLESN's Day of Silence and " GAY ALLY ! " pledge cards for kindergartners and other children are direct assaults on traditional parental , American values .
GLSEN and the Hitler Youth [ WND ]
World Net Daily Columnist Compares GLSEN , Day of Silence Participants to Hitler Youth [ GLSEN ]
Supporting equality for LGBT people / Supporting history 's most notorious genocidal dictator .
Do we really need to waste any words showing you the flaw in that almost unbelievable comparison ?
We think notsee .
The only fair comparison between gay and gay - supportive teens and Hitler Youth involves their potential participation in a production of Cabaret :
Everything else is disturbing , disgusting , and deeply disingenuous for a movement that claims to have the interests of children at heart !
Your thoughts
Ugh .
I see Ms. Reisman is done beating up on Alfred Kinsey for now .

Seriously ?
This is what the " pro-family " side has always done - their main talking - point has always been about Homosexuals preying on America 's children - Judith Reisman 's column show just how desperate they have become .

And who said the reality tv bubble was set to burst ?
Sure , we ’ve all been subject to the law of diminshing returns ( or reruns ) , but up crops Herman Munster / Muppet offspring Susan Boyle and suddenly there ’s nothing hotter in watercooler gossip - gabble .
Following Susan ’s ‘ shocking ’ debut on Britain ’s Got Talent last week , she has since sung to millions on Good Morning America and is now set to appear on the Oprah Winfrey Show .
Which means she is now officially more famous than Robbie Williams .
Funny , sure , but we ’re sorry – we just do n’t get it .
Yippee – she can sing .
And she ’s ugly .
A little surprising , sure , but why the hell is Queen of the Universe Oprah deciding to bless her with her ( no doubt satanically sourced ) seal of approval ?
We understand fuglies are n’t the most well - represented minority in today ’s image - conscious society , but it ’s not a freakin’ disability .
Does n’t anyone else think this more than a little patronising ?
Oh sweet merciful Zeus ( Or Oprah – same thing in America ) .
Is Susan Boyle our new Leona Lewis ?
You know the ‘ Bleeding Love ’ video ?
Now imagine the Boyle - meister recreating it .
Phwoar .
What do you think ?
Are we completely off - base ?
Does she deserve a blossoming music AND movie career ?
Or has this reality thing just got too out of hand ?
Sound off below … .
CINCINNATI ( Reuters ) - While U.S. President Barack Obama tries to claw back bonuses paid to AIG employees , Americans facing pay cuts and job losses are outraged that some refuse to share the pain of the recession .
“ It ’s not fair , ” said Nancy Johns , echoing millions of Americans who watch with disbelief as Washington and Wall Street battle over whether to recover millions in corporate bonuses paid out by firms that received government bailouts .
AIG , an insurance giant that is being kept alive on a taxpayer - funded $ 180 billion lifeline , is paying out $ 165 million in bonuses for 2008 .
It has argued that it is legally obliged to meet employee retention payments .
Ordinary people have trouble understanding that logic .
Johns was working as a daycare provider in Cincinnati in 2007 when the economic downturn hit .
The subsequent slump in daycare demand led to her work hours being cut from 40 hours a week to 25 -- dropping her weekly paycheck to just over $ 200 .
“ You could n’t get enough hours to buy food for your kids , ” said Johns , who has a five - year - old daughter .
She quit her job , the family sold their second car , and she spent $ 20,000 to go back to school to retrain as a medical billing specialist .
Her year - long struggle has eased now that she has a job handling medical paperwork , but she ’s outraged that some at the top rungs of the income ladder are helping themselves to big payouts while the less fortunate lose their jobs and homes .
“ There were no guarantees for us , ” she said .
Others question the financial merit of paying out bonuses in companies that were on the brink of the collapse until the government stepped in .
“ I always thought bonuses were contingent on a job well done , not for simply showing up , or mindlessly driving the company over a cliff , ” said Dave Blank , a medical supplies salesman in Milwaukee , Wisconsin .
“ So what have those bonus - worthy executives done so well ? ”
CONCESSIONS MADE
In Arizona , unemployed manager Don Yows , 50 , is furious about the AIG bonuses , which have prompted threats from the Obama administration and lawmakers in Congress and made newspaper headlines across the country .
“ My frustration is two - fold : why they feel they are entitled to it , it ’s a level of arrogance .
I ’m angry , angry .
And number two , how they ’ve gotten away with it so far , ” said Yows , who lost his technology job in December .
“ I ’m looking for any job ... bonuses are n’t even a part of the consideration , it ’s just getting a job and being gainfully employed right now . ”
A belief that Americans have made concessions to help save jobs , especially in hard - hit sectors such as the auto industry , has helped to fuel the popular outrage over the corporate bonuses .
Thousands of white - collar workers have accepted unpaid furloughs , Congress forced U.S. automakers to wring concessions from their employees before receiving federal aid , and many workers have swallowed pay freezes .
At the same time others , particularly on Wall Street , say the furor over bonuses has been blown out of proportion .
They note that the payouts represent a sliver of government bailout funds and resulted from legally binding contracts .
That argument , however , rankles Tony Montana , a spokesman for the United Steelworkers of America , which represents workers in industries as diverse as steel and nursing .
“ A lot of companies have come to our union and said ‘ Please let us renegotiate our contract , ’ ” Montana said .
“ Our union has been very pro-active and very flexible with our employers because we do recognize the circumstances . ”
“ It is unfair to expect rank and file union members around the country to accept concessions or cutbacks while CEOs and other executives are raking in the benefits from their lucrative employment contracts , ” Montana said .
WASHINGTON --
Most charities once refused cash carrying a whiff of scandal .
Now they often are accepting -- and in some cases seeking -- campaign contributions from disgraced Wall Street firms and figures that have been unloaded by politicians eager to escape public outrage .
President Barack Obama , White House economic adviser Larry Summers and several members of Congress said they have given away money they received from fallen banks or mortgage companies and disgraced financiers like Bernard Madoff and R. Allen Stanford .
In years past , charities have refused tobacco company money , gambling winnings and contributions from companies whose labor and benefits policies they disagree with .
But with charities reporting substantial drops in giving in 2008 , many philanthropies feel they are n't in a position to be as selective .
The nation 's financial scandals have had a direct impact on charities :
The Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity , for example , lost $ 15.2 million -- virtually all its assets -- which were invested with indicted financier Bernard Madoff .
But in Congress , those same scandals have provided charities with an additional spigot of cash , and politicians are emerging as influential -- if controversial -- new philanthropists .
Ellen Roman , executive director of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Southeastern Connecticut , part of the national network of Boys and Girls Clubs , got $ 4,000 from Senate Banking Committee chairman Sen. Christopher Dodd ( D. , Conn. ) , who received the money as a donation from fallen mortgage giant Countrywide Financial Corp .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Barack Obama plans to abolish restrictions on family travel and remittances to Cuba , fulfilling a campaign promise , the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday .
Obama does not intend to call for lifting the longstanding trade embargo against Cuba , which would require congressional action , the Journal said , citing an unidentified administration official .
The Obama administration is not considering any specific diplomatic outreach toward Cuba ’s communist government , the newspaper reported .
The removal of limits on family travel and cash remittances would allow Cuban Americans and Cuban emigres living in the United States to travel freely to the island , instead of once a year at present , and remove the ceiling of $ 1,200 per person in cash remittances to family members in Cuba .
The U.S. president has authority to loosen these rules on his own , and the move is likely meant as a signal of a new attitude toward both Cuba and other Latin American countries that have pressed the United States to alter its policy , the Journal said .
Obama will meet with Latin American leaders at a hemispheric summit this month in Trinidad and Tobago .
The U.S. Congress is currently considering bills that would lift the ban on U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba that was introduced with other sanctions in the early 1960s when Fidel Castro ’s revolution turned Cuba into a Soviet ally .

Mexican President Felipe Calderon issued an emergency decree on Saturday giving the government special powers to run tests on sick people and order them isolated to fight the deadly flu crisis .
[ efoods ]
Mexico City has already shut schools and museums and canceled sporting and cultural events as an outbreak of a new type of swine flu killed up to 68 people in the country and spread north to infect some people in the United States .
Saturday ’s decree , published in Mexico ’s official journal , gives the government power to isolate sick people , enter homes or workplaces and regulate air , sea and land transportation to try to stop further infection .
The flu has rattled residents of Mexico ’s overcrowded capital of some 20 million people .
Calderon tried to calm Mexicans earlier on Saturday , saying the flue was curable .
He said health authorities easily had enough antiviral medicine for the 1,000 or so people suspected to be infected with the swine flu and that his government was monitoring the situation “ minute by minute . ”

Co-director of the Children ’s Research Centre at Trinity College Dublin , Prof Sheila Greene , said there was no evidence that children in lesbian and gay families were experiencing the kind of problems that some people had predicted .
Prof Greene said : “ Children within gay and lesbian families are not any more or less gay , they are not confused and they do n’t suffer from mental health problems to any greater or lesser extend than children being reared by a biological mother and father . ”
She said debates about who should and should not parent children in Ireland must be informed by scientific evidence rather than unfounded assumptions , and sometimes biased beliefs , about the outcomes for children in lesbian and gay families .
The professor was one of the guest speakers at a national symposium called Marriage Matters for Lesbian and Gay People in Dublin , organised by the National Gay and Lesbian Federation .
She said it was now widely accepted that of the many reasons why children develop emotional or behavioural problems , the sexual orientation of parents did not appear to be one .
But Prof Greene said being raised by lesbian and gay parents was not plain sailing and she urged parents to be aware of the challenges that their children might face .
It was already known from recent Irish research that there was a high level of homophobia and bullying among young people .
“ If children are teased because they wear glasses or because their parents were separated , it was reasonable to expect that children may be teased because of the sexual orientation of their parents .
“ This will mean that children may have bad moments , like any others , not that they will be psychologically scarred or suffer from mental health problem .
The important issue is that parents must be tuned into the needs of their children , ” she said .
Meanwhile , well known British - based human rights and gay rights campaigner , Peter Tatchell , said the Irish Government ’s proposed civil partnership legislation was a big mistake and an insult to same - sex couples .
“ It is a rejection of marriage equality .
Separate laws for gay people are not equal laws , ” said Mr Tatchell .
The campaigner urged the Irish Government not to go down the same road as Britain with its flawed system of civil partnerships .
Comment New research has confirmed a reality which is obvious to many , but which can seldom be acknowledged in British mainstream politics : that it is primarily the fact of drugs being illegal which makes them so damaging to society .
Furthermore , if drugs were legalised - even assuming a huge increase in their use - the public purse would gain substantially .
The confirmation comes in a report from the thinktank Transform , funded by charitable foundations and individual donors .
In it , the authors note the poor record to date of today 's prohibitive drug laws , which were " established with the clear aim of reducing drug supply and use , but have achieved the exact opposite on a consistent basis " .
In the year 1970 , the UK had fewer than 2000 dependent heroin and cocaine users ; by the turn of the century there were 100,000 in government treatment programmes and as many as 200,000 more in the population .
The report 's authors also note the rather capricious nature of the UK 's drug laws : dangerous alcohol and tobacco are regulated but permitted , and comparatively innocuous substances such as ecstasy and cannabis forbidden .
This backfires , of course : as alcohol is mostly supplied by legal and regulated channels , a parent - for instance - actually has more visibility of and control over a teenager 's alcohol consumption than his or her possible heroin , cocaine or skunk habit .
Transform also points out the ridiculous way in which the case for prohibition is pushed , citing as an example the HIV / AIDS epidemic which resulted among intravenous drug users sharing needles - a direct consequence of prohibition , not of drug use itself .
Nonetheless , the Home Office actually sought to use this to justify strict drug laws .
In this case a specific drug - related harm that is almost exclusively the result of the highrisk behaviours , rituals , products and environments that stem directly from prohibition and the default underground drug cultures it creates , is perversely being used both to justify the continuation of the very policy that has fostered it in the first instance , and also to argue against the policy [ legalisation and regulation ] that would largely eliminate it .
In the study , the Transform analysts generally describe a worst - case scenario for legalisation and regulation .
They consider only the benefits from legalised use of cocaine and heroin ; they assume that there would be little or no tax revenue from these drug users .
Potential taxation revenue is assumed to be fairly small ( for the non-prescribed opiate and cocaine market ) , in the region of tens of millions , once the inflationary pressures of prohibition are removed .
These figures have not been calculated or included .
The analysis also ignores many large potential benefits to Blighty of legalised drug use , such as no longer having to fight the war in Afghanistan with one hand tied behind our backs .
( One of the greatest handicaps for our troops there is that they are committed to wiping out the opiate - farming sector , the region 's main profitable business .
This drives people into the arms of the Taliban , as well as offering them a ready source of funds . )
But this is not included in the report .
We have deliberately been conservative in our assumptions regarding the benefits of moving to legal regulation of drugs , and the costs of prohibition .
Substantial and acknowledged costs of the current system of prohibition , prominently including international drug enforcement and the illicit trade ’s impact on destabilisation of producer and transit countries ( conflict , corruption , terrorism in Afghanistan for example ) , are not included ...
The main , easily visible benefit of legalisation , according to Transform , would be that junkies would no longer need to mug and burgle to pay for their habits .
Legal drugs would be much cheaper than prohibited ones , so that even poor addicts could afford them .
They would then leave the rest of us alone , which would save an enormous fortune in policing , court and prison costs .
There would still be drug crime of the same sort as today 's alcohol crime : druggies fighting , crashing cars , vandalising and breaching the peace the way drinkers do .
But the habit - feeding robbery would largely cease .
It is a relatively small subset of the using population , made up of marginalised low income dependent users offending to fund their drug use , who are disproportionately responsible for creating the secondary £ 13.9 billion in acquisitive crime costs from the £ 3.7 billion turnover of the illicit market for heroin and cocaine .
That the heroin and cocaine market , freed of the distorting influence of criminal market economic pressures , would likely be worth around one tenth of the £ 3.7 billion figure highlights this particular negative impact of prohibition economics even more starkly .
Over half of all UK property crime is to fund drug misuse , primarily heroin and cocaine .
If drugs were available on prescription or at affordable prices comparable to those paid by dependent drinkers , it is assumed that levels of acquisitive crime related to fundraising would be negligible .
Intoxication - related offences would be unchanged ( at a given level of use ) .

I 'll preface this post by saying I am not a lawyer .
And I invite any constitutional experts to weigh in with their views in the comment space below .
But I am someone who pays attention to legal issues and who has a working knowledge of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms .
I believe that there are grounds for voters in several constituencies to challenge the results of the May 12 election on the basis that their votes are worth less than people living in other constituencies .
Section 3 of the charter recognizes that every citizen has a right to vote .
Section 15 states that every individual is equal and has the right to equal protection and benefit of the law without discrimination based on such things as race , religion , ethnic origin , and physical or mental disability .
However under B.C.'s electoral - district system , some citizens ' votes are far more powerful than others .
That 's because there are massive population differentials between different constituencies .
In Richmond -- which has a large Chinese Canadian population -- there is one MLA for more than 60,000 residents .
In New Westminster , which has a large multicultural population , there is one MLA for 63,929 residents .
If you skip across the Vancouver , Burnaby , and Surrey constituencies , the ratios are n't much different .
But step outside of Metro Vancouver , and there are ratios of one MLA for every 21,317 residents in Stikine , one MLA for every 23,348 residents in North Coast , and one MLA for every 27,354 residents in Peace River South .
The residents in these rural constituencies have a far more powerful vote .
That 's not fair .
An electoral boundaries commission tried to create more fairness in 2007 , but the members of the legislature overruled its recommendations .
It 's tough for an MLA to service a sprawling rural constituency , but that does n't mean residents should have votes that pack two or three times the punch of a voter in Richmond , Vancouver , Burnaby or Surrey .
I think if this election is really close , someone could challenge the results on the basis that the electoral - district configuration is unconstitutional .
They could make the argument that it discriminates against people on the basis of their race or national origin .
We only have one cabinet minister of Chinese descent , Ida Chong .
There is only one cabinet minister of South Asian descent , Wally Oppal .
Why is the cabinet so heavily tilted toward Caucasians ?
It 's because there is a disproportionate number of seats in districts with larger Caucasian populations .
I 'm guessing that this alone could cause a judge to strike down the boundaries on the basis that they discriminate against people on the basis of their race and national origin .
Now , let 's move to the referendum for a single transferable ballot .
Under this system , residents in metropolitan Victoria would get seven MLAs .
Those who live in the Peace River district would get two MLAs .
Is it fair that one person gets seven people to represent him or her and another only gets two ?
STV advocates say there is representation by population because the number of seats is allocated on the basis of a district 's population .
That could stand up in court .
Or perhaps it could be struck down under section three of the charter .
But why did n't Premier Gordon Campbell test - drive it first by submitting it to the court on a reference before we launched this multimillion - dollar referendum vote ?
Why did n't the attorney general make this recommendation ?
We have an attorney general , Wally Oppal , who is supposed to be looking after these types of issues .
So far , I 've seen no evidence that Jolly Wally has demonstrated any interest whatsoever in determining if B.C. 's current electoral - district system is racist or if the courts would strike down an electoral system rooted in the STV .
In a previous post , I wrote that despite Oppal 's celebrity status , he has been a mediocre cabinet minister .
For evidence , I point to his approach to electoral reform .
I also point to his decision not to question the legislature overturning the recommendations of an independent electoral - boundaries commission , which was chaired by B.C. Supreme Court Justice Bruce Cohen .
What does Oppal know that Cohen does n't about the constitutionality of an electoral - boundaries system ?
Slapdash sanitation brings naked sushi shop to a sickening stop
The consumption of morsels of sushi from atop a naked female ’s stomach is referred to as nyotaimori .
There ’s been some skepticism as to whether such dining facilities actually exist in this day and age .
Well , at least one did .
According to Nikkan Gendai ( May 23 ) , it opened for business in Shinjuku ’s Kabukicho entertainment district in June 1998 , and immediately caused a stir .
Unfortunately a bit too much of the stirring took place in customers ’ hiatal sphincters and lower bowels , as it seems such dauntless dining demands a cast - iron constitution .
The shop , which opened after securing a bank loan of 20 million yen , operated according to the 40 - 40 system .
First came all the sushi the customer could consume within 40 minutes .
This was followed by 40 minutes of being sexually serviced by a female employee .
The damages for this double delight came to 30,000 yen .
That price appealed to the mid-level corporate types wining and dining customers on their expense accounts .
But sadly , salmonella reared its ugly head .
Perhaps it was the prolonged contact of the sushi with the women ’s bodies , which warmed it up .
Fresh fish , as is well known , spoils easily .
Or perhaps the contamination was caused by the customers themselves .
It seems some wielded vibrators to stimulate the female staff ’s vaginas and then , after making them suitably lubricious , seasoned the sushi by slipping them over the secreting slits before popping the morsels into their mouths — a surefire way of inviting bacterial infection .
One journalist who reviewed the shop at the time even used his tongue to compare the flavors of the woman ’s akagai ( ark shell ) with an actual Anadara broughtonii .
Before complaints from violently ill patrons could bring down the wrath of the metropolitan board of health , the owner decided to close the shop .
He blamed the loss of his customer base on a rival shop , the notorious Loulan no -panty shabu - shabu restaurant — where as opposed to fish consumed raw , the beef was boiled right at the table , thereby alleviating concerns over germs .
“ I suppose I got out while the getting out was good , ” the shop ’s former owner tells Nikkan Gendai .
“ But I think if I had opened the shop one year earlier than I did , it would have really made me some money . ”

When we first drove the 2010 Mustang GT , the chassis felt robust enough to handle another 100 horsepower — seems like somebody at Ford felt the same way .
The 2010 Shelby GT500 gives us an extra 225 .
Gee , ummm , thanks !
Goodyear , the supplier of an all - new Eagle F - 1 Supercar tire is probably likewise thankful given the way the latest Shelby can ignite its tires .
While we 're talking tires , the newest compound and tread pattern improve the mechanical grip of the doughnuts while quieting them down .
Sorry , we 're getting ahead of ourselves …
As the afterglow of the 2010 Mustang 's Fall introduction waned , the Mustang faithful were stung by the GT 's dearth of power compared to the 2009 Dodge Challenger R/T and the 2010 Chevrolet Camaro .
With 315 standard horsepower , the Mustang GT got walloped by the R/T's 372 ponies .
Even worse , the base Camaro with a 3.6 - liter V - 6 produces over 300 horsepower .
Ouch !
The muscle car game is often played by numbers , and Ford was coming up shy .
Jamal Hameedi , Chief Program Engineer SVT explained the 225 - horsepower jump from the GT and the big gap between the strongest Stang and the most powerful Challenger and Camaro , " We anticipated supercharged versions of the competition , and this was the power level we felt we needed to deliver . "
Indeed .
With 540 horsepower at 6,200 rpm and 510 lb- ft torque at 4,500 rpm , all is right again in the Mustang corral .
The new Shelby gets its power from a supercharged 5.4 - liter overhead cam V - 8 with an iron block and aluminum heads .
Ford claims the 2010 Shelby GT500 will run 0 - 60 mph in about 4.1 seconds , through the quarter mile in 12.1 seconds , and top out at an electronically - limited 155 mph .
After spending the better part of two days behind the wheel , we can attest to this Mustang 's ability to run at a very fast gallop .
On a less than ideal day on the drag strip at Infineon Raceway in California , we ripped off high 12 - second runs .
Given ideal launch conditions and no headwind , perhaps 12.1 would be possible .
The standard six - speed manual gearbox has taller gears in 5th and 6th for better highway cruising .
EPA mpg numbers are 14 /22 mpg , or about what the much less powerful Mustang GT achieved in 2009 .
The throws are short and take some muscle , but the new dual - disc clutch is a smoothly - engaging pleasure .
Suspension components are tuned to deal with the 2010 Shelby GT500 's power .
Changes at every corner and a thinner front anti-sway bar makes the Shelby handle better than the 2007 - 09 edition ( less understeer ) .
Driving on all manner of roads , the suspension is stiff but not punishing .
It can soak up bumps and broken pavement better than you might expect knowing that this is the last of the pony cars to use a live rear axle ( Challenger and Camaro use an independent rear suspension ) .
Unlike past versions of Mustangs ( think back several generations ) , the live rear axle would get all excited over bumps , especially when they were hit mid-corner .
Only inexperienced drivers were surprised when their steed stepped way out of line .
Try as we did , we were never able to make the 2010 Shelby put a hoof wrong .
On the race track , driven sanely , the GT500 feels balanced and responsive .
The car can be driven with the throttle , and around the old Sears Point road course , the Shelby proved it could turn just as well as it goes straight .
On a lower - speed figure - eight handling loop , we found that GT500 ultimately understeers .
The car 's uniquely programmed Advance Trac electronic stability control also proved its capabilities on this course .
In its standard mode , fun was considerably damped .
In sport mode , thresholds are raised enough to allow some oversteer and side slip , but crazy drifts are not allowed .
To spin doughnuts or drift ( both easy to do thanks to the stable chassis and 540 horsepower ) , Advance Trac must be completely shut down .
Every driver at our press event drivers went faster with the system in sport mode .
The ultimate steed wears front brakes from Brembo with fixed four - piston calipers .
Rear brakes are a Ford - part .
We never experienced any fade on the road or track , but even on the track , we were n't able to drive the car hard enough to test their limits .
The new Ford Shelby GT500 carries over the lines of the re-drawn 2010 Mustang … mostly .
The new grill and aluminum hood simplified and in our eyes , beefed up .
A functional air extractor is visible on the hood 's leading edge , positioned to help rid the engine compartment of heat .
A special front air dam with an operative splitter looks cool but does n't do much to reduce aerodynamic drag because they are n't followed by underchassis belly pans and such .
In contrast , the black Gurney flap at the tailing edge of the spoiler is very functional , as moves the center of downforce toward the center of the car , aiding in high - speed stability .
The Shelby also gets unique forged and CNC - milled 19 - inch wheels on the coupe ( 18 - inchers on the convertible ) .
Its bold stripes can't be missed , even from the inside .
The exterior stripes carry through the center sections of the leather - covered front and rear seats .
Even the ball topping the short - throw shifter is striped .
The door sill plate includes an SVT ( Special Vehicle Team ) logo that glows when the ambient lighting is operational .
While pony car buyers are n't necessarily interested in crash test performance , the new Shelby GT500 delivers on safety with a standard complement of features including ; ABS , traction control , electronic stability control ( with " track " and full - off positions ) , tire - pressure monitoring system , remote keyless entry , and four airbags .
SYNC's 911 Assist is also standard .
The 2010 Mustang has not yet been tested , but Ford expects full five - star crash test performance .
The IIHS has n't recently tested a Mustang Coupe , but when they tested a 2007 Mustang Convertible , the results were " Acceptable " for frontal offset crashes and " Good " for side impacts .
In terms of equipment , the 2010 Ford Shelby GT500 carries the best of what can be found on the Mustang line .
Standards include the tilt steering wheel , cruise control , air conditioning , high - powered audio system , and power windows .
The GT500 also includes the SYNC infotainment interface and ambient lighting ( offering 125 different available interior lighting combinations … ohhhh , ahhhh ) .
Sirius NAV system with Travel Link is optional .
Ford told us they 'll build as many units of the 2010 Shelby GT500 as consumers will buy , so do n't let a dealer charge you a premium for buying this powerful pony car .
When the new - car market was more normal , Ford sold around 7,000 examples per year , so the GT500 will never be considered rare , but this does n't diminish its competence over the road or its exuberance on the track .

A little while ago I telephoned Professor Antony Flew at his home in Reading .
The philosopher once described as “ the world ’s most famous atheist ” was having his lunch .
Could I call back later ?
When I did , however , the great man was not exactly forthcoming .
“ Professor Flew , ” I began , “ I wonder if you would be willing to be interviewed for the New Statesman ? ” “ I am old and decrepit , ” replied the prof , “ but my mind is still sharp .
So my answer is no . ”
Click , brrrr .
The reason for Flew ’s refusal , and his brevity , was not some curious dislike for the NS .
The answer lies in the designation above .
He may once have been described as “ the world ’s most famous atheist ” , but no more .
Flew caused a stir – made news around the world , in fact – in 2004 , when it was reported that he now believed in God .
There had already been rumours of his “ conversion ” three years previously , which he denied with a response titled : “ Sorry to disappoint , but I ’m still an atheist ! ”
This time they were confirmed .
New scientific discoveries persuaded him , he said , “ that intelligence must have been involved ” in producing life .
He later backtracked on the reasons for his change of heart , saying he had been misled by the evidence he ’d been presented with , a statement that ­attracted some derision in humanist and philosophical circles .
Which is why , I suspect , that at the age of 86 , Flew does n’t want to go into all this in depth again .
He does , however , still believe in God – or , in his case , god .
For Flew had become not a Christian , but a deist , a distinction the British Humanist Association correctly noted on its website , where it continued for a while to list him as a “ distinguished supporter ” with the regretful rider : “ Professor Flew has recently become a deist .
Nevertheless , we would like to thank him for his many years of support . ”
Flew was no more sympathetic to the revealed religions of the Book , with their “ monstrous Oriental despots ” of gods , as he called them , than before .
He had simply come to the conclusion that , at the very least , there was probably some kind of “ first cause ” ; and that this , rather than an interventionist deity presiding over an afterlife , was what he meant by “ god ” .
Most people have probably never heard of the term deism , or , if they had , would fail to distinguish it from theism .
The confusion would be understandable given that the two terms ’ derivations differ merely in that deist comes from the Latin deus and theist from the Greek theos , and that both mean “ god ” .
The two are very different , however .
Deists believe in a god who created but does not intervene in the universe .
That god , however , does not have to be anything more than an entity that set creation in motion .
It does not give you the anthropomorphised deity to whom many believers pray , nor any of the trappings and beliefs that we associate with religion .
Theism , on the other hand , implies belief in the God of the Abrahamic religions , who remains present to and active within the world at the same time as transcendent over it .
But , from the Enlightenment onwards , the influence of deism has been vast .
Many of America ’s Founding Fathers , including Thomas Jef­ferson and Benjamin Franklin , were deists , as were the philosophers Rousseau and Voltaire and the English radical pamphleteer Tom Paine .
The precise nature of Flew ’s deism is a matter of considerable controversy .
Some allege that the philosopher has been taken advantage of , and that his 2007 book There Is a God was mainly the work of his American co-author , Roy Varghese , although Flew vigorously denies this .
Nevertheless , many felt that the book lacked the coherence and style of his earlier works , such as God and Philosophy and his essay “ The Presumption of Atheism ” , and did not show the brilliance of a mind known to generations of undergraduates .
A New York Times reviewer summed up the mood of the new book ’s detractors : “ I doubt thoughtful believers will welcome this volume .
Far from strengthening the case for the existence of God , it rather weakens the case for the existence of Antony Flew . ”
The deism of the Founding Fathers , however , was significantly stronger than that which can be ascribed to Flew with con­fidence .
Theirs was that of a natural religion , one that was not revealed to Middle Eastern prophets but could be arrived at by reason .
The laws of nature must have been designed , goes the argument , hence there must be a designer , and the concept of natural rights ( which so permeates the United States constitution ) is embodied in his creation .
Any belief in scriptural authenticity or an ­afterlife is not entailed , although many of these deists were close enough to religion for it to be queried today whether they were , in fact , not deists but rationalist theists .
Benjamin Franklin was typical of those who took this approach .
“ As to Jesus of Nazareth , ” he wrote to the president of Yale University in 1790 , “ I think the system of morals and his religion , as he left them to us , the best the world ever saw or is likely to see ; but I have , with most of the present dissenters in England , some doubts as to his divinity ; though it is a question I do not dogmatize upon , having never studied it , and think it needless to busy myself with it now , when I expect soon an opportunity of knowing the truth with less trouble . ”
If Franklin ’s words strike a chord with many , including those who think of themselves as being Christians , perhaps that is no surprise .
According to Tom Wright , the Bishop of Durham and a world - renowned New Testament scholar , most of them are in fact deists – whether they know it or not .
“ I think that almost all ‘ ordinary English ’ people – and a good many others , too – simply take a deist framework of thought for granted and when they hear the word ‘ god ’ that ’s what they are thinking of , ” he tells me .
“ The fact that there is a major difference between deism and the three Abrahamic religions is not just news to most ; it is incomprehensible when the ‘ news ’ is told them . ”
Wright ’s analysis certainly fits with the vague professions and low - level observance that characterise the popular image , and often the reality , of English churchgoing ( as opposed to the more rigid theologies and greater demands placed on followers of , say , Catholicism and Islam ) .
And if it is correct , it is of far greater significance than the decision of one particular atheist , however famous , to join them .
C S Lewis was once himself a deist , until he took a journey to Whipsnade Zoo in the sidecar of his brother ’s motorbike , at the end of which he found he had become a Christian .
But his later words , subsequent to his final conversion , are a stern rebuke to any Christian who fails to affirm the divinity of Christ , or thinks of him merely as a great teacher ; for they have in fact lapsed into deism .
“ A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher , ” wrote Lewis .
“ He would either be a lunatic – on a level with the man who says he is a poached egg – or else he would be the Devil of Hell .
You must make your choice . ”
No in - between path can be taken to be truly Christian .
In which case , the multitudes that do take just such paths , while still occasionally taking a pew , and the similar numbers of those who profess no formal religion , but maintain a hazy conviction that there must be some originator of the universe , may make up the millions of what could be thought of as Britain ’s hidden religion – a deist faith that the world has forgotten .
" Freedom - fry loving conservatives " have started another food fight , said Mary Ann Akers in The Washington Post .
Led by Sean Hannity on Fox News , the angry right is accusing President Obama of being an elitist for ordering a cheeseburger with Dijon mustard instead of ketchup .
( watch reaction to " Dijongate " by Sean Hannity , Laura Ingraham , and Mark Steyn via Media Matters )
But that 's not all — Hannity and Co. also blasted the liberal media for covering up " Obama 's Dijon mustard eating ways . "
Talk about a non-story , said Ed Morrissey in Hot Air .
OK , so it 's true that MSNBC broadcasters talked over Obama 's order , so you could n't hear Obama asking for the Dijon .
That 's not because they think the president 's mustard preference " represented an enormous insult to the working - class families that Obama and Joe Biden claim to represent .
It 's probably because it 's just mustard . "
Of course it 's just mustard , said Cornell Law School professor William A. Jacobson in Legal Insurrection ( hat tip Memeorandum ) .
The tweaking of Obama 's condiment choice — by me and other bloggers was " tongue - in- cheek . "
Our real target was the " absurd extent to which the Obama administration went to create a ' real guy kind of quality ' image of Obama / Biden " eating their burgers , and the shameful way in which " MSNBC played along like a loyal worshipper .

PARIS , May 24 ( Reuters ) - Europeans started over - exploiting freshwater fish at least 1,000 years ago , according to historical studies that could help manage depleted modern fish stocks worldwide .
Whales teemed in waters off New Zealand in the 19th century and a now almost non-existent cod stock in the Gulf of Maine totalled a huge 70,000 tonnes a year in the mid-19th century , according to historical records .
Records reconstructed from everything from Russian monastery purchases to U.S. schooner logs indicate that over - fishing has been happening in many parts of the world for centuries and that fish used to be more abundant , and bigger , than now .
" We see similar patterns of human impacts on the oceans pretty much everywhere , and in many cases real depletion , " said Andy Rosenberg of the University of New Hampshire , a leader of a project called the History of Marine Animal Population ( HMAP ) .
The findings , part of a 10 - year Census of Marine Life due for completion in 2010 , have widened from a few local anecdotes about fish abundance in past centuries , he told Reuters .
He will chair a HMAP " Oceans Past " conference in Vancouver on May 26 - 28 .
In Europe , a shift to eating marine fish species from locally caught freshwater fish happened about 1,000 years ago .
" The size of freshwater fish caught by Europeans started shrinking in medieval times ... likely caused by increased exploitation and pollution , " an HMAP statement said , based on freshwater fish remains dumped in northwest Europe and England .
New fishing boats in the 16th century made it possible to fish in deeper seas and a " real revolution " came in the mid-17th century when pairs of boats started dragging much bigger nets .
Blue whales , orcas and dolphins used to be common off Cornwall in southwest England .
Examination of records including log books of whalers indicated that populations of the southern right whale off New Zealand totalled 22,000 to 32,000 in the early 19th century .
They now total perhaps 1,000 after over - hunting .
RECOVERY
Poul Holm , professor at Trinity College in Dublin and global chair of HMAP , said that the history of stocks could help work out recovery plans .
New threats such as climate change are also emerging .
" We need to have better biological information and HMAP is providing some of the solution , " he told Reuters .
Rosenberg led a 2005 report that showed schooners used to land 70,000 tonnes of cod a year in the 1860s in the Gulf of Maine .
" Now a mechanised fleet lands 3,000 tonnes , " he said .
" When we talk about rebuilding the fishery in the Gulf of Maine people are talking about 5 - 10,000 tonnes . "
He said governments including Australia , New Zealand and Canada were starting to build a historical perspective in planning stock management .
Among other examples , a comparison of 13 photos of " trophy " reef fish caught between 1956 and 2007 in Key West , Florida , showed that the average fish size shrank to an estimated 2.3 kg ( 5 lb ) from 20 kg .

Matthew Shepard killed in non-bias " robbery , " Foxx says
North Carolina Republican Rep. Virginia
Foxx is questioning whether the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard , a 21 - year - old gay University of Wyoming student , was a bias attack motivated by his sexual orientation .
Shepard 's mother Judy was in the gallery at the time , according to a senior Democratic aide .
The socially conservative Foxx , arguing against a new Democratic hate crimes bill that includes new protections for gays and lesbians , described the description of Shepard 's murder as a anti-homosexual attack a " hoax " -- and questioned whether prior bias crime legislation should have been named after him .
“ I also would like to point out that there was a bill -- the hate crimes bill that 's called the Matthew Shepard bill is named after a very unfortunate incident that happened where a young man was killed , but we know that that young man was killed in the commitment of a robbery .
It was n't because he was gay . "
She added : " This -- the bill was named for him , hate crimes bill was named for him , but it 's really a hoax that that continues to be used as an excuse for passing these bills .
" Matthew Shepard 's mother was in the gallery yesterday and I believe she was back today -- so I 'm sorry she had to be around to hear it , " said Rep. Steve Cohen ( D - Tenn . ) .
" It 's an urban myth ...
And I 'd tell her that man did land on the moon and the moon was n't made out of green cheese . "
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( D - Fla. ) , who supports the hate crimes bill , stared in disbelief before answering a question about the statement .
" It 's just sad the Republican caucus has been reduced such a fringe , " she said .
" It 's sad they would go out of their way to prevent people from getting justice . "
Two young men -- Russell Arthur Henderson and Aaron James McKinney -- were convicted in connection with the crime , with multiple witnesses testifying to their anti-gay aspect of the crime .
Both also intended to rob the Sheppard home after the attack , according to press accounts .
McKinney testified that Shepard attempted to grab his leg earlier in the evening and that had spurred a " gay panic " that provoked an extraordinarily violent outburst -- with his lawyers claiming McKinney had suffered homosexual abuse as a child .

Is Obama Getting Tough With Israel ?
President Obama heads to the Middle East next week , where on Thursday he 'll make a much - anticipated address in Cairo aimed at repairing American 's ties with the Muslim world .
He has a big advantage simply not being George W. Bush , of course -- and having abolished the most egregious , Crusade - like aspects of this country 's approach to counter - terrorism .
But what can he tell the world 's Muslims to assuage their anger about their most long - standing grievance : America 's reflexive support of Israel ?
As I 've written before , there are signs Obama will promote a new regional peace initiative for the Middle East , much like the one championed by Jordan 's King Abdullah .
And now along comes the first distinct signs that Obama is willing to play hardball with Israel .
Paul Richter , Christi Parsons and Richard Boudreaux write in the Los Angeles Times : " President Obama and top Israeli officials staked out sharply opposing positions over the explosive issue of Jewish settlements Thursday , propelling a rare dispute between the two close allies into full public view just days before the U.S. leader is due to deliver a long - awaited address in Egypt to the world 's Muslims .
" Speaking after a White House meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , Obama reiterated that he had been 'very clear about the need to stop building settlements , to stop building outposts ' on Palestinian territory .
" Only hours earlier , the Israeli government said it would continue to allow some growth in the settler communities in the West Bank .
" The exchange underscored the unusually hard - line position Obama has taken publicly with Israel early in his administration .
Most U.S. presidents , aware of the political sensitivity , have worked hard to keep disagreements out of sight , when they existed . "
The issue of Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories is incendiary for Palestinians , and nearly defining for the right - wing Israeli political bloc that newly re-installed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu depends on in order to retain power .
Farah Stockman writes for the Boston Globe : " As he prepares to fly to the Middle East next week to give a speech on his policy toward the region and US - Muslim relations , it seemed clear yesterday that his administration is willing to risk prickly relations with one of the closest US allies - and possible anger from some Jewish voters - to try to create a Palestinian state . "
David S. Cloud writes for Politico : " Obama 's willingness to place much of the initial onus on Israel for resuming peace talks is clearly greater than his predecessor , President George W. Bush , who rarely allowed any hint of public difference between himself and Israel .
The strategy also carries some domestic political risk for Obama .
That was clear Thursday when 329 House members and 76 senators sent him a letter advising against putting too much public pressure on Israel . "
Glenn Kessler writes in The Washington Post that the 2003 " road map " for peace , " commits Israel to dismantling settler outposts and freezing ' all settlement activity , ' including building to accommodate what is known as ' natural growth . '
But the near - daily barrage of U.S. demands that Israel halt settlement growth has surprised Israeli officials , who argue that they greatly restrained growth under an unwritten 2005 agreement with the Bush administration .
Under that deal , Israel was to stop providing incentives for settlers to move to the West Bank and was to build only in areas it expected to keep in future peace agreements ....
" The Obama administration appears to have calculated that pressing Israel on settlements will help demonstrate to the Arab nations that the United States is serious about pursuing peace , even at the risk of appearing to undermine Netanyahu 's nascent government . "
Steven Thomma writes for McClatchy Newspapers : " President Barack Obama Thursday ratcheted up what might be America 's toughest bargaining position with Israel in a generation . "
Thomma also writes : " It 's noteworthy that Obama this week announced that he'd go to Saudi Arabia early next week for a private dinner with King Abdullah , en route to Cairo .
" ' If what Obama is trying to do is get states like the Saudis to actually do things now , not only will he have achieved something pretty significant , he 'll make it almost impossible for the Israelis to say no , ' Miller said .
' No Israeli prime minister can afford to mismanage Israel 's most important relationship , especially at a time when the Iranians are closer to nuclear power . ' "
It 's also possible that Obama is willing -- heck , even eager -- to see Netanyahu 's government collapse .
The prime minister has been a longtime skeptic of proposals to create a Palestinian state and refused to commit to the concept during his U.S. visit .
Laura Rozen blogs for Foreign Policy : " According to many observers in Washington and Israel , the Israeli prime minister , looking for loopholes and hidden agreements that have often existed in the past with Washington , has been flummoxed by an unusually united line that has come not just from Obama White House and the secretary of state , but also from pro-Israel congressmen and women who have come through Israel for meetings with him over Memorial Day recess .
To Netanyahu 's dismay , Obama does n't appear to have a hidden policy .
It is what he said it was ....
" Even one veteran Washington peacemaker who had grown skeptical that Washington can overcome obstacles to get substantive progress on Middle East peace admitted to being impressed by the Obama team 's resolve .
' What I 'm beginning to see is that the Obama administration may be less concerned with actually getting to negotiations and an agreement and more interested in setting new rules and rearranging the furniture , ' said Aaron David Miller of the Woodrow Wilson Institute .
' They may have concluded that they can't get to a real two state solution with this prime minister .
Maybe they want a new one ?
And the best way to raise the odds of that is to demonstrate that he can't manage Israel 's most important relationship : with the U.S. ' "
Jackson Diehl writes in his Washington Post opinion column : " From its first days the Bush administration made it clear that the onus for change in the Middle East was on the Palestinians : Until they put an end to terrorism , established a democratic government and accepted the basic parameters for a settlement , the United States was not going to expect major concessions from Israel .
" Obama , in contrast , has repeatedly and publicly stressed the need for a West Bank settlement freeze , with no exceptions .
In so doing he has shifted the focus to Israel . "
This is not a good thing , Diehl writes , because in so doing , Obama " has revived a long - dormant Palestinian fantasy : that the United States will simply force Israel to make critical concessions , whether or not its democratic government agrees , while Arabs passively watch and applaud . "
But in an interview with Yedioth Ahronoth translated by M.J. Rosenberg , Martin Indyk , director of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy and a former United States ambassador to Israel , suggests that Obama is on a larger mission .
" Netanyahu should listen to Obama because Obama is telling him , in essence , that resolving the conflict is an American interest , " Indyk said .
" What is happening at present is that the Israeli - Arab conflict serves as an instrument in the hands of America 's enemies — Iran , Hizbullah and Hamas .
Time is not working in Israel 's favor or in favor of peace . "
Indyk says Obama 's new message to Israels is this : " [ A ]ll these years , the US has been strengthening you precisely for this purpose — so that you can take the risk of making peace .
How exactly can the Palestinians destroy you ?
The real existential danger is that you will not succeed in parting from them . "

Technology.am ( Apr. 24 , 2009 ) — Pennsylvania State University scientists have produced an electric “ fart ” that gives microbes power to convert electrical energy into methane to store energy .
The electrical farting machine could improve fuel cell technology by turning C02 in the atmosphere into methane , and it could help store alternative energies such as wind and solar more efficiently .
Given small jolts of electricity to “ archea ” , older than bacteria , lacking a nucleus and other cellular machinery , prompts them to remove C02 from the air and turn it into methane , released as tiny “ farts . ”
The archea are 80 percent efficient at conserving the electrical energy into the chemical bonds of methane , that is sufficient enough to use the methanogen to store energy generated by intermittent power sources , like wind , solar or tidal energy .

Mud Flaps , Arizona , March 29 , 2006 -- A team of creationist paleontologists from the Discovery Institute 's main field research arm announced today that they had discovered the remains of a large manmade object confirmed to be an ancient dinosaur saddle .
The Discovery Institute 's discovery was discovered in the remote Dusty Rivers area of southwestern Arizona .
A spokesman for the paleontological team said that the dinosaur saddle provides irrefutable proof that man and dinosaurs lived simultaneously , as predicted by most creationist or " " doctrines .
" I can't tell you how thrilled we all were to stumble upon this groundbreaking historical find , " said Dr. K. Firth Booble , leader of the expedition .
" We knew there had to be some evidence for man - dinosaur concurrence buried somewhere around here , but did n't think we 'd discover it so quickly . "
Dr. Booble , who received his doctorate in paleontology from the respected Holy Patriot !™
Bible University and Correspondence College of Claptrappe , Oklahoma , had embarked on the search , funded by a $ 2 million Discovery Institute grant , expecting to remain in the field for at least two years .
The dinosaur saddle was unearthed a mere two weeks after the expedition 's launch .
" We were going on the assumption that evidence of man 's domestication of certain dinosaurs would have called for large fences , supports for the dinosaur corrals , so that 's what we started looking for , " said Dr. Booble .
" We found a number of poles buried in several feet of sand almost immediately with the help of infrared satellite photos of the area .
Then we just started digging , and boom , there it was . "
The stunning find , a large saddle Dr. Booble believes would have been used by early man in riding " a Velociraptor , or a small Stegosaurus " is in relatively good condition considering its age , which Dr. Booble estimates to be " between 6,000 and 6,500 years " .
" We have n't yet found any human remains in the area , but that 's merely a question of time , " said Dr. Booble .
According to Dr. Booble and the Discovery Institute , a think - tank based in Seattle with affiliates operating at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , Washington , D.C. , dinosaurs were expelled from the Garden of Eden for excessive flatulence and " unruly behavior " at about the same time that Adam and Eve were forced to leave as a penalty for a serpent - related " apple conspiracy " .
Those descendants of Adam who were not captured and eaten by some of the larger carnivores are assumed to have domesticated the less spiky and more manageable species for livestock , along with cows , chickens , goats and pigs .
" Based on the shape of the saddle , and this wedge that would slot neatly around the upper spikes of the back , I 'm quite confident the saddle was intended to be worn by a Stegosaurus , " said Dr. Booble .
" Stegosaurus would have proven very useful to early man as a feed animal , and could also have been ridden whenever early horses , who were quite fleet of hoof , could not be captured . "
Dr. Booble 's colleague , Dr. D. Oxy Ribonucleic , offers an alternative view to Dr. Booble 's interpretation .
" This saddle is far too narrow to fit across the sweeping shoulders of a Stegosaurus , " said Dr. Ribonucleic .
" It is far more likely that early man used it when riding the much faster and more versatile Velociraptor .
Furthermore , we know Velociraptor was a vegetarian , as can be clearly deduced from its long rows of razor - sharp teeth , perfectly designed for tearing leaves from trees or rooting for truffles and other buried delicacies , and could therefore be domesticated at very low risk . "
Drs. Booble and Ribonucleic hope to exhibit the dinosaur saddle at the prestigious Smithsonian Institution as soon as preliminary lab work and cleansing rites have been performed on the specimen .

Happiness is simply a state of mind .
No , I ’m not implying that we can instantly heal the pain of a severe or unexpected personal tragedy just by thinking about being happy .
Rather , I am referring to our levels of happiness on routine days when things in our lives are close to normal .
In these neutral times , when we are neither ecstatic nor extremely sad , the slightest change in attitude can swing our happiness balance drastically in either a positive or negative direction .
One of the primary factors that affect our attitude is our choice of words .
Words have a lot of power and influence on both the speaker and the listener .
When we speak we sometimes unintentionally choose words that have a negative undertone .
This can make us seem unhappy ( and negative ) in the eyes of others .
Even worse , after we have spoken these words our unconscious mind starts believing in them .
“ If this is what came out of my mouth , it must be the way I truly feel . ”
However , this is not always true .
The first fleeting words that come to mind are not necessarily the most accurate representation of our feelings and intentions .
We must realize that we have the power to choose the words we use , and if we pick them carefully , they can change the way we feel .
Here are three typical scenarios where positive language can inject positivity and happiness into our lives .
Inject Happiness into Casual Communication
Typically , when I ask someone “ How are you ? ” they reply , “ I ’m fine ” or “ I ’m okay . ”
But one lazy Monday afternoon last month a new colleague of mine replied , “ Oh , I am fabulous ! ”
It made me smile , so I asked him what was making him feel so fabulous and he said , “ I ’m healthy , my family is healthy , and we live in a free country .
So I do n’t have any reason not to be happy . ”
The difference was simply his attitude and his choice of words .
He was n’t necessarily any better off than anyone else , but he seemed twenty times happier .
It really struck a chord with me .
Suddenly I realized that I have a choice .
I can either say “ the glass is half empty ” or “ the glass is half full . ”
Why not rejoice in the fact that , thankfully , I do n’t have anything to be terribly upset about .
So now when someone asks me how I am doing , I say “ I ’m doing wonderful ! ” or “ Everything is awesome ! ” or something similar that reflects a positive , happy mood .
Since I ’ve made a regular habit of doing this , multiple friends and acquaintances have noticed a positive change in my attitude .
And I do genuinely feel happier .
Also , it seems like the people around me are smiling more now too .
So I guess it ’s contagious .
Keep Friendly Discussions Friendly
We ’ve all been involved in friendly discussions that turn into heated arguments .
This usually results in a complete breakdown of productive communication .
The reason for this is simple .
When people get into heated arguments they get unhappy , and unhappy people are not productive .
More often than not these arguments transpire due to our choice of words rather than our point of views .
If communicated peacefully and appropriately people usually tolerate each other ’s perspectives pretty well .
Hence , it ’s very important to choose our words wisely even when we strongly disagree with someone .
Instead of telling the other person “ You always … ” try saying “ Sometimes you … ” .
Instead of saying “ That ’s not true , ” try saying “ I do n’t think I completely understand your point of view . ”
Instead of telling your friend “ I do n’t want to go to that bar , ” you can say “ Oh , we can go to that bar too if you want , but I would rather … ”
Using words that make the other person feel negated always creates negativity in conversations .
On the other hand , choosing words that assure the listeners that their perspectives are being respected drastically improves the chances of getting your point across without heating things up .
Wendell Johnson once said :
Always and never are two words you should always remember never to use .
Maintain a Hopeful Outlook
When we are talking or thinking about ourselves we are typically the least careful with our choice of words .
We assume that there are no restrictions on what to say or how to think about our own person .
In some situations this might be true , but the positivity or negativity of our words and thoughts still affect us .
For example , there is a huge difference between saying “ I wish I have a house that big someday ” versus “ It would be great to have a house that big someday . ”
The latter gives a greater sense of possibility and confidence which allows us to believe that ‘ yes ’ it is possible and ‘ yes ’ it could happen one day .
Whereas , using words like ‘ I wish ’ makes it seem unreachable and impossible , which generally leads to feelings of discontentment .
Conclusion
These are just some simple examples that illustrate how important it is to choose and use positive words .
Remember , our words transparently coincide with our mindset .
Positive language creates a healthy balance between our mind and our heart .

Netcraft has observed a surge in popularity of the Lynx browser , particularly since the recent Pwn2Own competition , which was held at the CanSecWest conference in Vancouver last month .
During the course of the competition , security researchers once again exposed fresh vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer , Firefox and Safari .
Financial institutions have noted that the Lynx browser is particularly suitable for online banking , as it supports the latest cryptographic ciphers used in ecommerce , and is immune to attacks via JavaScript , Flash and other multimedia content .
Lynx 's algorithms for dealing with such threats are so comprehensive , it is just as safe as if the multimedia content was not there .
User Agent share at FNB Oki Koki
April Erste , Public Relations Manager at the First National Bank of Oki Koki , told Netcraft that users are migrating to Lynx because of its speed and advanced security features .
She added : " Lynx has not once suffered a buffer overflow in its image processing , and indeed has suffered no security vulnerabilities at all in the last 2 years . "
By comparison , the most recent Firefox security update was only 4 days ago .
The bank also notes that Telnet remains popular with a small group of its customers .
Although it lacks the sophisticated user interface of Lynx , many security experts argue that Telnet is significantly more secure and has the largest installed base of any browser .
Erste said that while the bank is dedicated to providing an accessible online banking experience , some customers still report difficulties when trying to make HTTPS requests through Telnet without the aid of an extended keyboard layout .

One factor that has held back wider adoption of Lynx is its lack of protection against phishing .
As with other web browsers , it can be difficult to tell a genuine bank website from a well - constructed lookalike .
To bolster Lynx 's growing footprint in the browser market , Netcraft has released the Netcraft Toolbar for Lynx .
This free add - on blends in at the top of every web page , and not only protects Lynx users against phishing attacks , but the beautiful text - based rendition of the Netcraft logo is sure to brighten anyone 's day .
Shut down and takeover of “ tent cities ” stokes fears of internment pretext
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Thursday , March 26 , 2009
Plans to shut down tent cities in California and relocate homeless people to government - run facilities have stoked fears that the move could be a pretext for a wider internment of Americans in the event of a total economic collapse .
“ California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said a make - shift tent city for the homeless that sprang up in the capital city of Sacramento will be shut down and its residents allowed to stay at the state fairgrounds , ” reports Bloomberg News .
Homeless people will be moved to the the state facility known as Cal - Expo as the Sacramento City Council last night agreed to spend $ 880,000 to expand homeless programs .
“ Together with the local government and volunteers , we are taking a first step to ensure the people living in tent city have a safe place to stay , with fresh water , healthy conditions and access to the services they need , ” Schwarzenegger said in a statement .
“ And I am committed to working with Mayor Johnson to find a permanent solution for those living in tent city . ”
That “ permanent solution ” has some people worried that many more Americans could be interned against their will in the event of widespread rioting and the implementation of martial law .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Legislation currently working it ’s way through Congress mandates the establishment of “ national emergency centers ” to be located on military installations .
The purpose of such facilities is to provide “ temporary housing , medical , and humanitarian assistance to individuals and families dislocated due to an emergency or major disaster , ” the expansion of which under FEMA is codified under HR 645 , otherwise known as the National Emergency Centers Act .
Ominously , the bill states that the camps can be used to “ meet other appropriate needs , as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security , ” an open ended mandate which many fear could mean the forced detention of American citizens in the event of widespread rioting after a national emergency or total economic collapse .
The issue of containment camps re-gained national attention three years ago when it was announced that Kellogg , Brown and Root had been awarded a $ 385 million dollar contract by Homeland Security to construct detention and processing facilities in the event of a national emergency .
The language of the preamble to the agreement veils the program with talk of temporary migrant holding centers , but it is made clear that the camps will also be used “ as the development of a plan to react to a national emergency . ”

Advocates of a single payer health care system held a silent protest demonstration at Senator Ron Wyden ’s town hall meeting in Forest Grove , Oregon on Sunday .
The protesters demanded that Senator Wyden open the debate on health care reform to include advocates of a single payer , everybody in , nobody out , free choice of doctor and hospital health care system .
The protesters charged that Senator Wyden is backing a health care plan that is mere piecemeal tinkering of the current system .
About ten minutes into the event Rick Staggenborg MD , of Physicians for a National Health Program ( PNHP ) , asked Senator Wyden if he would sit down with single payer advocates .
Wyden remains steadfastly opposed to single payer , but said he would sit down with the single payer advocates .
But Senator
Wyden did nothing to ensure that single payer advocates were represented in recent Senate Finance Committee hearings .
Big business and health insurance companies dominated the sessions .
More than 41 witnesses testified over three days of hearings on health care before the Committee .
Not one of the 41 was an advocate of a single payer system — even though recent polls show that the majority of Americans , the majority of doctors and even the majority of health economists favor a single payer system .
Thirteen doctors , nurses , lawyers and other single payer activists were arrested at those hearings for demanding that one single payer advocate be allowed to testify .
All were charged with “ disruption of Congress ” and face arraignment starting this week in Washington , D.C .
About fifteen minutes into the Wyden town hall meeting , five single payer activists walked to the front of the room and put on surgical masks with messages written on them .
“ Everybody in .
Nobody out , ” read one .
Another read —
“ Healthcare is for people , not for profit . ”
The activists were Single Payer Action ’s Philip Kauffman , Dr. Joe Eusterman of PNHP , Jamie Partridge of the Portland Jobs with Justice Healthcare Committee , an unidentified woman , and Martha Perez , a healthcare professional based in Portland .
Wyden did not recognize the silent protesters until a news photographer began taking photos .
Wyden then turned and was surprised by the presence of the protesters .
( See video here . )
But the protesters continued their silent protest as a backdrop to Senator Wyden as he took questions for over an hour .
About 60 citizens attended the town hall meeting .
“ A majority of the people who attended the Wyden town hall meeting support single payer and many thanked us for our silent protest , ” said Kauffman .
“ Wyden parroted the insurance industry line that we need a ‘ uniquely American ’ approach to healthcare .
At that point a member of the audience said — ‘ I think we already have a uniquely American system .
It does n’t work . ' ”
“ I respect what Senator Wyden has done for this state and country , ” Dr. Eusterman said .
“ He has been courageous and honorable , but on the issue of health care , he is dead wrong . ”

General Electric on Monday announced a new technology it says is capable of fitting 100 DVDs worth of information onto a single standard disc .
According to the company , the technology is still in early development .
G.E. is looking for ways to produce it at cost effective prices .
The technology , according to The New York Times , utilizes holographic storage .
Says the paper ,
The data is encoded in light patterns that are stored in light - sensitive material .
The holograms act like microscopic mirrors that refract light patterns when a laser shines on them , and so each hologram 's recorded data can then be retrieved and deciphered .
" The price of storage per gigabyte is going to drop precipitously , " G.E. Scientist Brian Lawrence said of the technology .
OK , so a lot can go wrong .
But maybe nothing is worse than when the celebrity 's troubles have a cruel , ironic connection to the product they 're endorsing , turning your multimillion dollar ad campaign into an exercise in unintentional hilarity .
We 're talking about ...
Really , can anything go wrong with a celebrity endorsement ?
OK , other than their latest movie / album / TV show turning into a flop .
Or them getting caught on camera beating a hooker while wearing your clothing line .
5 Eric Clapton and Michelob

Way back in 1987 , Anheuser - Busch launched their " The Night Belongs to Michelob " campaign , a series of commercials involving popular rock and roll artists of the day .
However the first couple of ads featured such stars as Steve Winwood and Phil Collins , two accomplished , albeit mind - numbingly boring musicians .
Sensing they needed to take a new direction , Anheuser - Busch went out and recruited a giant in the music industry : Eric Fucking Clapton .
The commercial itself , although dated , is still pretty damned cool .
It 's got all your necessary rock and roll cliches , from the smoky club to the hot chicks ( with big ass 80s hair ) to the hip band and to top it all off , Clapton .
Check it out here .

The Problem :
Clapton , like virtually all musicians , had a bit of a drug problem ( which he overcame ) , a fact known to just about everyone ... minus the shithead ad execs at Anheuser - Busch .
Either that or they did know and just were too stoned themselves to ask any follow up questions like " Are you clean and sober now Mr. Clapton ? "
If they had they probably would 've avoided the painful sting of irony .
Right around the time Clapton 's commercial was released , he decided to come clean ... literally .
Clapton fessed up that he was currently seeking treatment at a detox facility ... for alcoholism .
The Fallout :

Upon finding out that the centerpiece to their multimillion dollar ad campaign was in rehab trying to liberate himself of imaginary bugs , Anheuser - Busch promptly terminated the contract .
They wanted an image of carefree people happily drinking in a smoky bar , damn it !
Not of some guy responsibly seeking help from professionals when he realizes he has a problem !
These days , Anheuser - Busch has learned their lesson , stopped pretending beer is part of some kind of imaginary rock star lifestyle and now claims Michelob will turn you into a top athlete instead .
Desktop malware risk gets raised and patched

One of the most common claims about GNU / Linux is that it is supposed to be relatively immune to viruses and malware .
However , for the past few weeks , that claim has been more closely scrutinized , thanks to a blog posting by " foobar " entitled " How to write a Linux virus in 5 easy steps . "
Specifically , the posting gives a high - level explanation of how malware can take advantage of the behavior of application launchers on the GNOME and KDE desktops to infect a user account — and possibly gain root access as well .
The result has been endless Internet discussions and coordinated efforts by both GNOME and KDE to minimize the problem .
The method described by foobar depends on social engineering :
That is , manipulating users into saving an attachment to their GNOME or KDE desktop , and then into executing it .
Ordinarily , foobar points out , a saved email attachment would not have executable permission .
However , GNOME and KDE share a common format for desktop launchers ( *.desktop ) , and allows them to run without an executable flag .
This exception makes it easy to run a script ( foobar suggests Python as a likely language ) that will download a piece of malware , especially since a custom icon and name can disguise the nature of the program that the launcher runs .
Furthermore , by adding a link in the desktop environment 's autostart directory , the malware can then run each time that a user logs into the account .
From the perspective of security architecture , gaining root access is considered the goal of malware .
However , foobar emphasizes that the method described can do damage without logging into the root account .
Still , foobar suggests that the use of sudo and temporary root logins for graphical administration tools provide a backdoor for gaining root access .
According to foobar , all that a piece of malware would need to do is make a local copy of an administration tool , then run the malware referencing the local copy .
A user would then enter the root password for the tool , and not notice that the malware command was also receiving root access .
Alternatively , the malware could add a similar command to the path definition of the current account .
Either way , foobar writes , " there 's a good chance that you will get [ root access ] eventually if you are patient . "
These suggestions are not new .
LWN pointed out the basic problem nearly three years ago , and the potential vulnerabilities of sudo were pointed out two years ago in an Ubuntu forum .
All the same , foobar 's post has been widely discussed since it first appeared .
Besides the comments below the post , it has been discussed in such places as Linux Today , LWN , Slashdot , the KDE Community Forums , and the Ubuntu Forums .
Much of this discussion is repetitive , and beside the point .
For example , some users quibble that foobar is technically referring to a trojan , not a virus at all .
Others , like " Felice " below the original post , dismiss foobar 's analysis on the grounds that , " There will never be any protection against the user 's stupidity . "
Others , like " friends of the one law " ( also beneath the original post ) insists that such exploits are less likely on GNU / Linux than on Windows because " The installation and / or maintenance of a basic linux desktop requires a level of knowledge _and_ intellect somewhat more developed than that required for a basic Micro$oft product . "
All these comments , however , are side issues that do not alter the basic problem in any way , even though they each contain some degree of truth .
Other comments were more to the point .
Expanding on a comment by foobar , " Colin " posted beneath the original post with a link to the code snippet that prevents
Thunar , the Xfce file manager , from having the same desktop vulnerability .
Still others tried to correct foobar 's suggested code or variations on the basic method outlined .
Some of the most focused responses appeared as comments to LWN 's initial coverage of the story .
" drag " suggested using a tool like SELinux to create a security context for downloads to the desktop that flags them as untrusted until they are specifically marked as trusted .
The same commenter suggested that downloads should be savable only to a designated directory off the desktop — although , as foobar pointed out in the followup blog post , whether this idea would work is uncertain .
In the last few days , both GNOME and KDE have been taking concrete steps to alleviate the problem , with discussions taking place on the XDG ( Free Desktop ) list .
In a blog post , Michael Pyne proposes a policy that will allow files with a . desktop extension to run if they are owned by root ( and therefore part of a standard installation ) , or installed from " a known location for services , applications , and XDG - compliant applications " ( that is , ones that meet the shared Free Desktop standards ) .
A whitelist will track all . desktop files that are permitted to run .
Pyne tells LWN that a major challenge of implementation is getting the white list correct .
His first whitelist excluded autostart entries , and discussion raised a number of other cases , such as whether existing . desktop files needed to be updated , and how to handle launchers created from a menu or panel .
My first response was to simply broaden the whitelist to include the KDE install prefixes until I could get all the exceptions figured out .
Luckily , David Faure immediately knew what was going on and so he 's done a good job at re-restricting the whitelist , with some other kdelibs changes needed to make it happen .
Last I heard there was still one user having issues ( something to do with symlinks ) but so far I 've heard no other major complaints .
Another issue raised on the XDG list is whether a header should be added to untrusted . desktop files to prevent them from being run from the command line .
While some developers questioned the need , Pyne seems to have decided that the precaution is necessary .
Still another concern is to write a clear dialog window that opens when a user tries to launch a . desktop file that is not whitelisted and is therefore not executable .
The language is still being improved , but will probably explain the potential danger and when you should and should not continue to run the program , as well as giving the complete path to the command .
GNOME developer Alexander Larsson , although writing that the issue is " all pretty overblown , " is working along similar lines .
When the changes are implemented , GNOME will add an executable permission to all existing . desktop files when upgrading — a move that KDE , for now , will not follow .
" We thought about it but opted to start with the dialog , " Pyne tells LWN .
" Some kind of dialog will be required no matter what , and any auto - upgrade we do in KDE would have to be done with the user 's permission .
We may still do it , but it not set yet . "
Another difference in GNOME is that any . desktop files that are executable but not in a system directory will be flagged as " untrusted . "
To emphasize their status , such files will show a shortcut icon and the real file name , rather than any custom icon and display name for the desktop .
Pyne has expressed some interest in this idea to LWN , and briefly speculated about how files might be listed as trusted , but , for now KDE is not following this suggestion .
However , much as in KDE , clicking an untrusted file in GNOME will open a dialog that warns the user about the file 's status , and gives the choice of running it anyway , marking it as trusted , or canceling its execution .
In both GNOME and KDE , these changes should appear very shortly .
Larsson asked for a string break approval for next month 's release of GNOME 2.26 so that his changes , particularly the new dialog , can be included .
The request was granted , and Larsson tells LWN , " all the required Gnome changes have now landed in glib and nautilus . "
Similarly , Pyne hopes to see his changes backported to KDE 4.2 in a point release , as well as appearing in KDE 4.3 .
Whether the backports occur , he explains to LWN , depends " on if it 's deemed a big enough security risk . "
The speed with which these changes are being implemented suggests that both KDE and GNOME are treating the security problem as moderately serious .
However , Pyne is careful to warn about the limits of the fixes , telling LWN :
This kind of security is only intended to defend against the type of vulnerability where an email attachment or web link is directly executed ( by way of downloading an image and clicking on it , for instance ) .
This does n't defend against archives with executable . desktop files , just like archives with executable Python scripts have no protection .
This also does n't defend against the user following guided instructions on saving a trojan in a whitelisted directory , just like we can't save users who will type in " sudo rm - rf / " in a terminal because an email told them to .
This just brings . desktop files up to normal POSIX levels of executable security , nothing more or less .
In other words , the fixes should minimize the chances of a malware infection of the type describes by foobar , but , as many commenters have pointed out , nothing can completely counter user ignorance , rashness , or plain stupidity .
The most that desktop developers can do , short of restricting desktop files to a degree that most users would find unacceptable , is to make users aware of the consequences of their possible actions .

Bush 's former Secretary of Homeland Security , was a guest on John King 's CNN show where he chastised Limbaugh for his " shrill " vicious attacks on people instead of ideas .
He 's concerned that the GOP needs to restore itself as a national party and that the way Limbaugh is going about it is counterproductive .
This morning a much larger audience watched one of the last nationally popular Republican leaders , Colin Powell , who has been harshly criticized by the far right , try to move his party back towards the mainstream , pointing out that Limbaugh is nothing more than a well - paid entertainer who has used his own contemptible racism as a tool to attack his ( Powell 's ) ideas .
It was a very powerful appearance and I suggest you give it a listen if you missed it : Powell did n't mention that Limbaugh and Cheney were both selfish and hypocritical draft - dodgers and phonies -- but he got the point across pretty well .
He did mention that “ Rush will not get his wish , and Mr. Cheney was misinformed ; I ’m still a Republican . ”

( CNN ) -- Canada will ask the Russian ambassador to explain why two Canadians who worked at the NATO Information Office in Moscow had their diplomatic accreditation revoked , Canada 's foreign ministry said Wednesday .
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov postponed a trip to Brussels because of the NATO exercises .
" Canada strongly objects to Russia 's unjustifiable decision to expel [ the ] two Canadians , " said Rene Lemay , spokesman for the nation 's Foreign Affairs ministry .
The latest developments come after Belgium revoked the diplomatic accreditation of two Russian representatives at NATO headquarters last week .
The Belgian Foreign Ministry accused the two Russians of spying activities incompatible with their diplomatic status , Russia 's Interfax news agency reported .
Moscow described Belgium 's accusations as trumped up and promised a response , Interfax reported .
Isabelle Francois , the head of the NATO Information Office in Moscow , and another official from her office were stripped of their accreditation , the Russian Foreign Ministry reported .
Both were also accredited as attaches with the Canadian Embassy in Russia .
Do n't Miss Russia slams NATO plan to expel diplomats
Russia is refraining from declaring the two personae non gratae , a Russian Foreign Ministry official told Interfax .
Russia is unhappy with NATO military exercises beginning this week in Georgia and scheduled to last a month .
Russia has accused the alliance of " muscle - flexing . "
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov postponed his trip to Brussels , Belgium , for Wednesday 's ministerial meeting of the NATO - Russia Council because of the planned exercises , Lavrov told the Itar - Tass news agency .
A spokeswoman for NATO , however , said Lavrov was never supposed to attend the meeting because it is being held at the ambassadorial level .
It was unclear whether he was intending to be in Brussels for another matter .
NATO ministers had agreed to use Wednesday 's meeting " as a forum for dialogue with Russia on all issues -- where they agree and disagree -- with a view toward resolving problems and building practical co-operation , " said an announcement issued earlier this year .

By 1940 , George Orwell had behind him four conventional “ social ” novels and , more significantly , three books of documentary reportage , each one better than the last , culminating in his classic account of the Spanish Civil War , Homage to Catalonia .
Gradually in the others but culminating in Homage , Orwell perfected his signature “ plain ” style , which so resembles someone speaking honestly and without pretence directly to you , and he had more or less settled on his political opinions : “ Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written , directly or indirectly , against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism , as I understand it . ”
So he said in 1946 .
But while this may have been settled , there were other matters Orwell was still working out in his mind .
The subjects of the essays Orwell wrote in the 1940s are almost all , in one way or another , things Orwell does n’t like .
The essays are incessantly self - contradicting .
First ,
Orwell declares that no great novel could now be written from a Catholic ( or communist ) perspective ; later he allows that a novel could be written from such a perspective , in a pinch ; and then , in his essay on Graham Greene , he comes very near to suggesting that only Catholics can now write novels .
In his essay on T S Eliot , he writes that it is “ fashionable to say that in verse only the words count and ‘ meaning ’ is irrelevant , but in fact every poem contains a prose - meaning , and when the poem is any good it is a meaning which the poet urgently wishes to express .
All art is to some extent propaganda . ”
Several years later , in “ The Prevention of Literature ” , in arguing for the idea that poetry might survive totalitarianism while prose would not , he writes that “ what the poet is saying – that is , what his poem ‘ means ’ if translated into prose – is relatively unimportant even to himself ” .
What is particularly frustrating about these contradictions is that at each successive moment Orwell presents them in his great style , his wonderful sharp - edged plain - spoken style , which makes you feel that there is no way on earth you could possibly disagree with him , unless you ’re part of the pansy left , or a sandal - wearer and fruit - juice drinker , or maybe just a crank .
In a way I ’m exaggerating , because the rightness of Orwell on a number of topics has been an albatross around his neck for 60 years .
In truth , Orwell was wrong about all sorts of things , not least the inner logic of totalitarianism : he thought a mature totalitarian system would so deform its citizenry that they would not be able to overthrow it .
This was the nightmare vision of Nineteen Eighty - Four .
In fact , as it turned out in Russia , even the ruling elite was not willing to maintain mature totalitarianism after Stalin ’s death .
Other totalitarian regimes have repeated the pattern .
Orwell was wrong and Orwell contradicted himself .
He was more insightful about the distant dangers of communist thought - control , in the Soviet Union , than the more pressing thought - control of western consumerism .
Nor did he see the sexual revolution coming , not by a long shot ; one wonders what the too - frequent taunter of the “ pansy left ” would have made of the fact that the gay movement was one of the most successful , because most militant , of the post - 1960s liberation struggles .
But there is a deeper logic in Orwell ’s essays , beneath the contradictions and inevitable oversights .
The crisis that he was writing himself through in the 1940s was the crisis of the war and , even more confusingly , the postwar .
It involved a kind of projection into the future of certain tendencies latent in the present .
Orwell worries about the potential Sovietisation of Europe , but also the infection by totalitarian thinking of life outside the Soviet sphere – not just specific threats to specific freedoms , but to deeper structures of feeling .
As the philologist Syme says to Winston Smith in Nineteen Eighty - Four : “ Do n’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought ? . . .
Every year fewer and fewer words , and the range of consciousness is smaller . ”
If Orwell was wrong in some sense about the long - term development of totalitarianism , he was right about its deepest intellectual intentions , about the rot it wished to create at the centre of thinking itself .
And he was right that this rot could spread .
One solution would be to cordon off literature from life and politics entirely : this was , in some sense , the solution adopted by the writers of the previous generation – Eliot , James Joyce , D H Lawrence , Ezra Pound – whom Orwell calls the writers of the 1920s and we now call the high modernists .
And yet he did not want to make a special plea for literature ; in fact , of all the writers of his time , Orwell was constitutionally the least capable of making this separation .
His own writing and politics were the fruit of his specific experience – of imperialism in Burma , of the conditions in the English coal mines , of the war in Spain .
He insists on several occasions that “ all art is propaganda ” – the expression of a particular world - view .
In Dickens ’s case , for example , this is the world - view of a classic 19th - century bourgeois liberal , a world - view Orwell admires even as he sees its limitations .
For the Orwell of the early essays , the case of Henry Miller is the tough one .
Because while Dickens ’s politics are in the end congenial enough , Miller ’s quietism is less so .
“ I first met Miller at the end of 1936 , when I was passing through Paris on my way to Spain , ” writes Orwell .
“ What most intrigued me about him was to find that he felt no interest in the Spanish war whatever .
He merely told me in forcible terms that to go to Spain at that moment was the act of an idiot . ”
Orwell nonetheless went to Spain , and fought there .
He was a writer who felt it was vital to let politics animate his work ; Miller was the opposite .
And yet Orwell contrasts Miller favourably to W H Auden , who at this time in the poem “ Spain ” was miming the thoughts of the good party man about the “ necessary murder ” .
Miller is so far removed from this sort of sentiment , so profound is his individualism and his conviction , that Orwell comes close to endorsing it : “ Seemingly there is nothing left but quietism robbing reality of its terrors by simply submitting to it .
Get inside the whale – or rather , admit that you are inside the whale ( for you are , of course ) . ”
Except Orwell does n’t really mean this .
He may be inside the whale but he does not intend to stop disturbing its digestion , he does not intend to be any more quietistic .
What he admired above all in Miller was his willingness to go against the grain of the time .
While all art is propaganda , it need n’t necessarily propagandise something correct .
The important thing is that the writer himself believe it .
But there are certain things that you simply can’t believe .
“ No one ever wrote a great novel in praise of the Inquisition , ” he asserts .
Is that true ?
At almost the exact same moment , Jean - Paul Sartre ( a writer who , Orwell thought , incorrectly , was “ full of air ” ) was writing in What Is Literature ? :
“ Nobody can suppose for a moment that it is possible to write a good novel in praise of anti-Semitism . ”
Is that true ?
It seems to have been a problem that leftist writers of the 1940s were going to face by sheer bluff assertion .
For Orwell the number of beliefs hostile to literary production seemed to expand and expand .
Eliot ’s “ Four Quartets ” is labelled “ Pétainist ” – a fairly strong term to hurl at a long experimental poem that does n’t even rhyme .
And Salvador Dalí , in “ Benefit of Clergy ” , is a “ rat ” .
As the war goes on , then ends , Orwell ’s sense of peril grows sharper , and he looks at literature in a different way .
He comes to think that no matter who wins , the world will find itself split again into armed camps , each of them threatening the others , none of them truly free – and literature will simply not survive .
This is the landscape of Nineteen Eighty - Four and it is also the landscape of his later essays – “ The Prevention of Literature ” , “ Politics and the English Language ” , “ Writers and Leviathan ” .
There is even , momentarily , a kind of hallucination , in the curious short piece “ Confessions of a Book Reviewer ” , where some of Orwell ’s old interest in the starving writer crops up , now mixed with the wintry gloominess of his later years :
“ In a cold but stuffy bed - sitting room littered with cigarette ends and half - empty cups of tea , a man in a moth - eaten dressing gown sits at a rickety table , trying to find room for his typewriter among the piles of dusty papers that surround it . . .
He is a man of 35 , but looks 50 .
He is bald , has varicose veins and wears spectacles , or would wear them if only his pair were not chronically lost . ”
Who is this but Winston Smith , the failed hero of Nineteen Eighty - Four , figured as a book reviewer ?
Or who , conversely , is Winston Smith , but a book reviewer figured as the prisoner of a futuristic totalitarian regime ?
With great doggedness , Orwell keeps delving into the question of literature ’s position in society , and what might be done to keep it alive in a time of total politics .
In “ Writers and Leviathan ” , dated 1948 , he argues that writers must ultimately separate themselves from their political work .
It ’s a depressing essay and it ends – one wonders whether Orwell was aware of this – with an echo of the line of Auden ’s he so reviled : the writer capable of separating himself from his political activity will be the one who “ stands aside , records the things that are done and admits their necessity , but refuses to be deceived as to their true nature ” .
Orwell was always a realist who knew that politics was a dirty business –
but he was never quite such a realist as here .
The realm of freedom had finally shrunk to a small , small point , and it had to be defended .
As Winston Smith says in Nineteen Eighty - Four , “ Nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull . ”
It is hard not to wonder whether the pessi­mism of this conclusion was partly a response to the art ( or propaganda ) Orwell was himself creating in those years .
He had published Animal Farm in 1945 ; weakened by the tuberculosis that would kill him , he was writing Nineteen Eighty - Four in 1947 - 48 .
After the reception of Animal Farm , and with the direction Nineteen Eighty - Four was taking , it must have been clear to him on some level that the world was going to use these books in a certain way .
And it did use them that way .
The socialist critique of Orwell ’s late work seems essentially correct – they were not only anti-Stalinist but anti-revolutionary , and were read as such by millions of ordinary people ( a fact that Orwell , who was always curious to know what ordinary people thought , would have had to respect ) .
Out of “ necessity ” he had chosen a position , and a way of stating that position , that would be used for years to come to bludgeon the anti-war , anti-imperialist left .
That he had chosen honestly what seemed to him the least bad of a set of bad political options did not make them , in the long view of history , any better .
But what a wonderful writer he had become !
That voice – once you ’ve heard it , how do you get it out of your head ?
It feels like the truth , even when it ’s not telling the truth .
It is clear and sharp but unhurried ; Orwell is not afraid to be boring , which means that he is never boring .
His voice as a writer had been formed before Spain , but Spain gave him a jolt – not the fighting nor his injury ( a sniper had shot him through the throat in 1937 ) , though these had their effects , but the calculated campaign of deception he saw in the press when he got back , waged by people who knew better .
“ Early in life I had noticed that no event is ever correctly reported in a newspaper , ” Orwell recalled , “ but in Spain , for the first time , I saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts , not even the relationship which is implied in an ordinary lie .
I saw great battles reported where there had been no fighting , and complete silence where hundreds of men had been killed . . .
This kind of thing is frightening to me , because it often gives me the feeling that the very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world .
After all , the chances are that those lies , or at any rate similar lies , will pass into history . ”
This insight reverberates through Orwell ’s work for the rest of his life .
The answer to lies is to tell the truth .
But how ?
How do you even know what the truth is , and how do you create a style in which to tell it ?
Orwell ’s answer is laid out in “ Politics and the English Language ” :
You avoid ready phrases , you purge your language of dead metaphors , you do not claim to know what you do not know .
Far from being a relaxed prose ( which is how it seems ) , Orwell ’s is a supremely vigilant one .
It is interesting that Orwell did not go to university .
He went to Eton , but loafed around there and , afterwards , went off to Burma as a police officer .
University is where you sometimes get loaded up with fancy terms whose meaning you ’re not quite sure of .
Orwell was an intellectual and a highbrow who thought Joyce , Eliot and Lawrence were the greatest writers of his age , but he never uses fancy terms .
You could say that Orwell was not essentially a literary critic , or that he was the only kind of literary critic worth reading .
He was most interested in the way that literature intersects with life , with the world , with groups of actual people .
Some of his more enjoyable essays deal with things that a lot of people read and consume – postcards , detective fiction , “ good bad books ” ( and poetry ) – simply because a lot of people consume them .
Postwar intellectuals would celebrate ( or bemoan ) the “ rise of mass culture ” .
Orwell never saw it as a novel phenomenon .
He was one of the first critics to take popular culture seriously because he believed it had always been around and simply wanted attention .
These essays are part of a deeply democratic commitment to culture in general and reading in particular .
His reading of writers who were more traditionally “ literary ” is shot through with the same commitment .
Orwell had read a great deal , and his favourite writers were by many standards difficult writers , but he refused to appeal to the occult mechanisms of literary theory .
“ One ’s real reaction to a book , when one has a reaction at all , is usually ‘ I like this book ’ or ‘ I do n’t like it , ’ and what follows is a rationalisation .
But ‘ I like this book ’ is not , I think , a non-literary reaction . ”
And the “ rationalisation ” , he saw , was going to involve your background , your expectations , the historical period you ’re living through .
If we compare Orwell to his near - contemporary Edmund Wilson , who was in many senses a more sensitive critic , we see Orwell ’s peculiar strength .
At almost the exact same moment as Orwell , in early 1940 , Wilson published a psychobiographical essay on Dickens in which he traced much of Dickens ’s later development to his brush with poverty as a young man .
Orwell ’s treatment is much more sociological and political , and in a way less dramatic than Wilson’s .
Yet at one point Orwell encapsulates Wilson ’s argument with a remarkable concision : “ Dickens had grown up near enough to poverty to be terrified of it , and in spite of his generosity of mind , he is not free from the special prejudices of the shabby - genteel . ”
This is stark , and fair , and that “ terrified ” is unforgettable .
You can tie yourself in knots – many leftist intellectuals have done this over the years – trying to prove that Orwell ’s style is a façade , an invention , a mask he put on when he changed his name from Eric Blair to “ George Orwell ” ; that by seeming to tell the whole story in plain and honest terms , it actually makes it more difficult to see , it obfuscates , the part of the story that ’s necessarily left out ; that ultimately it rubber - stamps the status quo .
In some sense , intellectually , all this is true enough ; you can spend a day , a week , a semester proving it .
There really are things in the world that Orwell ’s style would never be able to capture .
But there are very few such things .
Orwell did not want to become a saint , but he became a saint anyway .
For most of his career a struggling writer , eking out a living reviewing books at an astonishing rate , he was gradually acknowledged , especially after the appearance of Homage to Catalonia in 1938 , to be a great practitioner of English prose .
With the publication of Animal Farm – a book turned down by several of England ’s pre-eminent houses because they did not want to offend Britain ’s ally the Soviet Union – Orwell became a household name .
Then his influence grew and grew , so that shortly after his death he was already a phenomenon .
“ In the Britain of the 1950s , ” the great cultural critic Raymond Williams once lamented , “ along every road that you moved , the figure of Orwell seemed to be waiting .
If you tried to develop a new kind of popular cultural analysis , there was Orwell ; if you wanted to report on work or ordinary life , there was Orwell ; if you engaged in any kind of socialist argument , there was an enormously inflated statue of Orwell warning you to go back . ”
In a way the incredible posthumous success of Orwell has seemed one of the more peculiar episodes in the cultural life of the west .
He was not , as Lionel Trilling once pointed out , a genius ; he was not mysterious ; he had served in Burma , washed dishes in a Parisian hotel , and fought for a few months in Spain , but this hardly added up to a life of adventure ; for the most part he lived in London and reviewed books .
So odd , in fact , has the success of Orwell seemed to some that there is even a book , George Orwell : the Politics of Literary Reputation , devoted to getting to the bottom of it .
When you return to his essays of the 1940s , the mystery evaporates .
You would probably not be able to write this way now , even if you learned the craft : the voice would seem put-on , after Orwell .
But there is nothing put - on about it here , and it seems to speak , despite the specificity of the issues discussed , directly to the present .
In Orwell ’s clear , strong voice we hear a warning .
Because we , too , live in a time when truth is disappearing from the world , and doing so in just the way Orwell worried it would : through language .
We move through the world by naming things in it , and we explain the world through sentences and stories .
The lesson of these essays is clear : Look around you .
Describe what you see as an ordinary observer – for you are one , you know – would see them .
Take things seriously .
And tell the truth .
Tell the truth .

Medical journals are highly corrupt : they only print " science " that agrees with the belief systems of the top editors .
The vast majority of articles published in most journals have conflicts of interest where , for example , researchers are funded by the very same drug companies that stand to financial benefit from the conclusions of the published studies .
In reality , today 's medical journals are collections of scientific fiction , wishful thinking , and outright scientific fraud posing as hard science .
Oh yes , and to top it all off , many journals are primarily funded by advertising revenues from the very companies whose products are being studied .
Objectivity is simply impossible in such an environment .
Clearly , it 's time for a change , and the PLoS medical journals look like the most promising entry for challenging the current system of medical journal corruption .
Everyone ’s favorite stoners , Richard " Cheech " Marin and Tommy Chong , do n’t smoke anymore , but if they did , they say they ’d share .
Chong has just one ( hypothetical ) rule : “ If you take my stash , make sure you replace it . ”
“ I ’m very liberal , ” he explained .
“ I tell my kids , if you ’re going to do drugs , replace them . ”
Still , the iconic druggie duo ’s days of toking up went up in smoke years ago – officially speaking , at least .
“ Officially , we do n’t smoke , never have , ” Chong said .
Cheech agreed : “ Officially , that ’s our position . ”
The pair have been cracking stoner jokes for 40 years now , though their act has hardly been consistent thanks to their on - again / off - again relationship .
While many couples avoid labels in unstable relationships , Cheech and Chong seem to have worked out the differences that kept them apart for nearly two decades and are eager to make things official :
They ’re back together , have never been happier , and have a revised drug policy , too .
Chong , who spent time in prison after pleading guilty to drug paraphernalia distribution charges in 2003 , tries to promote a pot policy that is both by the book and on the right side of the law .
Officially , of course .
“ Our official position is that marijuana is a medicine and it should be taken only by people who need it , ” he said .
“ Do you need some ? ” Cheech asked , effectively lightening the mood with an infectious giggle .
“ I can get you a good deal . ”
As the two joke back and forth it can be hard to know when they are , in fact , joking and when the ribbing has nothing to do with the act .
Though they ’ve endured some mighty contentious times – they hardly spoke for nearly 20 years after experiencing a falling - out in the mid-1980s and only officially reunited last year – Cheech and Chong seem to have picked up right where they left off .
“ We ’re back to entertaining each other again , ” Chong said .
“ I try to think of things to crack him up , and he ’ll crack me up .
The strength of ‘ Cheech and Chong ’ was that we did n’t need an audience because we had each other . ”
The first couple of drug culture comedy was honored in Las Vegas in November during a roast that was part of the annual Comedy Festival at Caesars Palace .
Six months after being roasted , they ’re back - “ And now we ’re being toasted , ” Cheech chimed .
Their “ Light Up America ” tour will sparked up the Pearl Saturday evening .
Though time has mellowed 62 - year - old Cheech and 70 - year - old Chong , the older and wiser duo say their act is “ smoother , longer and funnier , ” than when they performed at Ceasars last fall .
In addition to their current North American tour , the two have several other projects on the go , both together and individually .
They have announced another movie , have an animated film in the works and recently taped a live DVD .
Cheech – who has had a successful solo career doing voiceover work for Disney and appearing on the small screen first with Nash Bridges and more recently on Lost – credits “ poverty and the will of God ” as the incentives that persuaded him and Chong to return to their roots and familiar roles .
According to Chong , the forthcoming Cheech and Chong movie will involve a new take on an old classic : “ Its working title is Grumpy Old Stoners , ” Chong said , explaining , “ It ’s Up In Smoke 30 years later . ”
He says the flick , which will start filming in the fall and is slotted for a summer 2010 release , will be a combination of old characters in new situations .
“ We ’ve got all these characters that were never featured before in our movies , ” Chong said , “ ( So ) this movie has a lot of new characters in different scenarios .
“ It ’s going to probably be the top - grossing movie of all time , ” he predicted .
The two are reluctant to discuss retirement in absolutes .
“ We do n’t want to beat the horse to death , ” Chong said before explaining that they ’re sticking to a “ One day , one - tour - at - a - time kind of approach . ”
“ As long as we ’re having fun , we ’ll do it , ” Cheech offered .
Despite more than four decades of ups and downs , drugs and drug busts , the iconic duo do n’t seem to have many regrets .
“ I probably would n’t have been the second Star Trek movie , ” Cheech said , “ but that ’s probably it . ”
Defense Secretary Robert Gates is going to the country 's war colleges this week , to explain his radical remake of America 's arsenal .
It looks like I 'll be traveling with Gates on Thursday and Friday .
At his stop today at the Air War College , Gates provided additional details on his decision to end production of the F - 22 stealth jet .
He said he was absolutely committed to making sure that America 's keeps up its dominance of the skies .
But in asking himself " what are the things that the F - 22 , and only the F - 22 , can do , " he found there were only limited answers .
* There is no doubt that the F - 22 has unique capabilities that we need – the penetration and defeat of an advanced enemy air defense and fighter fleet .
But , the F - 22 is , in effect , a niche , silver - bullet solution required for a limited number of scenarios – to overcome advanced enemy fighters and air defense systems . *
That view is in stark contrast to how the Air Force characterizes the F - 22 Raptor – as a plane that can do everything from reconnaissance to electronic attack to bombing runs .
**
The F - 22s are n't only so - called " fifth generation " fighters the
U.S. is buying , of course .
The Pentagon is also spending hundreds of billions on Joint Strike
Fighters , too .
The combination of F - 22s and JSFs means that the U.S. has a major head start on any potential dogfighting adversaries .
> Russia is probably 6 years away from Initial Operating Capability of a fifth - generation fighter and the Chinese are 10 to 12 years away .
By then we will have more than 1,000 fifth - generation fighters in our inventory .

Concern over flu pandemic justified
Dr Margaret Chan
Director - General of the World Health Organization
Mister President , honourable ministers , excellencies , distinguished delegates , Dr Mahler , ladies and gentlemen ,
Over the past three decades , the world has , on average , been growing richer .
People have , on average , been enjoying longer and healthier lives .
But these encouraging trends hide a brutal reality .
Today , differences in income levels , in opportunities , and in health status , within and between countries , are greater than at any time in recent history .
Our world is dangerously out of balance , and most especially so in matters of health .
The current economic downturn will diminish wealth and health , but the impact will be greatest in the developing world .
Human society has always been characterized by inequities .
History has long had its robber - barons and its Robin Hoods .
The difference today is that these inequities , especially in access to health care , have become so deadly .
The world can be grateful that leaders from 189 countries endorsed the Millennium Declaration and its Goals as a shared responsibility .
These Goals are a profoundly important way to introduce greater fairness in this world .
Populations all around the world can be grateful that health officials are recommitting themselves to primary health care .
This is the surest route to greater equity in access to health care .
Public health can be grateful for backing from the Commission on Social Determinants of Health .
I agree entirely with the findings .
The great gaps in health outcomes are not random .
Much of the blame for the essentially unfair way our world works rests at the policy level .
Time and time again , health is a peripheral issue when the policies that shape this world are set .
When health policies clash with prospects for economic gain , economic interests trump health concerns time and time again .
Time and time again , health bears the brunt of short - sighted , narrowly focused policies made in other sectors .
Equity in health matters .
It matters in life - and - death ways .
The HIV / AIDS epidemic taught us this , in a most visible and measurable way .
We see just how much equity matters when crises arise .
Ladies and gentlemen ,
The world is facing multiple crises , on multiple fronts .
Last year , our imperfect world delivered , in short order , a fuel crisis , a food crisis , and a financial crisis .
It also delivered compelling evidence that the impact of climate change has been seriously underestimated .
These crises come at a time of radically increased interdependence among nations , their financial markets , economies , and trade systems .
All of these crises are global , and all will hit developing countries and vulnerable populations the hardest .
All threaten to leave this world even more dangerously out of balance .
All will show the consequences of decades of failure to invest in health systems , decades of failure to consider the importance of equity , and decades of blind faith that mere economic growth is the be-all , end - all , cure - for - all .
It is not .
The consequences of flawed policies show no mercy and make no exceptions on the basis of fair play .
As we have seen , the financial crisis has been highly contagious , moving rapidly from one country to another , and from one sector of the economy to many others .
Even countries that managed their economies well , did not purchase toxic assets , and did not take excessive financial risks are suffering the consequences .
Likewise , the countries that contributed least to greenhouse gas emissions will be the first and hardest hit by climate change .
And now we have another great global contagion on our doorstep : the prospect of the first influenza pandemic of this century .
Ladies and gentlemen ,
For five long years , outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in poultry , and sporadic frequently fatal cases in humans , have conditioned the world to expect an influenza pandemic , and a highly lethal one .
As a result of these long years of conditioning , the world is better prepared , and very scared .
As we now know , a new influenza virus with great pandemic potential , the new influenza A ( H1N1 ) strain , has emerged from another source on another side of the world .
Unlike the avian virus , the new H1N1 virus spreads very easily from person to person , spreads rapidly within a country once it establishes itself , and is spreading rapidly to new countries .
We expect this pattern to continue .
Unlike the avian virus , H1N1 presently causes mainly mild illness , with few deaths , outside the outbreak in Mexico .
We hope this pattern continues .
New diseases are , by definition , poorly understood when they emerge , and this is most especially true when the causative agent is an influenza virus .
Influenza viruses are the ultimate moving target .
Their behaviour is notoriously unpredictable .
The behaviour of pandemics is as unpredictable as the viruses that cause them .
No one can say how the present situation will evolve .
The emergence of the H1N1 virus creates great pressure on governments , ministries of health , and WHO to make the right decisions and take the right actions at a time of great scientific uncertainty .
On 29 April , I raised the level of pandemic influenza alert from phase 4 to phase 5 .
We remain in phase 5 today .
This virus may have given us a grace period , but we do not know how long this grace period will last .
No one can say whether this is just the calm before the storm .
Presence of the virus has now been confirmed in several countries in the southern hemisphere , where epidemics of seasonal influenza will soon be picking up .
We have every reason to be concerned about interactions of the new H1N1 virus with other viruses that are currently circulating in humans .
Moreover , we must never forget that the H5N1 avian influenza virus is now firmly established in poultry in several countries .
No one can say how this avian virus will behave when pressured by large numbers of people infected with the new H1N1 virus .
Ladies and gentlemen ,
The move to phase 5 activated a number of stepped up preparedness measures .
Public health services , laboratories , WHO staff , and industry are working around the clock .
A defining characteristic of a pandemic is the almost universal vulnerability of the world ’s population to infection .
Not all people become infected , but nearly all people are at risk .
Manufacturing capacity for antiviral drugs and influenza vaccines is finite and insufficient for a world with 6.8 billion inhabitants .
It is absolutely essential that countries do not squander these precious resources through poorly targeted measures .
As you heard this morning , we are trying to get some answers to a number of questions that will strengthen risk assessment and allow me to issue more precise advice to governments .
Ideally , we will have sufficient knowledge soon to advise countries on high - risk groups and recommend that efforts and resources be targeted to these groups .
I have listened very carefully to your comments this morning .
As the chief technical officer of this Organization , I will follow your instructions carefully , particularly concerning criteria for a move to phase 6 , in discharging my duties and responsibilities to Member States .
While many questions do not have firm answers right now , I can assure you on one point .
When WHO receives information of life - saving importance , such as the heightened risk of complications in pregnant women , we alert the international community immediately .
To date , most outbreaks have occurred in countries with good detection and reporting capacities .
Let me take this opportunity to thank the governments of these countries for the diligence of their surveillance , their transparency in reporting , and their generosity in sharing information and viruses .
An influenza pandemic is an extreme expression of the need for solidarity before a shared threat .
We are fortunate that the outbreaks are causing mainly mild cases of illness in these early days .
I strongly urge the international community to use this grace period wisely .
I strongly urge you to look closely at anything and everything we can do , collectively , to protect developing countries from , once again , bearing the brunt of a global contagion .
I have reached out to the manufacturers of antiviral drugs and vaccines .
I have reached out to Member States , donor countries , UN agencies , civil society organizations , nongovernmental organizations , and foundations .
I have stressed to them the absolute need to extend preparedness and mitigation measures to the developing world .
The United Nations Secretary - General is joining me in these efforts , which are tireless .
Ladies and gentlemen ,
As I said , equity in health matters in life - and - death ways .
It matters most especially in times of crisis .
The world of today is more vulnerable to the adverse effects of an influenza pandemic than it was in 1968 , when the last pandemic of the previous century began .
The speed and volume of international travel have increased to an astonishing degree .
As we are seeing right now with H1N1 , any city with an international airport is at risk of an imported case .
The radically increased interdependence of countries amplifies the potential for economic disruption .
Apart from an absolute moral imperative , trends such as outsourcing and just - in - time production compel the international community to make sure that no part of the world suffers disproportionately .
We have to care about equity .
We have to care about fair play .
These vulnerabilities , to imported cases , to disrupted economies and businesses , affect all countries .
Unfortunately , other vulnerabilities are overwhelmingly concentrated in the developing world .
On current evidence , most cases of severe and fatal infections with the H1N1 virus , outside the outbreak in Mexico , are occurring in people with underlying chronic conditions .
In recent years , the burden of chronic diseases has increased dramatically , and shifted dramatically , from rich countries to poorer ones .
Today , around 85 % of the burden of chronic diseases is concentrated in low - and middle - income countries .
The implications are obvious .
The developing world has , by far , the largest pool of people at risk for severe and fatal H1N1 infections .
A striking feature of some of the current outbreaks is the presence of diarrhoea or vomiting in as many as 25 % of cases .
This is unusual .
If virus shedding is detected in faecal matter , this would introduce an additional route of transmission .
The significance could be especially great in areas with inadequate sanitation , including crowded urban shantytowns .
The next pandemic will be the first to occur since the emergence of HIV / AIDS and the resurgence of tuberculosis , also in its drug - resistant forms .
Today ’s world has millions of people whose lives depend on a regular supply of drugs and regular access to health services .
Most of these people live in countries where health systems are already overburdened , understaffed , and poorly funded .
The financial crisis is expected to increase that burden further , as more people forego private care and turn to publicly - financed services .
What will happen if sudden surges in the number of people requiring care for influenza push already fragile health services over the brink ?
What will happen if the world sees the end of an influenza pandemic , only to find itself confronted , say , with an epidemic of extensively drug - resistant tuberculosis ?
We have good reason to believe that pregnant women are at heightened risk of severe or fatal infections with the new virus .
We have to ask the question .
Will spread of the H1N1 virus increase the already totally unacceptable levels of maternal mortality , which are so closely linked to weak health systems ?
Ladies and gentlemen ,
In the midst of all these uncertainties , one thing is sure .
When an infectious agent causes a global public health emergency , health is not a peripheral issue .
It moves straight to centre stage .
The world is concerned about the prospect of an influenza pandemic , and rightly so .
This Health Assembly has been shortened for a good reason .
Health officials are now too important to be away from their home countries for more than a few days .
Much is in our hands .
How we manage this situation can be an investment case for public health .
The world will be watching , and one big question is certain to arise .
Are the world ’s public health services fit - for - purpose under the challenging conditions of this 21st century ?
Of course not .
And I think the consequences will be quickly , highly , and tragically visible .
Now comes the second question .
Will something finally be done ?
At the same time , we cannot , we dare not , let concerns about a pandemic overshadow or interrupt other vital health programmes .
In fact , many of the issues you will be addressing this week , or have addressed in recent sessions , concern exactly the capacities that will be needed during a pandemic , or any other public health emergency of international concern .
The health sector cannot be blamed for lack of foresight .
We have long known what is needed .
An effective public health response depends on strong health systems that are inclusive , offering universal coverage right down to the community level .
It depends on adequate numbers of appropriately trained , motivated , and compensated staff .
It depends on fair access to affordable medical products and other interventions .
All of these items are on your agenda .
I urge you , in particular , to complete work under the item on public health , innovation and intellectual property .
We are so very close .
The International Health Regulations , also on your agenda , give the health sector an advantage that financial managers , at the start of last year ’s crisis , did not have when faulty policies precipitated a global economic downturn .
The International Health Regulations provide a coordinated mechanism of early alert , and an orderly system for risk management that is driven by science , and not by vested interests .
I must remind you .
We need to finish the job of polio eradication , as guided by the ongoing independent evaluation .
I must also remind you that this job is already providing solid benefits as we reach for the goal of ridding the world of a devastating disease .
Right now , the vast surveillance networks and infrastructure in place for polio eradication are being used to step up surveillance for cases of H1N1 infection , especially in sub-Saharan Africa and the Asian sub -continent .
The proposed programme budget is also on your agenda .
WHO is prepared to lead the response to a global public health emergency .
Our services , in several areas , are strained , but we are coping .
We need to be assured that we can continue to function well , especially if the emergency escalates .
Ladies and gentlemen ,
I have a final comment to make .
Influenza viruses have the great advantage of surprise on their side .
But viruses are not smart .
We are .
Preparedness levels , and the technical and scientific know - how that supports them , have advanced enormously since 1968 .
We have the revised International Health Regulations , and we have tested and robust mechanisms like the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network .
As I said , an influenza pandemic is an extreme expression of the need for global solidarity .
We are all in this together .
And we will all get through this , together .
Thank you .
STANFORD , California —
We ’ve known that the DIY ethic is good for modding your Roomba or building a beer bong , but groups of college students have taken the movement to the next level : space .
Working on shoestring budgets and short timelines , duct tape and tape measures , CubeSat enthusiasts build 4 - inch square satellites and then piggyback their dreams on bigger missions ’ rockets .
They do it dirty and cheap , but their results are competitive with their spendier counterparts .
The CubeSat strategy was pioneered at Stanford University in the Space and Systems Development Laboratory , now headed by Andrew Kalman , a consulting professor .
In this Wired Science video , Kalman explains how CubeSats came to be , how they ’re built , and why they ’re important .
What was just a concept 10 years ago is now a thriving way of accessing space at very low cost .
Now , even NASA is giving the idea the thumbs up .
Tuesday , a new nanosatellite will take a ride into orbit on a Minotaur 1 rocket .
The entire satellite is just 4 inches tall and 12 inches long , like three standard CubeSats stuck together .
PharmaSat , as the NASA Ames project is known , will carry a small payload of yeast , which it will feed with nutrient liquid — and then attempt to kill — over the course of 100 hours .
The project is supposed to test the effectiveness of antifungals in killing microbes in space .
It turns out that low - gravity conditions can do strange things to earthling cells , including making them more virulent .
If we ’re going to send humans , with their huge complements of bacterial ecosystems into space , we need to know how microbes react to the low - gravity environment .
While the PharmaSat project adopts some of the CubeSat methods , keep in mind that it still helps to have NASA behind you .
The agency spent $ 3 million on PharmaSat , mostly bringing the rigor of the CubeSat up to NASA standards .
“ I do n’t think we ’re using exotic or one of - a - kind products , ” said Bruce Yost , PharmaSat mission manager at NASA Ames .
“ It ’s how it ’s put together . ”
PharmaSat grew out of an earlier proof - of - concept CubeSat project called GeneSat , which proved that engineers could send up a tiny satellite that would effectively nourish microbes and carry out detailed analysis of biological changes .
“ PharmaSat is kind of a version 2.0 of GeneSat , ” Yost said .
“ It ’s quite a bit lot more complicated .
It will handle more valves and fluids and microwells .
I tell people sometimes that it ’s GeneSat on steroids . ”
Even though the experiment will only take 100 hours or so , the limited bandwidth available to the satellite — which maxes out at 9600 baud — means that the PharmaSat will be beaming data down for months after the yeast die .

Ms Prejean says she does not regret her remarks
The runner - up at the Miss USA beauty pageant says her outspoken opposition to gay marriage cost her first place in the competition .
During the televised event , Carrie Prejean - Miss California - said she believed that " a marriage should be between a man and a woman " .
She had been asked for her views on the subject by one of the judges , celebrity blogger Perez Hilton .
" It did cost me my crown , " said Ms Prejean , after the competition .
The eventual winner of the pageant was Kristen Dalton , Miss North Carolina .
' Alienated '
" We live in a land where you can choose same - sex marriage or opposite marriage , " said Ms Prejean , in a section of the show that has become a popular clip on YouTube .
" I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a woman , " she continued .
" No offence to anybody out there , but that 's how I was raised . "
The remarks drew a mixture of booing and applause from the audience .
Speaking after the show , which was broadcast on Sunday evening in the US , Ms Prejean said : " I would n't have had it any other way .
I said what I feel .
I stated an opinion that was true to myself and that 's all I can do . "
Hilton said he had been " floored " by Ms Prejean 's answer , which , he said , " alienated millions of gay and lesbian Americans , their families and their supporters " .
He told ABC News : " She lost it because of that question .
She was definitely the front - runner before that . "
Keith Lewis , who runs the Miss California competition , released a statement condemning Ms Prejean 's comments .
" As co-director of the Miss California USA , I am personally saddened and hurt that Miss California believes marriage rights belong only to a man and a woman . "
The issue of same - sex marriage is a flashpoint in American politics .
Four US states now allow gay marriage , but many other states have passed legislation outlawing it .

The Chevy Volt will be a plug - in hybrid .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Toyota is recognized as one of the leaders in hybrid technology , so it may come as a surprise to some that the company is not terribly keen on selling hybrid plug-ins to consumers .
Even though the company is planning to build 500 plug - in Prius cars for test fleets , there are no immediate plans to develop plug - in hybrid technology for consumers .
At first , it may seem counter - intuitive for Toyota to shun plug - in hybrids .
After all , GM plans to release the Chevy Volt -- its plug - in hybrid -- next year .
But it makes a little more sense after you read Toyota 's reasoning , reported by AutoMonster.ca :
Toyota estimates sales of hybrids that can be recharged at household outlets may be 50,000 units a year at most and could be as few as 3,500 , Bill Reinert , U.S. national manager for advanced technology , told a National Academy of Sciences panel today in Washington .
Sales of Toyota 's Prius , the best - selling gasoline - electric vehicle , were almost 159,000 last year .
A market for the plug - in electric hybrid vehicles " will emerge , but their success depends on advantages over existing hybrids , " Reinert said in prepared remarks .
" There is a great deal of variation on how current PHEVs perform in real - world conditions . "
Clearly , Toyota think it already has a good think going with its current Prius -- no plug needed .
Plug-ins are considered somewhat inconvenient right now by many consumers .
They have to be charged regularly , and there needs to be the proper infrastructure to support plug-ins so that commuters can charge up their cars while at work .
Of course , the fact that 75 % of Americans live within 20 miles of their work means that the 40 - mile range of the Volt may be sufficient .
Besides , the Volt also has an electric - gasoline hybrid engine that can switch to gasoline when the battery runs down .
So at least there is n't the fear of being stuck .
Current electric - gasoline hybrids do n't have the plug - in factor .
They are desirable because they do n't require consumers to make any significant changes in their behavior .
Although , technically , the Volt would n't require a change , either .
But its battery is more expensive ( adding to the cost of the car ) .
Honda is also reluctant to introduce plug - in hybrids .
The company says it 's studying the matter to determine whether it is worth the investment in plug-ins .
The reluctance of the Japanese automakers to get involved may pave the way for American carmakers to lead the way for plug-ins .
But with Honda and Toyota offering a product consumers are already comfortable with ( and may prefer ) , does it even matter ?

THE Daily Record has uncovered the only CD ever made by Scotland ’s singing sensation Susan Boyle .
And you can listen to it EXCLUSIVELY on our player below .
It emerged last night that Susan , whose Britain ’s Got Talent triumph has made her an instant superstar , is being lined up for an appearance
on the Oprah Winfrey show which would give her the chance of a number one album in the US .
But the Record can reveal she made her first recording back in 1999 , when she sang blues ballad Cry Me A River for a charity CD .
Only 1000 copies of the disc were ever produced , but we ’ve got hold of the long - forgotten recording and it ’s now on our site .
A showbiz insider said : “ This is a real coup for the Record .
The whole world would have wanted to find this .
“ People will be scrambling to get their hands on this CD .
They will be like gold dust soon . ”
Susan , 48 , of Blackburn , West Lothian , has gone from obscurity to worldwide fame in less than a week after her amazing Britain ’s Got Talent debut .
So far , her performance of I Dreamed A Dream from Les Miserables has attracted more than 16 MILLION hits on YouTube .
And yesterday , she was doing the rounds of America ’s top morning TV chat shows .
CBS superstar Diane Sawyer interviewed Susan for the Early Show .
And Kathie Lee Gifford , host of NBC ’s Today Show , was so moved by her voice that she burst into tears .
Last night , it emerged that Susan has also been offered the chance to be a guest on the Oprah Winfrey show .
And BGT supremo Simon Cowell reckons that if the appearance goes ahead , it will guarantee that her debut album will top the charts in the States .
It ’s all a far cry from 1999 , when Susan recorded her track for the charity compilation CD at Whitburn Academy , where X Factor winner Leon Jackson went to school .
The Millennium Celebration disc , which was partly funded by Whitburn Community Council , was the brainchild of local newspaper editor Eddie Anderson .
He launched a search for unsigned acts to take part .
And as soon as he heard Susan at the auditions he knew he had found something special .
“ I was amazed when she sang , ” Eddie said .
“ It was probably the same reaction as everyone had last Saturday .
“ Susan was exactly the same then as she is now .
She has a fabulous and unique talent . ”
When Susan walked on to the Britain ’s Got Talent stage , the judges and audience seemed more interested in her appearance than her voice .
Simon , Piers Morgan and Amanda Holden rolled their eyes and raised their eyebrows when she told them she wanted to be a Broadway superstar like Elaine Paige .
But their scorn quickly turned to amazement when she started to sing .
Simon grinned as he admitted that Susan ’s voice was “ extraordinary ” .
Piers told her : “ I am giving you the biggest ‘ yes ’ I have ever given to anybody . ”
And Amanda added : “ It was a privilege to listen to you . ”
In the days that followed , Susan became a YouTube sensation .
Even Hollywood A-lister Demi Moore admitted she was moved to tears when she watched her performance .

The bookies have installed Susan as red - hot favourite to win the £ 100,000 Britain ’s Got Talent first prize .
But in her live satellite interview with Diane Sawyer yesterday , she was still keeping her feet firmly on the ground .
Asked about her newfound stardom , Susan giggled and said : “ Most mornings I wake up with a smile .
I ca n’t believe it has happened . ”
Susan has lived alone with her cat Pebbles since her mum Bridget died two years ago at the age of 91 .
She has admitted that she has never been on a date or even been kissed but she was too shy to discuss her spinster lifestyle on CBS .
“ Aaah , no comment , ” she said .
“ I do n’t want to talk about that . ”
Sawyer asked Susan what she would do with the prize money if she won , but she replied : “ Well , it ’s just baby steps at the moment , we shall see how things progress . ”
Susan would n’t rule out having a makeover as part of Britain ’s Got Talent , telling Sawyer : “ You ’ll have to watch the programme and find out . ”
But she did admit there would be no repeat of the dance steps she showed off on Saturday .
“ That ’s it , ” she insisted .
“ Let ’s try and keep it ladylike . ”
Susan suffered a mild form of brain damage at birth and she admitted to Sawyer that she was bullied when she was younger .
“ They did a bit , ” she said , “ but they always do that with someone who is quiet and I tended to be quiet at school .
“ Well , they have turned around .
They are nice to me now , so we will move on from there . ”
Susan said her friends and family were “ gobsmacked ” by her success .
And when Sawyer asked what she would say to her late parents if she could , she replied : “ I would like to say thank you for supporting me over the years , thank you for looking after me and I hope I can make you proud . ”
Sawyer replied : “ I certainly think you have done that .
We can not wait to see you over in the US . ”
Newspapers and websites all over America and beyond have been covering Susan ’s story , and hits on the Britain ’s Got Talent section of the ITV website have soared to more than half a million since Saturday .
But Susan wo n’t face the judges again until the end of next month , when she ’ll find out whether she has made it through to the live shows .
She said this week : “ I ’m taking it all in my stride and I ’m quite relaxed about everything .
“ I ’ve had lots of kind support from people so far .
Some of the things people have said have been marvellous and really lovely .
“ I ’ve been singing since I was 12 and have just never had this chance before .
I ’m glad I got the chance now .
I ’d love to have a musical career but we ’ll have to take one step at a time . ”
Susan added : “ I went on the audition to see how far I could get but the standard is very high .
“ You need a lot of hard work and perseverance to make it .
“ I think there is room for improvement though . ”
The big five Canadian banks  Royal Bank of Canada , Toronto - Dominion Bank , Bank of Nova Scotia , Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Bank of Montreal  survived the recent turmoil relatively unscathed .
Their balance sheets remain intact and their capital ratios are comfortably above requirements .
Yes , Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s government may buy as much as 125 billion Canadian dollars ( about $ 100 billion ) worth of mortgages , increasing banks ’ capacity to lend .
But this is small change compared with the scale of Washington ’s bailout .
Few would have predicted that Canadian banks , long derided as among the least autonomous because of stringent government oversight , would emerge from the global mayhem as some of the more independent international players .
Since Mr. Obama seems to admire the Canadian banking system , his administration might want to take a page out of its playbook .
This would entail building a national banking system based on a small number of large , broadly held , centrally and rigorously regulated firms .
Imitating the Canadian model would require sweeping consolidation of American banks .
This would be a very good thing .
Washington had difficulty figuring out the magnitude of the financial crisis because there are so many thousands of banks that it was impossible for regulators to get into all of them .
Washington is already on the path to achieving consolidation .
Eventually , some of the larger banks into which the government is injecting taxpayer money will probably be deemed beyond help , and will either be allowed to die or be partnered with other banks .
The market will take its cues from this stress - testing , and make its own bets on which banks will survive .
It ’s hard to predict how many will have survived when the dust settles , but the new landscape might consist of only 50 or 60 banking institutions .
More radically , Washington could take over the licensing of banks from the states , or , at the very least , consider more stringent regulation of global and super - regional banks .
After all , the Canadian system is considered successful not only because it has fewer banks to regulate , but because regulation is based on the tenets of safety and soundness .
There is no time to waste .
Reconfiguring the American banking structure to look more like the Canadian model would help restore much - needed confidence in a beleaguered financial system .
Why not emulate the best in the world , which happens to be right next door ?
At the very least , Hamilton would have approved .
There ’s something about the Diggbroglio that has left me scratching my head : how is it that so many people are up in arms about the DiggBar when they ’ve had nothing to say about the framing bars of StumbleUpon , FaceBook , etc. etc . ?
Now , please note that I ’m not saying the DiggBar , or any other framing bar , is cool and we should all love it .
I ’m not .
I absolutely , completely , totally get all the reasons why framing bars are bad for breaking bookmarking and navigating and search engines and copyright and hijacking content and so on .
But that ’s precisely why I ’m so confused , because we ’ve known for years now that framing bars are bad mojo — and yet StumbleUpon , for example , is based on bars .
There is a browser extension / plugin StumbleUpon thingy you can install , but there ’s also a web - based framing bar thing ( see this link , for example ) that they offer , and I bet people use .
You do n’t have to be a member to use it : I hit that link in a browser that allows cross - site frame loading and I get the bar and the page it ’s framing , and I ’ve never been a StumbleUpon member .
The source shows it ’s using iframe s to make it happen .
So far as I can tell , it ’s not really different from the DiggBar .
So why do we have people writing JavaScript and PHP and Ged - knows - what - else that specifically busts out of the DiggBar framing , instead of busting out of all framing ?
After all , site framing is universally agreed to be objectionable ; even yet - to - be - discovered life forms orbiting distant stars think it ’s a bad idea .
So why is one instance of it being targeted while the rest are tolerated ?
Why are we all not just using if ( top != self ) { top.location.replace(self.location.href ) ;} and other - language equivalents ?
Yes , I know , some of you do just that , but why is n’t everyone ?
Perhaps because I have yet to eradicate a stubborn streak of faith in the rationality of my peers , I assume that there ’s some technical difference here that I ’m missing and that , once understood , would let me understand the source of the outcry .
So can someone please explain to me , or point at an explanation that states , the technical ways in which the DiggBar is worse enough than already - extant framing bars that it ’s triggered this outrage ?
Again , nobody has to enumerate the complete list of the DiggBar ’s sins ; I understand .
A list of any different and more egregious sins would be just fine , though .
Also , if anyone comes up with a way to bust out of the frames while still preserving the bar — that is , correcting the problems framing bars cause while preserving their functionality for the people who want to use them — that would be extra-cool .
After all , people who use those services like the bars .
If we could let them browse the web the way they prefer while fixing bookmark / SEO / etc. problems framing bars can cause , that would be a win all the way around .
Update 14 Apr 09 : looks like Porter ‘s trying to keep the bar without the framing .
Update 16 Apr 09 : in his post about Digg changing the way the DiggBar will work , John Gruber lists ( by way of quoting Digg VP John Quinn ’s post about it ) the two things that made the DiggBar extra-objectionable ( at least in his eyes ) .
Thanks ,
John !
Boys '
English grades are up to a tenth worse when high numbers of girls are in the class with them , though girls ' grades are unaffected
Boys do worse in English when there are girls in their class , researchers will say today , contradicting the widely held belief that girls are always a good influence on boys in school .
Boys do best with " as few girls as possible " in English lessons at primary and secondary school , Steven Proud , a research student at Bristol University , will tell the Royal Economic Society 's conference .
But when it comes to maths and science , both boys and girls at primary school achieve up to a tenth of a grade more when there is a high proportion of girls in the class , Proud found .
Proud tracked boys ' and girls ' test results at the ages of seven , 11 , 14 and 16 in 16,000 schools in England between 2002 and 2004 for his PhD .
He analysed the test scores to see whether the proportion of girls in a year group made a difference to the results of both genders in maths , science and English .
There are marginally more boys than girls in schools , but most classes in mixed schools are almost equally split between the genders .
Proud looked at these and schools that were exceptional in their high or low proportion of girls .
Boys consistently perform up to a tenth of a grade worse when they study English with high numbers of girls as opposed to few or no girls , Proud found .
The more girls there are in an English class , the worse boys perform .
This is particularly the case in primary schools , he discovered .
Proud will argue that his results show boys should be taught English in single - sex classes .
Girls , who outperform boys in English at every stage at school , are unaffected by the number of boys in their English classes .
Girls also do better when there are some boys who receive free school meals in their class , Proud found .
He said : " The results imply that boys would benefit at all ages from being taught English with as small a proportion of girls as possible .
In maths and science , the results tend to imply that both boys and girls benefit from having more girls in the classroom .
A mix of the genders in both science and maths is optimal . "
Proud said boys may do worse in English when there is a high proportion of girls in their class because they realise that the girls are better than them .
It could also be that teachers use teaching styles more appropriate to girls when there are more girls than boys in the class .
Both genders perform better in maths and science at primary school when there are more girls in the class because boys tend to disrupt the class more , he said .
Professor Alan Smithers , director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham , said girls started school with slightly better verbal skills , while boys started with a slightly greater aptitude for maths .
" Boys might be discouraged by how well girls are doing in English , " he said , " but that still does not explain why they would do better in maths and science with a higher proportion of girls in their class .
" This is one study , among many , which detects very small differences between boys and girls .
But you can't say that it means boys or girls should be separated .
It has very little practical importance for schools . "
Why , yes , my hooman is single .
How did you guess ?

Omidreza Mirsayafi started a blog in Iran to write about traditional Persian music and culture .
He was arrested , and died last week in a Tehran prison .
" I am a cultural and not a political blogger , " Mirsayafi had said in November following his trial under laws which prohibit insulting the Supreme Guide Khomeini , and making propaganda against the state .
" Of all the articles I have posted online , only two or three were satirical .
I did not mean to insult anyone . "
Sentenced to two years prison , Mirsayafi emailed Reporters Without Borders ( RSF ) , the Paris - based organisation in support of press freedom .
" I am worried .
The problem is not my sentence of two years in prison .
But I am a sensitive person .
I will not have the energy to live in prison .
I want everything to be like it was before .
I want to resume my normal life and continue my studies . "
Mirsayafi ’s name is still listed on the RSF ’s website among 69 cyber - dissidents in prison , including another three in Iran .
The timing of Mirsayafi ’s death was a sad full stop to a week that had started with Online Free Expression Day on March 12 , and had also seen the RSF release its 2009 Internet Enemies report .
While it might shock few that Iran again featured in this annual summary of regimes with a repressive hold on their country ’s cursors , it was a surprise to see Australia on that list also .
Twelve countries were identified as internet enemies : Saudi Arabia , Burma , China , Cuba , Egypt , Iran , North Korea , Syria , Tunisia , Turkmenistan , Uzbekistan and Vietnam .
Each has " transformed the network into an intranet " , and are marked " not just for their capacity to censor news and information online but also for their almost systematic repression of internet users . "
The report also listed 11 countries the RSF has placed " under surveillance " for adopting or considering measures that could open the way to online abuses of information .
They include Belarus , Bahrain , the United Arab Emirates , Eritrea , Malaysia , Thailand , Yemen and Zimbabwe .
More disturbingly , perhaps , was the fact that for the first time , two countries with a high level of democratic freedom — Australia and South Korea — were included in this category .
The principle reason for Australia ’s inclusion was for its proposed " clean feed " filter for censoring internet content .
The report raised alarm at the lack of transparency in the system : " The law does not say who would decide that websites were ‘ inappropriate ’ .
It will not be users who will draw attention to content to be banned . "
In addition , the report referred to Australia ’s anti-terror legislation enacted in the wake of September 11 .
" The law has allowed the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) to carry out independent investigations , including in the absence of judicial authorisation . "
While many Western democracies have filters of some sort in place , the Australian version differs by being a mandatory model .
Vincent Brossel , head of the RSF ’s Asia - Pacific desk said that by naming Australia the organisation wanted to open a debate .
" Australia and many other countries are facing these issues .
But the intention is wrong , and the way Australia is doing it , especially through obliging all ISPs to block access , is exactly the same as methods implemented by authoritarian regimes . "
Countries such as China and Cuba are known for their efforts to repress information .
Brossel says Australia ’s current path is a dangerous one for a recognised democracy to tread .
" We need to be careful what is going on in the democratic world .
The fact an established democracy like Australia can imagine that internet control and surveillance is a solution is nonsensical .
Freedom of expression on the internet is very crucial .
It would be a paradox for Australia to promote democracy in Asia , if they cannot even manage their own internet , " he said .
Australia ’s proposed censorship measures could be the start of a slippery slope .
Brossel acknowledges that efforts against paedophilia , pornography and terrorism are important , but points to examples where the censorship measures against these issues has gone too far .
" In some Muslim countries you are fighting against pornography , and at the end you block all websites associated with sex .
And sex is an important topic — people need access to information about it . "
One of the greatest concerns the RSF has about Australia ’s proposed new laws is that it creates a legal framework that could be abused by future governments .
Brossel says that in the hands of a more authoritarian government the proposed laws would be very dangerous .
" You can have a law , but it really depends on how you use it because you do n’t know the limits of government .
Who will be in power in Australia in 20 years ?
Why create such a framework ? "
By placing Australia as " under surveillance " , the organisation has effectively put us on par with Sri Lanka and Thailand .
The comparison is a grim one .
In Sri Lanka Government forces have recently inflicted heavy defeats upon the Tamil Tigers .
In 2007 , the BBC reported that several Tamil websites , such as TamilNet , had been blocked .
The Government denied any knowledge .
In any case , pro-Tamil websites are playing an increasingly important part in the conflict .
On 9 March , the BBC reported that 180 Tigers had been killed .
With journalists barred from certain regions , the news organisation relies on such websites to gain an opposing line — in this case , that hundreds of Government soldiers were also alleged to have died in the fight .
" The Tigers are part of the country , " said Brossel .
" You should be able to read what they have to say .
It ’s the same for illegal content .
That ’s why we decided to put Australia on this watch list . "
In Thailand , also on the " under surveillance " list , RSF says that local efforts to censor the internet only exacerbated the problem from the authorities ’ point of view .
Thailand is renowned for its eagerness to enforce royal reverence — just ask Australian writer Harry Nicolaides , imprisoned under the harsh lese majeste laws .
Concerned about a handful of sites criticising the King , the Government blocked access to them .
Brossel said the measure backfired , encouraging thousands of similar websites to flourish , which the Government now must also control .
" When you ban something it becomes more exciting , more interesting to do it , " says Brossel , " and it creates frustration for the people who want to express their views .
Ninety - nine per cent of the Thai people love the King .
Why should they be afraid of the expression of the other 1 per cent ? "
While governments are free to ignore the RSF completely , in the past the organisation has successfully lobbied on behalf of journalists and bloggers , including a Tunisian lawyer and blogger released just in time for a visit by French president Nicolas Sarkozy .
More importantly , they raise awareness of issues which governments or the United Nations can then act on .
Through publishing the Internet Enemies report , the RSF hopes to send a message to governments that there are no exceptions when it comes to free speech .
On the eve of the report ’s release , members of the RSF visited the Paris embassies of the 22 countries implicated to offer them an advance copy .
Only the Tunisian and Burmese embassies refused to receive it — which means our copy should have reached Canberra by now .

Israeli site DTown has published what appears to be legit press photos for the DSLR , with its articulating display vividly highlighted .

Human rights campaigners pressed for an independent judicial inquiry yesterday after the British security services revealed there might be up to 15 more cases in which they could be complicit in the torture of terrorism suspects .
MI5 and MI6 carried out a review of files after the launch of an unprecedented police investigation into claims by the former Guantanamo Bay detainee Binyam Mohamed that British intelligence services knew he was being tortured .
The review has uncovered 15 cases in which the intelligence services carried out interrogations of suspects in US custody .
Most of the cases relate to a period between 2002 and 2004 at American facilities in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay .

Shami Chakrabarti , of the human rights organisation Liberty , said that the Government could no longer avoid an independent judicial inquiry headed by a senior judge with powers to call ministers at the highest level .
" This development is enormously significant and full credit to the security services for attempting to come clean about this , " she said .
" An inquiry must now be launched , asking who knew what and what sanctions were given to the security services for their actions . "
If an inquiry led to criminal charges , these could include aiding and abetting torture , which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment .
White House : Obama ' absolutely ' stands behind effort to throw out warrantless wiretapping suit Eric Brewer
Published : Friday April 10 , 2009
Print This Email This President Barack Obama endorsed a Justice Department move to dismiss a case in which the National Security Agency is being sued over its warrantless wiretapping program , because he believes the case presents a risk to national security , the White House told Raw Story Thursday .
In response to a question at Thursdays press briefing , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that President Obama stands firmly behind a Justice Department brief filed last week which aims to have a civil liberties groups lawsuit dismissed .
He absolutely does ,  Gibbs said .
 Obviously , these are programs that have been debated and discussed , but the President does support that viewpoint . 
The Electronic Frontier foundation is suing the NSA for damages over a program in which the government tracked the phone calls and emails of thousands of Americans following the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks .
In their filing Friday , the Justice Department argued that the case should be dismissed because information surrounding the program was a state secret and therefore couldnt be litigated or discussed .
It also proposed that the government was protected by sovereign immunity  under federal wiretapping statutes and the Patriot Act , arguing that the United States could only face lawsuits if they willfully elected to disclose intelligence obtained by wiretapping .
In other words , the motion posited that government agencies couldnt be sued for spying because they never intentionally told anyone they were engaged in warrantless wiretaps , even if such a program violated the law .
During his presidential campaign , then - Sen .
Barack Obama criticized the Bush Administration for its use of state secrets  as a legal argument to prevent lawsuits from moving forward .
His campaign website listed state secrets under the headline  Problems . 
 The Bush administration has ignored public disclosure and has invoked a legal tool known as the state secrets  privilege more than any other previous administration to get cases thrown out of court ,  his campaign site said .
Raw Story questioned Gibbs about the apparent contradiction .
 Before he was elected , the President said that the Bush administration had abused the state secrets privilege ,  this reporter asked .
 Has he changed his mind ? 
 No ,  Gibbs replied .
 I mean , obviously , we 're dealing with some suits , and the President will -- and the Justice Department will make determinations based on protecting our national security . 
 So he still thinks that the Bush administration abused the state secrets privilege ? 
Raw Story asked .
 Yes ,  Gibbs said .
The invocation of state secrets privilege as a means of derailing suits against the government is nothing new .
The Obama Justice Department made this claim in February , in response to a suit brought by victims of extraordinary rendition .
But the Departments sovereign immunity  argument is unexpected .
A close review of the Department 's brief suggests that the Justice Department took a quote out of context in an effort to bolster their case .
The Department asserts that the United States cant be sued because its specifically excluded under the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act .
 In the Wiretap Act and ECPA , Congress expressly preserved sovereign immunity against claims for damages and equitable relief , permitting such claims against only a ' person or entity , other than the United States , ' the Department wrote .
In that section of the law , however , the phrase other than the United States  is there only because those sections specify the penalties to be used in cases in which the law is violated by someone other than the United States .
In contrast , another section of the law specifies penalties for violations of the law by the United States .
( More on the law can be read at section 2520 ( in chapter 119 ) and section 2707 . )
Some legal scholars have raised eyebrows at the claim .
Orin Kerr , professor at George Washington School of Law , believes that the Administration 's argument they can't be prosecuted unless they willfully provide wiretapping intelligence seems spurious .
" The statute itself says ' any willful violation , ' and it expressly covers all of Chapter 121 ( the Stored Communications Act ) , all of Chapter 119 ( the Wiretap Act ) , and those explicit sections of the [ Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ] , " Kerr wrote .
The preceding article was a White House report from Eric Brewer , who periodically attends White House press briefings for Raw Story .
Brewer is also a contributor at BTC News .
He was the first person to ask about the Downing Street memo at a White House briefing .

Doublesix developed Burn Zombie Burn exclusively for PSN with the use of Sony ’s recently announced “ Pub Fund . ”
The “ Pub Fund ” provides developers with funds and marketing in exchange for making their titles PSN exclusive .
It ’s a win -win situation for both Sony and game developers .
Developers are provided the opportunity to have their game exposed to as as many PS3 owners as possible , while Sony gets to deliver on its promise to make PSN a unique and compelling experience .
Here is what James Brooksby of Doublesix had to say about the “ Pub Fund ” :
“ I think there ’s a number of other ways in which the Pub Fund can help you , not least because Sony suddenly has a more vested interest in your product ’s success . ”
Since Sony is looking for a good return on its considerably sizable investment , not everyone can get on the Pub Fund .
“ Obviously there will be a level of quality expected from Sony ’s side , so not everyone will be suitable for Sony either , ” said Brooksby .
Looks like the “ Pub Fund ” could have a bright future , especially for startup developers .

Jailed ex-NU student freed in Iran , reunites with parents
Members of Reporters Without Borders demonstrate in front of Iranian embassy in Paris Sunday .
US - Iranian reporter Roxana Saberi , awaiting an appeal against her eight - year jail sentence for espionage by an Iranian court .
Sign reads : Free Roxana Saberi .
Reza Saberi and his wife Akiko , parents of US - Iranian journalist Roxana Saberi , wait before their daughter Roxana leaves jail outside of Evin prison in Tehran on Monday .
TEHRAN , Iran --
An American journalist jailed for four months in Iran was freed Monday and reunited with her parents after an appeals court suspended her eight - year prison sentence on charges of spying for the U.S.
Her parents said they would bring her home to the U.S. within days .
The release of Roxana Saberi , a 32 - year - old dual Iranian - American citizen , clears a major snag in President Barack Obama 's efforts to engage Iran in a dialogue after decades of shunning the country .
Washington had called the charges against Saberi baseless and repeatedly demanded her release .
Saberi's arrest in late January , followed by a secretive , one - day trial and a heavy prison sentence , prompted sharp U.S. criticism .
Soon after , Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and other officials appeared to back off , suggesting the sentence could be reversed .
On Monday , an appeals court reduced her jail term to a two - year suspended sentence , Iran 's judiciary spokesman , Ali Reza Jamshidi , told reporters .
Jamshidi said she was free to leave Iran .
" I 'm very happy that she is free .
Roxana is in good condition , " Saberi 's Iranian - born father Reza Saberi said after her release .
" We had expected her release but not so soon .
She will be preparing to leave ( Iran ) tomorrow or the day after tomorrow , " he told reporters at his house in Tehran .
He said Saberi was staying at a friend 's house , where her parents would join her .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed the release .
" Obviously , we continue to take issue with the charges against her and the verdicts rendered , but we are very heartened that she has been released , and wish her and her family all of the very best , " Clinton said in a statement to reporters at the State Department .
The Saberi family lives in Fargo , North Dakota and her parents have been in Iran for several weeks seeking their daughter 's freedom .
At one point , the younger Saberi held a two week hunger strike protesting her jailing , but ended it after two weeks for health reasons .
The elder Saberis were reunited with their daughter at Tehran 's Evin prison , where Roxana was held since her arrest .
Outside the prison , Saberi 's mother was smiling , while her father appeared overcome by emotion .
They were later whisked away outside a back door , out of sight of journalists .
" She was reunited with her father and mother .
They left for their house , " her lawyer Saleh Nikbakht told The Associated Press .
The judiciary spokesman , Jamshidi , said the appeals court reduced her sentence as a gesture of " Islamic mercy " because she had cooperated with authorities and had expressed regret .
During the two - year suspended sentence she will barred from practicing journalism in Iran and " if she commits a similar crime , the 2 - year jail term will be enforced against her , " he said .
Saberi , who grew up in Fargo , moved to Iran six years ago and had worked as a freelance journalist for several organizations including National Public Radio and the British Broadcasting Corp .
When she was first arrested , authorities accused Saberi of working without proper journalism credentials .
But when she was put on trial in mid-April by a closed - door security court , she was convicted on much harsher charges of spying for the United States .
She was jailed in Evin prison , where many political prisoners are held .
On Sunday , a court heard an appeal of Saberi 's conviction and sentence and her lawyers emerged saying they were able to defend her and were optimistic her sentence would be reduced .
The United States , several European countries and human rights groups had been advocating for Saberi 's release .
" They ( Iranian officials ) surely must have felt the weight of international pressure , " U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota told the AP after hearing she would be released .
... the last lady is hilarious
The first time I saw Wayne Allwine and Russi Taylor was at Disneyland in the early 90s .
They were set up outside of the Plaza Inn doing radio interviews .
Although later in life they were much skinnier , at this point they were ‘ larger ’ than the average person .
Wayne had this amazing full beard ( which was very out of place in the park ) .
It was a little chilly out and they were dressed in matching plaid outfits .
Thinking this was some form of celebrity appearance I had n’t seen before , I stuck around to see what was going on .
A few minutes later I was surprised to hear two very familiar mousey voices coming out of these two large people , it was Mickey Mouse and Minnie .
It was almost a decade before I really got to talk with Wayne and Russi and hear them speak at length .
In the meantime they had gotten married ( in 1997 to each other in Hawaii ) and continued to do amazing work both for the Disney company and other projects .
Turns out , you would be hard pressed to find a nicer couple of people then Wayne and Russi .
They were always happen to meet with fellow Disney fans and spin a tale or two of their experiences as Mickey and Minnie .
Wayne was trained as a sound effects guy and foley artist by one of the best in the business , Jimmy MacDonald .
Along the way he learned to do Mickey ’s Voice from Jimmy , who himself took over from Walt .
Wayne first did Mickey ’s voice in 1977 as a lead in voice over for the New Mickey Mouse Club and had his first feature animated voice work for 1983 ’s “ Mickey ’s Christmas Carol . ”
I recall one anecdote Wayne told at an NFFC event , he had asked Jimmy MacDonald for some advice about doing Mickey ’s voice and Jimmy said “ remember , you ’re just filling in for the boss . ”
In 2008 Wayne and Russi were named Disney Legends in a ceremony at the studios .
Recently Wayne had been combating complications related to diabetes and was said to be in need of a kidney transplant .
Sadly he passed away May 18th as a result of his illness .
Official confirmation was made on his Disney Legend bio .
I like to think that now all three voices of Mickey Mouse are reunited somewhere discussing the affect that one little character had on their lives and on the world .
Our lives are all richer for their efforts .
Everyone here at The Disney Blog wishes peace and condolences to Russi and the rest of Wayne ’s family .
( below the cut is a video of Wayne and Russi talking about their roles and Mickey and Minnie )
Penguins are probably the funniest birds , and they are so sweet at the same time : )

( CNN ) -- A Pennsylvania woman who called 911 to report that she and her daughter had been abducted was charged with making a false report and identity theft after police found the pair at a Disney resort in Florida , authorities said Wednesday .
Bonnie Sweeten , 38 , told authorities Tuesday afternoon that she and 9 - year - old Julia Rakoczy were kidnapped after two men in a Cadillac rear - ended her sport-utility vehicle in Upper Southampton , north of Philadelphia .
They were being held in the trunk of the Cadillac , she claimed .
Sweeten was arrested late Wednesday at Disney 's Grand Floridian Resort in Orlando , Florida , said Michelle Henry , district attorney for Bucks County , Pennsylvania .
Sweeten awaits extradition proceedings .

Asked what tipped off investigators , Henry said , " It was a combination of different facts that just did n't add up . "
Sweeten 's daughter is in state custody until her biological father picks her up , Henry said .
Authorities said Sweeten withdrew about $ 12,000 over a week in preparing for the trip and obtained a driver 's license from a co-worker to buy airline tickets to Florida .
The mother and daughter traveled under false names , and the trip was paid for in cash , Henry said .
Though possible motives were under investigation , Henry said , " We believe there were some domestic problems . "
Sweeten has two other children who did not go on the trip , police said .
Will under - 67 - year - olds be worse off on the dole instead of the pension ?
We crunch the numbers .
Perhaps the most unpopular policy decision in Budget ’09 was the Government ’s announcement that it will raise the aged pension eligibility age — by 2023 , it will only be available to those over 67 .
Pollsters even suggest it ’s what led to a sharp drop in Kevin Rudd ’s popularity .
The new policy would suggest that in 2023 , 65 - and 66 - year - olds will either have to keep working , or take the dole as they wait for the pension .
But what does that actually mean ?
Are people right to be peeved on behalf of their future selves ?
Admittedly , by 2023 , the whole public welfare system could have changed , but we thought we ’d crunch some numbers anyway to look at the dollar difference between the current pension and the dole .
Not including extras , the difference between dole and pension is at least $ 66 a fortnight .
Here ’s what that looks like in Graph Form :
The maximum fortnightly payment for a pensioner is $ 569.80 for a single , and $ 475.90 each for couples ( that does n’t include the government ’s Budget boost for pensioners , $ 32.49 a week for singles and $ 10.14 each for couples ) .
For a single over 60 on the “ Newstart allowance ” ( aka The Dole ) , you ’d get $ 496.40 , and a couple gets $ 409 per person .
Defending the decision to not give more money to the unemployed in Budget ’09 ( while handing out more to pensioners ) , Wayne Swan yesterday argued that “ it ’s wrong to compare unemployment benefit , which is a temporary benefit , to a long - term retirement benefit . ”

But just what should we expect of a 64 - year - old on Newstart — to be looking for work ?
Returning to study ?
Each is also eligible for some benefits , which looks like this * :
In all , a single under - 67 - year - old ( aged at least 60 ) would be somewhere between $ 73.40 and $ 93.35 worse off a fortnight ( $ 1908.40 — $ 2427.10 a year ) on the dole instead of the pension , and a partnered under - 67 - year - old would be somewhere between $ 66.90 and $ 76.87 worse off a fortnight ( $ 1739.40 – $ 1998.62 a year ) .
* We have made an assumption that people of this age do n’t have dependent children ( extras payments change slightly depending on this variable ) .
( NB .
Those on Newstart allowance are also eligible for the Education Entry Payment , Work for the Dole Supplement , and the Pensioner Education Supplement , but we felt those are n’t of great relevance to your average retiree .

Over the past few weeks , Glenn Beck and Fox News have been pushing a totally baseless smear against Yale Law School Dean Harold Koh and the Obama Administration .
Their essential claim : that through Koh , the White House was seeking to impose Sharia law in the United States .
Despite being fueled by a New York Post column written by a former Bush speechwriter , the absurd smear has mostly fizzled .
Earlier this month , former conservative attorney Ted Olson , who served both Reagan and Bush , endorsed Koh .
Now , the Yale Daily News reports Kenneth Starr has also endorsed Koh :
As conservatives continued to attack outgoing Yale Law School Dean Harold Hongju Koh ’s nomination to the Department of State last week , an endorsement came from the unlikeliest of people .
In a speech at Yale Law School on Thursday , conservative icon Kenneth Starr announced his support for Koh before an audience of about 95 students and professors , two people in attendance said .
The endorsement from Starr — whose report on the Monica Lewinsky scandal paved the way for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton LAW ’ 73 — comes as right - wing critics continue to allege that Koh will place international statutes above American law .
According to the two audience members , Starr said the Senate should defer to the president ’s nominations , especially those in the executive branch .
As long as the nominee demonstrates integrity and competence , Starr added , the president deserves to appoint his own assistants and advisers .
We 've now got two leading conservative legal minds who have rejected the loony attacks advanced by Fox News against Harold Koh .
Neither Starr nor Olson agree with Koh on every legal issue ; they are conservatives , he is not .
But at the same time , Starr and Olson recognize that Koh is perfectly qualified for the job , and absolutely capable of preserving and protecting the Constitution of the United States .
The fact that taking such an eminently reasonable position sets them apart from the bulk of the conservative movement is all you need to know to understand just how extremist and nutty the right - wing has become .
The cheeky kea , a type of parrot native to New Zealand , is under “ severe stress , ” according to conservationists .
The bird was determined to be the smartest in the world by the Institute of Cognitive Biology in Vienna , even concluding that its intelligence rivals some primates .
In the 1990 ’s , 15,000 of the birds soared above New Zealand ’s South Island , but today only an estimated 1,000 remain .
The birds are well - known across the country for their mischievous ways , thus their cheeky name .
“ It ’s the flocks of teenage boys that are generally the real trouble makers , flying around , sliding down people ’s roofs , throwing stones at windows and making a nuisance of themselves , ” said Tamsin Orr-Walker , chairwoman of the Kea Conservation Trust .
Conservationists blame a few things for their decline , but a common poison used to kill opossums , 1080 , and lead poisoning from the birds eating nail heads seem to be the top culprits .
Up until 1971 , they were the target of an extermination campaign by farmers because the birds tend to attack livestock .
“ People are really starting to appreciate their great personalities , and how smart they are and like humans , ” said Orr-Walter .
“ But we ’re still hearing of dead birds , stapled to signs or found in plastic bags by the side of the road , so there ’s still a long way to go . ”

The F.R.E.E. Australia Party says legislation for electoral changes in South Australia is aimed , in part , at derailing its attempt to stand candidates at the state election on March 20 next year .
The party says it objects to a proposed amendment that would prevent it being a registered party until six months after an application was approved .
F.R.E.E. ( Freedom Rights Education Environment ) Australia applied for registration last month .
Its spokesman Paul Kuhn says the SA Government 's bill before parliament would be another obstacle to contesting the election next year , based on the registration process .
" That part alone would rule us out at the next election if the Government plays its cards right , which is what we see very clearly happening , since the Attorney - General in fact has been on public record stating that he would seek crown law advice in stopping us getting registered , " he said .
" It just happens to coincide with our application .
The Electoral Act 's been basically in this form for a number of years .
Why change it right now ?
" So if one did have some concern one would think this was in fact targeting somebody that the Government did n't want to speak for the people . "
The F.R.E.E. Australia Party has members from a number of motorcycle clubs .
US banks that have taken billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts are still shipping thousands of jobs overseas .
Earlier this month , Bank of New York Mellon , which received $ 3 billion in TARP funds , opened its third call center in Pune , India , where it now employs 1,300 people .
Doug Brown , who wrote “ The Black Book of Outsourcing , ” said Bank of America , with $ 52.5 billion of TARP funds in the kitty , has expanded its India - based payroll to 5 percent of its 301,000 employees in 2009 , about 15,000 people .
The moves , which have outraged unions , are 100 percent legal .
Congress did n’t put into the TARP law any restrictions on shipping jobs overseas .
Citigroup , which got $ 50 billion in TARP funds plus $ 300 billion in government guarantees , plowed ahead with a program last fall to add as many as 1,000 call - center employees in the Philippines — weeks after it got its first round of taxpayer relief .
Representatives for Citigroup and Bank of New York Mellon declined to comment on their outsourcing arrangements .
A Bank of America spokesman said the firm has not announced any facility openings outside the US since last year .
Gov.
Tim Pawlenty vetoed an emotionally charged proposal late Friday to allow terminally ill patients to use marijuana for medical purposes , but signed into law a plan to disburse hundreds of millions of dollars from the Legacy Amendment passed by Minnesotans last year .
Four days after the Legislature ended with a stormy adjournment , the governor issued five vetoes Friday night on issues from election law to mortgage - foreclosure proceedings .
He also signed a bill late Thursday that allows police to pull over drivers solely because they or their passengers are not wearing seat belts .
Currently , officers must spot another traffic offense before they can stop a vehicle and ticket someone for not being strapped in .
The new law is effective June 9 , and carries a $ 25 fine .
Pawlenty , who in 2008 set an apparent single - year record for most vetoes by a Minnesota governor , indicated in a letter that he was torn by the medical marijuana legislation .
He said that while he was " sympathetic to those dealing with end - of - life illnesses , " he felt marijuana poses " serious public safety and health risks . "
Legalizing marijuana , even under limited conditions , " could serve to compound these problems , " he wrote .
Although he had also expressed some concerns with how the Legislature wanted to allocate Legacy Amendment money , Pawlenty signed the legislation Friday with just one , $ 200,000 line - item veto .
That money was for a board that was created a year ago and that supporters said needed one - time - only money , Pawlenty said .
After gaining nearly 56 percent backing in November , the Legacy Amendment showed that Minnesotans were willing to vote for higher taxes in some instances even as the state and national economies were headed downward .
Once the issue reached the Legislature , the focus was on who would get the money as scores of groups jockeyed to be heard .
The amendment increases the state sales tax by three - eighths of 1 percent for 25 years , with money going for the outdoors , water resources , parks and trails , and arts and cultural heritage .
Estimates by the Department of Revenue showed that , in the first year , the water resources and outdoors categories each stood to get $ 77.2 million , and that $ 46.2 million would be available to arts and cultural heritage projects .
In the proposal that passed the Legislature on Monday , a variety of projects were selected for Legacy funding , among them : $ 36 million to buy a permanent conservation easement on nearly 190,000 acres of forest land in northern Minnesota ; a $ 450,000 project to improve the water quality of Lake Rebecca in Hennepin County ; $ 51 million for the state pollution control agency for clean water initiatives , and $ 1 million to the Perpich Center for Arts Education in Golden Valley .
Sen. Ellen Anderson , DFL - St. Paul , who played a lead role in shaping the legislation , said that Pawlenty could have line - item vetoed more proposals within the Legacy legislation had he philosophically disagreed with them .
But doing so , she added , would simply mean more money would be available from the Legacy funds in future years , and would not help the governor solve the state 's vexing budget deficit .
Other actions
In other actions , Pawlenty vetoed an elections bill in part because he said he disagreed with a proposal to move the state 's primary from September to August .
In signing the seat belt legislation , the governor also OK'd a new provision that allows motorists to drive 10 miles over posted speed limits of 55 miles per hour or above when passing on two - lane highways .
Many had expected a veto on the medical marijuana bill , which would have allowed terminally ill patients to use marijuana to ease their pain .
One of the important players in the debate was Chris DeLaForest , a former state legislator who was an influential lobbyist this year for the proposal .
On Friday DeLaForest joined the Pawlenty administration when he was named as the new director of legislative and cabinet affairs .
DeLaForest said his selection , on a day when he was waiting to hear whether the governor would sign the bill , did not place him in an uncomfortable situation .

ATLANTA 
In a city where Coca - Cola , United Parcel Service and Home Depot are the titans of industry , there are new powerful forces on the block : Mexican drug cartels .
Their presence and ruthless tactics are largely unknown to most here .
Yet , of the 195 U.S. cities where Mexican drug - trafficking organizations are operating , federal law enforcement officials say Atlanta has emerged as the new gateway to the troubled Southwest border .
Rival drug cartels , the same violent groups warring in Mexico for control of routes to lucrative U.S. markets , have established Atlanta as the principal distribution center for the entire eastern U.S. , according to the Justice Department 's National Drug Intelligence Center .
In fiscal year 2008 , federal drug authorities seized more drug - related cash in Atlanta — about $ 70 million — than any other region in the country , Drug Enforcement Administration records show .
This year , more than $ 30 million has been intercepted in the Atlanta area — far more than the $ 19 million in Los Angeles and $ 18 million in Chicago .
Atlanta has not seen a fraction of the violence that engulfs much of northern Mexico , but law enforcement officials are increasingly concerned about the cartels ' expanding operations here .
" The same folks who are rolling heads in the streets of Ciudad Juárez " — El Paso 's Mexican neighbor — " are operating in Atlanta .
Here , they are just better behaved , " says Jack Killorin , who heads the Office of National Drug Control Policy 's federal task force in Atlanta .
The same regional features that appeal to legitimate corporate operations — access to transportation systems and proximity to major U.S. cities — have lured the cartels , Atlanta U.S. Attorney David Nahmias says .
Explosive Hispanic growth
An added attraction for the cartels , say Nahmias and Rodney Benson , the DEA 's Atlanta chief , is the explosive growth of the Hispanic community .
Nahmias calls northeast suburban Gwinnett County , about 30 miles northeast of Atlanta , the " epicenter " of the region 's drug activity .
Gwinnett 's Hispanic population surged from 8,470 in 1990 to 64,137 in 2000 , according to the Pew Hispanic Center .
Now , 17 % of the county 's 776,000 people are Hispanic .
" You see Mexican drug - trafficking operations deploying representatives to hide within these communities in plain sight , " Benson says .
" They were attempting to blend into the same communities as those who were hard - working , law - abiding people . "
The cartel representatives here range from the drivers , packagers and money counters to senior figures in the drug trade .
" We 've got direct linkages between cartel representatives who take their orders from cartel leadership in Mexico , " Benson says .
From the border , shipments of marijuana , cocaine , methamphetamine and heroin are routed over land to Atlanta for storage in a network of stash houses .
They are then moved to distribution operations in the Carolinas , Tennessee , the Mid-Atlantic , New York and New England .
Cash is generally moved over the same routes back to the Atlanta area , where balance sheets are reconciled .
The bundles of money are turned over to transportation units for bulk shipments back to Mexico , Benson says .
Concern over violence
Although the level of drug - related violence in Mexico has not surfaced in the Atlanta area , recent incidents have raised concerns among law enforcement officials .
Last July , for example , a Rhode Island man who allegedly owed $ 300,000 to Atlanta - based traffickers was found chained to a wall in the basement of a Lilburn , Ga. , home , located in western Gwinnett County .
Benson says the man had been blindfolded , gagged and beaten .
Federal investigators , who were alerted to the location , later found the man alive but severely dehydrated .
Three Mexican nationals fled the house when authorities approached .
All three were captured and a cache of weapons , including an assault rifle , was seized .
" There is no doubt in my mind that … we certainly saved his life , " Benson says .
About the same time last year , another man was kidnapped in Gwinnett County for non-payment of drug proceeds .
When traffickers went to pick up what they thought was a $ 2 million ransom , shots were exchanged between the traffickers and police who were working with the victim 's family .
One of the suspects was killed and the other arrested , Benson says .
Killorin says much of the violence has been related to similar incidents of " intra - cartel discipline " and has not spilled into the streets .
There is no mistaking the groups ' influence .
" We know they 're here , " Gwinnett County Police Cpl.
Illana Spellman says , adding that the area 's access to interstate highways is a major lure .
" Geographically , it 's set up perfectly for these kinds of activities . "

A jury has ordered Microsoft to pay $ 388 M to security software firm Uniloc , who alleged back in 2003 that Microsoft infringed on the firm 's patents for Windows Activation , one of the most horrible features ever .

One way to look at this — the hasty , vindictive , techno - populist way — is to see this whole thing as some kind of cosmic rebalancing , in which Microsoft is finally paying a huge , literal price for years of subjecting us to broken product activation runarounds in virtually every major piece of software they 've released in the last eight years .
Their 30 days is up , their trial period ( ha ! ) over , etc etc etc .
Another way : A gigantic company , who has produced loads of useful products despite succumbing to the temptations of overbearing antipiracy measures , has been forced to shovel an ungodly sum of money to a company that only produces overbearing antipiracy measures .
So , hurray . [ WSJ ]
Paris was basking in summery temperatures when the robber struck
Jewellery worth more than 6 m euros ( £5 m , $ 8 m ) has been stolen from an exclusive Paris store in broad daylight by a lone gunman , police sources say .
Dressed in a suit and fedora , the man entered Chopard on Place Vendome and reportedly made staff hand over 15 pieces of jewellery at gunpoint .
The mid-afternoon hold - up lasted two minutes , after which the robber , said to be in his 50s , calmly walked out .
Chopard jewellery is worn by stars at the Oscars and Cannes film festival .
Place Vendome is an elegant old square known for its luxury hotels , and is also home to numerous jewellery stores as well as the French justice ministry .
In December , armed robbers stole jewels worth at least 80 m euros ( $ 102 m ) from a store near the French capital 's famous Champs - Elysees avenue .
As many as four robbers , two disguised as women , raided the Harry Winston 's store and stole nearly all its valuables .
' Like any other customer '
The Vendome robber struck just before 1500 ( 1300 GMT ) on Saturday , at a time when , in good weather , the square is usually full of strollers .
The Cannes Golden Palm award is designed by Chopard " According to the first set of information we received , it was a man in his 50s , dressed in a chic costume and wearing a Borsalino [ fedora ] hat , " Olivier Lebon , a police union representative , told Reuters news agency .
" He came in like any other customer , pointed his gun at employees and asked for about 15 pieces . "
It was not immediately known if the robber had an accomplice waiting for him outside the store .
A sales assistant working in an adjacent jeweller 's store told AFP news agency she had heard and seen nothing .
" We were working , " she added .
Late on Saturday afternoon , the store at No 1 Place Vendome stood closed behind iron shutters , an AFP correspondent reports .
Only some leather handbags could be seen in the window , and no trace of a robbery could be seen from the outside .
The French capital was basking in sunshine on Saturday , with temperatures rising to a summery 23C , AFP reports .
At least some of the capital 's beau monde would have been attending the French Open , one of the tennis world 's most prestigious events , at the city 's Roland Garros stadium .
Among Chopard 's commissions is the Golden Palm awarded at the Cannes festival .
Founded in 1860 , the firm has branches in major cities across the world .

Amazon will have to do much more than enlarge its Kindle to increase the e-reader 's appeal to college students .
Announced Wednesday , the Kindle DX features a 9.7 - inch screen geared toward displaying textbooks for college students .
However , many students polled by Wired.com on Twitter listed various reasons for why the DX would fail to replace their mountains of textbooks .
Their complaints ranged from the reader 's $ 500 price tag to the DX being inconvenient for study habits .
" I 'd need five Kindles just to hold a single thought while writing essays , " said Marius Johannessen , who is studying for his master 's in information systems at University of Agder .
" Books work just fine . "
Amazon is investing high hopes in its Kindle e-book reader , with dreams of spearheading a paperless revolution .
It 's unclear just how close Amazon is to actualizing this dream , as the company has declined to release official sales numbers of the reader , which debuted late 2007 .
However , Jeff Bezos , founder and CEO of Amazon , said in February that the Kindle makes up 10 percent of the e-book market , and Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney estimated 500,000 Kindles were sold over 2008 .
So that would suggest 5 million e-readers were sold over 2008 — still a small market relative to the tech industry .
With the DX , Amazon is aiming to expand its e-book presence by targeting two major print industries — newspapers and textbooks .
The textbook industry , worth $ 9.8 billion , is going to be tough to crack , because there are so many ways thrifty students obtain their books :
University stores often offer used books , book - trading programs and sometimes even textbook rentals .
Other than specification details and the product 's price , Amazon did not disclose sales strategies for e-textbooks .
Tech strategist Michael Gartenberg said a viable e-textbook business model would be the DX 's main challenge in appealing to students .
" You can't introduce technology like this , which has got a lot of breakthrough things associated with it , and expect it to be business as usual , " Gartenberg said .
" The reason the iPod worked was not only did it introduce new technology , but it introduced a new business model for the technology as well . "
Indiana University business student Chandler Berty told Wired.com he would consider a Kindle DX if e-books cost less than used physical textbooks .
He added , however , that college students already carry laptops , which are superior to the Kindle , rendering the reader unnecessary .
" Two devices = fail , " Berty said .
Students pointed out plenty of other issues about the DX to Wired.com .
For instance , students often loan textbooks to one another , and currently that 's not practical with a Kindle , as you 'd have to loan your entire reader and library .
Also , the beauty of paper textbooks is the ability to highlight sentences , underline keywords and keep all of them open at once .
While the Kindle does have highlight and notes tools , the reader is sluggish with performance , and the keyboard is unnatural and clunky to type on .
However , it 's too soon to say how Amazon 's DX will fare on campuses , as the students polled by Wired.com had mixed opinions .
Overall , 19 students replied to our query via Twitter , five of whom said they would definitely purchase a DX , seven who said no and seven who said maybe .
" Law students are waiting for Kindle books ! " said Twitter user " SoCaliana . "
" We have so many books to carry around .
I could n't find my texts on CD or anything ! "
We can expect Amazon to cook up some interesting sales models after it completes DX pilot programs with Arizona State , Case Western Reserve , Princeton , the University of Virginia and Pace university .
Meanwhile , let 's get the brainstorming started .
What would you suggest for e-textbook sales strategies , readers ?
Here 's an idea : Selling e-textbooks by individual chapters as opposed to complete books , since most classes do n't read textbooks in entirety anyway .
That would certainly cut costs .

If Barack Obama played it safe , he never would have challenged Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination two years after leaving the Illinois legislature .
Once he won the nomination , he never would have planned a splashy tour of foreign capitals that might have typecast him as inexperienced and pretentious .
He never would have tried to fill a football stadium and become the first candidate since John F. Kennedy to accept a nomination outdoors .
In the general election , he would not have bet on states like Indiana , North Carolina and Virginia that had not voted blue for decades .
And in his first 100 days as president , he would not have sought $ 1 trillion from affluent Americans and a similar sum from businesses to finance health care , education and energy initiatives .
All that while simultaneously trying to save the auto industry , revive financial markets , end the Iraq war and redouble efforts to battle Islamic extremists in Afghanistan .
Mr. Obama ’s closest aides have long embraced that pattern , even if it still startles official Washington .
As his campaign manager , David Plouffe , put it last fall , “ We are always better off on the high wire . ”
Twitter has become a nationwide phenomenon , and like any phenom , all the Twitter talk grows quickly tiresome .
But despite what you may think , Twitter is n't just for narcissists ; it 's actually insanely useful .

So let 's assume that you already know about the navel - gazing uses of Twitter — the aspects of Twitter that most people criticize when they complain about the site .
Discounting Twitter altogether because you think it 's ridiculous that people tweet about what they had for breakfast is like claiming that email is useless because of forward chains .
It 's a mistake , and you'd be missing out on a great tool if you let that put you off Twitter completely .
Advertisement
Twitter is as useful as you make it .
In fact , Twitter does several very worthwhile things better than any other tool .
1. Instant , Real - Time Search Results
G/O Media may get a commission First Bag Free
Search is hands down the most useful feature of Twitter — whether or not you actually participate by posting anything to the site .
Consider , for example , a very trivial example : I live on the West coast , so when the American Idol results show ends every Wednesday on the East coast , it 's only 7 pm here .
I could wait two hours , then suffer through another hour of the Wednesday night , up - with - people variety show , but I really just want to know who was voted off .
News sites move too slowly , and at one point blogs had aimed to fill this instant - answers void , but guess what :
When you want to find out who was voted off Idol as soon as the results are available , Twitter is the quickest and easiest way to get this answer .
Try it sometime .
Within seconds of the announcement on Idol , Twitter fills with hundreds of posts answering this question for me .
The real - time search applies to so much more .
If the signal on my cell phone goes out , I check Twitter to see if there 's some sort of AT&T outage in my area .
If I want to know what people are saying about something important to me , I hit up Twitter .
What you get is like a centralized , searchable , real - time comment - thread for everything .
Yes , like all comment threads , you 'll find a good amount of crap .
But that does n't render the entire thread worthless .
Bookmark Twitter Search now and use it next time Google or your favorite blog search engine fails you .

2. Monitoring Something You Care About
Advertisement
Virtually every company has a Twitter account these days , which means if there 's a product you really care about , following them on Twitter is often the easiest way to stay up to date with the latest developments .
But more often than not ( in the context of Twitter , at least ) , the thing we care about most is ourselves .
We 've already shown you how to create an ego search to monitor what 's being said about you on the web , but now Twitter is another must - use tool for getting your ego fix .
Feed your ego with RSS Click to viewYou already know how well your name Googles affects how strangers and potential …

Still , even if you 're not an ego - maniac , surely there 's something that you care about that you could monitor on Twitter .
Do yourself a favor and download one of the free desktop Twitter clients to help you create persistent Twitter searches so you can keep track of whatever your want without always hitting up the main Twitter search page .
We 'd recommend checking out TweetDeck or Seesmic Desktop .
3. News Updates
Advertisement
We 've been using newsreaders to subscribe to RSS feeds for years now , but newsreaders still have n't completely caught on with the world at large .
It seems less manageable to us , but many people are perfectly happy using Twitter as a tool to keep up with the latest news — which is partly why CNN has over 1 million followers .
Likewise , re-tweeting ( the process of copying and re-posting someone else 's tweet ) spreads news like wildfire — so breaking news can reach you on Twitter a million times faster than through any of the old methods .
( For what it 's worth , here at Lifehacker we have our own Twitter feed that pushes out all of our top stories . )
4. Instant Communication with Friends
Advertisement
This is closer to what people think about when they think Twitter .
But , as I said above , Twitter communication does n't have to be a cesspool of " what I ate this morning " and " just flushed the toilet . "
You can choose whose updates you want to be notified of and how you get those updates .
Upshot :
If you and your pals use Twitter well , it can be a fantastic communication tool .
If not , of course it 's useless — but that 's not really Twitter 's fault .
Also , if privacy is a concern , you can always protect your updates .
5. Twitter as a Productivity Command Line
Advertisement
Whether you want to add a new event to Google Calendar , a new to - do to Remember the Milk , or a new note to Evernote , you can do it all via Twitter .
It took us a while to warm up to Twitter from a productivity angle , but this kind of integration made us admit that Twitter may yet boost your productivity , too .

6. Ask Questions , Get Answers
Advertisement
Provided you have enough followers ( with enough knowledge ) , Twitter is also a powerful place to ask questions and get answers .
Before I started writing this post , for example , I asked my followers what they think Twitter 's best uses are — the answers to which helped inform this entire post .
We certainly have n't exhausted all the options , but hopefully this gives you a more balanced look at how Twitter can be useful to you .
Of all of these options , Twitter search is far and away the most powerful feature , and one we 'd recommend you start using .
If you 've got something worthwhile you use Twitter for that we did n't cover , let 's hear about it in the comments .

If you know of anyone about to graduate high school , make sure they read this post
.
I wish someone had referred me to a post like this or given me the advice I am about to give when I was graduating high school .
Graduating high school will be among one of the most exciting moments of your life .
You no longer have to deal with teachers or your parents treating you like a child .
You are now eighteen , or about to be , and you are about to make the important step towards being an adult .
You may think all of your troubles are about to be over and you will be able to do whatever you want to do .
NOT SO FAST .
Being an adult is not all it is cracked up to be .
Being an adult means you have to be financially responsible .
Mom and Dad should not have to bail you out .
Financial issues are one of the biggest problems of being an adult .
You have to work and pay the rent / mortgage , utilities , insurance , car payments , student loans , etc .
You , recent graduate , can make it easier on yourself when you venture out into the real world .
You are currently in a unique position .
You probably have no debt and maybe a little bit of money saved from a part - time job , graduation gifts , parents and grandparents , etc .
Here are 3 tips to help you make a smooth transition into financial adult life :
1. Save , Save , Save .
It may seem boring or it may seem uncool but it 's important .
If you get $ 20 , save $ 5 .
It does n't matter that it is only $ 5 .
Every little bit helps and it does add up .
If you start this habit early , it will help you out tremendously in your adult years .
Plus , having a nice fat savings account means that when you are early in your career , you can still go out and have fun instead of worrying about how you are going to pay the bills .
** Tip :
**
HSBC offers an free online savings account .
No fees , no minimum balance .
2. Student Loans .
If you are going to college and have to take out student loans , ONLY use the amount you need .
If you have extra money left over after paying for the necessities and basic living expenses , save the rest ( see Tip # 1 ) .
Just because you have it , does not mean you have to spend it .
They will give you more than you need and while it may be cool at the time ,
you eventually have to pay it back
. I graduated college when I was 22 .
Here I am at 31 and I am still trying to pay off my student loans .
Note :
I know there are some student loan programs that do not require repayment but we wo n't go into that here .
I still think the " take only what you need " motto still should apply .
3. Credit Cards .
Some people say do n't get one , some people think you should get one .
I think you should get one
.
You will most likely need credit to buy a home or car once you graduate college so it is best to build your credit early .
Getting a credit card in college , with a small credit limit , will help you once you graduate college .
Having good credit out of college will make easier to rent that first apartment , get insurance or when a potential employer pulls your credit for a job .
If you choose to get a credit card , here are the rules :
Pay your balance in full ; never pay interest .
Pay your bill on time .
Never go over 40 % of your credit limit .
Do n't charge more than you can pay .
If you do n't have the money to pay the bill in full by the time the bill comes , do n't charge it .
Go back and see tip # 1 .
** Tip :
offers a credit card especially for students .
**
Note :
Using a credit card requires responsibility .
If you do n't think you will be responsible with a credit card , do n't apply for one .
It does n't matter if they give you a " free " t- shirt .
The free t- shirt could cause you years of financial stress .
You may think I am just another adult spouting off advice but trust me , I know what I 'm talking about .
I made ALL of the above mistakes .
I wish someone had told me about the three tips above when I started college .
I am still working on getting rid of the mistakes I made in my college years almost ten years later .
I regret all of the fun things I did n't get to to in my early twenties because I could n't afford it .
I screwed up in college financially and I had bills to pay .
Every paycheck went towards bills and there were a lot of nights I had to stay home and watch television while my friends went out and had fun .
The visual system has limited capacity and cannot process everything that falls onto the retina .
Instead , the brain relies on attention to bring salient details into focus and filter out background clutter .
Two recent studies by researchers at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies , one study employing computational modeling techniques and the other experimental techniques , have helped to unravel the mechanisms underlying attention .
" In everyday viewing a visual detail that is the target of our attention is generally surrounded by a lot of stimuli that are momentarily irrelevant to behavior , " says John H. Reynolds , Ph.D. , an associate professor in the Systems Neurobiology Laboratory at the Salk Institute , who led the study published in the March 26 , 2009 issue of the journal Neuron .
" Attention dynamically routes relevant information to decision - making areas in the brain and suppresses the surrounding clutter . "
But just how the brain achieves this feat has been the topic of much debate .
In an earlier issue of Neuron , Reynolds and David J. Heeger , Ph.D. , a professor in the Department of Psychology and the Center for Neural Science at NYU , put forth a new theoretical model of attention .
Their model suggests that attention co-opts the same neural circuitry used by the visual system to adjust its sensitivity , which allows us to perceive the world irrespective of huge changes in contrast and illumination over the day .
" The central role of attention in perception has been known since the dawn of experimental psychology .
An enormous amount of research has been done on the subject , but ostensibly conflicting experimental data have bewildered researchers for years , " says Reynolds .
" Our model brought what seemed like a hodgepodge of observations together within a simple framework , and our latest study tested and confirmed predictions of the theory . "
The strength of visual input fluctuates over orders of magnitude .
The visual system reacts automatically to these changes by adjusting its sensitivity , becoming more sensitive in response to faint inputs , and reducing sensitivity to strong inputs .
For example , when we walk into a darkened lecture hall on a sunny day at first we see little , but over time our visual system adapts , increasing its sensitivity to match the environment .
A subtler version of this is the so - called contrast gain control .
" Spend a few minutes staring at an Ansel Adams photograph .
You will find that your visual system will adapt to low - contrast parts of the image , revealing subtleties that were invisible at first , " explains Reynolds .
advertisement
Heeger proposed a simple but powerful model of the cortical circuitry that helps mediate this form of automatic gain control .
" We believe that this circuitry has been co-opted through evolution , enabling the brain to exploit the same circuitry to adjust its sensitivity endogenously , " says Reynolds .
" It does n't just adjust sensitivity in response to changes in input strength , it also enables the brain to emphasize task - relevant information and suppress neuronal signals driven by task - irrelevant clutter . "
Neurons in the visual cortex view the world through their " receptive fields , " the small portion of the visual field individual neurons actually " see " or respond to .
Whenever a stimulus falls within the receptive field , the cell produces a volley of electrical spikes , known as " action potentials " that convey information about the stimulus in the receptive field .
But the strength and fidelity of these signals also depends on other factors .
Scientists generally agree that neurons typically respond more strongly when attention is directed to the stimulus in their receptive fields .
In addition , the response of individual neurons can be strongly influenced by what 's happening within the immediate surroundings of the receptive field , a phenomenon known as contextual modulation .
" The surround has the ability to suppress the neuron 's response , " explains first author Kristy Sundberg , Ph.D. , a former graduate student in Reynolds ' lab and now a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University .
" It keeps us from responding all the time if there 's something that 's big and uniform and not particularly interesting or useful .
This raised the possibility that the receptive field surround might provide a way to suppress the responses of task - irrelevant distracters . "
To get to the bottom of this , Sundberg set up a series of experiments in which she placed one stimulus in the receptive field and another in the surround .
As predicted by Reynolds ' and Heeger 's theory , she found that directing attention to the center stimulus immunized the neuron from the suppressive effects of the stimulus in the surround .
When she instead directed attention to a stimulus in the surround , it suppressed the neuron 's response to the task - irrelevant stimulus in the center .
" The attentional system exploits the center - surround organization of the receptive field to keep neurons that transmit task - relevant information from being suppressed by distracters in the environment , while at the same time suppressing the responses of neurons that respond to irrelevant clutter , " says Sundberg .
" The brain uses the receptive field surround actively to separate the wheat from the chaff . "
Jude F. Mitchell , Ph.D. , a postdoctoral researcher in Reynolds ' lab also contributed to the study .

Construction will continue in east Jerusalem and West Bank , official says , despite Hillary Clinton 's call to stop
Israel is to continue construction inside existing Jewish settlements , an official said today , despite a clear call from the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , for a halt to all settlement growth .
Deepening differences are emerging between Israel 's new government , led by the prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , and the US administration , which has adopted a tougher position over Israel 's actions towards the Palestinians than in the past .
Concern over settlements , which are home to nearly 500,000 Israelis in east Jerusalem and the West Bank , will dominate a meeting in Washington today between Barack Obama and Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president .
Israel has said it will not build new settlements and is committed to removing settlement outposts that are not authorised by the government .
However , Mark Regev , a spokesman for Netanyahu , said today that " normal life " would be allowed to continue inside existing settlements , which included new construction such as enlarging homes and building schools to accommodate growing families .
Israel believed that all sides should " in parallel move forward in implementing their obligations " under the peace process , Regev said .
" As to existing settlements , their fate will be determined in final status talks between Israelis and Palestinians and in the interim we believe that normal life should continue in these communities .
" Activity inside existing communities does not pre-judge any final status arrangements between Israel and the Palestinians . "
His words mirror comments from Netanyahu this week in an Israeli cabinet meeting , when he said it " would n't be fair to ban construction to meet the needs of natural growth " .
Natural growth is taken to mean constructing new homes and other buildings in settlements to meet the demands of growing families .
However , the 2003 US road map explicitly calls for a freeze on all settlement activity , including natural growth .
Settlements on occupied land are illegal under international law .
Palestinian negotiators have said talks with Israel cannot restart without an end to settlement expansion .
Yesterday , Clinton issued an unusually blunt call for a halt to settlement growth .
She said Obama " wants to see a stop to settlements – not some settlements , not outposts , not natural growth exceptions .
We think it is in the best interests of the effort that we are engaged in that settlement expansion cease . "
She said the Americans " intend to press that point " .
US and Israeli officials have been meeting for talks , including in London this week .
Netanyahu has consistently argued that Iran and its nuclear programme represents the most pressing challenge for Israel and should take priority over negotiations with the Palestinians .
He has refused even to talk of a two - state solution to the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
However , with Obama due to make a key speech to the Muslim world from Cairo next week , Washington appears to be stepping up pressure on Israel to make concessions towards the Palestinians to allow a peace process to restart .
Just in case you happen to forget your period , this underwear will keep you posted .
This is how it works : at the front waistband of this feminine undergarment , a clip holding band is equipped by sewing horizontal and vertical threads in a grid form , and below the clip holding band , a date portion is located in which numerals and heart shapes are printed in two lines .
Both edges of the clip holding band are designed to be sewn as to extend from the date portion .
At first , a gold heart - shaped clip is hooked on the right end portion and a silver heart - shaped clip is hooked on the left end of the clip holding band with a vertical pin and a horizontal pin .
Moving the clip onto the clip holding band above the date of the date portion below and allowing the vertical pin tip end to protrude from the clip holding band enables the clip to indicate the date below .
This enables the recording of the date when the period began and allows for the computation of the time until the next period begins .

Today ’s New York Times online features a round table discussion on the subject of marijuana law reform .
Two years ago we ran a quorum debating the pros and cons of decriminalizing marijuana .
Since then , a largely theoretical debate has moved quite substantially toward the realm of reality , with a growing number of states and municipalities having changed their laws .
… So we asked a group of people — Paul Armentano , Mike Braun , Joel W. Hay , Jeffrey Miron , and Robert Platshorn — to think about a national decriminalization of marijuana … and answer the following :
What would be some of the most powerful economic , social , and criminal - justice effects ?
Here are their answers .

BIRMINGHAM , Alabama ( Reuters ) - When Barack Obama is sworn in next week as the first black U.S. president , 97 - year - old Alabama civil rights veteran Amelia Boynton Robinson will see a miracle in the milestone .
Amelia Boynton Robinson , 97 , an Alabama activist , speaks to visitors at a National Parks Service facility as Bernard LaFayett ( R ) looks on in Tuskegee , Alabama , January 9 , 2009 .
Robinson , who was jailed , beaten and often risked her life to push for voting rights in the racially segregated South said she is still fighting for equal treatment of all .

“ I think it ’s an act of God , ” said Robinson , who was jailed and beaten decades ago in the racially segregated U.S. South .
For Robinson , whose mother was born just a few years after the end of slavery , the fight for equality did not end with the civil rights laws passed in the 1960s and it wo n’t end with Obama ’s historic inauguration on January 20 .
“ To this day , I am still on the battlefield , ” Robinson told 35 educators , students and activists last week in Tuskegee , Alabama , during a four - day tour of civil rights historic sites in Selma , Montgomery and Birmingham , Alabama .
Obama ’s election has rekindled interest in the U.S. civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s amid continuing racial tensions and wide disparities in income , education and health care between whites and minority groups .
In Alabama , visitor numbers are up dramatically at a center that marks the route of a five - day , 47 - mile march led by King from Selma to Montgomery in 1965 by 25,000 people demanding equal rights for black Americans , said Tina Smiley of the U.S. National Park Service .
Doug McMillon , chief executive of the Sam ’s Club unit of Wal - Mart Stores Inc , has brought four large groups of executives to the center in recent months , and has commissioned a film so all his workers can share the experience , she said .
Activists Charles Alphin and Bernard Lafayette organize civil rights tours such as the one Robinson addressed .
Robinson , who once hosted Martin Luther King Jr. in her home , will travel to England next month to teach the principles of non-violence used in the sit-ins , mass arrests and protests that characterized the movement .

In the 1930s , she started a voter registration drive in Selma , Alabama , where African - Americans were hindered from voting until the mid-1960s by capricious literacy tests , poll taxes and the need to produce two white “ sponsors . ”
Robinson catapulted the issue into the limelight in 1965 when she asked King for help .
Soon afterward , King led the historic voting rights marches in Alabama .
On what came to be known as “ Bloody Sunday , ” white authorities beat and tear - gassed protesters and television images flashed around the world .
A LONG ROAD
“ It ’s the screaming I remember most , ” says Joanne Bland , who was 11 years old when she was knocked unconscious on Bloody Sunday .
Her 14 - year - old sister needed 26 stitches on her head ; but both girls marched again the next Tuesday .
The violence sparked outrage and solidarity marches around the country and helped prod Congress into passing the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , a law that finally secured the right of African - Americans to vote .
Bland ran Selma ’s voting rights museum and now leads tours of the 20,000 - plus town that is grappling with a high crime rate , drug problems , severe poverty and rising unemployment .
Bland says the Selma movement paved the way for the election of Obama , who visited the city in 2007 .
“ What we did here in Selma is why he was able to be elected , ” she said .
Obama often credits the black Americans whose struggle made his personal road to the White House possible .
“ It ’s important for people to study and learn about this period of history so that we can continue to build on King ’s work and his philosophy , ” added Roger Vredeveld , 47 , who teaches U.S. and black history in Chattanooga , Tennessee , and went on the tour .
Some analysts have described Obama ’s victory as ushering in a “ post - racial ” era , but civil rights activists say there is still much to be done .
They point to such crises as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , which revealed deep racial divides , and recurrent cases of police brutality .
Another teacher on the tour , Arthur Romano , cited riots in Oakland , California , after the January 1 shooting of an unarmed 22 - year - old black man by a white transit police officer , and said King ’s non-violent approach would be far more productive .
Oscar Grant ’s death , he said , “ serves as a reminder of how far there is to go , and the need for serious , strategic and long - term community involvement on these issues . ”
Believe it or not , the 2009 Hennessey GTR puts the phenomenal Nissan GT - R SpecV back in the kiddie pool .
That ’s what Hennessey Performance does .
They create street legal vehicles that annihilate the underlying base models .
The new 2009 Hennessey GTR700 throws out 715 hp and 662 lb - ft of torque .
Modifications take the form of expanded turbos with bigger compressor wheels , new ECU mapping , stainless steel exhaust system , cold air intake , high - flow fuel injectors as well as upgrades to the clutch and a transmission cooler among others .
All this customization to the Nissan GT - R results in a 0 to 60 mph sprint of only 2.9 seconds .
The Hennessey GTR700 even performs 0 to 100 mph in just 6.5 seconds and hits the 150 mph mark at 14.5 seconds .
It ’ll rip off a quarter - mile in 10.8 seconds at 130 mph .
This monster actually cuts the time needed to reach 186 mph in half compared to the base GT - R .
Just check out the video below :

Two promi­nent eco­nom­ics text­book writ­ers have recent­ly writ­ten that the Glob­al Finan­cial Cri­sis ( GFC ) shows that the world needs more eco­nom­ics rather than less .
Writ­ing in the New York Times , Gre­go­ry Mankiw could see some need to mod­i­fy eco­nom­ics cours­es a bit in response to the GFC , but over­all he felt that :
“ Despite the enor­mi­ty of recent events , the prin­ci­ples of eco­nom­ics are large­ly unchanged .
Stu­dents still need to learn about the gains from trade , sup­ply and demand , the effi­cien­cy prop­er­ties of mar­ket out­comes , and so on .
These top­ics will remain the bread - and - but­ter of intro­duc­to­ry cours­es . ”
( That Fresh­man Course Wo n’t Be Quite the Same , New York Times May 23 2009 )
Writ­ing on a blog The East Asia Forum , authors Doug McTag­gart , Christo­pher Find­lay and Michael Parkin wrote that :
“ The cri­sis has also brought calls for the heads of econ­o­mists for fail­ing to antic­i­pate and avoid it .
That idea , too , is wrong : much eco­nom­ic research point­ed to the emerg­ing prob­lem .
More eco­nom­ic research ( and teach­ing ) , not less , is the best hope of both emerg­ing from the cur­rent cri­sis and of avoid­ing future ones . ”
( The state of eco­nom­ics , East Asia Forum , May 21 2009 )
What a load of bol­locks .
The “ prin­ci­ples of eco­nom­ics ” that Mankiw cham­pi­ons , and the “ More eco­nom­ic research ( and teach­ing ) ” that McTag­gart et al are call­ing for , are the major rea­son why econ­o­mists in gen­er­al were obliv­i­ous to this cri­sis until well after it had bro­ken out .
If they meant “ Prin­ci­ples of Hyman Min­sky ’s Finan­cial Insta­bil­i­ty Hypoth­e­sis ” , or “ More Post Key­ne­sian and Evo­lu­tion­ary eco­nom­ic research ” , there might be some valid­i­ty to their claims .
But what they real­ly mean is “ prin­ci­ples of neo­clas­si­cal eco­nom­ics ” and “ More neo­clas­si­cal eco­nom­ic research ( and teaching ) ” –precisely the stuff that led to this cri­sis in the first place .
Neo­clas­si­cal eco­nom­ic the­o­ry sup­port­ed the dereg­u­la­tion of the finan­cial sys­tem that helped set this cri­sis in train .
See for exam­ple this New York Times report on the abo­li­tion of the Glass - Stea­gall Act in 1999 “ CONGRESS PASSES WIDE - RANGING BILL EASING BANK LAWS ” ( New York Times Novem­ber 5th 1999 ) .
The reporter Stephem Laba­ton not­ed that :
The oppo­nents of the mea­sure gloomi­ly pre­dict­ed that by unshack­ling banks and enabling them to move more freely into new kinds of finan­cial activ­i­ties , the new law could lead to an eco­nom­ic cri­sis down the road when the mar­ket­place is no longer grow­ing briskly …
Then he observed that
Sup­port­ers of the leg­is­la­tion reject­ed those argu­ments .
They respond­ed that his­to­ri­ans and econ­o­mists have con­clud­ed that the Glass - Stea­gall Act was not the cor­rect response to the bank­ing cri­sis because it was the fail­ure of the Fed­er­al Reserve in car­ry­ing out mon­e­tary pol­i­cy , not spec­u­la­tion in the stock mar­ket , that caused the col­lapse of 11,000 banks .
If any­thing , the sup­port­ers said , the new law will give finan­cial com­pa­nies the abil­i­ty to diver­si­fy and there­fore reduce their risks .
The new law , they said , will also give reg­u­la­tors new tools to super­vise shaky insti­tu­tions .
This is a very apt descrip­tion of the role of neo­clas­si­cal econ­o­mists over the last 40 years : every step of the way , they have argued for dereg­u­la­tion of the finan­cial sys­tem .
Now we have McTag­gart and col­leagues mak­ing the self - serv­ing claim that :
The cur­rent cri­sis is a fail­ure of reg­u­la­tion that calls for not more reg­u­la­tion , but the right reg­u­la­tion .
So the same eco­nom­ic the­o­ry that sup­port­ed the abo­li­tion of Glass - Stea­gall , amongst many oth­er Depres­sion - inspired con­trols , is sud­den­ly going to be able to do a volte - face and tell us what “ the right reg­u­la­tion ” might be ?
Garbage .
What is real­ly need­ed is a thor­ough rev­o­lu­tion in eco­nom­ic thought .
First and fore­most this has to be based on empir­i­cal real­i­ty , and from this per­spec­tive almost every­thing that cur­rent text­books treat as gospel truth will end up in the dust­bin .
Coin­ci­den­tal­ly , many non-neo­clas­si­cal econ­o­mists whose writ­ings have been put into the dust­bin by today ’s eco­nom­ics ortho­doxy will be back on the shelves once more .
Min­sky , Schum­peter , Keynes , Veblen and Marx do n’t rate a men­tion in in most cur­rent eco­nom­ic text­books ; they had bet­ter fea­ture in future texts , or by 2060 or so we ’ll be back here again .
Though I ’m clear­ly annoyed at Manki­w ’s and McTag­gart ’s dri­v­el , I ’m not sur­prised by it–in fact I pre­dict­ed it ( I doubt that they can point to any­thing they wrote pri­or to the GFC that pre­dict­ed it ! ) .
I said the fol­low­ing in an arti­cle “ Mad , bad , and dan­ger­ous to know ” pub­lished on March 12 2009 in issue 49 of the Real World Eco­nom­ics Review :
Despite the sever­i­ty of the cri­sis in the real world , aca­d­e­m­ic neo­clas­si­cal econ­o­mists will con­tin­ue to teach from the same text­books in 2009 and 2010 that they used in 2008 and ear­li­er …
they will inter­pret the cri­sis as due to poor reg­u­la­tion , …
They will seri­ous­ly believe that the cri­sis calls not for the abo­li­tion of neo­clas­si­cal eco­nom­ics , but for its teach­ings to be more wide­ly known .
The very thought that this finan­cial cri­sis should require any change in what they do , let alone neces­si­tate the rejec­tion of neo­clas­si­cal the­o­ry com­plete­ly , will strike them as incred­i­ble .
Some­times , I would like to be wrong …
Final­ly , what les­son did neo­clas­si­cal econ­o­mists take from the Great Depres­sion ?
That the Fed­er­al Reserve caused it via poor eco­nom­ic pol­i­cy .
Who do cur­rent neo­clas­si­cal econ­o­mists blame for this cri­sis ?
The Fed­er­al Reserve of course , for poor eco­nom­ic pol­i­cy :
By 2007 , fuelled by the Fed­er­al Reserve ’s egre­gious pol­i­cy errors , mar­kets were mov­ing into unsus­tain­able bub­ble ter­ri­to­ry .
The Fed by this time had real­ized the prob­lem was get­ting out of hand and had moved inter­est rates up sharply — too sharply — and burst the house price bub­ble .
( McTag­gart et al ) .
But who staffs the Fed­er­al Reserve ?
Neo­clas­si­cal econ­o­mists of course …
Please , let ’s not fall for this non­sense a sec­ond time .
Keynes tried to free us from neo­clas­si­cal eco­nom­ic think­ing back in the 1930s , only to have neo­clas­si­cal econ­o­mists like John Hicks and Paul Samuel­son evis­cer­ate Key­nes ’s thought and re-estab­lish a revi­talised neo­clas­si­cal eco­nom­ics after the Depres­sion was over .
This time , let ’s do it right and get rid of neo­clas­si­cal eco­nom­ics once and for all .
The general consensus among gaming media and fans alike is that E3 2009 could be Sony ’s biggest showing in the history of the PlayStation brand .
Rumors , leaks , and a massive pre-E3 media event have helped fuel the hype for what is set to be quite an amazing show .
PlayStation LifeStyle has the great pleasure of seeing this first hand , and will work tirelessly to bring you all possible coverage of the PlayStation brand , no matter how big or small the news .
Before E3 begins , and Sony takes the gaming world by storm , we are bringing you a trip down memory lane by giving you a recap of Sony ’s biggest E3 showings of the past .
This way , you can see exactly what Sony ’s showing at E3 2009 is up against , and you can be the judge of whether or not this will be Sony ’s best year ever !
E3 1995
SEGA , after having two poorly - received hardware offerings with the SEGA CD and 32X , needed to impress the crowd at the very first E3 .
SEGA had previously announced the SEGA Saturn before the show which had a scheduled release date of September 2 , 1995 .
However at the SEGA Keynote , it was announced that the SEGA Saturn was secretly shipped to retailers the night before , and was now on sale for $ 399 .
A move that left retailers unhappy , and gamers without many launch titles to choose from .
This , shortly after , was completely overshadowed by Sony .
Olaf Olafsson ( who named this guy ? ) took the stage at Sony ’s keynote and announced the release date for the Sony PlayStation .
The real shocker , and what could have been the death blow to Sega before the PlayStation was even released , was the announcement that it would release for the price of $ 299 .
Also shown during E3 were what soon became PlayStation franchise mainstays : Ridge Racer , Tekken , and WipEout .
This marked the beginning of Sony ’s reign over the gaming industry .
E3 2000
History repeated itself a bit with E3 2000 .
The Sega Dreamcast had been released in North America the prior year and was off to a rough start .
Its CD - based software medium constrained the visions of many developers .
While the PS2 had already been announced in Japan previously , there had n’t been a release date set for the American market .
Sony took the opportunity to do so at E3 2000 , and set the big day for October 26 of the same year .
Although this time around , Sony ’s console was priced higher than SEGA ’s by $ 100 ; it offered DVD playback , as well as DVD - ROM as the software medium , allowing for larger games .
The inclusion of the DVD player may have been Sony ’s most genius idea yet .
It helped introduce the PS2 into the homes of anyone interested in DVD players , as it offered a decent quality DVD player , along with PlayStation brand gaming for around the price of your average DVD player at the time .
E3 2000 was n’t all about hardware , in fact it was the software that really stole the show .
One title in particular had fans and media floored .
That title was Metal Gear Solid 2 , the follow up to the fan favorite Metal Gear Solid on the original PlayStation ( now known as the PSOne ) .
The sheer detail of MGS2 is what impressed the crowd , and it really showed of what the PS2 was capable of .
While MGS2 did n’t make the PS2’s launch , Sony had plenty of other titles to show , 51 of which were scheduled to be available by Christmas of 2000 .
E3 2003
Kaz Harai takes the stage at Sony ’s Keynote during E3 ’03 , and had plenty of major announcements to discuss .
He started off with the announcement of a revised PS2 in the works .
The revision boasted progressive DVD playback , a built in IR port for use with a remote , reduced fan noise , and would be bundled with a Network Adapter .
Sony continued to strut its planned online strategy , which was a direct response to the undeniable success of Xbox Live .
Games that were shown included Final Fantasy XI , SOCOM II , and pledged support from EA Sports ’ future lineup .
Of course Sony was n’t done there .
Dr. Richard Marx then took the stage and demonstrated the PS EyeToy .
The EyeToy was a USB web cam that allowed for interaction with images on screen by moving your body and appendages ; no controller was needed .
Lastly , Sony announced its plans to take on Nintendo and its stronghold over the handheld gaming market with the PlayStation Portable .
No Hardware or Software was shown , or demoed , but the announcement was big enough to shock gamers .
E3 2005
The PlayStation 2 was in its prime ; a large amount of AAA games were shown .
The current king of consoles was easily overshadowed by the announcement of its successor , the PlayStation 3 .
The PlayStation 3 was debuted , boasting some of the most impressive specs ever seen by console gamers .
Specs at the time included the cell processor , 1080 p High Definition gaming , 3 Ethernet ports , 2 HDMI outputs , 6 USB ports ( 4 front , 2 rear ) , Wifi , Bluetooth 2.0 , and a built - in Blu - Ray drive .
Even with the massive listed specs , the thing that generated the most buzz was the new controller .
The new controller was n’t yet another iteration of the Dualshock , it was a boomerang - shaped controller .
Jokes galore hit the internet about how if you were angry after losing in a game , you could n’t throw the controller , as it might come back and hit you .
There was no actual software , however there was plenty of technical demos ready to go that were running on PCs that had specs similar to that of what the PlayStation 3 would have .
PlayStation staples such as Devil may Cry , and Tekken were shown ( ironically , both went multiplatform ) .
The biggest splash came from the confirmation of Metal Gear Solid 4 being in the works , and the showing of a technical demo of Final Fantasy VII .
This immediately sparked excitement from the crowd , as fans thought a FFVII remake was in the works .
However , that was n’t true , as Square quickly make it clear that it was a tech demo only .
E3 2006
Not all E3 announcements are good announcements , despite how large they may be .
In 2006 , Sony announced the price of the now “ gimped ” ( originally the PS3 was to have 2 HDMI outputs , 6 USB ports , 3 ethernet ports , and more ) PS3 , which was set to $ 599 .
Although there was a less - expensive 20 GB model announced , which was even more gimped with its removal of wifi , card readers , and a lower - capacity internal hard drive , the price shocked the world .
Both Sony ’s previous consoles had been released for $ 299 , and history had shown that expensive consoles never fared well .
There was the argument that you get what you pay for , and Sony ’s newest console was surely a beast .
While that was indeed true , the massive price tag scared away many long time PlayStation fans over to the other HD console on the market , the Xbox 360 .
The price tag was the target of media outlets , which soon started questioning Sony ’s motives about the console , claiming it was more about Blu - Ray penetration than making another successful gaming console .
To this day , the PlayStation 3 is the most expensive console .
Anyone can see that because of this , the sales have been less than Sony ( perhaps foolishly ) hoped for in comparison to the ridiculously fast - selling PlayStation 2 .
E3 2009
You have seen our predictions .
You have heard the rumors of a redesigned PSP , and a slimmed down PS3 .
You know the massive lineup of games that are scheduled to be at E3 .
You know that Sony always has more games that are currently unannounced , and that E3 is prime time to unleash them .
Because of those facts , it does seem to be that 2009 will be Sony ’s best showing ever .
Stay tuned to PlayStation LifeStyle for all of your E3 coverage !
Orrin Hatch is undoubtedly merely responding to his constituents ’ demands with this nonsense .
The Utah Utes finished 13 - 0 last season , with notable wins over Michigan , Oregon State , ranked teams TCU and BYU , and a BCS bowl defeat of Alabama .
It ’s a pretty impressive resume .
They were the only undefeated team in Div I - A ( FBS ) .
But they ’re not the Champion .
Florida , who finished 13 - 1 ( with their sole loss being to Mississippi ) is the Champion .
I understand the complaint .
If a mid-major team like Utah can have the season they ’ve had , beat the teams they beat , and still fall behind a one - loss school from a “ major ” conference , then no mid-major will ever be crowned Champion .
Granted , Florida may have been the best team in college football ( as the Patriots were the best team in the NFL in ’ 07 - 8 despite not winning Super Bowl XLII ) , but I do n’t think the system for determining a Champion is very fair .
It ’s not a system I like .
It ’s also not a system that Orrin Hatch likes , but he ’s sticking the full power of the federal government into the debate :
Sen . Orrin Hatch , R - Utah , may be a skinny guy with a high voice .
But he ’s angrily setting out to tackle the biggest powers in college football , vowing to pound them until they reform the Bowl Championship Series .
He called them out Wednesday , as he and Sen. Herb Kohl , D - Wisc. — respectively the top Republican and Democrat on a Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust — released a list of topics that panel plans to consider this year .
A bit buried on Page 4 of an eight - page list , amid somewhat sleep - inducing reading on oil and railroad antitrust , is a nifty paragraph about the BCS .
“ The BCS system leaves nearly half of all the teams in college football at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to qualifying for the millions of dollars paid out every year , ” their joint statement says .
Then it drops its first unexpected bomb : “ The subcommittee will hold hearings to investigate these issues . ”
That is followed by a second : “ Sen . Hatch will introduce legislation to rectify this situation . ”
I realize that Congress believes it has purview over everything that occurs within our borders , but if their “ fixes ” for other problems are anywhere near as effective as this one will be , I ’m not sure anyone will want to watch college football afterwards .
I really wish they ’d waste their time ruining something else , because I quite enjoy spending fall Saturdays watching one of the few worthwhile sports left .
Early this month , Carl Joseph Walker - Hoover , an 11 - year - old boy from Springfield , Mass. , hanged himself after months of incessantly being hounded by his classmates for being “ gay . ”
( He was not ; but did , apparently , like to do well in school . )
In March , 2007 , 17 - year - old Eric Mohat shot himself in the head , after a long - term tormentor told him in class , “ Why do n’t you go home and shoot yourself ; no one will miss you . ”
Eric liked theater , played the piano and wore bright clothing , a lawyer for his family told ABC news , and so had long been subject to taunts of “ gay , ” “ fag , ” “ queer ” and “ homo . ”
Teachers and school administrators , the Mohats ’ lawsuit now asserts , did nothing .
We should do something to get this insanity under control .
I ’m not just talking about combating bullying , which has been a national obsession ever since Columbine , and yet seems to continue unabated .
I ’m only partly talking about homophobia , which , though virulent , cruel and occasionally fatal among teenagers , is not the whole story behind the fact that words like “ fag ” and “ gay ” are now among the most potent and feared weapons in the school bully ’s arsenal .
Being called a “ fag , ” you see , actually has almost nothing to do with being gay .
It ’s really about showing any perceived weakness or femininity – by being emotional , seeming incompetent , caring too much about clothing , liking to dance or even having an interest in literature .
It ’s similar to what being viewed as a “ nerd ” is , Bennington College psychology professor David Anderegg notes in his 2007 book , “ Nerds : Who They Are and Why We Need More of Them ” : “ ‘ queer ’ in the sense of being ‘ odd ’ or ‘ unusual , ’ ” but also , for middle schoolers in particular , doing “ anything that was too much like what a goody - goody would do . ”
It ’s what being called a “ girl ” used to be , a generation or two ago .
“ To call someone gay or fag is like the lowest thing you can call someone .
Because that ’s like saying that you ’re nothing , ” is how one teenage boy put it to C.J. Pascoe , a sociologist at Colorado College , in an interview for her 2007 book , “ Dude , You ’re a Fag : Masculinity and Sexuality in High School . ”
The message to the most vulnerable , to the victims of today ’s poisonous boy culture , is being heard loud and clear : to be something other than the narrowest , stupidest sort of guy ’s guy , is to be unworthy of even being alive .
It ’s weird , is n’t it , that in an age in which the definition of acceptable girlhood has expanded , so that desirable femininity now encompasses school success and athleticism , the bounds of boyhood have remained so tightly constrained ?
And so staunchly defended : Boys avail themselves most frequently of epithets like “ fag ” to “ police ” one another ’s behavior and bring it back to being sufficiently masculine when someone steps out of line , Barbara J. Risman , a sociologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago , found while conducting extensive interviews in a southeastern urban middle school in 2003 and 2004 .
“ Boys were showing each other they were tough .
They were afraid to do anything that might be called girlie , ” she told me this week .
“ It was just like what I would have found if I had done this research 50 years ago .
They were frozen in time . ”
Pascoe spent 18 months embedded in a Northern California working - class high school , in a community where factory jobs had gone south after the signing of Nafta , and where men who ’d once enjoyed solid union salaries were now cobbling together lesser - paid employment at big - box stores .
“ These kids experience a loss of masculine privilege on a day - to - day level , ” she said .
“ While they did n’t necessarily ever experience the concrete privilege their fathers and grandfathers experienced , they have the sense that to be a man means something and is incredibly important .
These boys do n’t know how to be that something .
Their pathway to masculinity is unclear .
To not be a man is to not be fully human and that ’s terrifying . ”
That makes sense .
But the strange thing is , this is n’t just about insecure boys .
There ’s a degree to which girls , despite all their advances , appear to be stuck – voluntarily – in a time warp , too , or at least to be walking a very fine line between progress and utter regression .
Spending unprecedented amounts of time and money on their hair , their skin and their bodies , at earlier and earlier ages .
Essentially accepting the highly sexualized identity imposed on them , long before middle school , by advertisers and pop culture .
In high school , they have second - class sexual status , Pascoe found , and by jumping through hoops to be sexually available enough to be cool ( and “ empowered ” ) yet not so free as to be labeled a slut , they appear to be complicit in maintaining it .
Why – given the full array of choices our culture ostensibly now allows them – are boys and girls clinging to such lowest - common - denominator ways of being ?
The strain of being a teenager , and in particular , a preteen , no doubt accounts for much of it ; people tend to be at their worst when they ’re feeling most insecure .
But there ’s more to it than that , I think .
Malina Saval , who spent two years observing and interviewing teenage boys and their parents for her new book “ The Secret Lives of Boys , ” found that parents played a key role in reinforcing the basest sort of gender stereotypes , at least where boys were concerned .
“ There were a few parents who were sort of alarmist about whether or not their children were going to be gay because of their music choices , the clothes they wore , ” she said .
Generally , she said , “ there was a kind of low - level paranoia if these high - school - age boys were n’t yet seriously involved with a girl . ”
It seems it all comes down , as do so many things for today ’s parents , to status .
“ Parents are so terrified that their kids will miss out on anything , ” Anderegg told me .
“ They want their kids to have sex , be sexy . ”
This generation of parents tends to talk a good game about gender , at least in public .
Practicing what we preach , in anxious times in particular , is another thing .
When a high school cheerleader in northeastern Pennsylvania learned that she might face criminal charges after investigators reported finding a nude photo of her on someone else ’s cellphone , she was more confused than frightened at being caught up in a case of “ sexting ” : the increasingly popular phenomenon of nude or seminude photos sent over wireless phones .
“ They said they had a full - bodied naked picture of me , but I knew I ’d never had any naked picture taken of me , ” the student , Marissa Miller , 15 , recalled of the Feb. 10 telephone call to her mother as the two were having lunch together at Tunkhannock Area High School .
Marissa is a freshman at the school , where her mother , MaryJo , works with special education students .
The picture that investigators from the office of District Attorney George P. Skumanick of Wyoming County had was taken two years earlier at a slumber party .
It showed Marissa and a friend from the waist up .
Both were wearing bras .
Mr. Skumanick said he considered the photo “ provocative ” enough to tell Marissa and the friend , Grace Kelly , that if they did not attend a 10 - hour class dealing with pornography and sexual violence , he was considering filing a charge of sexual abuse of a minor against both girls .
If convicted , they could serve time in prison and would probably have to register as sex offenders .
As you may have seen , Mozilla Labs has recently announced Jetpack :
Jetpack is an API for allowing you to write Firefox add - ons using the web technologies you already know .
In short , the goal of Jetpack is to enable Web developers to create extensions for Firefox .
There are already roughly 8,000 Extension developers who have built 12,000 add - ons .
It 's a lot , but it could be a lot more if we could find ways to enable people who build Websites to create more extensions .
What does Jetpack have to do with Generativity and generative technologies ?
Well , the Web is already a generative technology .
When it was invented , Tim Berners - Lee and his team did not envision what it would become .
People who have invented innovative Web sites and services did not have to ask them permission to invent them .
Actually , the Web was invented on top of the Internet and the IP protocol .
Tim Berners - Lee did not seek permission from those who invented the Internet nor those who deployed it ( ISPs and network operators ) .
This is exactly what makes the Net and the Web generative technologies : people could invent new things on top of them without having to ask permission .
Firefox add - ons are of the same nature : if you want to have a different browser , you do n't have to ask Mozilla to build a specific version of Firefox for you .
You can build your own add - on .
Now building an add - on is quite easy compared to contributing core Gecko code , but it can be made easier .
That 's what Jetpack is aiming at .
In short , enabling more people to hack .
In my recent article about generativity , I quoted Jonathan Zittrain about the 5 things that make technologies generative .
# 3 was ease of mastery , and this is exactly where Jetpack is good .
It 's actually lowering the barrier to entry .
It 's also acting on item # 5 , transferability , as explained by the Jetpack announcement :
from a user perspective , Jetpack will allow new features to be added to the browser without a restart or compatibility issues , resulting in little to no disruption to the online experience .
By making the user experience better ( no restart needed , less compatibility issues ) , Jetpack is making Firefox better and more generative , because innovations built with it will be more transferable .
Let 's also talk about the 3 remaining items listed by Zittrain :
1 : leverage : Jetpack leverages the existing Web technologies ( HTML , CSS and JS + DOM ) and applications ( via their APIs )
Jetpack leverages the existing Web technologies ( HTML , CSS and JS + DOM ) and applications ( via their APIs ) 2 : adaptability : add - ons are already used in many different fileds , and I expect Jetpack extensions just in the same way
add - ons are already used in many different fileds , and I expect Jetpack extensions just in the same way 4 : accessibility : to use these technologies , all you need is an Internet - connected computer that runs Firefox ( so you can run Windows , OS X or Linux ) , which is a free download .
To sum things up , Jetpack is yet another demonstration of what Mozilla does to make the Web Browser even more generative .
I believe that the 2009 Cleveland Indians will win the AL Central by at least 6 games .
I also believe that the lead will be bigger before Eric Wedge takes his foot off of the gas .
Travis Hafner and Kerry Wood will be carpooling back - and - forth to the Cleveland Clinic .
Bad hunch here , but Pronk and the new guy are both going to have injury - plagued seasons .
Look for Wood to be on the DL at least three times .
Expect Hafner to miss a couple of months .
Matt LaPorta will be the starting 1B or DH by the end of the season .
The Indians will lose in the ALCS to the Anaheim Angels .
Grady Sizemore will be a candidate for AL MVP with an outstanding year .
Look for sizemore to go 30/30 with over 110 RBI .
Mark DeRosa will make the 2010 AL All - Star team based on what he does this season for the Tribe .
Look for DeRosa to be the versatile piece that completes the puzzle .
Cliff Lee will not win the 2009 Cy Young Award .
Look for Lee to still rack up 16 wins and be among the league leaders in ERA all season .
Fausto Carmona will be demoted to the bullpen .
This move might take place for several reasons .
The most obvious being Kerry Wood being physically unable to perform and the Indians needing the quick fix .
He may also be used as a setup man after struggling as a starter .
Victor Martinez will have a great year and miss very little playing time .
Look for Martinez to be healthy all year with maybe one short trip to the DL , barring some freaky injury .
Asdrubal Cabrera will be replaced by Josh Barfield by the end of the season .
Do n’t be shocked if this happens .
Cabrera just does n’t impress me enough with the bat .
Once Barfield gets a good look at Spring Training , do n’t hold it against Eric Wedge to make this move .
Bonus : Mark Shapiro will bring in someone for the playoff push .
That someone is going to be Roy Halladay .
Another long reach here , but the Blue Jays are going to be unloading salary when they are eliminated by the break this year .
Cleveland will look to add one more big arm for the push !
Lewis Libby has been an influential figure in the White House
Lewis Libby , chief - of - staff to Dick Cheney , was also charged with obstruction of justice and making false statements to a federal grand jury .
Bush aide Karl Rove was not charged but the investigation remains open .
The identity of CIA agent Valerie Plame - whose husband criticised the Iraq war - was leaked to a US reporter in 2003 .
Mr Libby said he was confident he would be " completely and totally exonerated " .
Special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald has accused Mr Libby of lying to investigators about how and when he learned and disclosed to reporters classified information about Ms Plame .

Mr Cheney - who may have to testify at a trial - said he had accepted Mr Libby 's resignation with deep regret , adding that he must be presumed innocent until found guilty .
Speaking outside the White House , President George W Bush said Mr Libby had " sacrificed much " and served in " extraordinary times " .
He said Mr Libby could expect " due process and a fair trial " .
' Lied under oath '
This latest crisis for the Bush administration follows the withdrawal on Thursday of the president 's nominee for the Supreme Court , Harriet Miers , after criticism from Mr Bush 's conservative supporters .
Patrick Fitzgerald says his inquiry into the leak is not yet over
Meanwhile , Mr Bush 's right - hand man , Karl Rove , is still in a state of limbo .
His lawyer says he is still under investigation .
The prosecutor , Mr Fitzergerald , said the investigation was not yet over , but he would not speculate on whether anyone else would be charged .

" At the end of the day , what appears is that Mr Libby 's story , that he was at the tail end of a chain of phone calls , passing on from one reporter what he heard from another , was not true - it was false , " he said .
" He was at the beginning of the chain of the phone calls , the first official to disclose this information outside the government , to a reporter .
And he lied about it afterwards , under oath , and repeatedly . "
He said the indictment showed the world that all Americans , no matter what their position , were bound by the law .
The disclosure had not only damaged Ms Plame but also compromised US national security , he said .
Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said the bigger picture was " about how the Bush White House manufactured and manipulated intelligence in order to bolster its case for the war in Iraq and to discredit anyone who dared to challenge the president " .
Ms Plame 's identity was leaked after her husband , diplomat Joseph Wilson , accused the Bush administration of manipulating intelligence to support military action against Iraq .
Mr Wilson says it was done to undermine his credibility .
Others have raised the possibility that it was a form of payback for her husband 's criticism .
